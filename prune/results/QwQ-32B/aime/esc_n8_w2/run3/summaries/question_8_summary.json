      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b equals 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It's a standard problem of distributing 300 units among three nonnegative integers. But the second equation complicates things. Let me see if I can manipulate the second equation to make it more manageable.\n\nLooking at the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b, I notice that each term is a product of a square of one variable and the other variable. Maybe there's a way to factor this or relate it to the first equation. Let me try to factor the expression.\n\nLet me see if I can factor out common terms. Let's group terms with the same variables:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c = a\u00b2(b + c)\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c = b\u00b2(a + c)\n\nAnd c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nSo the entire expression becomes a\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b). Hmm, that might be helpful.\n\nNow, since we know that a + b + c = 300, maybe we can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let's try that substitution.\n\nSo substituting, the expression becomes:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c)\n\nTherefore, the second equation is equivalent to:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me write that down:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nNow, since a + b + c = 300, perhaps we can express this in terms of the variables and their sums. Alternatively, maybe there's symmetry here. Since the equation is symmetric in a, b, c, maybe the solution is symmetric as well? Let me check if a = b = c is a possible case.\n\nIf a = b = c, then each of them would be 100, since 100 + 100 + 100 = 300. Let's plug that into the second equation:\n\nEach term would be 100\u00b2*(300 - 100) = 10000*200 = 2,000,000. Since there are three such terms, the total would be 3*2,000,000 = 6,000,000. Hey, that's exactly the required value! So (100, 100, 100) is a solution. But are there other solutions?\n\nHmm, the problem asks for all triples, so there might be more. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two variables are equal and the third is different? Let's suppose that two variables are equal, say a = b, and c is different. Then since a + b + c = 300, we can write c = 300 - 2a. Let's see if that helps.\n\nLet me try to set a = b, so c = 300 - 2a. Then substitute into the second equation:\n\nFirst, compute each term:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\nSince a = b, this becomes:\n\na\u00b2a + a\u00b2c + a\u00b2a + a\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2a\n\n= 2a\u00b3 + 2a\u00b2c + 2a c\u00b2\n\nFactor out 2a:\n\n2a(a\u00b2 + a c + c\u00b2)\n\nAlternatively, maybe plugging in c = 300 - 2a into the equation.\n\nWait, let's use the expression we had earlier:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nSince a = b, then:\n\n2a\u00b2(300 - a) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nBut c = 300 - 2a, so substitute that in:\n\n2a\u00b2(300 - a) + (300 - 2a)^2*(300 - (300 - 2a)) = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\nThe term (300 - (300 - 2a)) simplifies to 2a, so:\n\n(300 - 2a)^2 * 2a\n\nSo the entire equation becomes:\n\n2a\u00b2(300 - a) + 2a*(300 - 2a)^2 = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me factor out the 2a:\n\n2a [ a(300 - a) + (300 - 2a)^2 ] = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, let's compute the expression inside the brackets:\n\nFirst term: a(300 - a) = 300a - a\u00b2\n\nSecond term: (300 - 2a)^2 = 300\u00b2 - 4*300a + 4a\u00b2 = 90000 - 1200a + 4a\u00b2\n\nAdding them together:\n\n(300a - a\u00b2) + (90000 - 1200a + 4a\u00b2) = (300a - 1200a) + (-a\u00b2 +4a\u00b2) + 90000\n\n= (-900a) + 3a\u00b2 + 90000\n\nSo the bracket becomes 3a\u00b2 - 900a + 90000\n\nThus, the equation is:\n\n2a*(3a\u00b2 - 900a + 90000) = 6,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 2a (assuming a \u22600, but we can check a=0 later):\n\n3a\u00b2 - 900a + 90000 = 3,000,000 / a\n\nHmm, this seems messy. Maybe instead, let me compute the left side:\n\nLeft side: 2a*(3a\u00b2 - 900a + 90000) = 6a\u00b3 - 1800a\u00b2 + 180,000a\n\nSet equal to 6,000,000:\n\n6a\u00b3 - 1800a\u00b2 + 180,000a - 6,000,000 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0\n\nHmm, that's a cubic equation. Let me see if I can factor this. Maybe trying rational roots?\n\nPossible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1. So possible integer roots are \u00b11, \u00b12, ..., \u00b11,000,000. That's too many, but maybe a is a nice number. Let's try a=100 first, since that's the symmetric case.\n\nPlugging a=100 into the cubic:\n\n100\u00b3 - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 -1,000,000 = 0. So yes, a=100 is a root.\n\nTherefore, (a - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.\n\nDividing the cubic by (a - 100):\n\nUsing polynomial long division:\n\nDivide a\u00b3 -300a\u00b2 +30,000a -1,000,000 by (a - 100).\n\nSet up:\n\na\u00b3 -300a\u00b2 +30,000a -1,000,000 \u00f7 (a - 100)\n\nFirst term: a\u00b3 \u00f7 a = a\u00b2. Multiply (a - 100) by a\u00b2: a\u00b3 -100a\u00b2\n\nSubtract from dividend: (a\u00b3 -300a\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 -100a\u00b2) = -200a\u00b2\n\nBring down next terms: -200a\u00b2 +30,000a\n\nNext term: -200a\u00b2 \u00f7 a = -200a. Multiply (a - 100) by -200a: -200a\u00b2 +20,000a\n\nSubtract: (-200a\u00b2 +30,000a) - (-200a\u00b2 +20,000a) = 10,000a\n\nBring down the last term: 10,000a -1,000,000\n\nNext term: 10,000a \u00f7 a = 10,000. Multiply (a - 100) by 10,000: 10,000a - 1,000,000\n\nSubtract: (10,000a -1,000,000) - (10,000a -1,000,000) = 0. Perfect division.\n\nSo the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 -200a +10,000).\n\nNow factor the quadratic: a\u00b2 -200a +10,000.\n\nLet's see discriminant: 200\u00b2 - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0. So it's a perfect square: (a -100)^2.\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as (a -100)^3 =0. So the only real root is a=100. Therefore, in this case, when a = b =100, then c = 300 - 2*100 =100, which is the symmetric solution again.\n\nTherefore, when assuming a = b, the only solution is the symmetric one. So maybe there are other solutions where variables are not equal, but perhaps two variables are equal and the third is different?\n\nWait, but in this case, when we set a = b, the only solution is the symmetric case. Maybe if we set another pair equal?\n\nAlternatively, maybe if one variable is 0?\n\nSuppose, for instance, c =0. Then the equations become a + b =300, and the second equation becomes a\u00b2b + a\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2*0 +0 +0 = a\u00b2b +ab\u00b2 = ab(a + b) = ab*300 =6,000,000. Therefore, ab = 6,000,000 /300 =20,000. So ab =20,000 with a + b =300. Let me see if this is possible.\n\nSo solving for a and b such that a + b =300 and ab=20,000.\n\nLet me set up the quadratic equation. Let a be x, then b =300 -x. Then x(300 -x)=20,000\n\nSo 300x -x\u00b2 =20,000\n\nRearranged: x\u00b2 -300x +20,000=0\n\nDiscriminant D = 300\u00b2 -4*1*20,000 =90,000 -80,000 =10,000\n\nsqrt(D)=100\n\nTherefore solutions are x=(300 \u00b1100)/2 = (400/2)=200 or (200/2)=100.\n\nSo x=200 or 100. Therefore, the pairs (a,b) would be (200,100) or (100,200). Since c=0, so the triples would be (200,100,0), (100,200,0), (0,200,100), etc., but since c is fixed as 0 here, actually, the triples would be permutations where one variable is 0, another is 200, another 100. Wait, but in the case when we set c=0, we have (a, b, 0). So the solutions are (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). But since variables are nonnegative integers and ordered triples, all permutations would count. Wait, actually, in the case when one variable is 0, the other two are 200 and 100. So how many such triples are there?\n\nThe number of permutations where one variable is 0, another is 200, and the third is 100. Since there are 3 choices for which variable is 0, and then the other two can be arranged in 2 ways (since 200 and 100 are distinct). So total of 3*2=6 triples.\n\nTherefore, these are additional solutions. Therefore, the symmetric solution (100,100,100) and the six triples where one variable is 0, another 200, another 100. Are there any other solutions?\n\nWait, maybe there are other cases where two variables are non-equal and non-zero? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that two variables are equal but not 100. Wait, earlier when we set a = b, the only solution was a =100. But perhaps if variables are not equal but arranged differently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are solutions where one variable is different from the others, but none are zero. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the original equation again. Let me think of the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nAlternatively, note that this expression can be written as (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc. Wait, let me check that.\n\nLet me recall that:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(a + c)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expanding (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca)\n\n= a\u00b2b + a b c + a c\u00b2 + a b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + b c a + a b c + b c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\n\nHmm, grouping terms:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b + 3 a b c.\n\nTherefore,\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = (a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) + 3abc\n\nTherefore, rearranged,\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc\n\nAh! That's a useful identity. So the left-hand side of the given equation can be written as (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nGiven that a + b + c =300, so substituting that in:\n\n300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc =6,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n300(ab + bc + ca) -3abc =6,000,000.\n\nWe can divide both sides by 3 to simplify:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc =2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so now the equation is 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc =2,000,000.\n\nThis might be a better form to work with. Let me note that.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) a + b + c =300,\n\n2) 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc =2,000,000.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can denote variables in terms of symmetric sums. Let me denote S =a + b + c =300,\n\nP = abc,\n\nQ =ab + bc + ca.\n\nThen the second equation is 100Q - P =2,000,000.\n\nAlso, we know from the theory of symmetric sums that for three variables,\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). Therefore,\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2Q = 300\u00b2 - 2Q =90,000 - 2Q.\n\nBut not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express the equation as P =100Q -2,000,000.\n\nSo, we need to find nonnegative integers a,b,c with a + b + c =300, and abc =100(ab + bc + ca) -2,000,000.\n\nHmm. Let me see if we can find a relationship here. Let me think of variables in terms of two variables. Let me suppose that two variables are expressed in terms of the third.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps substituting variables as follows. Let me let x = a, y = b, so c =300 -x -y. Then substitute into the equation.\n\nSo, let me write Q =ab + bc + ca = xy + y(300 -x -y) +x(300 -x -y)\n\n= xy + 300y -xy - y\u00b2 +300x -x\u00b2 -xy\n\nWait, let me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: ab = xy,\n\nSecond term: bc = b*c = y*(300 -x - y),\n\nThird term: ca = c*a = (300 -x - y)*x.\n\nTherefore, Q = xy + y(300 -x -y) +x(300 -x -y).\n\nExpanding each term:\n\n= xy + 300y -x y - y\u00b2 + 300x -x\u00b2 -x y\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nxy -xy -xy = -xy,\n\n300y + 300x,\n\n- y\u00b2 -x\u00b2,\n\nSo altogether:\n\nQ = 300x + 300y -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 -x y.\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nSimilarly, P =abc =x*y*(300 -x -y).\n\nSo the equation is 100Q - P =2,000,000.\n\nSubstituting Q and P:\n\n100*(300x + 300y -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 -xy) - x y (300 -x -y) =2,000,000.\n\nThis seems very involved, but maybe expanding and simplifying could lead somewhere. Let me try.\n\nFirst, expand the first part:\n\n100*(300x + 300y -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 -xy) = 30,000x +30,000y -100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 -100xy\n\nThen subtract P =x y (300 -x -y):\n\nSo total equation becomes:\n\n30,000x +30,000y -100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 -100xy - [300xy -x\u00b2 y -x y\u00b2] =2,000,000\n\nWait, actually, need to distribute the negative sign properly:\n\nWait, the equation is:\n\n[30,000x +30,000y -100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 -100xy] - [x y (300 -x -y)] =2,000,000\n\nSo expanding the second term:\n\n- x y (300 -x -y) = -300xy +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2\n\nThus, putting all together:\n\n30,000x +30,000y -100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 -100xy -300xy +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2 =2,000,000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2,\n\n-100xy -300xy = -400xy,\n\n+ x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2,\n\n+30,000x +30,000y,\n\nSo the entire expression is:\n\n-100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 -400xy +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2 +30,000x +30,000y =2,000,000.\n\nHmm, this is getting very complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying to assume some variables are equal. Since when we set two variables equal, we found the symmetric solution. Also, when we set one variable to 0, we found another set of solutions. Let me see if there are other possibilities.\n\nSuppose that one variable is 0, like before. We found that gives 6 solutions. The symmetric case gives 1 solution. Let me check if there are solutions where two variables are equal but not 100, but with the third variable not zero. Wait, when we assumed a = b, we found that the only solution was a = b = c =100. So maybe all solutions are either the symmetric case or the ones with a zero?\n\nAlternatively, let me test another case where, say, a=0, then the equations become b +c =300 and the second equation:\n\nab + ... etc. Wait, when a=0, the second equation reduces to 0 +0 +0 +b\u00b2c +0 +0 =b\u00b2c +0= b\u00b2c. Wait, actually, let's recalculate.\n\nWait, if a=0, then the original expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b becomes 0 +0 +0 + b\u00b2c +0 + c\u00b2b =b\u00b2c + bc\u00b2 = bc(b +c). Since b +c=300, so that expression is bc*300. So the equation becomes 300 bc =6,000,000 => bc=20,000, which is exactly what we had before, leading to the solutions (0,200,100) etc. So that's consistent.\n\nSimilarly, if another variable is zero, same result.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that two variables are zero. Let's see: if two variables are zero, say b =c =0, then a=300, but the second equation becomes 0 +0 +0 +0 +0 +0 =0 \u22606,000,000. So that's invalid. So two variables can't be zero.\n\nSo the only solutions with a zero are those with exactly one zero and the other two variables 200 and 100. So that gives 6 solutions. The symmetric case gives 1 solution. So total of 7? But maybe there are other solutions where none of the variables are zero and not all equal?\n\nLet me see. Let me consider if there are solutions where variables are distinct and non-zero. Let me think of possible triples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of the equation 100Q - P =2,000,000.\n\nSuppose that variables are all different, but not involving zeros. Let me see if I can find such a triple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are solutions where two variables are 150 each? Let's test.\n\nSuppose a = b =150, then c =0. But then c is zero, which we already considered. If instead, a =150, b=150, c=0, that's part of the previous solutions. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, trying a=150, b=100, c=50. Let's check:\n\na +b +c=150+100+50=300. Good.\n\nCompute Q =ab + bc + ca =150*100 +100*50 +50*150 =15,000 +5,000 +7,500=27,500.\n\nThen 100Q =2,750,000.\n\nP=abc=150*100*50=750,000.\n\nThus 100Q - P =2,750,000 -750,000 =2,000,000. Hey! That works!\n\nSo (150,100,50) is a solution. Wait, so that's another solution where none of the variables are zero and they are distinct.\n\nHmm, so that's a new solution. So my initial assumption that only the symmetric case and the ones with zeros are solutions is wrong. There are more solutions. Let me see.\n\nTherefore, this suggests there are more triples. Let me check this example:\n\na=150, b=100, c=50. So that works. Similarly, permutations of this would also be solutions. So the number of permutations here would be 6, since all three numbers are distinct (150,100,50 are all different). So there are 6 permutations of this triple.\n\nWait, let me confirm the calculation again.\n\nQ =ab + bc + ca =150*100 +100*50 +50*150 =15,000 +5,000 +7,500 =27,500.\n\n100*27,500 =2,750,000.\n\nabc =150*100*50 =750,000.\n\nSo 2,750,000 -750,000 =2,000,000. Correct. So that works. So that's another solution.\n\nTherefore, there are solutions beyond the symmetric and zero cases. So we need to find all triples (a,b,c) such that a + b + c =300 and 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc =2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can find all triples where variables are in arithmetic progression? Wait, in the example above, 50,100,150 is an arithmetic progression with difference 50. Let me see if that's a coincidence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are triples where the variables form an arithmetic sequence. Let me test another arithmetic progression.\n\nSuppose a = x -d, b =x, c =x +d, so that they are in AP. Then a +b +c= 3x =300 => x=100. So then a=100 -d, b=100, c=100 +d.\n\nThen compute Q =ab + bc + ca.\n\nab = (100 -d)(100) =10,000 -100d,\n\nbc =100*(100 +d)=10,000 +100d,\n\nca= (100 +d)(100 -d)=100\u00b2 -d\u00b2=10,000 -d\u00b2.\n\nThus Q= (10,000 -100d) + (10,000 +100d) + (10,000 -d\u00b2) =30,000 -d\u00b2.\n\nThen P=abc = (100 -d)*100*(100 +d) =100*(100\u00b2 -d\u00b2)=100*(10,000 -d\u00b2)=1,000,000 -100d\u00b2.\n\nNow plug into the equation 100Q - P =2,000,000.\n\nCompute 100*(30,000 -d\u00b2) - (1,000,000 -100d\u00b2)= 3,000,000 -100d\u00b2 -1,000,000 +100d\u00b2 =2,000,000.\n\nWait a second! That's exactly equal to 2,000,000 regardless of d? So that means that for any arithmetic progression centered at 100, with difference d, the equation is satisfied as long as a +b +c=300?\n\nWait, so this suggests that any arithmetic progression triplet (100 -d, 100, 100 +d) where a, b, c are non-negative integers will satisfy the equation. But we need a, b, c to be nonnegative.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\n100 -d \u22650 => d \u2264100,\n\n100 +d \u22650, which is always true since d is nonnegative (as variables are nonnegative; but d could be negative? Wait, but since a =100 -d must be nonnegative, and c =100 +d must be nonnegative. If d is allowed to be negative, then a could be greater than 100, but d is just a difference. Wait, actually, in an arithmetic progression, d can be positive or negative, but since variables must be nonnegative, then:\n\nIf d is positive, then a =100 -d must be nonnegative => d \u2264100,\n\nand c =100 +d can be up to 200,\n\nIf d is negative, say d = -k where k>0, then a =100 +k and c=100 -k. Then c must be nonnegative, so k \u2264100.\n\nThus, in either case, d can range from -100 to 100 in integer steps, but such that a, b, c are nonnegative integers.\n\nWait, but the difference d can be any integer such that the terms are nonnegative. So the possible values of d are integers from -100 to 100, but with the constraints that 100 - |d| \u22650. So |d| \u2264100.\n\nHowever, since a, b, c must be nonnegative integers, and d can be any integer such that 100 -d \u22650 and 100 +d \u22650. Since d is an integer, d can range from -100 to 100, but the triplet must consist of integers. However, since a, b, c are integers, d must be an integer.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of d are integers from -100 to 100, but with the constraints:\n\nFor d \u22650: d from 0 to 100,\n\nfor d <0: d from -100 to -1,\n\nBut since d is just a difference, the triplets for d and -d are different. For example, d=50 gives (50,100,150), while d=-50 gives (150,100,50). But since the problem counts ordered triples, these are considered different unless permutations are considered the same, but the problem says \"triples of nonnegative integers\", which are ordered triples. Wait, actually in combinatorics, when they say \"triples\", unless specified otherwise, they are ordered. Wait, but let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait the problem says \"the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c)\", so I think they are ordered triples. So each permutation is a different triple. However, in the arithmetic progression approach, each d gives a unique ordered triple unless we consider different orderings. Wait, actually, in the arithmetic progression setup, we fixed the order as (100 -d, 100, 100 +d). So different d's give different ordered triples. But permutations would be different triples.\n\nWait, but in our previous example, (150, 100, 50) is different from (50, 100, 150), etc. So in this approach, the arithmetic progression with difference d gives one ordered triple, but permutations would require different setups. Hmm, perhaps I need to think of all permutations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all solutions are those that can be arranged into an arithmetic progression? Because in the previous example, (150,100,50) can be arranged as (50,100,150) which is an arithmetic progression with difference 50. Similarly, (200,100,0) can be arranged as (0,100,200), which is an arithmetic progression with difference 100.\n\nWait, 0,100,200: the difference is 100, but the common difference is 100. So that's also an arithmetic progression. So actually, the case where one variable is zero is also an arithmetic progression with difference 100. For example, (0,100,200) has differences of 100 and 100. Wait, arithmetic progression requires the difference between consecutive terms to be constant. So 0,100,200 is indeed an arithmetic progression with common difference 100. Similarly, (50,100,150) is an AP with difference 50. The symmetric case (100,100,100) is also an AP with difference 0.\n\nTherefore, all the solutions we found so far are arithmetic progressions. So perhaps all solutions must be arithmetic progressions?\n\nIf that's the case, then all solutions are arithmetic progressions of three terms adding up to 300, and satisfying the second equation. Since we saw that for any arithmetic progression with a + b + c =300, the second equation is automatically satisfied?\n\nWait, in the earlier calculation, when we considered variables in AP, we found that regardless of d, the equation holds. So as long as a, b, c form an arithmetic progression with sum 300, then 100Q - P =2,000,000. So this is always true. So that means that all such arithmetic progressions are solutions. Therefore, the set of solutions is exactly all triples that form an arithmetic progression of three nonnegative integers summing to 300.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting all arithmetic progressions of three nonnegative integers a \u2264 b \u2264 c such that a + b + c =300, and then considering all permutations of these triples.\n\nWait, but arithmetic progression can be in any order, but since we are counting ordered triples, we need to consider all permutations.\n\nAlternatively, first, let's count the number of arithmetic progressions (in order) where a, b, c are in AP, and then account for permutations.\n\nBut first, let me formalize this.\n\nLet the three terms of the AP be a, a + d, a + 2d, so that they are in non-decreasing order. Then their sum is 3a +3d =300 => a + d =100. Therefore, the middle term is 100. Wait, that's an important point.\n\nWait, if we denote the three terms as a, a +d, a +2d, then their sum is 3a + 3d =3(a + d)=300 => a + d =100. Therefore, the middle term is a +d =100. Therefore, the three terms can be written as (100 -d, 100, 100 +d). This is similar to our previous approach.\n\nTherefore, the three terms must be symmetrically placed around 100. So the common difference is d, so the three terms are 100 -d, 100, 100 +d. To ensure that all terms are nonnegative integers, we need:\n\n100 -d \u22650 => d \u2264100,\n\nand 100 +d \u22650, which is always true since d is a nonnegative integer (since we assumed the terms are non-decreasing). Wait, but d can be any integer such that 100 -d is nonnegative, so d can be from 0 up to 100. But d must be an integer, so d=0,1,2,...,100.\n\nWait, but d is the common difference. If we consider the AP in the order (a, b, c), then d can be positive or negative, but in terms of non-decreasing order, d must be nonnegative. But since the problem counts all ordered triples, not just non-decreasing ones, we need to consider all permutations.\n\nTherefore, for each possible AP in non-decreasing order (with difference d \u22650), we can permute the three terms in any order, leading to different triples.\n\nHowever, some triples may have repeated elements, so their permutations would not all be unique. For example, when d=0, all terms are 100, so there's only one distinct triple (100,100,100). For d>0, the three terms are distinct if d\u22600, so each such AP gives 6 permutations. Except when one of the terms is 0, which still are distinct but their permutations would include cases where the 0 is in different positions.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nFirst, let's consider all arithmetic progressions in non-decreasing order: (100 -d, 100, 100 +d) where d is an integer from 0 to 100.\n\nFor each d from 0 to 100:\n\n- If d=0: the triple is (100,100,100). This is only one ordered triple.\n\n- For d from 1 to 100:\n\nThe terms are distinct: 100 -d, 100, 100 +d. Since d \u22651, these are three distinct numbers. Therefore, the number of permutations for each such triple is 3! =6.\n\nHowever, when d=100, the terms become (0,100,200). These are also distinct, so they have 6 permutations. Similarly for other d.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ordered triples would be:\n\n1 (for d=0) + 6*100 (for d=1 to 100) ?\n\nWait, wait, d ranges from 0 to 100, so that's 101 values. But when d=0, it's 1 triple, and for d=1 to 100, each gives 6 triples. So total is 1 + 6*100 = 1 +600=601?\n\nWait, but hold on: when d=100, the triple is (0,100,200). When d=50, it's (50,100,150). But when d=25, it's (75,100,125). All of these are valid as long as 100 -d \u22650.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check for d=100: yes, 100 -100=0, 100, 200. Valid.\n\nBut hang on: the problem states that a, b, c are nonnegative integers. So all terms must be nonnegative. Since we have 100 -d \u22650, so d can be from 0 to 100 inclusive. So yes, 101 possible values of d. Each d from 1 to 100 gives 6 ordered triples, and d=0 gives 1. So total 1 + 6*100 = 601.\n\nWait, but earlier when we considered d from 0 to 100, that's 101 values. However, in the case of d=0, the triple is only one. For each d from 1 to 100, you have 6 permutations. So total number of triples is 1 + 6*100 =601.\n\nBut hold on a second. Wait, but when d and -d give the same set of numbers but in different order. However, in our setup, d is the difference such that the terms are (100 -d,100,100 +d). So d is nonnegative. So actually, each d corresponds to a unique combination of numbers in non-decreasing order, and permutations account for all orderings. So I think the count is correct: 601?\n\nWait, but in the earlier example where a=150, b=100, c=50 (which is d=50 in reverse order), that is counted in the permutations of (50,100,150). So all permutations are included. So total number of ordered triples is indeed 1 +6*100=601.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check with d=100. The triple (0,100,200). The permutations of this are 6, but when we considered earlier when one variable is zero, we found 6 triples, which are exactly the permutations of (0,100,200). Similarly for d=50, the permutations of (50,100,150) give 6 triples, which are the ones we found earlier. The symmetric case (100,100,100) is 1. So all these are included in the 601.\n\nHowever, wait a second. Is there any restriction on d? For example, when d=100, the third term is 200, which is okay. What about d=99? Then the terms would be (1,100,199). That is valid. Similarly d=1 gives (99,100,101). All valid.\n\nTherefore, all d from 0 to 100 are allowed, so the total is 601. But let me check for d=0.5? Wait, but d must be integer because a, b, c are integers. Since the terms are integers, the common difference must be an integer. Therefore, d must be integer. So yes, d from 0 to 100 inclusive integers.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is 1 + 6*100 =601. However, this contradicts my earlier thought that the answer might be 601, but I need to verify.\n\nWait, but let me check with another example. Let me take d=1. Then the triple in order is (99,100,101). The permutations of this would be 6 different ordered triples, like (99,100,101), (99,101,100), etc. All of these are distinct and satisfy the equations. Let me check one of them:\n\nTake (99,101,100). Let's check the sum: 99+101+100=300.\n\nCompute the expression a\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\na=99, b=101, c=100.\n\na\u00b2b =99\u00b2*101,\n\na\u00b2c =99\u00b2*100,\n\nb\u00b2a =101\u00b2*99,\n\nb\u00b2c =101\u00b2*100,\n\nc\u00b2a =100\u00b2*99,\n\nc\u00b2b =100\u00b2*101.\n\nAdding all these terms.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula (a +b +c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nWe know a +b +c=300,\n\nab + bc + ca: compute that:\n\nab=99*101=9999,\n\nbc=101*100=10100,\n\nca=100*99=9900,\n\nSo ab + bc + ca =9999 +10100 +9900 = (9999+9900)=19899 +10100=30, 000 -1? Wait let's compute:\n\n9999 +10100 =20,099,\n\n20,099 +9900=30, 000 -1? Wait 20,099 +9,900=30,000-1 +9,900? Wait:\n\nWait 20,099 +9,900 =20,099 +9,900 =30,000 -1? Let's compute:\n\n20,099 +9,900:\n\n20,000 +9,900 =29,900,\n\nplus 99 =29,999.\n\nHmm, so ab + bc + ca =29,999.\n\nThen 300*(29,999) -3abc = ?\n\nCompute 300*29,999 =300*(30,000 -1)=9,000,000 -300=8,999,700.\n\nThen subtract 3abc. Compute abc=99*101*100.\n\nFirst compute 99*101: (100-1)(100+1)=10,000 -1=9,999.\n\nSo abc=9,999*100=999,900.\n\nThus 3abc=2,999,700.\n\nSo 8,999,700 -2,999,700 =6,000,000. Correct. So that works.\n\nTherefore, this triple is indeed a solution. So the arithmetic progression approach works.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is 1 +6*100=601.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check if there are any other triples that are not in arithmetic progression. Suppose there exists a triple that is not an arithmetic progression but still satisfies the equations.\n\nSuppose, for instance, take a=140, b=100, c=60. Let me check if this is an arithmetic progression. The terms would be 60,100,140 which is an AP with difference 40. So yes, that is an AP with d=40. So that's included in our count.\n\nAnother example: a=130, b=100, c=70. Also AP with d=30.\n\nWhat about a triple like (120, 100, 80). AP with d=20. Yes.\n\nAlternatively, pick a non-AP triple. Let's see. Let me try a=150, b=110, c=40. Their sum is 150+110+40=300.\n\nCheck if they form an AP: differences are 150-110=40, 110-40=70. Not constant, so not an AP.\n\nLet me compute the equation:\n\nCompute ab + bc + ca:\n\nab=150*110=16,500,\n\nbc=110*40=4,400,\n\nca=40*150=6,000,\n\nTotal Q=16,500 +4,400 +6,000=26,900.\n\nThen 100Q=2,690,000.\n\nP=abc=150*110*40=150*4,400=660,000.\n\nThus 100Q - P =2,690,000 -660,000=2,030,000\u22602,000,000. So doesn't satisfy the equation.\n\nTherefore, this is not a solution. Thus, it seems that only the arithmetic progressions work.\n\nAnother test: Let me take a triple not in AP but with variables adding to 300. Let's say (120, 120, 60). Sum is 300.\n\nCheck if it's an AP: 60,120,120. The differences are 60 and 0. Not constant. Not an AP.\n\nCompute Q=ab + bc + ca=120*120 +120*60 +60*120=14,400 +7,200 +7,200=28,800.\n\n100Q=2,880,000.\n\nP=abc=120*120*60=864,000.\n\n100Q - P=2,880,000-864,000=2,016,000\u22602,000,000. Doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, it seems only arithmetic progressions work. So the total number is indeed 601.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again about d. The terms are (100 -d, 100, 100 +d). So when d=0, it's (100,100,100). When d=1, it's (99,100,101), up to d=100: (0,100,200). Each d from 0 to 100 gives a unique combination in non-decreasing order. Each of these, except d=0, can be permuted in 6 ways, giving 6 triples each. Thus total triples:\n\nFor d=0: 1\n\nFor d=1 to 100: 100 values, each giving 6 triples.\n\nTotal:1 + 100\u00d76= 1 +600=601.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601.\n\nWait, but let me check if there is any overcounting or undercounting.\n\nSuppose d=50, the triple (50,100,150). Its permutations are all counted in the 6\u00d7100. Similarly, when d=100, (0,100,200) is counted similarly. The only case not multiplied by 6 is the symmetric case.\n\nTherefore, the count is correct.\n\nBut let me check for d=100. The triple (0,100,200). The permutations would include (0,200,100), (100,0,200), etc., all 6 permutations. These are all valid and distinct triples, so they are counted correctly.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is 601. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{601}.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem says \"nonnegative integers\". So zero is allowed. So all terms are okay. The arithmetic progression approach includes all possible triples where the three numbers form an arithmetic progression (in any order), and sum to 300. Since we have considered all permutations, that should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again of the case when two numbers are the same but not all three. For example, (100,100,100) is the only one with all same. If two numbers are same but not all three, like (100,100,100) is same, but suppose (x,y,z) where two are same but third different. For example, (150,100,50) has all distinct. To have two same, let's see:\n\nSuppose that two terms are equal, but not all three. Let me see if that can happen in an arithmetic progression.\n\nSuppose an arithmetic progression with two equal terms. That requires the common difference d=0, but then all three terms are equal. So the only way to have two equal terms in an arithmetic progression is if all three are equal. Therefore, there are no arithmetic progressions with exactly two equal terms. Thus, all triples except the symmetric one have distinct terms, so each of those contributes 6 permutations, and the symmetric one contributes 1.\n\nTherefore, the total is indeed 601.\n\nHence, the answer is 601.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm with another example where d=25:\n\nTriple (75,100,125). The permutations would be 6, which are all valid.\n\nAnother check with d=33:\n\nTriple (67,100,133). Sum is 67+100+133=300. The terms are distinct. So permutations give 6 triples.\n\nTherefore, all cases seem to check out. So I think the answer is 601.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that when d=0, it's counted once, and when d=100, it's counted as 6. The problem says \"triples of nonnegative integers\", so each permutation is a distinct triple, so yes, the count is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 601.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{601}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b equals 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It's a standard problem of distributing 300 units among three nonnegative integers. But the second equation complicates things. Let me see if I can manipulate the second equation to make it more manageable.\n\nLooking at the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b, I notice that each term is a product of a square of one variable and the other variable. Maybe there's a way to factor this or relate it to the first equation. Let me try to factor the expression.\n\nLet me see if I can factor out common terms. Let's group terms with the same variables:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c = a\u00b2(b + c)\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c = b\u00b2(a + c)\n\nAnd c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nSo the entire expression becomes a\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b). Hmm, that might be helpful.\n\nNow, since we know that a + b + c = 300, maybe we can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let's try that substitution.\n\nSo substituting, the expression becomes:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c)\n\nTherefore, the second equation is equivalent to:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me write that down:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nNow, since a + b + c = 300, perhaps we can express this in terms of the variables and their sums. Alternatively, maybe there's symmetry here. Since the equation is symmetric in a, b, c, maybe the solution is symmetric as well? Let me check if a = b = c is a possible case.\n\nIf a = b = c, then each of them would be 100, since 100 + 100 + 100 = 300. Let's plug that into the second equation:\n\nEach term would be 100\u00b2*(300 - 100) = 10000*200 = 2,000,000. Since there are three such terms, the total would be 3*2,000,000 = 6,000,000. Hey, that's exactly the required value! So (100, 100, 100) is a solution. But are there other solutions?\n\nHmm, the problem asks for all triples, so there might be more. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two variables are equal and the third is different? Let's suppose that two variables are equal, say a = b, and c is different. Then since a + b + c = 300, we can write c = 300 - 2a. Let's see if that helps.\n\nLet me try to set a = b, so c = 300 - 2a. Then substitute into the second equation:\n\nFirst, compute each term:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\nSince a = b, this becomes:\n\na\u00b2a + a\u00b2c + a\u00b2a + a\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2a\n\n= 2a\u00b3 + 2a\u00b2c + 2a c\u00b2\n\nFactor out 2a:\n\n2a(a\u00b2 + a c + c\u00b2)\n\nAlternatively, maybe plugging in c = 300 - 2a into the equation.\n\nWait, let's use the expression we had earlier:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nSince a = b, then:\n\n2a\u00b2(300 - a) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nBut c = 300 - 2a, so substitute that in:\n\n2a\u00b2(300 - a) + (300 - 2a)^2*(300 - (300 - 2a)) = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\nThe term (300 - (300 - 2a)) simplifies to 2a, so:\n\n(300 - 2a)^2 * 2a\n\nSo the entire equation becomes:\n\n2a\u00b2(300 - a) + 2a*(300 - 2a)^2 = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me factor out the 2a:\n\n2a [ a(300 - a) + (300 - 2a)^2 ] = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, let's compute the expression inside the brackets:\n\nFirst term: a(300 - a) = 300a - a\u00b2\n\nSecond term: (300 - 2a)^2 = 300\u00b2 - 4*300a + 4a\u00b2 = 90000 - 1200a + 4a\u00b2\n\nAdding them together:\n\n(300a - a\u00b2) + (90000 - 1200a + 4a\u00b2) = (300a - 1200a) + (-a\u00b2 +4a\u00b2) + 90000\n\n= (-900a) + 3a\u00b2 + 90000\n\nSo the bracket becomes 3a\u00b2 - 900a + 90000\n\nThus, the equation is:\n\n2a*(3a\u00b2 - 900a + 90000) = 6,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 2a (assuming a \u22600, but we can check a=0 later):\n\n3a\u00b2 - 900a + 90000 = 3,000,000 / a\n\nHmm, this seems messy. Maybe instead, let me compute the left side:\n\nLeft side: 2a*(3a\u00b2 - 900a + 90000) = 6a\u00b3 - 1800a\u00b2 + 180,000a\n\nSet equal to 6,000,000:\n\n6a\u00b3 - 1800a\u00b2 + 180,000a - 6,000,000 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0\n\nHmm, that's a cubic equation. Let me see if I can factor this. Maybe trying rational roots?\n\nPossible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1. So possible integer roots are \u00b11, \u00b12, ..., \u00b11,000,000. That's too many, but maybe a is a nice number. Let's try a=100 first, since that's the symmetric case.\n\nPlugging a=100 into the cubic:\n\n100\u00b3 - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 -1,000,000 = 0. So yes, a=100 is a root.\n\nTherefore, (a - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.\n\nDividing the cubic by (a - 100):\n\nUsing polynomial long division:\n\nDivide a\u00b3 -300a\u00b2 +30,000a -1,000,000 by (a - 100).\n\nSet up:\n\na\u00b3 -300a\u00b2 +30,000a -1,000,000 \u00f7 (a - 100)\n\nFirst term: a\u00b3 \u00f7 a = a\u00b2. Multiply (a - 100) by a\u00b2: a\u00b3 -100a\u00b2\n\nSubtract from dividend: (a\u00b3 -300a\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 -100a\u00b2) = -200a\u00b2\n\nBring down next terms: -200a\u00b2 +30,000a\n\nNext term: -200a\u00b2 \u00f7 a = -200a. Multiply (a - 100) by -200a: -200a\u00b2 +20,000a\n\nSubtract: (-200a\u00b2 +30,000a) - (-200a\u00b2 +20,000a) = 10,000a\n\nBring down the last term: 10,000a -1,000,000\n\nNext term: 10,000a \u00f7 a = 10,000. Multiply (a - 100) by 10,000: 10,000a - 1,000,000\n\nSubtract: (10,000a -1,000,000) - (10,000a -1,000,000) = 0. Perfect division.\n\nSo the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 -200a +10,000).\n\nNow factor the quadratic: a\u00b2 -200a +10,000.\n\nLet's see discriminant: 200\u00b2 - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0. So it's a perfect square: (a -100)^2.\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as (a -100)^3 =0. So the only real root is a=100. Therefore, in this case, when a = b =100, then c = 300 - 2*100 =100, which is the symmetric solution again.\n\nTherefore, when assuming a = b, the only solution is the symmetric one. So maybe there are other solutions where variables are not equal, but perhaps two variables are equal and the third is different?\n\nWait, but in this case, when we set a = b, the only solution is the symmetric case. Maybe if we set another pair equal?\n\nAlternatively, maybe if one variable is 0?\n\nSuppose, for instance, c =0. Then the equations become a + b =300, and the second equation becomes a\u00b2b + a\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2*0 +0 +0 = a\u00b2b +ab\u00b2 = ab(a + b) = ab*300 =6,000,000. Therefore, ab = 6,000,000 /300 =20,000. So ab =20,000 with a + b =300. Let me see if this is possible.\n\nSo solving for a and b such that a + b =300 and ab=20,000.\n\nLet me set up the quadratic equation. Let a be x, then b =300 -x. Then x(300 -x)=20,000\n\nSo 300x -x\u00b2 =20,000\n\nRearranged: x\u00b2 -300x +20,000=0\n\nDiscriminant D = 300\u00b2 -4*1*20,000 =90,000 -80,000 =10,000\n\nsqrt(D)=100\n\nTherefore solutions are x=(300 \u00b1100)/2 = (400/2)=200 or (200/2)=100.\n\nSo x=200 or 100. Therefore, the pairs (a,b) would be (200,100) or (100,200). Since c=0, so the triples would be (200,100,0), (100,200,0), (0,200,100), etc., but since c is fixed as 0 here, actually, the triples would be permutations where one variable is 0, another is 200, another 100. Wait, but in the case when we set c=0, we have (a, b, 0). So the solutions are (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). But since variables are nonnegative integers and ordered triples, all permutations would count. Wait, actually, in the case when one variable is 0, the other two are 200 and 100. So how many such triples are there?\n\nThe number of permutations where one variable is 0, another is 200, and the third is 100. Since there are 3 choices for which variable is 0, and then the other two can be arranged in 2 ways (since 200 and 100 are distinct). So total of 3*2=6 triples.\n\nTherefore, these are additional solutions. Therefore, the symmetric solution (100,100,100) and the six triples where one variable is 0, another 200, another 100. Are there any other solutions?\n\nWait, maybe there are other cases where two variables are non-equal and non-zero? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that two variables are equal but not 100. Wait, earlier when we set a = b, the only solution was a =100. But perhaps if variables are not equal but arranged differently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are solutions where one variable is different from the others, but none are zero. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the original equation again. Let me think of the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nAlternatively, note that this expression can be written as (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc. Wait, let me check that.\n\nLet me recall that:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(a + c)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expanding (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca)\n\n= a\u00b2b + a b c + a c\u00b2 + a b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + b c a + a b c + b c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\n\nHmm, grouping terms:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b + 3 a b c.\n\nTherefore,\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = (a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) + 3abc\n\nTherefore, rearranged,\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc\n\nAh! That's a useful identity. So the left-hand side of the given equation can be written as (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nGiven that a + b + c =300, so substituting that in:\n\n300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc =6,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n300(ab + bc + ca) -3abc =6,000,000.\n\nWe can divide both sides by 3 to simplify:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc =2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so now the equation is 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc =2,000,000.\n\nThis might be a better form to work with. Let me note that.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) a + b + c =300,\n\n2) 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc =2,000,000.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can denote variables in terms of symmetric sums. Let me denote S =a + b + c =300,\n\nP = abc,\n\nQ =ab + bc + ca.\n\nThen the second equation is 100Q - P =2,000,000.\n\nAlso, we know from the theory of symmetric sums that for three variables,\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). Therefore,\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2Q = 300\u00b2 - 2Q =90,000 - 2Q.\n\nBut not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express the equation as P =100Q -2,000,000.\n\nSo, we need to find nonnegative integers a,b,c with a + b + c =300, and abc =100(ab + bc + ca) -2,000,000.\n\nHmm. Let me see if we can find a relationship here. Let me think of variables in terms of two variables. Let me suppose that two variables are expressed in terms of the third.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps substituting variables as follows. Let me let x = a, y = b, so c =300 -x -y. Then substitute into the equation.\n\nSo, let me write Q =ab + bc + ca = xy + y(300 -x -y) +x(300 -x -y)\n\n= xy + 300y -xy - y\u00b2 +300x -x\u00b2 -xy\n\nWait, let me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: ab = xy,\n\nSecond term: bc = b*c = y*(300 -x - y),\n\nThird term: ca = c*a = (300 -x - y)*x.\n\nTherefore, Q = xy + y(300 -x -y) +x(300 -x -y).\n\nExpanding each term:\n\n= xy + 300y -x y - y\u00b2 + 300x -x\u00b2 -x y\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nxy -xy -xy = -xy,\n\n300y + 300x,\n\n- y\u00b2 -x\u00b2,\n\nSo altogether:\n\nQ = 300x + 300y -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 -x y.\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nSimilarly, P =abc =x*y*(300 -x -y).\n\nSo the equation is 100Q - P =2,000,000.\n\nSubstituting Q and P:\n\n100*(300x + 300y -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 -xy) - x y (300 -x -y) =2,000,000.\n\nThis seems very involved, but maybe expanding and simplifying could lead somewhere. Let me try.\n\nFirst, expand the first part:\n\n100*(300x + 300y -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 -xy) = 30,000x +30,000y -100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 -100xy\n\nThen subtract P =x y (300 -x -y):\n\nSo total equation becomes:\n\n30,000x +30,000y -100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 -100xy - [300xy -x\u00b2 y -x y\u00b2] =2,000,000\n\nWait, actually, need to distribute the negative sign properly:\n\nWait, the equation is:\n\n[30,000x +30,000y -100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 -100xy] - [x y (300 -x -y)] =2,000,000\n\nSo expanding the second term:\n\n- x y (300 -x -y) = -300xy +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2\n\nThus, putting all together:\n\n30,000x +30,000y -100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 -100xy -300xy +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2 =2,000,000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2,\n\n-100xy -300xy = -400xy,\n\n+ x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2,\n\n+30,000x +30,000y,\n\nSo the entire expression is:\n\n-100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 -400xy +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2 +30,000x +30,000y =2,000,000.\n\nHmm, this is getting very complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying to assume some variables are equal. Since when we set two variables equal, we found the symmetric solution. Also, when we set one variable to 0, we found another set of solutions. Let me see if there are other possibilities.\n\nSuppose that one variable is 0, like before. We found that gives 6 solutions. The symmetric case gives 1 solution. Let me check if there are solutions where two variables are equal but not 100, but with the third variable not zero. Wait, when we assumed a = b, we found that the only solution was a = b = c =100. So maybe all solutions are either the symmetric case or the ones with a zero?\n\nAlternatively, let me test another case where, say, a=0, then the equations become b +c =300 and the second equation:\n\nab + ... etc. Wait, when a=0, the second equation reduces to 0 +0 +0 +b\u00b2c +0 +0 =b\u00b2c +0= b\u00b2c. Wait, actually, let's recalculate.\n\nWait, if a=0, then the original expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b becomes 0 +0 +0 + b\u00b2c +0 + c\u00b2b =b\u00b2c + bc\u00b2 = bc(b +c). Since b +c=300, so that expression is bc*300. So the equation becomes 300 bc =6,000,000 => bc=20,000, which is exactly what we had before, leading to the solutions (0,200,100) etc. So that's consistent.\n\nSimilarly, if another variable is zero, same result.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that two variables are zero. Let's see: if two variables are zero, say b =c =0, then a=300, but the second equation becomes 0 +0 +0 +0 +0 +0 =0 \u22606,000,000. So that's invalid. So two variables can't be zero.\n\nSo the only solutions with a zero are those with exactly one zero and the other two variables 200 and 100. So that gives 6 solutions. The symmetric case gives 1 solution. So total of 7? But maybe there are other solutions where none of the variables are zero and not all equal?\n\nLet me see. Let me consider if there are solutions where variables are distinct and non-zero. Let me think of possible triples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of the equation 100Q - P =2,000,000.\n\nSuppose that variables are all different, but not involving zeros. Let me see if I can find such a triple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are solutions where two variables are 150 each? Let's test.\n\nSuppose a = b =150, then c =0. But then c is zero, which we already considered. If instead, a =150, b=150, c=0, that's part of the previous solutions. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, trying a=150, b=100, c=50. Let's check:\n\na +b +c=150+100+50=300. Good.\n\nCompute Q =ab + bc + ca =150*100 +100*50 +50*150 =15,000 +5,000 +7,500=27,500.\n\nThen 100Q =2,750,000.\n\nP=abc=150*100*50=750,000.\n\nThus 100Q - P =2,750,000 -750,000 =2,000,000. Hey! That works!\n\nSo (150,100,50) is a solution. Wait, so that's another solution where none of the variables are zero and they are distinct.\n\nHmm, so that's a new solution. So my initial assumption that only the symmetric case and the ones with zeros are solutions is wrong. There are more solutions. Let me see.\n\nTherefore, this suggests there are more triples. Let me check this example:\n\na=150, b=100, c=50. So that works. Similarly, permutations of this would also be solutions. So the number of permutations here would be 6, since all three numbers are distinct (150,100,50 are all different). So there are 6 permutations of this triple.\n\nWait, let me confirm the calculation again.\n\nQ =ab + bc + ca =150*100 +100*50 +50*150 =15,000 +5,000 +7,500 =27,500.\n\n100*27,500 =2,750,000.\n\nabc =150*100*50 =750,000.\n\nSo 2,750,000 -750,000 =2,000,000. Correct. So that works. So that's another solution.\n\nTherefore, there are solutions beyond the symmetric and zero cases. So we need to find all triples (a,b,c) such that a + b + c =300 and 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc =2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can find all triples where variables are in arithmetic progression? Wait, in the example above, 50,100,150 is an arithmetic progression with difference 50. Let me see if that's a coincidence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are triples where the variables form an arithmetic sequence. Let me test another arithmetic progression.\n\nSuppose a = x -d, b =x, c =x +d, so that they are in AP. Then a +b +c= 3x =300 => x=100. So then a=100 -d, b=100, c=100 +d.\n\nThen compute Q =ab + bc + ca.\n\nab = (100 -d)(100) =10,000 -100d,\n\nbc =100*(100 +d)=10,000 +100d,\n\nca= (100 +d)(100 -d)=100\u00b2 -d\u00b2=10,000 -d\u00b2.\n\nThus Q= (10,000 -100d) + (10,000 +100d) + (10,000 -d\u00b2) =30,000 -d\u00b2.\n\nThen P=abc = (100 -d)*100*(100 +d) =100*(100\u00b2 -d\u00b2)=100*(10,000 -d\u00b2)=1,000,000 -100d\u00b2.\n\nNow plug into the equation 100Q - P =2,000,000.\n\nCompute 100*(30,000 -d\u00b2) - (1,000,000 -100d\u00b2)= 3,000,000 -100d\u00b2 -1,000,000 +100d\u00b2 =2,000,000.\n\nWait a second! That's exactly equal to 2,000,000 regardless of d? So that means that for any arithmetic progression centered at 100, with difference d, the equation is satisfied as long as a +b +c=300?\n\nWait, so this suggests that any arithmetic progression triplet (100 -d, 100, 100 +d) where a, b, c are non-negative integers will satisfy the equation. But we need a, b, c to be nonnegative.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\n100 -d \u22650 => d \u2264100,\n\n100 +d \u22650, which is always true since d is nonnegative (as variables are nonnegative; but d could be negative? Wait, but since a =100 -d must be nonnegative, and c =100 +d must be nonnegative. If d is allowed to be negative, then a could be greater than 100, but d is just a difference. Wait, actually, in an arithmetic progression, d can be positive or negative, but since variables must be nonnegative, then:\n\nIf d is positive, then a =100 -d must be nonnegative => d \u2264100,\n\nand c =100 +d can be up to 200,\n\nIf d is negative, say d = -k where k>0, then a =100 +k and c=100 -k. Then c must be nonnegative, so k \u2264100.\n\nThus, in either case, d can range from -100 to 100 in integer steps, but such that a, b, c are nonnegative integers.\n\nWait, but the difference d can be any integer such that the terms are nonnegative. So the possible values of d are integers from -100 to 100, but with the constraints that 100 - |d| \u22650. So |d| \u2264100.\n\nHowever, since a, b, c must be nonnegative integers, and d can be any integer such that 100 -d \u22650 and 100 +d \u22650. Since d is an integer, d can range from -100 to 100, but the triplet must consist of integers. However, since a, b, c are integers, d must be an integer.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of d are integers from -100 to 100, but with the constraints:\n\nFor d \u22650: d from 0 to 100,\n\nfor d <0: d from -100 to -1,\n\nBut since d is just a difference, the triplets for d and -d are different. For example, d=50 gives (50,100,150), while d=-50 gives (150,100,50). But since the problem counts ordered triples, these are considered different unless permutations are considered the same, but the problem says \"triples of nonnegative integers\", which are ordered triples. Wait, actually in combinatorics, when they say \"triples\", unless specified otherwise, they are ordered. Wait, but let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait the problem says \"the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c)\", so I think they are ordered triples. So each permutation is a different triple. However, in the arithmetic progression approach, each d gives a unique ordered triple unless we consider different orderings. Wait, actually, in the arithmetic progression setup, we fixed the order as (100 -d, 100, 100 +d). So different d's give different ordered triples. But permutations would be different triples.\n\nWait, but in our previous example, (150, 100, 50) is different from (50, 100, 150), etc. So in this approach, the arithmetic progression with difference d gives one ordered triple, but permutations would require different setups. Hmm, perhaps I need to think of all permutations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all solutions are those that can be arranged into an arithmetic progression? Because in the previous example, (150,100,50) can be arranged as (50,100,150) which is an arithmetic progression with difference 50. Similarly, (200,100,0) can be arranged as (0,100,200), which is an arithmetic progression with difference 100.\n\nWait, 0,100,200: the difference is 100, but the common difference is 100. So that's also an arithmetic progression. So actually, the case where one variable is zero is also an arithmetic progression with difference 100. For example, (0,100,200) has differences of 100 and 100. Wait, arithmetic progression requires the difference between consecutive terms to be constant. So 0,100,200 is indeed an arithmetic progression with common difference 100. Similarly, (50,100,150) is an AP with difference 50. The symmetric case (100,100,100) is also an AP with difference 0.\n\nTherefore, all the solutions we found so far are arithmetic progressions. So perhaps all solutions must be arithmetic progressions?\n\nIf that's the case, then all solutions are arithmetic progressions of three terms adding up to 300, and satisfying the second equation. Since we saw that for any arithmetic progression with a + b + c =300, the second equation is automatically satisfied?\n\nWait, in the earlier calculation, when we considered variables in AP, we found that regardless of d, the equation holds. So as long as a, b, c form an arithmetic progression with sum 300, then 100Q - P =2,000,000. So this is always true. So that means that all such arithmetic progressions are solutions. Therefore, the set of solutions is exactly all triples that form an arithmetic progression of three nonnegative integers summing to 300.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting all arithmetic progressions of three nonnegative integers a \u2264 b \u2264 c such that a + b + c =300, and then considering all permutations of these triples.\n\nWait, but arithmetic progression can be in any order, but since we are counting ordered triples, we need to consider all permutations.\n\nAlternatively, first, let's count the number of arithmetic progressions (in order) where a, b, c are in AP, and then account for permutations.\n\nBut first, let me formalize this.\n\nLet the three terms of the AP be a, a + d, a + 2d, so that they are in non-decreasing order. Then their sum is 3a +3d =300 => a + d =100. Therefore, the middle term is 100. Wait, that's an important point.\n\nWait, if we denote the three terms as a, a +d, a +2d, then their sum is 3a + 3d =3(a + d)=300 => a + d =100. Therefore, the middle term is a +d =100. Therefore, the three terms can be written as (100 -d, 100, 100 +d). This is similar to our previous approach.\n\nTherefore, the three terms must be symmetrically placed around 100. So the common difference is d, so the three terms are 100 -d, 100, 100 +d. To ensure that all terms are nonnegative integers, we need:\n\n100 -d \u22650 => d \u2264100,\n\nand 100 +d \u22650, which is always true since d is a nonnegative integer (since we assumed the terms are non-decreasing). Wait, but d can be any integer such that 100 -d is nonnegative, so d can be from 0 up to 100. But d must be an integer, so d=0,1,2,...,100.\n\nWait, but d is the common difference. If we consider the AP in the order (a, b, c), then d can be positive or negative, but in terms of non-decreasing order, d must be nonnegative. But since the problem counts all ordered triples, not just non-decreasing ones, we need to consider all permutations.\n\nTherefore, for each possible AP in non-decreasing order (with difference d \u22650), we can permute the three terms in any order, leading to different triples.\n\nHowever, some triples may have repeated elements, so their permutations would not all be unique. For example, when d=0, all terms are 100, so there's only one distinct triple (100,100,100). For d>0, the three terms are distinct if d\u22600, so each such AP gives 6 permutations. Except when one of the terms is 0, which still are distinct but their permutations would include cases where the 0 is in different positions.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nFirst, let's consider all arithmetic progressions in non-decreasing order: (100 -d, 100, 100 +d) where d is an integer from 0 to 100.\n\nFor each d from 0 to 100:\n\n- If d=0: the triple is (100,100,100). This is only one ordered triple.\n\n- For d from 1 to 100:\n\nThe terms are distinct: 100 -d, 100, 100 +d. Since d \u22651, these are three distinct numbers. Therefore, the number of permutations for each such triple is 3! =6.\n\nHowever, when d=100, the terms become (0,100,200). These are also distinct, so they have 6 permutations. Similarly for other d.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ordered triples would be:\n\n1 (for d=0) + 6*100 (for d=1 to 100) ?\n\nWait, wait, d ranges from 0 to 100, so that's 101 values. But when d=0, it's 1 triple, and for d=1 to 100, each gives 6 triples. So total is 1 + 6*100 = 1 +600=601?\n\nWait, but hold on: when d=100, the triple is (0,100,200). When d=50, it's (50,100,150). But when d=25, it's (75,100,125). All of these are valid as long as 100 -d \u22650.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check for d=100: yes, 100 -100=0, 100, 200. Valid.\n\nBut hang on: the problem states that a, b, c are nonnegative integers. So all terms must be nonnegative. Since we have 100 -d \u22650, so d can be from 0 to 100 inclusive. So yes, 101 possible values of d. Each d from 1 to 100 gives 6 ordered triples, and d=0 gives 1. So total 1 + 6*100 = 601.\n\nWait, but earlier when we considered d from 0 to 100, that's 101 values. However, in the case of d=0, the triple is only one. For each d from 1 to 100, you have 6 permutations. So total number of triples is 1 + 6*100 =601.\n\nBut hold on a second. Wait, but when d and -d give the same set of numbers but in different order. However, in our setup, d is the difference such that the terms are (100 -d,100,100 +d). So d is nonnegative. So actually, each d corresponds to a unique combination of numbers in non-decreasing order, and permutations account for all orderings. So I think the count is correct: 601?\n\nWait, but in the earlier example where a=150, b=100, c=50 (which is d=50 in reverse order), that is counted in the permutations of (50,100,150). So all permutations are included. So total number of ordered triples is indeed 1 +6*100=601.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check with d=100. The triple (0,100,200). The permutations of this are 6, but when we considered earlier when one variable is zero, we found 6 triples, which are exactly the permutations of (0,100,200). Similarly for d=50, the permutations of (50,100,150) give 6 triples, which are the ones we found earlier. The symmetric case (100,100,100) is 1. So all these are included in the 601.\n\nHowever, wait a second. Is there any restriction on d? For example, when d=100, the third term is 200, which is okay. What about d=99? Then the terms would be (1,100,199). That is valid. Similarly d=1 gives (99,100,101). All valid.\n\nTherefore, all d from 0 to 100 are allowed, so the total is 601. But let me check for d=0.5? Wait, but d must be integer because a, b, c are integers. Since the terms are integers, the common difference must be an integer. Therefore, d must be integer. So yes, d from 0 to 100 inclusive integers.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is 1 + 6*100 =601. However, this contradicts my earlier thought that the answer might be 601, but I need to verify.\n\nWait, but let me check with another example. Let me take d=1. Then the triple in order is (99,100,101). The permutations of this would be 6 different ordered triples, like (99,100,101), (99,101,100), etc. All of these are distinct and satisfy the equations. Let me check one of them:\n\nTake (99,101,100). Let's check the sum: 99+101+100=300.\n\nCompute the expression a\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\na=99, b=101, c=100.\n\na\u00b2b =99\u00b2*101,\n\na\u00b2c =99\u00b2*100,\n\nb\u00b2a =101\u00b2*99,\n\nb\u00b2c =101\u00b2*100,\n\nc\u00b2a =100\u00b2*99,\n\nc\u00b2b =100\u00b2*101.\n\nAdding all these terms.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula (a +b +c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nWe know a +b +c=300,\n\nab + bc + ca: compute that:\n\nab=99*101=9999,\n\nbc=101*100=10100,\n\nca=100*99=9900,\n\nSo ab + bc + ca =9999 +10100 +9900 = (9999+9900)=19899 +10100=30, 000 -1? Wait let's compute:\n\n9999 +10100 =20,099,\n\n20,099 +9900=30, 000 -1? Wait 20,099 +9,900=30,000-1 +9,900? Wait:\n\nWait 20,099 +9,900 =20,099 +9,900 =30,000 -1? Let's compute:\n\n20,099 +9,900:\n\n20,000 +9,900 =29,900,\n\nplus 99 =29,999.\n\nHmm, so ab + bc + ca =29,999.\n\nThen 300*(29,999) -3abc = ?\n\nCompute 300*29,999 =300*(30,000 -1)=9,000,000 -300=8,999,700.\n\nThen subtract 3abc. Compute abc=99*101*100.\n\nFirst compute 99*101: (100-1)(100+1)=10,000 -1=9,999.\n\nSo abc=9,999*100=999,900.\n\nThus 3abc=2,999,700.\n\nSo 8,999,700 -2,999,700 =6,000,000. Correct. So that works.\n\nTherefore, this triple is indeed a solution. So the arithmetic progression approach works.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is 1 +6*100=601.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check if there are any other triples that are not in arithmetic progression. Suppose there exists a triple that is not an arithmetic progression but still satisfies the equations.\n\nSuppose, for instance, take a=140, b=100, c=60. Let me check if this is an arithmetic progression. The terms would be 60,100,140 which is an AP with difference 40. So yes, that is an AP with d=40. So that's included in our count.\n\nAnother example: a=130, b=100, c=70. Also AP with d=30.\n\nWhat about a triple like (120, 100, 80). AP with d=20. Yes.\n\nAlternatively, pick a non-AP triple. Let's see. Let me try a=150, b=110, c=40. Their sum is 150+110+40=300.\n\nCheck if they form an AP: differences are 150-110=40, 110-40=70. Not constant, so not an AP.\n\nLet me compute the equation:\n\nCompute ab + bc + ca:\n\nab=150*110=16,500,\n\nbc=110*40=4,400,\n\nca=40*150=6,000,\n\nTotal Q=16,500 +4,400 +6,000=26,900.\n\nThen 100Q=2,690,000.\n\nP=abc=150*110*40=150*4,400=660,000.\n\nThus 100Q - P =2,690,000 -660,000=2,030,000\u22602,000,000. So doesn't satisfy the equation.\n\nTherefore, this is not a solution. Thus, it seems that only the arithmetic progressions work.\n\nAnother test: Let me take a triple not in AP but with variables adding to 300. Let's say (120, 120, 60). Sum is 300.\n\nCheck if it's an AP: 60,120,120. The differences are 60 and 0. Not constant. Not an AP.\n\nCompute Q=ab + bc + ca=120*120 +120*60 +60*120=14,400 +7,200 +7,200=28,800.\n\n100Q=2,880,000.\n\nP=abc=120*120*60=864,000.\n\n100Q - P=2,880,000-864,000=2,016,000\u22602,000,000. Doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, it seems only arithmetic progressions work. So the total number is indeed 601.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again about d. The terms are (100 -d, 100, 100 +d). So when d=0, it's (100,100,100). When d=1, it's (99,100,101), up to d=100: (0,100,200). Each d from 0 to 100 gives a unique combination in non-decreasing order. Each of these, except d=0, can be permuted in 6 ways, giving 6 triples each. Thus total triples:\n\nFor d=0: 1\n\nFor d=1 to 100: 100 values, each giving 6 triples.\n\nTotal:1 + 100\u00d76= 1 +600=601.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601.\n\nWait, but let me check if there is any overcounting or undercounting.\n\nSuppose d=50, the triple (50,100,150). Its permutations are all counted in the 6\u00d7100. Similarly, when d=100, (0,100,200) is counted similarly. The only case not multiplied by 6 is the symmetric case.\n\nTherefore, the count is correct.\n\nBut let me check for d=100. The triple (0,100,200). The permutations would include (0,200,100), (100,0,200), etc., all 6 permutations. These are all valid and distinct triples, so they are counted correctly.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is 601. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{601}.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem says \"nonnegative integers\". So zero is allowed. So all terms are okay. The arithmetic progression approach includes all possible triples where the three numbers form an arithmetic progression (in any order), and sum to 300. Since we have considered all permutations, that should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again of the case when two numbers are the same but not all three. For example, (100,100,100) is the only one with all same. If two numbers are same but not all three, like (100,100,100) is same, but suppose (x,y,z) where two are same but third different. For example, (150,100,50) has all distinct. To have two same, let's see:\n\nSuppose that two terms are equal, but not all three. Let me see if that can happen in an arithmetic progression.\n\nSuppose an arithmetic progression with two equal terms. That requires the common difference d=0, but then all three terms are equal. So the only way to have two equal terms in an arithmetic progression is if all three are equal. Therefore, there are no arithmetic progressions with exactly two equal terms. Thus, all triples except the symmetric one have distinct terms, so each of those contributes 6 permutations, and the symmetric one contributes 1.\n\nTherefore, the total is indeed 601.\n\nHence, the answer is 601.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm with another example where d=25:\n\nTriple (75,100,125). The permutations would be 6, which are all valid.\n\nAnother check with d=33:\n\nTriple (67,100,133). Sum is 67+100+133=300. The terms are distinct. So permutations give 6 triples.\n\nTherefore, all cases seem to check out. So I think the answer is 601.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that when d=0, it's counted once, and when d=100, it's counted as 6. The problem says \"triples of nonnegative integers\", so each permutation is a distinct triple, so yes, the count is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 601.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{601}\n\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the number of triples of nonnegative integers \\((a, b, c)\\) satisfying \\(a + b + c = 300\\) and \\(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\\), we start by analyzing the given equations.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the second equation using the identity:\n\\[\na^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc\n\\]\nGiven \\(a + b + c = 300\\), substituting this into the identity, we get:\n\\[\n300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 3, we obtain:\n\\[\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the possibility that the triples \\((a, b, c)\\) form an arithmetic progression. For three terms in an arithmetic progression, we can denote them as \\(100 - d\\), \\(100\\), and \\(100 + d\\) where \\(d\\) is a nonnegative integer. This ensures their sum is \\(300\\).\n\nFor these terms:\n- The sum \\(a + b + c = 300\\) is satisfied.\n- The product terms are calculated as follows:\n  - \\(ab + bc + ca = (100 - d) \\cdot 100 + 100 \\cdot (100 + d) + (100 + d) \\cdot (100 - d) = 30,000 - d^2\\)\n  - \\(abc = (100 - d) \\cdot 100 \\cdot (100 + d) = 1,000,000 - 100d^2\\)\n\nSubstituting these into the equation \\(100(ab + bc + ca) - abc\\), we get:\n\\[\n100(30,000 - d^2) - (1,000,000 - 100d^2) = 2,000,000\n\\]\nThis simplifies to \\(2,000,000\\), confirming that all arithmetic progressions satisfy the equation.\n\nThe values of \\(d\\) range from 0 to 100 (since \\(100 - d \\geq 0\\)). Each \\(d\\) from 1 to 100 gives a distinct set of three numbers, which can be permuted in 6 ways. The case \\(d = 0\\) (all terms 100) is a single triple.\n\nThus, the total number of triples is:\n- 1 (for \\(d = 0\\))\n- \\(6 \\times 100\\) (for \\(d = 1\\) to \\(d = 100\\))\n\nSumming these, we get:\n\\[\n1 + 6 \\times 100 = 601\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{601}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b equals 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note that the problem is about finding nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: their sum is 300 and their \"cross terms\" (the expression given) sum up to 6,000,000. Since they are nonnegative integers, each of a, b, c has to be 0 or a positive integer, but their total is fixed at 300.\n\nLet me start by trying to simplify the given equation. The expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b looks a bit complicated, but maybe there's a way to factor it or relate it to other expressions involving a, b, and c. Let me see.\n\nI recall that sometimes when dealing with symmetric expressions in variables, it helps to use symmetric sums or other known identities. Let me try to see if this expression can be rewritten in terms of the sum a + b + c and the pairwise products or something else.\n\nLet me note that the given expression is:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\nHmm, this can be grouped as:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nSince each term like a\u00b2 is multiplied by the sum of the other two variables. Since we know that a + b + c = 300, then for each term, say a\u00b2(b + c), since b + c = 300 - a, so substituting that in:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c)\n\nTherefore, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\u03a3_{cyc} a\u00b2(300 - a) = 300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3)\n\nSo the given equation is:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that's a good start. Let's write that down:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000. --- (1)\n\nAlso, we know that a + b + c = 300. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300. Maybe I can use some known identities involving sums of squares and cubes.\n\nRecall that (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). So we can express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 in terms of S and the pairwise products:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 300\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nSimilarly, there's an identity for the sum of cubes:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.\n\nSo substituting that into equation (1):\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - [ (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc ] = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me substitute S = 300, so:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - [300^3 - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step. First, let's expand the terms:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - 300^3 + 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nNow, let's substitute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 from the earlier equation:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 300\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca). Therefore,\n\n300*(300\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) - 300^3 + 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 300*(300\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) = 300^3 - 600*(ab + bc + ca)\n\nSecond term: -300^3\n\nThird term: +3*300*(ab + bc + ca) = +900*(ab + bc + ca)\n\nFourth term: -3abc\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\n[300^3 - 600*(ab + bc + ca)] - 300^3 + [900*(ab + bc + ca)] - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n300^3 - 300^3 cancels out.\n\n-600*(ab + bc + ca) + 900*(ab + bc + ca) = 300*(ab + bc + ca)\n\nThen the remaining terms are:\n\n300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n\n300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 3 to simplify:\n\n100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so we now have:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000. --- (2)\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to solving equations (a + b + c = 300) and (100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000) with a, b, c nonnegative integers.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit more manageable. Let me see if I can find some substitutions or ways to approach this.\n\nLet me denote variables as follows: Let\u2019s let S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ca. Then equation (2) becomes 100Q - P = 2,000,000. So P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nBut we also know that for three variables, there is the relation between S, Q, and the sum of squares. Let me recall that:\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\n\nSo, since S = 300,\n\n300\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2Q => a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 90000 - 2Q.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of other relations. Alternatively, perhaps express variables in terms of each other?\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that if two variables are equal? Since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps the solutions have some symmetry. Maybe assuming two variables are equal, or one is zero?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables as x, y, z where one is expressed in terms of the other two. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000. Let me see if I can find a relation between Q and P.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of variables as being multiples of some number. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps trying small cases or looking for possible substitutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of variables a, b, c as being multiples of 10? Since the equation involves 100 and 2,000,000, which are multiples of 100. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that a = 10x, b = 10y, c = 10z, so that x, y, z are nonnegative integers. Then:\n\na + b + c = 10(x + y + z) = 300 \u21d2 x + y + z = 30.\n\nThen Q = ab + bc + ca = 100(xy + yz + zx).\n\nSimilarly, P = abc = 1000xyz.\n\nSubstituting into equation (2):\n\n100*(100(xy + yz + zx)) - 1000xyz = 2,000,000\n\nCompute each term:\n\n100*100*(xy + yz + zx) = 10,000*(xy + yz + zx)\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n10,000*(xy + yz + zx) - 1000xyz = 2,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 1000:\n\n10*(xy + yz + zx) - xyz = 2000.\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n10(xy + yz + zx) - xyz = 2000. --- (3)\n\nAnd x + y + z = 30. --- (4)\n\nSo now the problem reduces to finding triples (x, y, z) of nonnegative integers with x + y + z = 30 and 10(xy + yz + zx) - xyz = 2000.\n\nThis seems more manageable. Maybe this substitution was helpful. Let me see.\n\nNow, since x, y, z are nonnegative integers, perhaps I can try to find possible triples (x, y, z) that satisfy these two equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use substitution here. Let me see if we can manipulate equation (3).\n\nLet me rearrange equation (3):\n\nxyz - 10(xy + yz + zx) + 2000 = 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor this equation? Not sure yet. Alternatively, let me think of variables in terms of symmetry again.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that if one of the variables is zero. Suppose, say, z = 0. Then equation (3) becomes 10(xy + 0 + 0) - 0 = 10xy = 2000 \u21d2 xy = 200. But then x + y = 30 (since z=0). So solving x + y =30 and xy = 200. The solutions would be roots of t^2 -30t +200 =0. The discriminant is 900 -800=100, so roots (30 \u00b110)/2 = 20 or 10. So (x,y) = (20,10) or (10,20). Therefore, with z=0, we have triples (20,10,0), (10,20,0), and permutations. So that would be 3 permutations (since z can be any of the three variables). Wait, but in this case, z is fixed as 0, so the triples would be (20,10,0), (10,20,0), (20,0,10), (10,0,20), (0,20,10), (0,10,20). So total of 6 solutions here? Wait, but actually, if z=0, then x and y are 20 and10, so there are three positions where the zero can be. For each position, there are two permutations (since x and y can be swapped). So 3 * 2 =6 solutions here. Hmm, so that's one set of solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are solutions where none of the variables are zero. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that maybe two variables are equal, so let me suppose x = y. Then, since x + y + z =30, then z =30 -2x. Then substituting into equation (3):\n\n10(x^2 + 2xz) -x^2 z =2000\n\nBut z =30 -2x, so substitute:\n\n10(x\u00b2 + 2x(30 -2x)) -x\u00b2(30 -2x) = 2000\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term inside the 10:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2x(30 -2x) = x\u00b2 +60x -4x\u00b2 = -3x\u00b2 +60x\n\nMultiply by 10: 10*(-3x\u00b2 +60x)= -30x\u00b2 +600x\n\nSecond term: -x\u00b2(30 -2x) = -30x\u00b2 +2x\u00b3\n\nTherefore total equation:\n\n-30x\u00b2 +600x -30x\u00b2 +2x\u00b3 =2000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x\u00b3 -60x\u00b2 +600x -2000 =0\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx\u00b3 -30x\u00b2 +300x -1000 =0\n\nHmm, let's see if this cubic can be factored. Let's try possible integer roots. The possible roots are divisors of 1000, so \u00b11, \u00b12, ..., \u00b11000. Let me try x=10:\n\n10\u00b3 -30*(10)^2 +300*10 -1000 = 1000 - 3000 + 3000 -1000 = 0. Hey, that works! So x=10 is a root.\n\nTherefore, we can factor (x -10)(quadratic) = x\u00b3 -30x\u00b2 +300x -1000.\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or factorization. Since (x-10) is a factor:\n\nDivide x\u00b3 -30x\u00b2 +300x -1000 by (x-10):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n10 | 1  -30   300   -1000\n\n          10  -200   1000\n\n      1  -20   100      0\n\nSo the quadratic is x\u00b2 -20x +100. Therefore,\n\nx\u00b3 -30x\u00b2 +300x -1000 = (x -10)(x\u00b2 -20x +100)\n\nNow, set to zero:\n\n(x -10)(x\u00b2 -20x +100)=0\n\nThe quadratic equation x\u00b2 -20x +100 =0 has discriminant 400 -400 =0, so x=(20)/2=10, so double root at 10. Wait, no: discriminant is 20\u00b2 -4*1*100 =400-400=0, so yes, x=10 is a double root. Wait, so actually the cubic factors as (x -10)^3 =0? Wait, no, wait. Wait (x -10)(x\u00b2 -20x +100) is (x -10)[(x)^2 -20x +100]. But x\u00b2 -20x +100 factors as (x -10)^2? Let me check (x -10)^2 =x\u00b2 -20x +100. Yes! So actually, the cubic factors as (x -10)^3 =0. Therefore, the equation is (x -10)^3 =0, so x=10 is the only real root, with multiplicity three.\n\nTherefore, when x = y =10, then z =30 -2x =30 -20 =10. So z=10. Therefore, the triple (x,y,z) = (10,10,10). So that's another solution where all variables are equal to 10. Let me check if this satisfies equation (3):\n\n10*(10*10 +10*10 +10*10) -10*10*10 =10*(300) -1000 =3000 -1000=2000. Yes, that works. So (10,10,10) is a solution. Since all variables are equal, this is only one unique solution (since permutations are the same in this case). So that's another solution.\n\nTherefore, when we assumed two variables are equal, we found that (10,10,10) is a solution, and also when one variable is zero, we get six solutions. Are there other solutions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are solutions where none of the variables are equal, and none are zero. Let me see.\n\nSuppose all variables are positive integers, and not all equal. Let me see if we can find such solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can let variables be in terms of x, y, z and try to set up equations. Let me think of variables as x, y, z with x + y + z =30 and 10(xy + yz + zx) - xyz =2000. Let me see if there are other integer solutions here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use substitution. Let me suppose z =30 -x -y, then substitute into the equation.\n\nLet me set z =30 -x -y, so substituting into equation (3):\n\n10[xy + y(30 -x -y) + x(30 -x -y)] - x y (30 -x -y) =2000.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the terms inside the brackets:\n\nxy + y(30 -x -y) + x(30 -x -y)\n\n= xy + 30y -xy - y\u00b2 +30x -x\u00b2 -xy\n\nWait, let me expand term by term:\n\nFirst term: xy\n\nSecond term: y*(30 -x -y) =30y -xy - y\u00b2\n\nThird term: x*(30 -x -y)=30x -x\u00b2 -xy\n\nAdding all together:\n\nxy + [30y -xy - y\u00b2] + [30x -x\u00b2 -xy]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nxy -xy -xy = -xy\n\n30y +30x remains.\n\nThen - y\u00b2 -x\u00b2\n\nSo total:\n\n30x +30y -xy -x\u00b2 -y\u00b2\n\nTherefore, the expression inside the brackets is 30x +30y -xy -x\u00b2 -y\u00b2.\n\nSo equation (3) becomes:\n\n10*(30x +30y -xy -x\u00b2 -y\u00b2) - x y (30 -x -y) =2000\n\nLet me expand the second term:\n\n- x y (30 -x -y) = -30xy +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2\n\nTherefore, putting all together:\n\n10*(30x +30y -xy -x\u00b2 -y\u00b2) + (-30xy +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2) =2000\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst part:\n\n10*(30x) =300x\n\n10*(30y)=300y\n\n10*(-xy)= -10xy\n\n10*(-x\u00b2)= -10x\u00b2\n\n10*(-y\u00b2)= -10y\u00b2\n\nSecond part:\n\n-30xy +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\n300x +300y -10xy -10x\u00b2 -10y\u00b2 -30xy +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2 =2000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n300x + 300y\n\nFor the xy terms: -10xy -30xy = -40xy\n\nFor x\u00b2 terms: -10x\u00b2 +x\u00b2 y\n\nFor y\u00b2 terms: -10y\u00b2 +x y\u00b2\n\nAlso, the cross terms x\u00b2 y and x y\u00b2.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the best. Let me see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that since x, y, z are positive integers adding to 30, perhaps trying small numbers or looking for patterns. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the equation 10(xy + yz + zx) - xyz =2000. Let me rearrange it as:\n\nxyz -10(xy + yz + zx) = -2000.\n\nHmm, maybe factor something here. Let me see. Let me add 1000 to both sides:\n\nxyz -10(xy + yz + zx) + 1000 = -1000.\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps consider introducing variables like u = x -10, v = y -10, w = z -10, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that variables are all 10, which we already found. Let me see if there are other triples. Let me try some examples.\n\nSuppose one of the variables is 20. Let me suppose x=20. Then since x + y + z =30, then y + z=10. Let me set variables as x=20, y + z=10. Let me compute equation (3):\n\n10(xy + y z +20 z) -20 y z =2000.\n\nWait, let me substitute x=20, so z=10 - y.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n10[20y + y(10 - y) +20(10 - y)] -20 y (10 - y) =2000.\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term inside the brackets:\n\n20y + y(10 - y) +20(10 - y)\n\n=20y +10y - y\u00b2 +200 -20y\n\n= (20y +10y -20y) + (-y\u00b2) +200\n\n=10y - y\u00b2 +200\n\nMultiply by 10:\n\n10*(10y - y\u00b2 +200) =100y -10y\u00b2 +2000\n\nSecond term: -20y(10 - y) = -200y +20y\u00b2\n\nSo total equation:\n\n(100y -10y\u00b2 +2000) + (-200y +20y\u00b2) =2000\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n(100y -200y) + (-10y\u00b2 +20y\u00b2) +2000 =2000\n\n= (-100y) +10y\u00b2 +2000 =2000\n\nSubtract 2000 both sides:\n\n-100y +10y\u00b2 =0 \u21d2 10y\u00b2 -100y =0 \u21d210y(y -10)=0 \u21d2 y=0 or y=10.\n\nIf y=0, then z=10, so triple (20,0,10). Which we already considered when one variable is zero. So that's one of the previous solutions.\n\nIf y=10, then z=0, so triple (20,10,0), which is again already considered. So that's the same as before.\n\nHmm, so no new solutions here.\n\nWhat if we try x=15. Let me try x=15. Then y + z=15. Let me set z=15 - y. Substitute into equation (3):\n\n10[15y + y(15 - y) +15(15 - y)] -15 y (15 - y) =2000.\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n15y + y(15 - y) +15*(15 - y)\n\n=15y +15y -y\u00b2 +225 -15y\n\n= (15y +15y -15y) + (-y\u00b2) +225\n\n=15y - y\u00b2 +225\n\nMultiply by 10:\n\n10*(15y - y\u00b2 +225) =150y -10y\u00b2 +2250\n\nSecond term: -15y(15 - y) =-225y +15y\u00b2\n\nThus total equation:\n\n150y -10y\u00b2 +2250 -225y +15y\u00b2 =2000\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(150y -225y) + (-10y\u00b2 +15y\u00b2) +2250 =2000\n\n= (-75y) +5y\u00b2 +2250 =2000\n\nBring all to left:\n\n5y\u00b2 -75y +2250 -2000 =0 \u21d25y\u00b2 -75y +250=0\n\nDivide by 5:\n\ny\u00b2 -15y +50=0\n\nSolutions:\n\ny = [15 \u00b1\u221a(225 -200)]/2 = [15 \u00b1\u221a25]/2 = [15 \u00b15]/2 \u21d2 y=(20)/2=10 or y=(10)/2=5.\n\nThus, if y=10, then z=15 -10=5. So triple (15,10,5). Let me check if this satisfies equation (3):\n\nCompute 10*(15*10 +10*5 +15*5) -15*10*5\n\nFirst compute the terms inside:\n\n15*10=150, 10*5=50, 15*5=75. Sum:150+50+75=275. Multiply by10: 2750.\n\nThen subtract 15*10*5=750. So total is 2750 -750=2000. Yes, that works. So (15,10,5) is a solution. Now, since variables are nonnegative integers, permutations of this would also be solutions.\n\nWait, so here we have a new solution where all variables are non-zero and not all equal. So that's a new solution.\n\nSo, for x=15, y=10, z=5, which sum to 30. Then the permutations of (15,10,5) would be all the permutations. Since all three numbers are distinct, the number of permutations is 3! =6. So that's 6 more solutions.\n\nWait, so now we have:\n\n- The solutions with a zero: 6 (from when one variable is 0, leading to 20,10,0 etc.)\n\n- The solution with all variables 10: 1 (since (10,10,10))\n\n- The solution with (15,10,5): 6 permutations.\n\nSo total so far: 6 +1 +6=13. But maybe there are more?\n\nLet me check if there are other triples. Let me try another value. Let me try x=25. Then y + z =5. Let me see:\n\nSet x=25, so z=5 - y. Then plug into equation (3):\n\n10[25y + y(5 - y) +25(5 - y)] -25y(5 - y)=2000.\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n25y +5y - y\u00b2 +125 -25y = (25y +5y -25y) + (-y\u00b2) +125 =5y - y\u00b2 +125\n\nMultiply by10: 50y -10y\u00b2 +1250\n\nSecond term: -25y(5 - y) = -125y +25y\u00b2\n\nTotal equation:\n\n50y -10y\u00b2 +1250 -125y +25y\u00b2 =2000\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(50y -125y) + (-10y\u00b2 +25y\u00b2) +1250 =2000\n\n= (-75y) +15y\u00b2 +1250 =2000\n\nBring all to left:\n\n15y\u00b2 -75y +1250 -2000=0 \u21d215y\u00b2 -75y -750=0\n\nDivide by 15:\n\ny\u00b2 -5y -50 =0\n\nDiscriminant:25 +200=225 \u21d2 y=(5 \u00b115)/2\n\nThus y=(20)/2=10 or y=(-10)/2=-5. Since y must be nonnegative, y=10. Then z=5 -10= -5. Which is invalid. So no solution here.\n\nHmm, so no solution here. So x=25 doesn't give a valid solution.\n\nHow about x=5. Let me try x=5. Then y + z=25. Let me set z=25 - y.\n\nPlugging into equation (3):\n\n10[5y + y(25 - y) +5(25 - y)] -5y(25 - y)=2000.\n\nCompute inside brackets:\n\n5y +25y -y\u00b2 +125 -5y = (5y +25y -5y) + (-y\u00b2) +125 =25y - y\u00b2 +125\n\nMultiply by10:250y -10y\u00b2 +1250\n\nSecond term: -5y(25 - y)= -125y +5y\u00b2\n\nTotal equation:\n\n250y -10y\u00b2 +1250 -125y +5y\u00b2 =2000\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(250y -125y) + (-10y\u00b2 +5y\u00b2) +1250 =2000\n\n=125y -5y\u00b2 +1250 =2000\n\nBring all to left:\n\n-5y\u00b2 +125y +1250 -2000=0 \u21d2-5y\u00b2 +125y -750=0\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\n5y\u00b2 -125y +750=0 \u21d2Divide by 5:\n\ny\u00b2 -25y +150=0\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=(25 \u00b1\u221a(625 -600))/2 = (25 \u00b1\u221a25)/2 = (25 \u00b15)/2 \u21d215 or 10.\n\nThus, if y=15, then z=25 -15=10. So triple (5,15,10). Which is the same as (15,10,5) just reordered. Similarly, y=10 gives z=15, so (5,10,15). So permutations again. So nothing new here.\n\nHow about x=12. Let me try x=12. Then y + z=18. Let me pick y= something. Let me see:\n\nSet x=12, so z=18 - y.\n\nPlug into equation (3):\n\n10[12y + y(18 - y) +12*(18 - y)] -12y(18 - y)=2000.\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n12y +18y -y\u00b2 +216 -12y = (12y +18y -12y) + (-y\u00b2) +216 =18y - y\u00b2 +216\n\nMultiply by10:180y -10y\u00b2 +2160\n\nSecond term: -12y(18 - y)= -216y +12y\u00b2\n\nTotal equation:\n\n180y -10y\u00b2 +2160 -216y +12y\u00b2 =2000\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(180y -216y) + (-10y\u00b2 +12y\u00b2) +2160 =2000\n\n= (-36y) +2y\u00b2 +2160 =2000\n\nBring all to left:\n\n2y\u00b2 -36y +2160 -2000=0 \u21d22y\u00b2 -36y +160=0 \u21d2Divide by 2:\n\ny\u00b2 -18y +80=0\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=(18 \u00b1\u221a(324 -320))/2=(18 \u00b12)/2=20/2=10 or 16/2=8.\n\nThus y=10 \u21d2 z=8, so triple (12,10,8). Let me check this:\n\nCompute 10*(12*10 +10*8 +12*8) -12*10*8\n\nInside the brackets: 120 +80 +96=296. 296*10=2960. Subtract 12*10*8=960. 2960-960=2000. Yes, that works. So (12,10,8) is another solution. So permutations of (12,10,8). Since all three numbers are distinct, there are 6 permutations. So that's another 6 solutions.\n\nHmm, so that adds more solutions. So now we have (12,10,8). Let me see if there are more such triples.\n\nWait, let me check if (12,10,8) is a valid solution. Yes, as above. So now, that's another set. Let me see if there are other triples.\n\nLet me try x=8. Let me see x=8, so y + z=22. Let me set z=22 - y.\n\nPlugging into equation (3):\n\n10[8y + y(22 - y) +8*(22 - y)] -8y*(22 - y)=2000.\n\nInside the brackets:\n\n8y +22y -y\u00b2 +176 -8y = (8y +22y -8y) + (-y\u00b2) +176 =22y - y\u00b2 +176\n\nMultiply by10:220y -10y\u00b2 +1760\n\nSecond term: -8y*(22 - y)= -176y +8y\u00b2\n\nTotal equation:\n\n220y -10y\u00b2 +1760 -176y +8y\u00b2=2000\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(220y -176y) + (-10y\u00b2 +8y\u00b2) +1760 =2000\n\n=44y -2y\u00b2 +1760 =2000\n\nBring all to left:\n\n-2y\u00b2 +44y +1760 -2000 =0 \u21d2-2y\u00b2 +44y -240=0 \u21d2Multiply by -1:\n\n2y\u00b2 -44y +240=0 \u21d2Divide by 2:\n\ny\u00b2 -22y +120=0\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=(22 \u00b1\u221a(484 -480))/2=(22 \u00b12)/2=24/2=12 or 20/2=10.\n\nThus, y=12 \u21d2 z=10, so (8,12,10). Which is same as (12,10,8) permuted. y=10 \u21d2 z=12, so (8,10,12). Same again.\n\nSo that's the same solution as before.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that (12,10,8) is another solution. Let me see if there are more such triples.\n\nLet me try x=18. Let me try x=18, so y + z=12. Let me set z=12 - y.\n\nPlug into equation (3):\n\n10[18y + y(12 - y) +18*(12 - y)] -18y*(12 - y)=2000.\n\nInside the brackets:\n\n18y +12y -y\u00b2 +216 -18y = (18y +12y -18y) + (-y\u00b2) +216 =12y -y\u00b2 +216\n\nMultiply by10:120y -10y\u00b2 +2160\n\nSecond term: -18y*(12 - y)= -216y +18y\u00b2\n\nTotal equation:\n\n120y -10y\u00b2 +2160 -216y +18y\u00b2=2000\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(120y -216y) + (-10y\u00b2 +18y\u00b2) +2160 =2000\n\n= -96y +8y\u00b2 +2160 =2000\n\nBring all to left:\n\n8y\u00b2 -96y +2160 -2000=0 \u21d28y\u00b2 -96y +160=0 \u21d2Divide by8:\n\ny\u00b2 -12y +20=0\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=(12 \u00b1\u221a(144 -80))/2=(12 \u00b1\u221a64)/2=(12 \u00b18)/2 \u21d220/2=10 or 4/2=2.\n\nThus, y=10 \u21d2 z=2, so triple (18,10,2). Check if that works:\n\n10*(18*10 +10*2 +18*2) -18*10*2\n\nInside: 180 +20 +36 =236. 236*10=2360. Subtract 360. 2360-360=2000. Yes, that works. So (18,10,2). Permutations: since numbers are distinct, 6 permutations. So that's another set.\n\nWait, but earlier when we considered the case with a zero, we had (20,10,0) etc. Here, (18,10,2) is different. So this is a new solution. So that adds 6 more solutions.\n\nSo now, let's see:\n\nPreviously, we had (15,10,5) \u2192 6 permutations,\n\n(12,10,8) \u21926 permutations,\n\n(18,10,2) \u21926 permutations,\n\nplus the all-10s and the zeros. Let me check another case.\n\nTry x= 20, but that led us to existing solutions. Let me try x= 16. Let me see.\n\nLet me try x=16, then y + z =14. Let me set z=14 - y.\n\nPlug into equation (3):\n\n10[16y + y(14 - y) +16*(14 - y)] -16y*(14 - y)=2000.\n\nInside the brackets:\n\n16y +14y -y\u00b2 +224 -16y = (16y +14y -16y) + (-y\u00b2) +224 =14y -y\u00b2 +224\n\nMultiply by10:140y -10y\u00b2 +2240\n\nSecond term: -16y*(14 - y)= -224y +16y\u00b2\n\nTotal equation:\n\n140y -10y\u00b2 +2240 -224y +16y\u00b2 =2000\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(140y -224y) + (-10y\u00b2 +16y\u00b2) +2240 =2000\n\n= -84y +6y\u00b2 +2240 =2000\n\nBring all to left:\n\n6y\u00b2 -84y +2240 -2000=0 \u21d26y\u00b2 -84y +240=0 \u21d2Divide by6:\n\ny\u00b2 -14y +40=0\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=(14 \u00b1\u221a(196 -160))/2=(14 \u00b1\u221a36)/2=(14 \u00b16)/2 \u21d220/2=10 or 8/2=4.\n\nThus, y=10 \u21d2 z=4, so triple (16,10,4). Check:\n\n10*(16*10 +10*4 +16*4) -16*10*4.\n\nInside: 160 +40 +64=264. 264*10=2640. Subtract 640 \u21d22640-640=2000. Works. So (16,10,4). Permutations: 6 solutions.\n\nAnother set. So that adds another 6.\n\nHmm, so now (16,10,4). Let me see if there's a pattern here. The triples so far with non-zero entries are (15,10,5), (12,10,8), (18,10,2), (16,10,4). Each time, one of the numbers is 10, and the other two add up with 10 to 30. Wait, but 15+10+5=30, 12+10+8=30, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the variables are arranged such that one of them is 10, and the other two add up to 20, but with different distributions?\n\nAlternatively, let me try x= 14. Let me see.\n\nSet x=14, so y + z=16. Let me set z=16 - y.\n\nPlug into equation (3):\n\n10[14y + y(16 - y) +14*(16 - y)] -14y*(16 - y)=2000.\n\nInside brackets:\n\n14y +16y -y\u00b2 +224 -14y = (14y +16y -14y) + (-y\u00b2) +224 =16y -y\u00b2 +224\n\nMultiply by10:160y -10y\u00b2 +2240\n\nSecond term: -14y*(16 - y)= -224y +14y\u00b2\n\nTotal equation:\n\n160y -10y\u00b2 +2240 -224y +14y\u00b2 =2000\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(160y -224y) + (-10y\u00b2 +14y\u00b2) +2240 =2000\n\n= -64y +4y\u00b2 +2240 =2000\n\nBring all to left:\n\n4y\u00b2 -64y +2240 -2000=0 \u21d24y\u00b2 -64y +240=0 \u21d2Divide by4:\n\ny\u00b2 -16y +60=0\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=(16 \u00b1\u221a(256 -240))/2=(16 \u00b1\u221a16)/2=(16\u00b14)/2 \u21d220/2=10 or 12/2=6.\n\nThus, y=10 \u21d2 z=6, so triple (14,10,6). Check:\n\n10*(14*10 +10*6 +14*6) -14*10*6\n\nInside:140 +60 +84=284. 284*10=2840 - 840=2000. Yes. So (14,10,6). 6 permutations.\n\nAnother solution set.\n\nHmm, so this seems like there's a pattern where one variable is 10, and the other two add up to 20. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the triples:\n\n(15,10,5): 15 +5 =20\n\n(12,10,8):12 +8=20\n\n(18,10,2):18 +2=20\n\n(16,10,4):16 +4=20\n\n(14,10,6):14 +6=20\n\nAh, so in each of these triples, two variables add up to 20, and the third is 10. So the variables can be written as (k,10, 20 -k), where k ranges over certain integers. Let me see.\n\nSo in this case, for example, k can be 15,12,18,16,14, etc. So perhaps all triples where one variable is 10, another is k, and third is 20 -k, with k from 2 to 18 in steps?\n\nWait, but let me see. Let me think of this approach.\n\nSuppose one of the variables is 10, say z=10. Then x + y =20. Then the triple is (x, y,10). Let me see what equation (3) gives us in this case.\n\nIf z=10, then equation (3):\n\n10(xy +10y +10x) -10xy =2000.\n\nWait, let me substitute z=10, so x + y=20.\n\nThen Q=xy +10y +10x =xy +10(x + y)=xy +10*20=xy +200.\n\nP= xyz= x y *10=10xy.\n\nThus equation (3) is 10*(xy +200) -10xy =2000 \u21d210xy +2000 -10xy=2000 \u21d22000=2000.\n\nWait, that's an identity? That can't be. Wait, that suggests that if we set z=10, then any x and y such that x + y=20 will satisfy the equation. But that contradicts our earlier findings where only specific x,y satisfy.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check my substitution again.\n\nWait, equation (3) is 10(xy + yz +zx) - xyz=2000.\n\nIf z=10, then:\n\n10(xy +10y +10x) -10xy =2000.\n\nCompute term by term:\n\n10xy +100y +100x -10xy =100y +100x =100(x + y). Since x + y =20, then 100*20=2000. So indeed, 2000=2000. So any x and y with x + y=20 would satisfy the equation when z=10. Therefore, if one variable is 10, then the other two variables can be any pair of nonnegative integers adding to 20. So that gives us infinitely many solutions? But no, since variables must be nonnegative integers, so there are 21 solutions for (x,y) when z=10 (since x can be from 0 to20, y=20 -x). But wait, in our problem, the variables are x,y,z which are nonnegative integers adding to 30. But in this case, z=10, so x + y =20, so x and y can be 0 to20. However, in our earlier examples, when we found (15,10,5), that is x=15,y=5,z=10, which is allowed. Similarly, (20,0,10) is allowed, but that was part of the zero solutions.\n\nWait, so actually, when z=10, any pair (x,y) with x+y=20 gives a solution. So that would be 21 solutions (from x=0 to20). But in our previous examples, we found some of them, but others like (0,20,10), (1,19,10) etc. would also be solutions. However, in the original problem, the variables a,b,c are 10x,10y,10z. Wait, hold on a second. Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, in the substitution, we set a=10x, b=10y, c=10z. So the original variables a,b,c must be multiples of 10? Wait, no, wait, actually, in my substitution earlier, I let a=10x, b=10y, c=10z so that x+y+z=30. But the original variables a,b,c are nonnegative integers. Therefore, x,y,z must be nonnegative integers as well, so a,b,c are multiples of 10. Wait, that's a crucial point!\n\nWait, hold on. The substitution I did earlier was to let a=10x, b=10y, c=10z. So that makes a,b,c multiples of 10. Therefore, the original problem allows a,b,c to be any nonnegative integers, but through this substitution, we're restricting them to multiples of 10. Therefore, this substitution may have missed solutions where a,b,c are not multiples of 10. Wait, but I need to check whether this substitution is valid or not.\n\nWait, the problem states that a,b,c are nonnegative integers. So when I set a=10x, then x must be an integer, but a could be any integer, so x can be fractional? No, x must be integer, so a must be a multiple of 10. Therefore, this substitution reduces the problem to only consider triples where a,b,c are multiples of 10. However, the original problem allows a,b,c to be any nonnegative integers, so this substitution might not capture all solutions, only those where a,b,c are multiples of 10. Therefore, perhaps my earlier approach is flawed?\n\nOh no, that's a problem. Because if I set a=10x, etc., then I might miss solutions where a,b,c are not multiples of 10. So this substitution might have limited the problem unnecessarily. Therefore, perhaps my earlier approach is incorrect. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc =2,000,000. If a,b,c are not multiples of 10, then the terms like ab might not be multiples of 10, but when multiplied by 100, they become multiples of 100, but abc could be not a multiple of 1000, but the right-hand side is 2,000,000, which is divisible by 1000. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that a,b,c are not multiples of 10. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLet me suppose that a,b,c are not multiples of 10. Let me check if the equation can hold.\n\nLet me consider the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc =2,000,000.\n\nSuppose that one of the variables is not a multiple of 10, say a is not divisible by 10. Let me see modulo 10.\n\nCompute the left-hand side modulo 10:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) \u22610 mod10,\n\n-abc mod10. So total left-hand side \u2261 -abc mod10.\n\nThe right-hand side is 2,000,000 \u22610 mod10.\n\nThus, -abc \u22610 mod10 \u21d2 abc\u22610 mod10. So at least one of a,b,c must be divisible by 2 or 5. But since we are considering a not divisible by 10, which is 2\u00d75, then a could be divisible by 2 or 5 but not both. Hmm, but even so, maybe possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's necessary that at least one variable is divisible by 10? Let me see.\n\nWait, let me suppose that none of a,b,c are divisible by 10. Then each of a,b,c must not be divisible by 2 or 5? No, they could be divisible by 2 or 5 but not both. However, the product abc must be divisible by 10. Since abc \u22610 mod10. So at least one of a,b,c must be divisible by 2 and at least one divisible by 5, but not necessarily the same variable. So for example, a divisible by 2, b divisible by5, and neither divisible by 10.\n\nBut then 100(ab + bc + ca) is divisible by 100, and abc divisible by10. Thus, the left-hand side is 100*(something) - abc. Since 100*(something) is divisible by 100, and abc divisible by10 but not necessarily by100, so 100*(something) - abc mod100 would be -abc mod100. Since abc divisible by10, so abc mod100 can be 10,20,...,90, or 100,..., but since abc is divisible by10 but not necessarily 100, so mod100 could be, say, 10,20,...,90. So 100*(...) -abc \u2261 - (abc mod100) mod100. The right-hand side is 2,000,000 mod100=0. Therefore, we require that abc mod100 \u22610. Therefore, abc must be divisible by 100. Therefore, abc must be divisible by 100. So in addition to being divisible by 10, the product must be divisible by 100. So that requires at least two factors of 2 and two factors of 5. So either one variable divisible by 10 and another by 10, or one divisible by 20 and another by5, or other combinations.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe my substitution approach was better, but it only captures solutions where a,b,c are multiples of10. Let me see how many solutions there are under that substitution, and then see if there are other solutions outside of that.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the question is asking for the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c). So if through substitution I found solutions where a,b,c are multiples of10, but there might be other solutions where they are not, but I have to consider them as well. So perhaps my earlier approach was incomplete. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all solutions require a,b,c to be multiples of10. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that a is not a multiple of10. Then, as per above, abc must be divisible by100. So suppose a is divisible by 2 but not 5, and b divisible by 5 but not2, then c must be divisible by 2 to get the second factor of2, but then a and c would both be even, so product divisible by4 and 5, but maybe that's possible. However, the equation may not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's too complicated, and all solutions actually are multiples of10. Let me see.\n\nLooking back at the solutions I found through substitution:\n\nThe solutions where one variable is zero (like (20,10,0)), but wait, in substitution terms, that would be a=200, b=100, c=0. Wait no, wait: Wait, in substitution, a=10x, so if x=20, then a=200. Wait, so the triples in terms of the original variables are (10x,10y,10z). So when we had the solution (x,y,z)=(20,10,0), that corresponds to (a,b,c)=(200,100,0). Similarly, (15,10,5) corresponds to (150,100,50), etc.\n\nBut if all solutions must be multiples of10, then the substitution is valid. But perhaps there are solutions outside of this substitution. Let me test with an example.\n\nSuppose there exists a solution where a=10, b=10, c=300-20=280. Let me see if that works.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na + b + c = 10 +10 +280=300, which is good.\n\nCompute the given equation:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b =100*10=1000,\n\na\u00b2c=100*280=28,000,\n\nb\u00b2a=100*10=1000,\n\nb\u00b2c=100*280=28,000,\n\nc\u00b2a=280\u00b2*10=78,400*10=784,000,\n\nc\u00b2b=280\u00b2*10= same as above? Wait, c\u00b2b= (280)^2 *10= same as c\u00b2a, since a and b are both 10. Wait, no:\n\nWait, c\u00b2a is (280)^2 *10,\n\nc\u00b2b is (280)^2 *10,\n\nso total of those two terms is 2*(280\u00b2 *10).\n\nWait, let me compute all terms:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= a\u00b2(b +c) +b\u00b2(a +c) +c\u00b2(a +b)\n\n=10\u00b2*(10 +280) +10\u00b2*(10 +280) +280\u00b2*(10 +10)\n\n= 100*(290) +100*(290) + (280)^2*(20)\n\n= 29,000 +29,000 + (78,400)*20\n\n=58,000 +1,568,000 =1,626,000\n\nWhich is way larger than 6,000,000. Wait, no, 1,626,000 is less than 6,000,000. Wait, but it's not equal. So that's not a solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another example.\n\nSuppose a=10, b=20, c=270.\n\nThen compute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\n=100*20 +100*270 +400*10 +400*270 + (270)^2*10 + (270)^2*20\n\n=2000 +27,000 +4,000 +108,000 +72,900*10 +72,900*20\n\nWait, this is going to be huge. Probably not equal to 6,000,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a= 20, b=20, c=260.\n\nWait, this might take too long. Alternatively, maybe the substitution approach is valid and all solutions are multiples of10, so the substitution didn't miss any solutions.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc =2,000,000.\n\nSuppose that a,b,c are multiples of10, then the equation is satisfied, but if they are not, then perhaps it's difficult to satisfy. Since when we set variables as multiples of10, we can find solutions, but maybe those are the only solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that all solutions must have a,b,c multiples of10. Therefore, the substitution is valid, and we can proceed with that.\n\nTherefore, proceeding under the assumption that all solutions are multiples of10, so the substitution is valid. So then, the variables x,y,z must be nonnegative integers adding to30, and the equation reduces to 10(xy + yz +zx) -xyz =2000.\n\nEarlier, I found that when one variable is10, the other two can be any pair adding to20, which gives 21 solutions (since x,y can be 0-20). But in the earlier examples, when I set z=10, then (x,y,z)=(20,0,10) was a solution, but also (15,5,10), etc. So those are all valid.\n\nHowever, in the problem statement, the triples (a,b,c) are ordered, so each permutation counts separately, except when variables are equal.\n\nWait, but in the substitution approach, the variables x,y,z correspond to a/10, b/10, c/10. So each solution in x,y,z corresponds to a solution in a,b,c scaled by10. So the number of triples (a,b,c) is the same as the number of triples (x,y,z).\n\nTherefore, to count the number of triples (x,y,z), we need to count all triples of nonnegative integers x,y,z with x+y+z=30, and 10(xy+yz+zx) -xyz=2000.\n\nNow, we found several cases:\n\n1. All variables equal to10: (10,10,10). Only 1 solution.\n\n2. One variable is0, and the other two are20 and10: for example (20,10,0). The number of such solutions: there are 3 choices for which variable is0, and for each, the other two variables can be arranged in 2 ways (since 20 and10 are distinct). So 3*2=6 solutions.\n\n3. One variable is10, and the other two add up to20. The number of solutions here:\n\nIf one variable is fixed as10, say z=10, then x + y =20. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to x + y=20 is21 (from x=0 to20). However, each such solution (x,y,10) is a distinct ordered triple only when considering permutations.\n\nWait, but in terms of unordered triples, but since the problem counts ordered triples, we need to consider all permutations.\n\nWait, actually, if we fix one variable as10, say the third variable is10, then the first two variables can be any pair adding to20, which gives21 ordered pairs (since x and y are ordered). However, when considering all permutations, we have to consider all positions where the 10 can be.\n\nWait, let me think carefully.\n\nSuppose we have triples where one of the variables is10, and the other two add up to20. The total number of ordered triples is as follows:\n\nFor each position of the10 (3 choices), the other two variables can be any pair (a,b) with a + b =20, where a and b are nonnegative integers. For each such pair, the two variables can be arranged in two ways unless a = b. However, since a and b can be zero, but the variables are ordered, so each pair (a,b) where a and b are nonnegative integers adding to20 gives exactly one ordered triple for each arrangement.\n\nWait, actually, for each of the three positions where the10 can be placed, the other two variables can be any ordered pair (x,y) with x + y=20. The number of ordered pairs (x,y) with x + y=20 is21 (since x can be0 to20, y=20\u2212x). So for each of the three positions of the10, there are21 ordered triples. However, this would count triples where two variables are10 as well? Wait, if x=10 and y=10, then the triple would be (10,10,10) if the third variable is also10. But in our current count, we are considering cases where exactly one variable is10 and the other two add to20. But (10,10,10) has all three variables as10, so that case is already counted separately. So to avoid overcounting, when we count the cases with one variable as10, we need to exclude the case where the other two variables are both10. Since x + y=20, if x=10 and y=10, then that's a valid solution, but in that case, the triple would be (10,10,10), which is already counted in the first case. Therefore, when counting the cases with exactly one10, we need to subtract those.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me structure it properly:\n\nTotal number of triples where at least one variable is10 and the other two add to20:\n\n- First, count all triples where one variable is10 and the other two add to20, including those where the other two variables might also be10.\n\n- Then subtract the overcounted cases where more than one variable is10.\n\nBut actually, since we are considering exactly one variable being10, but in the case where two variables are10, that would have been counted twice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute:\n\nNumber of triples with exactly one10 and the other two adding to20: For each of the three positions of10, the other two variables can be any pair (a,b) with a + b=20 and neither a nor b is10. Wait no, actually, even if one of them is10, but then the third variable is already10. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of all triples where one variable is10 and the other two variables add to20, allowing the other two variables to be anything (including10). The total number is 3 *21=63. But among these, the triple (10,10,10) is counted three times (once in each position). So to get the number of triples with exactly one10, we need to subtract 2*(1) for overcounts, but actually, the triple (10,10,10) has three10s, so it was counted three times in the 63, but should be excluded from the \"exactly one10\" count. However, since we are considering all cases where one variable is10 and the other two add to20, even if another variable is10, like (10,10,10) is included here because 10+10=20? Wait no, if one variable is10, then the other two variables add to20, so if another variable is10, the third must be10. So (10,10,10) is indeed included here, because 10+10=20. So in the count of triples with one variable as10 and the other two adding to20, the triple (10,10,10) is counted three times (once for each position of the \"first\"10). So to count the number of distinct triples where exactly one variable is10 and the other two add to20 (but not both10), we need to subtract the overcounts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the total number of triples where one variable is10 and the other two add to20 (regardless of other variables being10), then subtract the cases where two or three variables are10.\n\nWait, but in our case, the equation allows for triples where two variables are10 and the third is10 as well (the all-10 case). So perhaps it's better to separate the counts:\n\nCase1: All three variables are10: 1 triple.\n\nCase2: Exactly two variables are10: Let's see. If two variables are10, then the third must be10 as well because 10+10 + third =30 \u21d2 third=10. So there are no triples with exactly two10s.\n\nCase3: Exactly one variable is10: So the other two variables add to20, and neither is10. The number here is, for each position of the10 (3 choices), the number of ordered pairs (a,b) with a + b=20 and a \u226010, b\u226010. The total pairs where a + b=20 are21. Among them, the pair (10,10) is the only one where both are10, so subtracting that, we have20 pairs where neither is10. However, in ordered pairs, (10,10) is one pair, so the remaining are20. So for each position of the10, there are20 ordered pairs, so total 3\u00d720=60.\n\nCase4: No variables are10: Then, all three variables are different from10. But earlier, we found solutions like (15,10,5) but that has a10. Wait no, in this case, if no variables are10, then they must add to30 and satisfy the equation. But earlier solutions like (15,10,5) include a10, so they are excluded from this case. So need to see if there are solutions with no variables equal to10.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered (x,y,z)=(15,10,5), that has a10, so it's in case3. If there are solutions with none of the variables being10, then those would be in case4. Let me see if such solutions exist.\n\nSuppose none of x,y,z is10. Let me try to find such a solution.\n\nSuppose x=14, y=6, z=10. Wait, but that has a10. Let me try x=12, y=8, z=10 again, which has a10. Hmm, how about x=16, y=4, z=10. Also has a10.\n\nWait, let me try to find a solution where none of the variables is10.\n\nLet me suppose x=5, y=5, z=20. Then check equation (3):\n\n10*(5*5 +5*20 +5*20) -5*5*20 =10*(25+100+100) -500=10*225 -500=2250-500=1750\u22602000. Not good.\n\nHow about x=18, y=2, z=10, which is in case3.\n\nWhat about x=13, y=7, z=10? Still has a10.\n\nHmm, maybe there are no solutions where none of the variables is10. Let me see.\n\nSuppose all variables are different from10. Let me assume that x,y,z are all different from10 and see if the equation can hold.\n\nLet me suppose that x,y,z are all different from10. Let me try to find such a solution.\n\nLet me pick x=15, y=5, z=10. But z=10 is not allowed here. So set z= something else.\n\nLet me try x=12, y=8, z=10. Again has a10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x=14, y=6, z=10. Still has a10.\n\nWait, maybe it's impossible. Let me see.\n\nSuppose none of x,y,z is10. Then, we need to solve:\n\nx + y + z =30,\n\n10(xy + yz +zx) -xyz =2000.\n\nLet me see if such a solution exists.\n\nLet me assume variables are x,y,z \u226010.\n\nLet me try x=16, y=9, z=5. Then sum is30.\n\nCompute equation:\n\n10*(16*9 +9*5 +16*5) -16*9*5.\n\nFirst compute terms inside:\n\n16*9=144, 9*5=45,16*5=80. Sum:144+45+80=269. Multiply by10:2690.\n\nSubtract 16*9*5=720. 2690-720=1970\u22602000.\n\nClose but no.\n\nTry x=17, y=8, z=5. Sum30.\n\nCompute:\n\n10*(17*8 +8*5 +17*5)=10*(136+40+85)=10*(261)=2610.\n\nSubtract 17*8*5=680. 2610-680=1930.\n\nNot enough.\n\nTry x=19, y=6, z=5.\n\nSum30.\n\n10*(19*6 +6*5 +19*5)=10*(114 +30 +95)=10*(239)=2390.\n\nSubtract 19*6*5=570. 2390-570=1820.\n\nHmm.\n\nTry x=14, y=7, z=9.\n\nSum30.\n\n10*(14*7 +7*9 +14*9)=10*(98 +63 +126)=10*(287)=2870.\n\nSubtract 14*7*9=882. 2870-882=1988. Close.\n\nHmm.\n\nTrying x=13, y=7, z=10 (but z=10 is not allowed).\n\nHmm, maybe it's difficult to find such a solution, suggesting that maybe there are no solutions where none of the variables is10. Let me try another approach.\n\nSuppose that none of x,y,z is10. Then, since x+y+z=30, and each variable is at least0, but not10.\n\nLet me see if we can rewrite the equation 10(xy + yz +zx) -xyz =2000.\n\nLet me rearrange it as:\n\nxyz -10(xy + yz +zx) +2000 =0.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume variables are in arithmetic progression or something.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if none of the variables is10, then perhaps the equation can't be satisfied. Given that all the solutions I found so far have at least one variable as10, perhaps that is indeed the case.\n\nTherefore, proceeding under the assumption that all solutions have at least one variable equal to10. So then the total number of triples is:\n\nCase1: All variables10:1.\n\nCase2: Exactly one variable10 and the other two add to20:60.\n\nCase3: One variable0 and the other two are20 and10:6.\n\nWait, but wait, in case2, when exactly one variable is10, the other two add to20. The triples where one variable is0 and the other two are20 and10 are included in case2? Because if one variable is0, then the other two variables are20 and10, so one of them is10 and the other is20, so the third variable (the0) is not10. Therefore, those triples are included in case2. Wait, but in case2, we considered exactly one variable is10, but in the case where one variable is0 and the others are20 and10, there is exactly one variable10, so those are included in case2's count of60. But earlier I thought case2 was60, but case3 was6, but actually case3 is part of case2. Therefore, I made a mistake in separating them.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe cases are:\n\n1. All variables10:1.\n\n2. Exactly one variable10 and the other two add to20 (including cases where one of them is0): the count is3*(21 -1)=3*20=60? Wait, no, earlier analysis said that for each position of10, there are21 ordered pairs (a,b) where a + b=20. Among those, the pair (10,10) would lead to three10s, so for each position, the number of triples with exactly one10 is21 -1 (excluding the (10,10) case), so 20 per position, totaling 3\u00d720=60. The remaining triples where one variable is10 and the other two include a10 are the all10s case, which is counted three times in the initial 3\u00d721 count, but we subtract those to get60 for exactly one10. Therefore, the triples where one variable is0 and others are20 and10 are included in the exactly one10 case. So the6 solutions I thought of earlier (with a zero) are part of the60.\n\nTherefore, total solutions are case1 + case2=1+60=61.\n\nWait, but previously I found other triples like (15,10,5) which are in case2, and (12,10,8), etc. So the total number would be61. But wait, let me confirm:\n\nThe equation with x,y,z:\n\nTotal solutions are:\n\n- 1 solution where all are10.\n\n- For each of the three positions of the10, there are20 ordered pairs (a,b) where a + b=20 and neither a nor b is10. Wait, but actually, when you fix one variable as10, say x=10, then y and z must add to20. The number of ordered pairs (y,z) with y + z=20 is21. Among these, the pair (10,10) would give the triple (10,10,10). So to count exactly one10, we subtract that one case, so20 per position. So total of3\u00d720=60.\n\nThus, total solutions are61.\n\nBut wait, let me think of the triples where one variable is0:\n\nFor example, (20,10,0). Here, one variable is10, another is20, and the third is0. This is counted in case2 (exactly one10). Similarly, (10,20,0) is another, etc. So all such triples are part of the60.\n\nThus, the total number of triples (x,y,z) is61, so the number of triples (a,b,c) is also61, since they are in bijection via scaling.\n\nWait, but in the substitution, a=10x, so each solution (x,y,z) corresponds to exactly one (a,b,c). So the total number is61.\n\nWait but let me verify with the examples I found earlier:\n\n- The all-10 case:1.\n\n- The triples with exactly one10 and the other two adding to20 (including zeros):\n\nFor example, (20,10,0) is counted in the60.\n\nSimilarly, (15,10,5) is counted there,\n\n(12,10,8),\n\n(18,10,2),\n\n(16,10,4),\n\n(14,10,6),\n\nand their permutations.\n\nEach of these permutations is counted in the60.\n\nTherefore, total61.\n\nBut let me check the count again:\n\nTotal solutions for (x,y,z):\n\n- 1 triple with all10s.\n\n- For each of the three variables being the one that's10, there are20 possibilities for the other two numbers (since they can be any pair adding to20 except (10,10)), so 3\u00d720=60.\n\nTotal is61.\n\nTherefore, the number of triples (x,y,z) is61, so the number of triples (a,b,c) is also61. However, let me confirm with an example count.\n\nLet me consider the triples where one variable is10 and the other two are (0,20):\n\nThere are3 positions for the10, and for each, two permutations (since (0,20) and (20,0)), but since the variables are ordered, each of the three positions with the10 gives two ordered triples except when the other two are0 and20. Wait, no, actually, when the non-10 variables are0 and20, there are two orderings for each position of the10. For example, if the10 is in the first position, the other two can be (0,20) or (20,0). So for each of the three positions of the10, there are2 ordered triples where the other two are0 and20. So that's6 triples, which matches the earlier count of the zero cases.\n\nSimilarly, for the pair (5,15), there are two orderings for each position of the10, so 3\u00d72=6 triples.\n\nSimilarly for all other pairs except (10,10).\n\nTherefore, the total is indeed61.\n\nWait but let me confirm with another angle.\n\nThe equation in x,y,z is symmetric, so the total number of ordered triples is equal to the number of ordered triples with x+y+z=30 and 10(xy+yz+zx)\u2212xyz=2000.\n\nWe can also think of the solutions as:\n\n- 1 solution with (10,10,10).\n\n- For each permutation of (a,b,c) where one is10, one isk, and one is20\u2212k, where k ranges from0 to20 except10.\n\nWait, for each k from0 to20 except10, there are6 permutations (since three positions for the10, and two for the other two numbers unless they are equal).\n\nWait, actually, when k=0, the numbers are10,0,20, which are all distinct, so there are6 permutations.\n\nWhen k=20, same as k=0, since20\u221220=0.\n\nWhen k=5 and20\u2212k=15, they are distinct, so6 permutations each.\n\nSimilarly for k=8 and12, etc.\n\nExcept when k=10, which would give (10,10,10), which is already counted.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions with exactly one10 is:\n\nFor each k from0 to20 excluding10:\n\nFor each k (0 to20 except10), the triplet is (10,k,20\u2212k). However, when k=10, it's the all10s case. For other k, each pair (k,20\u2212k) is unique except when k=10. For each such k, the number of ordered triples is6 unless k=20\u2212k \u21d2k=10, but we already excluded that.\n\nWait, but when k=0, it's (10,0,20), which has two zeros? No, only one zero. Each triplet with distinct elements has6 permutations. So for each k from0 to20 excluding10 and excluding the duplicates where k>20\u2212k (to avoid double-counting). Wait, actually, since k ranges from0 to20, each pair (k,20\u2212k) is unique for each k, so there are21 terms (from0 to20), but excluding k=10 (which gives (10,10)), so20 terms. Each of these corresponds to a distinct unordered triplet, each of which has6 ordered permutations except when the two non-10 numbers are equal.\n\nWait, when are the two non-10 numbers equal? When k=20\u2212k \u21d2k=10. Which is excluded. So all other k give distinct pairs, so each unordered triplet has6 permutations.\n\nThus, the number of ordered triples is20\u00d76=120. Wait, but that contradicts previous count of60.\n\nHmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, this approach says:\n\nFor each k from0 to20 except10:\n\n- The triplet (10, k, 20\u2212k) where k\u226010.\n\nEach of these corresponds to an unordered triplet with elements10, k, and20\u2212k. Since k can be from0 to20 excluding10, there are20 such k.\n\nEach unordered triplet has6 permutations unless two elements are equal. Since k\u226020\u2212k (except whenk=10), so all these triplets have three distinct elements except when k=10. So each of the20 k gives an unordered triplet with three distinct elements, so each has6 permutations. Thus total is20\u00d76=120. But this contradicts the previous count of60.\n\nWhere is the mistake?\n\nAh! Because when I fix one variable as10, the other two arek and20\u2212k, but varying the position of the10. Wait, no, the above approach counts all permutations, so if I consider all ordered triples where one element is10 and the other two add to20, then it's indeed:\n\nFor each of the three positions of the10:\n\n- The other two elements can be any pair (a,b) witha +b=20. The number of ordered pairs (a,b) is21 (from a=0 tob=20).\n\nThus, total is3\u00d721=63 ordered triples. Among these, the triplet (10,10,10) is counted three times (once for each position of the10). So subtract2 duplicates to get1 triplet counted once, so total is63\u22122\u00d71=61? Wait, no.\n\nActually, the triplet (10,10,10) is counted three times in the63. To count the number of distinct ordered triples with at least one10 and the other two adding to20:\n\nTotal is63, but subtract the overcounts of the all-10 case which was counted three times but should only be counted once. So total is63\u22122=61. Which matches the previous count.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ordered triples (x,y,z) is indeed61.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be61. But wait, let me confirm once more:\n\nTotal solutions:\n\n- 1 all-10.\n\n- The rest are the60 with exactly one10 and the other two adding to20 (including zeros). So total61.\n\nTherefore, the number of triples (a,b,c) is61, since each corresponds to exactly one (x,y,z).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is61. But let me check with some examples.\n\nEarlier, I found:\n\n- The all-10:1.\n\n- The (20,10,0) and permutations:6.\n\n- The (15,10,5) and permutations:6.\n\n- The (12,10,8) and permutations:6.\n\n- The (18,10,2) and permutations:6.\n\n- The (16,10,4) and permutations:6.\n\n- The (14,10,6) and permutations:6.\n\nTotal so far:1 +6+6+6+6+6+6= 1 + 6\u00d76=1+36=37. But this is missing many more.\n\nWait, perhaps my enumeration was incomplete. For example, for k=1 to19 (excluding10), each gives6 permutations, so19\u00d76=114, plus the all-10: total115? No, no, I must be mixing up.\n\nAlternatively, the correct total is61 as per the systematic count. So I should trust that.\n\nThus, the answer is61, so boxed:\n\n\\boxed{61}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{61}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b equals 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note that the problem is about finding nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: their sum is 300 and their \"cross terms\" (the expression given) sum up to 6,000,000. Since they are nonnegative integers, each of a, b, c has to be 0 or a positive integer, but their total is fixed at 300.\n\nLet me start by trying to simplify the given equation. The expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b looks a bit complicated, but maybe there's a way to factor it or relate it to other expressions involving a, b, and c. Let me see.\n\nI recall that sometimes when dealing with symmetric expressions in variables, it helps to use symmetric sums or other known identities. Let me try to see if this expression can be rewritten in terms of the sum a + b + c and the pairwise products or something else.\n\nLet me note that the given expression is:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\nHmm, this can be grouped as:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nSince each term like a\u00b2 is multiplied by the sum of the other two variables. Since we know that a + b + c = 300, then for each term, say a\u00b2(b + c), since b + c = 300 - a, so substituting that in:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c)\n\nTherefore, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\u03a3_{cyc} a\u00b2(300 - a) = 300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3)\n\nSo the given equation is:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that's a good start. Let's write that down:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000. --- (1)\n\nAlso, we know that a + b + c = 300. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300. Maybe I can use some known identities involving sums of squares and cubes.\n\nRecall that (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). So we can express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 in terms of S and the pairwise products:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 300\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nSimilarly, there's an identity for the sum of cubes:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.\n\nSo substituting that into equation (1):\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - [ (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc ] = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me substitute S = 300, so:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - [300^3 - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step. First, let's expand the terms:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - 300^3 + 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nNow, let's substitute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 from the earlier equation:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 300\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca). Therefore,\n\n300*(300\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) - 300^3 + 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 300*(300\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) = 300^3 - 600*(ab + bc + ca)\n\nSecond term: -300^3\n\nThird term: +3*300*(ab + bc + ca) = +900*(ab + bc + ca)\n\nFourth term: -3abc\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\n[300^3 - 600*(ab + bc + ca)] - 300^3 + [900*(ab + bc + ca)] - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n300^3 - 300^3 cancels out.\n\n-600*(ab + bc + ca) + 900*(ab + bc + ca) = 300*(ab + bc + ca)\n\nThen the remaining terms are:\n\n300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n\n300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 3 to simplify:\n\n100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so we now have:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000. --- (2)\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to solving equations (a + b + c = 300) and (100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000) with a, b, c nonnegative integers.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit more manageable. Let me see if I can find some substitutions or ways to approach this.\n\nLet me denote variables as follows: Let\u2019s let S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ca. Then equation (2) becomes 100Q - P = 2,000,000. So P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nBut we also know that for three variables, there is the relation between S, Q, and the sum of squares. Let me recall that:\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\n\nSo, since S = 300,\n\n300\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2Q => a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 90000 - 2Q.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of other relations. Alternatively, perhaps express variables in terms of each other?\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that if two variables are equal? Since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps the solutions have some symmetry. Maybe assuming two variables are equal, or one is zero?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables as x, y, z where one is expressed in terms of the other two. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000. Let me see if I can find a relation between Q and P.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of variables as being multiples of some number. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps trying small cases or looking for possible substitutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of variables a, b, c as being multiples of 10? Since the equation involves 100 and 2,000,000, which are multiples of 100. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that a = 10x, b = 10y, c = 10z, so that x, y, z are nonnegative integers. Then:\n\na + b + c = 10(x + y + z) = 300 \u21d2 x + y + z = 30.\n\nThen Q = ab + bc + ca = 100(xy + yz + zx).\n\nSimilarly, P = abc = 1000xyz.\n\nSubstituting into equation (2):\n\n100*(100(xy + yz + zx)) - 1000xyz = 2,000,000\n\nCompute each term:\n\n100*100*(xy + yz + zx) = 10,000*(xy + yz + zx)\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n10,000*(xy + yz + zx) - 1000xyz = 2,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 1000:\n\n10*(xy + yz + zx) - xyz = 2000.\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n10(xy + yz + zx) - xyz = 2000. --- (3)\n\nAnd x + y + z = 30. --- (4)\n\nSo now the problem reduces to finding triples (x, y, z) of nonnegative integers with x + y + z = 30 and 10(xy + yz + zx) - xyz = 2000.\n\nThis seems more manageable. Maybe this substitution was helpful. Let me see.\n\nNow, since x, y, z are nonnegative integers, perhaps I can try to find possible triples (x, y, z) that satisfy these two equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use substitution here. Let me see if we can manipulate equation (3).\n\nLet me rearrange equation (3):\n\nxyz - 10(xy + yz + zx) + 2000 = 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor this equation? Not sure yet. Alternatively, let me think of variables in terms of symmetry again.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that if one of the variables is zero. Suppose, say, z = 0. Then equation (3) becomes 10(xy + 0 + 0) - 0 = 10xy = 2000 \u21d2 xy = 200. But then x + y = 30 (since z=0). So solving x + y =30 and xy = 200. The solutions would be roots of t^2 -30t +200 =0. The discriminant is 900 -800=100, so roots (30 \u00b110)/2 = 20 or 10. So (x,y) = (20,10) or (10,20). Therefore, with z=0, we have triples (20,10,0), (10,20,0), and permutations. So that would be 3 permutations (since z can be any of the three variables). Wait, but in this case, z is fixed as 0, so the triples would be (20,10,0), (10,20,0), (20,0,10), (10,0,20), (0,20,10), (0,10,20). So total of 6 solutions here? Wait, but actually, if z=0, then x and y are 20 and10, so there are three positions where the zero can be. For each position, there are two permutations (since x and y can be swapped). So 3 * 2 =6 solutions here. Hmm, so that's one set of solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are solutions where none of the variables are zero. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that maybe two variables are equal, so let me suppose x = y. Then, since x + y + z =30, then z =30 -2x. Then substituting into equation (3):\n\n10(x^2 + 2xz) -x^2 z =2000\n\nBut z =30 -2x, so substitute:\n\n10(x\u00b2 + 2x(30 -2x)) -x\u00b2(30 -2x) = 2000\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term inside the 10:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2x(30 -2x) = x\u00b2 +60x -4x\u00b2 = -3x\u00b2 +60x\n\nMultiply by 10: 10*(-3x\u00b2 +60x)= -30x\u00b2 +600x\n\nSecond term: -x\u00b2(30 -2x) = -30x\u00b2 +2x\u00b3\n\nTherefore total equation:\n\n-30x\u00b2 +600x -30x\u00b2 +2x\u00b3 =2000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x\u00b3 -60x\u00b2 +600x -2000 =0\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx\u00b3 -30x\u00b2 +300x -1000 =0\n\nHmm, let's see if this cubic can be factored. Let's try possible integer roots. The possible roots are divisors of 1000, so \u00b11, \u00b12, ..., \u00b11000. Let me try x=10:\n\n10\u00b3 -30*(10)^2 +300*10 -1000 = 1000 - 3000 + 3000 -1000 = 0. Hey, that works! So x=10 is a root.\n\nTherefore, we can factor (x -10)(quadratic) = x\u00b3 -30x\u00b2 +300x -1000.\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or factorization. Since (x-10) is a factor:\n\nDivide x\u00b3 -30x\u00b2 +300x -1000 by (x-10):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n10 | 1  -30   300   -1000\n\n          10  -200   1000\n\n      1  -20   100      0\n\nSo the quadratic is x\u00b2 -20x +100. Therefore,\n\nx\u00b3 -30x\u00b2 +300x -1000 = (x -10)(x\u00b2 -20x +100)\n\nNow, set to zero:\n\n(x -10)(x\u00b2 -20x +100)=0\n\nThe quadratic equation x\u00b2 -20x +100 =0 has discriminant 400 -400 =0, so x=(20)/2=10, so double root at 10. Wait, no: discriminant is 20\u00b2 -4*1*100 =400-400=0, so yes, x=10 is a double root. Wait, so actually the cubic factors as (x -10)^3 =0? Wait, no, wait. Wait (x -10)(x\u00b2 -20x +100) is (x -10)[(x)^2 -20x +100]. But x\u00b2 -20x +100 factors as (x -10)^2? Let me check (x -10)^2 =x\u00b2 -20x +100. Yes! So actually, the cubic factors as (x -10)^3 =0. Therefore, the equation is (x -10)^3 =0, so x=10 is the only real root, with multiplicity three.\n\nTherefore, when x = y =10, then z =30 -2x =30 -20 =10. So z=10. Therefore, the triple (x,y,z) = (10,10,10). So that's another solution where all variables are equal to 10. Let me check if this satisfies equation (3):\n\n10*(10*10 +10*10 +10*10) -10*10*10 =10*(300) -1000 =3000 -1000=2000. Yes, that works. So (10,10,10) is a solution. Since all variables are equal, this is only one unique solution (since permutations are the same in this case). So that's another solution.\n\nTherefore, when we assumed two variables are equal, we found that (10,10,10) is a solution, and also when one variable is zero, we get six solutions. Are there other solutions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are solutions where none of the variables are equal, and none are zero. Let me see.\n\nSuppose all variables are positive integers, and not all equal. Let me see if we can find such solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can let variables be in terms of x, y, z and try to set up equations. Let me think of variables as x, y, z with x + y + z =30 and 10(xy + yz + zx) - xyz =2000. Let me see if there are other integer solutions here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use substitution. Let me suppose z =30 -x -y, then substitute into the equation.\n\nLet me set z =30 -x -y, so substituting into equation (3):\n\n10[xy + y(30 -x -y) + x(30 -x -y)] - x y (30 -x -y) =2000.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the terms inside the brackets:\n\nxy + y(30 -x -y) + x(30 -x -y)\n\n= xy + 30y -xy - y\u00b2 +30x -x\u00b2 -xy\n\nWait, let me expand term by term:\n\nFirst term: xy\n\nSecond term: y*(30 -x -y) =30y -xy - y\u00b2\n\nThird term: x*(30 -x -y)=30x -x\u00b2 -xy\n\nAdding all together:\n\nxy + [30y -xy - y\u00b2] + [30x -x\u00b2 -xy]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nxy -xy -xy = -xy\n\n30y +30x remains.\n\nThen - y\u00b2 -x\u00b2\n\nSo total:\n\n30x +30y -xy -x\u00b2 -y\u00b2\n\nTherefore, the expression inside the brackets is 30x +30y -xy -x\u00b2 -y\u00b2.\n\nSo equation (3) becomes:\n\n10*(30x +30y -xy -x\u00b2 -y\u00b2) - x y (30 -x -y) =2000\n\nLet me expand the second term:\n\n- x y (30 -x -y) = -30xy +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2\n\nTherefore, putting all together:\n\n10*(30x +30y -xy -x\u00b2 -y\u00b2) + (-30xy +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2) =2000\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst part:\n\n10*(30x) =300x\n\n10*(30y)=300y\n\n10*(-xy)= -10xy\n\n10*(-x\u00b2)= -10x\u00b2\n\n10*(-y\u00b2)= -10y\u00b2\n\nSecond part:\n\n-30xy +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\n300x +300y -10xy -10x\u00b2 -10y\u00b2 -30xy +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2 =2000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n300x + 300y\n\nFor the xy terms: -10xy -30xy = -40xy\n\nFor x\u00b2 terms: -10x\u00b2 +x\u00b2 y\n\nFor y\u00b2 terms: -10y\u00b2 +x y\u00b2\n\nAlso, the cross terms x\u00b2 y and x y\u00b2.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the best. Let me see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that since x, y, z are positive integers adding to 30, perhaps trying small numbers or looking for patterns. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the equation 10(xy + yz + zx) - xyz =2000. Let me rearrange it as:\n\nxyz -10(xy + yz + zx) = -2000.\n\nHmm, maybe factor something here. Let me see. Let me add 1000 to both sides:\n\nxyz -10(xy + yz + zx) + 1000 = -1000.\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps consider introducing variables like u = x -10, v = y -10, w = z -10, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that variables are all 10, which we already found. Let me see if there are other triples. Let me try some examples.\n\nSuppose one of the variables is 20. Let me suppose x=20. Then since x + y + z =30, then y + z=10. Let me set variables as x=20, y + z=10. Let me compute equation (3):\n\n10(xy + y z +20 z) -20 y z =2000.\n\nWait, let me substitute x=20, so z=10 - y.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n10[20y + y(10 - y) +20(10 - y)] -20 y (10 - y) =2000.\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term inside the brackets:\n\n20y + y(10 - y) +20(10 - y)\n\n=20y +10y - y\u00b2 +200 -20y\n\n= (20y +10y -20y) + (-y\u00b2) +200\n\n=10y - y\u00b2 +200\n\nMultiply by 10:\n\n10*(10y - y\u00b2 +200) =100y -10y\u00b2 +2000\n\nSecond term: -20y(10 - y) = -200y +20y\u00b2\n\nSo total equation:\n\n(100y -10y\u00b2 +2000) + (-200y +20y\u00b2) =2000\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n(100y -200y) + (-10y\u00b2 +20y\u00b2) +2000 =2000\n\n= (-100y) +10y\u00b2 +2000 =2000\n\nSubtract 2000 both sides:\n\n-100y +10y\u00b2 =0 \u21d2 10y\u00b2 -100y =0 \u21d210y(y -10)=0 \u21d2 y=0 or y=10.\n\nIf y=0, then z=10, so triple (20,0,10). Which we already considered when one variable is zero. So that's one of the previous solutions.\n\nIf y=10, then z=0, so triple (20,10,0), which is again already considered. So that's the same as before.\n\nHmm, so no new solutions here.\n\nWhat if we try x=15. Let me try x=15. Then y + z=15. Let me set z=15 - y. Substitute into equation (3):\n\n10[15y + y(15 - y) +15(15 - y)] -15 y (15 - y) =2000.\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n15y + y(15 - y) +15*(15 - y)\n\n=15y +15y -y\u00b2 +225 -15y\n\n= (15y +15y -15y) + (-y\u00b2) +225\n\n=15y - y\u00b2 +225\n\nMultiply by 10:\n\n10*(15y - y\u00b2 +225) =150y -10y\u00b2 +2250\n\nSecond term: -15y(15 - y) =-225y +15y\u00b2\n\nThus total equation:\n\n150y -10y\u00b2 +2250 -225y +15y\u00b2 =2000\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(150y -225y) + (-10y\u00b2 +15y\u00b2) +2250 =2000\n\n= (-75y) +5y\u00b2 +2250 =2000\n\nBring all to left:\n\n5y\u00b2 -75y +2250 -2000 =0 \u21d25y\u00b2 -75y +250=0\n\nDivide by 5:\n\ny\u00b2 -15y +50=0\n\nSolutions:\n\ny = [15 \u00b1\u221a(225 -200)]/2 = [15 \u00b1\u221a25]/2 = [15 \u00b15]/2 \u21d2 y=(20)/2=10 or y=(10)/2=5.\n\nThus, if y=10, then z=15 -10=5. So triple (15,10,5). Let me check if this satisfies equation (3):\n\nCompute 10*(15*10 +10*5 +15*5) -15*10*5\n\nFirst compute the terms inside:\n\n15*10=150, 10*5=50, 15*5=75. Sum:150+50+75=275. Multiply by10: 2750.\n\nThen subtract 15*10*5=750. So total is 2750 -750=2000. Yes, that works. So (15,10,5) is a solution. Now, since variables are nonnegative integers, permutations of this would also be solutions.\n\nWait, so here we have a new solution where all variables are non-zero and not all equal. So that's a new solution.\n\nSo, for x=15, y=10, z=5, which sum to 30. Then the permutations of (15,10,5) would be all the permutations. Since all three numbers are distinct, the number of permutations is 3! =6. So that's 6 more solutions.\n\nWait, so now we have:\n\n- The solutions with a zero: 6 (from when one variable is 0, leading to 20,10,0 etc.)\n\n- The solution with all variables 10: 1 (since (10,10,10))\n\n- The solution with (15,10,5): 6 permutations.\n\nSo total so far: 6 +1 +6=13. But maybe there are more?\n\nLet me check if there are other triples. Let me try another value. Let me try x=25. Then y + z =5. Let me see:\n\nSet x=25, so z=5 - y. Then plug into equation (3):\n\n10[25y + y(5 - y) +25(5 - y)] -25y(5 - y)=2000.\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n25y +5y - y\u00b2 +125 -25y = (25y +5y -25y) + (-y\u00b2) +125 =5y - y\u00b2 +125\n\nMultiply by10: 50y -10y\u00b2 +1250\n\nSecond term: -25y(5 - y) = -125y +25y\u00b2\n\nTotal equation:\n\n50y -10y\u00b2 +1250 -125y +25y\u00b2 =2000\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(50y -125y) + (-10y\u00b2 +25y\u00b2) +1250 =2000\n\n= (-75y) +15y\u00b2 +1250 =2000\n\nBring all to left:\n\n15y\u00b2 -75y +1250 -2000=0 \u21d215y\u00b2 -75y -750=0\n\nDivide by 15:\n\ny\u00b2 -5y -50 =0\n\nDiscriminant:25 +200=225 \u21d2 y=(5 \u00b115)/2\n\nThus y=(20)/2=10 or y=(-10)/2=-5. Since y must be nonnegative, y=10. Then z=5 -10= -5. Which is invalid. So no solution here.\n\nHmm, so no solution here. So x=25 doesn't give a valid solution.\n\nHow about x=5. Let me try x=5. Then y + z=25. Let me set z=25 - y.\n\nPlugging into equation (3):\n\n10[5y + y(25 - y) +5(25 - y)] -5y(25 - y)=2000.\n\nCompute inside brackets:\n\n5y +25y -y\u00b2 +125 -5y = (5y +25y -5y) + (-y\u00b2) +125 =25y - y\u00b2 +125\n\nMultiply by10:250y -10y\u00b2 +1250\n\nSecond term: -5y(25 - y)= -125y +5y\u00b2\n\nTotal equation:\n\n250y -10y\u00b2 +1250 -125y +5y\u00b2 =2000\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(250y -125y) + (-10y\u00b2 +5y\u00b2) +1250 =2000\n\n=125y -5y\u00b2 +1250 =2000\n\nBring all to left:\n\n-5y\u00b2 +125y +1250 -2000=0 \u21d2-5y\u00b2 +125y -750=0\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\n5y\u00b2 -125y +750=0 \u21d2Divide by 5:\n\ny\u00b2 -25y +150=0\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=(25 \u00b1\u221a(625 -600))/2 = (25 \u00b1\u221a25)/2 = (25 \u00b15)/2 \u21d215 or 10.\n\nThus, if y=15, then z=25 -15=10. So triple (5,15,10). Which is the same as (15,10,5) just reordered. Similarly, y=10 gives z=15, so (5,10,15). So permutations again. So nothing new here.\n\nHow about x=12. Let me try x=12. Then y + z=18. Let me pick y= something. Let me see:\n\nSet x=12, so z=18 - y.\n\nPlug into equation (3):\n\n10[12y + y(18 - y) +12*(18 - y)] -12y(18 - y)=2000.\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n12y +18y -y\u00b2 +216 -12y = (12y +18y -12y) + (-y\u00b2) +216 =18y - y\u00b2 +216\n\nMultiply by10:180y -10y\u00b2 +2160\n\nSecond term: -12y(18 - y)= -216y +12y\u00b2\n\nTotal equation:\n\n180y -10y\u00b2 +2160 -216y +12y\u00b2 =2000\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(180y -216y) + (-10y\u00b2 +12y\u00b2) +2160 =2000\n\n= (-36y) +2y\u00b2 +2160 =2000\n\nBring all to left:\n\n2y\u00b2 -36y +2160 -2000=0 \u21d22y\u00b2 -36y +160=0 \u21d2Divide by 2:\n\ny\u00b2 -18y +80=0\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=(18 \u00b1\u221a(324 -320))/2=(18 \u00b12)/2=20/2=10 or 16/2=8.\n\nThus y=10 \u21d2 z=8, so triple (12,10,8). Let me check this:\n\nCompute 10*(12*10 +10*8 +12*8) -12*10*8\n\nInside the brackets: 120 +80 +96=296. 296*10=2960. Subtract 12*10*8=960. 2960-960=2000. Yes, that works. So (12,10,8) is another solution. So permutations of (12,10,8). Since all three numbers are distinct, there are 6 permutations. So that's another 6 solutions.\n\nHmm, so that adds more solutions. So now we have (12,10,8). Let me see if there are more such triples.\n\nWait, let me check if (12,10,8) is a valid solution. Yes, as above. So now, that's another set. Let me see if there are other triples.\n\nLet me try x=8. Let me see x=8, so y + z=22. Let me set z=22 - y.\n\nPlugging into equation (3):\n\n10[8y + y(22 - y) +8*(22 - y)] -8y*(22 - y)=2000.\n\nInside the brackets:\n\n8y +22y -y\u00b2 +176 -8y = (8y +22y -8y) + (-y\u00b2) +176 =22y - y\u00b2 +176\n\nMultiply by10:220y -10y\u00b2 +1760\n\nSecond term: -8y*(22 - y)= -176y +8y\u00b2\n\nTotal equation:\n\n220y -10y\u00b2 +1760 -176y +8y\u00b2=2000\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(220y -176y) + (-10y\u00b2 +8y\u00b2) +1760 =2000\n\n=44y -2y\u00b2 +1760 =2000\n\nBring all to left:\n\n-2y\u00b2 +44y +1760 -2000 =0 \u21d2-2y\u00b2 +44y -240=0 \u21d2Multiply by -1:\n\n2y\u00b2 -44y +240=0 \u21d2Divide by 2:\n\ny\u00b2 -22y +120=0\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=(22 \u00b1\u221a(484 -480))/2=(22 \u00b12)/2=24/2=12 or 20/2=10.\n\nThus, y=12 \u21d2 z=10, so (8,12,10). Which is same as (12,10,8) permuted. y=10 \u21d2 z=12, so (8,10,12). Same again.\n\nSo that's the same solution as before.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that (12,10,8) is another solution. Let me see if there are more such triples.\n\nLet me try x=18. Let me try x=18, so y + z=12. Let me set z=12 - y.\n\nPlug into equation (3):\n\n10[18y + y(12 - y) +18*(12 - y)] -18y*(12 - y)=2000.\n\nInside the brackets:\n\n18y +12y -y\u00b2 +216 -18y = (18y +12y -18y) + (-y\u00b2) +216 =12y -y\u00b2 +216\n\nMultiply by10:120y -10y\u00b2 +2160\n\nSecond term: -18y*(12 - y)= -216y +18y\u00b2\n\nTotal equation:\n\n120y -10y\u00b2 +2160 -216y +18y\u00b2=2000\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(120y -216y) + (-10y\u00b2 +18y\u00b2) +2160 =2000\n\n= -96y +8y\u00b2 +2160 =2000\n\nBring all to left:\n\n8y\u00b2 -96y +2160 -2000=0 \u21d28y\u00b2 -96y +160=0 \u21d2Divide by8:\n\ny\u00b2 -12y +20=0\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=(12 \u00b1\u221a(144 -80))/2=(12 \u00b1\u221a64)/2=(12 \u00b18)/2 \u21d220/2=10 or 4/2=2.\n\nThus, y=10 \u21d2 z=2, so triple (18,10,2). Check if that works:\n\n10*(18*10 +10*2 +18*2) -18*10*2\n\nInside: 180 +20 +36 =236. 236*10=2360. Subtract 360. 2360-360=2000. Yes, that works. So (18,10,2). Permutations: since numbers are distinct, 6 permutations. So that's another set.\n\nWait, but earlier when we considered the case with a zero, we had (20,10,0) etc. Here, (18,10,2) is different. So this is a new solution. So that adds 6 more solutions.\n\nSo now, let's see:\n\nPreviously, we had (15,10,5) \u2192 6 permutations,\n\n(12,10,8) \u21926 permutations,\n\n(18,10,2) \u21926 permutations,\n\nplus the all-10s and the zeros. Let me check another case.\n\nTry x= 20, but that led us to existing solutions. Let me try x= 16. Let me see.\n\nLet me try x=16, then y + z =14. Let me set z=14 - y.\n\nPlug into equation (3):\n\n10[16y + y(14 - y) +16*(14 - y)] -16y*(14 - y)=2000.\n\nInside the brackets:\n\n16y +14y -y\u00b2 +224 -16y = (16y +14y -16y) + (-y\u00b2) +224 =14y -y\u00b2 +224\n\nMultiply by10:140y -10y\u00b2 +2240\n\nSecond term: -16y*(14 - y)= -224y +16y\u00b2\n\nTotal equation:\n\n140y -10y\u00b2 +2240 -224y +16y\u00b2 =2000\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(140y -224y) + (-10y\u00b2 +16y\u00b2) +2240 =2000\n\n= -84y +6y\u00b2 +2240 =2000\n\nBring all to left:\n\n6y\u00b2 -84y +2240 -2000=0 \u21d26y\u00b2 -84y +240=0 \u21d2Divide by6:\n\ny\u00b2 -14y +40=0\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=(14 \u00b1\u221a(196 -160))/2=(14 \u00b1\u221a36)/2=(14 \u00b16)/2 \u21d220/2=10 or 8/2=4.\n\nThus, y=10 \u21d2 z=4, so triple (16,10,4). Check:\n\n10*(16*10 +10*4 +16*4) -16*10*4.\n\nInside: 160 +40 +64=264. 264*10=2640. Subtract 640 \u21d22640-640=2000. Works. So (16,10,4). Permutations: 6 solutions.\n\nAnother set. So that adds another 6.\n\nHmm, so now (16,10,4). Let me see if there's a pattern here. The triples so far with non-zero entries are (15,10,5), (12,10,8), (18,10,2), (16,10,4). Each time, one of the numbers is 10, and the other two add up with 10 to 30. Wait, but 15+10+5=30, 12+10+8=30, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the variables are arranged such that one of them is 10, and the other two add up to 20, but with different distributions?\n\nAlternatively, let me try x= 14. Let me see.\n\nSet x=14, so y + z=16. Let me set z=16 - y.\n\nPlug into equation (3):\n\n10[14y + y(16 - y) +14*(16 - y)] -14y*(16 - y)=2000.\n\nInside brackets:\n\n14y +16y -y\u00b2 +224 -14y = (14y +16y -14y) + (-y\u00b2) +224 =16y -y\u00b2 +224\n\nMultiply by10:160y -10y\u00b2 +2240\n\nSecond term: -14y*(16 - y)= -224y +14y\u00b2\n\nTotal equation:\n\n160y -10y\u00b2 +2240 -224y +14y\u00b2 =2000\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(160y -224y) + (-10y\u00b2 +14y\u00b2) +2240 =2000\n\n= -64y +4y\u00b2 +2240 =2000\n\nBring all to left:\n\n4y\u00b2 -64y +2240 -2000=0 \u21d24y\u00b2 -64y +240=0 \u21d2Divide by4:\n\ny\u00b2 -16y +60=0\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=(16 \u00b1\u221a(256 -240))/2=(16 \u00b1\u221a16)/2=(16\u00b14)/2 \u21d220/2=10 or 12/2=6.\n\nThus, y=10 \u21d2 z=6, so triple (14,10,6). Check:\n\n10*(14*10 +10*6 +14*6) -14*10*6\n\nInside:140 +60 +84=284. 284*10=2840 - 840=2000. Yes. So (14,10,6). 6 permutations.\n\nAnother solution set.\n\nHmm, so this seems like there's a pattern where one variable is 10, and the other two add up to 20. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the triples:\n\n(15,10,5): 15 +5 =20\n\n(12,10,8):12 +8=20\n\n(18,10,2):18 +2=20\n\n(16,10,4):16 +4=20\n\n(14,10,6):14 +6=20\n\nAh, so in each of these triples, two variables add up to 20, and the third is 10. So the variables can be written as (k,10, 20 -k), where k ranges over certain integers. Let me see.\n\nSo in this case, for example, k can be 15,12,18,16,14, etc. So perhaps all triples where one variable is 10, another is k, and third is 20 -k, with k from 2 to 18 in steps?\n\nWait, but let me see. Let me think of this approach.\n\nSuppose one of the variables is 10, say z=10. Then x + y =20. Then the triple is (x, y,10). Let me see what equation (3) gives us in this case.\n\nIf z=10, then equation (3):\n\n10(xy +10y +10x) -10xy =2000.\n\nWait, let me substitute z=10, so x + y=20.\n\nThen Q=xy +10y +10x =xy +10(x + y)=xy +10*20=xy +200.\n\nP= xyz= x y *10=10xy.\n\nThus equation (3) is 10*(xy +200) -10xy =2000 \u21d210xy +2000 -10xy=2000 \u21d22000=2000.\n\nWait, that's an identity? That can't be. Wait, that suggests that if we set z=10, then any x and y such that x + y=20 will satisfy the equation. But that contradicts our earlier findings where only specific x,y satisfy.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check my substitution again.\n\nWait, equation (3) is 10(xy + yz +zx) - xyz=2000.\n\nIf z=10, then:\n\n10(xy +10y +10x) -10xy =2000.\n\nCompute term by term:\n\n10xy +100y +100x -10xy =100y +100x =100(x + y). Since x + y =20, then 100*20=2000. So indeed, 2000=2000. So any x and y with x + y=20 would satisfy the equation when z=10. Therefore, if one variable is 10, then the other two variables can be any pair of nonnegative integers adding to 20. So that gives us infinitely many solutions? But no, since variables must be nonnegative integers, so there are 21 solutions for (x,y) when z=10 (since x can be from 0 to20, y=20 -x). But wait, in our problem, the variables are x,y,z which are nonnegative integers adding to 30. But in this case, z=10, so x + y =20, so x and y can be 0 to20. However, in our earlier examples, when we found (15,10,5), that is x=15,y=5,z=10, which is allowed. Similarly, (20,0,10) is allowed, but that was part of the zero solutions.\n\nWait, so actually, when z=10, any pair (x,y) with x+y=20 gives a solution. So that would be 21 solutions (from x=0 to20). But in our previous examples, we found some of them, but others like (0,20,10), (1,19,10) etc. would also be solutions. However, in the original problem, the variables a,b,c are 10x,10y,10z. Wait, hold on a second. Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, in the substitution, we set a=10x, b=10y, c=10z. So the original variables a,b,c must be multiples of 10? Wait, no, wait, actually, in my substitution earlier, I let a=10x, b=10y, c=10z so that x+y+z=30. But the original variables a,b,c are nonnegative integers. Therefore, x,y,z must be nonnegative integers as well, so a,b,c are multiples of 10. Wait, that's a crucial point!\n\nWait, hold on. The substitution I did earlier was to let a=10x, b=10y, c=10z. So that makes a,b,c multiples of 10. Therefore, the original problem allows a,b,c to be any nonnegative integers, but through this substitution, we're restricting them to multiples of 10. Therefore, this substitution may have missed solutions where a,b,c are not multiples of 10. Wait, but I need to check whether this substitution is valid or not.\n\nWait, the problem states that a,b,c are nonnegative integers. So when I set a=10x, then x must be an integer, but a could be any integer, so x can be fractional? No, x must be integer, so a must be a multiple of 10. Therefore, this substitution reduces the problem to only consider triples where a,b,c are multiples of 10. However, the original problem allows a,b,c to be any nonnegative integers, so this substitution might not capture all solutions, only those where a,b,c are multiples of 10. Therefore, perhaps my earlier approach is flawed?\n\nOh no, that's a problem. Because if I set a=10x, etc., then I might miss solutions where a,b,c are not multiples of 10. So this substitution might have limited the problem unnecessarily. Therefore, perhaps my earlier approach is incorrect. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc =2,000,000. If a,b,c are not multiples of 10, then the terms like ab might not be multiples of 10, but when multiplied by 100, they become multiples of 100, but abc could be not a multiple of 1000, but the right-hand side is 2,000,000, which is divisible by 1000. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that a,b,c are not multiples of 10. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLet me suppose that a,b,c are not multiples of 10. Let me check if the equation can hold.\n\nLet me consider the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc =2,000,000.\n\nSuppose that one of the variables is not a multiple of 10, say a is not divisible by 10. Let me see modulo 10.\n\nCompute the left-hand side modulo 10:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) \u22610 mod10,\n\n-abc mod10. So total left-hand side \u2261 -abc mod10.\n\nThe right-hand side is 2,000,000 \u22610 mod10.\n\nThus, -abc \u22610 mod10 \u21d2 abc\u22610 mod10. So at least one of a,b,c must be divisible by 2 or 5. But since we are considering a not divisible by 10, which is 2\u00d75, then a could be divisible by 2 or 5 but not both. Hmm, but even so, maybe possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's necessary that at least one variable is divisible by 10? Let me see.\n\nWait, let me suppose that none of a,b,c are divisible by 10. Then each of a,b,c must not be divisible by 2 or 5? No, they could be divisible by 2 or 5 but not both. However, the product abc must be divisible by 10. Since abc \u22610 mod10. So at least one of a,b,c must be divisible by 2 and at least one divisible by 5, but not necessarily the same variable. So for example, a divisible by 2, b divisible by5, and neither divisible by 10.\n\nBut then 100(ab + bc + ca) is divisible by 100, and abc divisible by10. Thus, the left-hand side is 100*(something) - abc. Since 100*(something) is divisible by 100, and abc divisible by10 but not necessarily by100, so 100*(something) - abc mod100 would be -abc mod100. Since abc divisible by10, so abc mod100 can be 10,20,...,90, or 100,..., but since abc is divisible by10 but not necessarily 100, so mod100 could be, say, 10,20,...,90. So 100*(...) -abc \u2261 - (abc mod100) mod100. The right-hand side is 2,000,000 mod100=0. Therefore, we require that abc mod100 \u22610. Therefore, abc must be divisible by 100. Therefore, abc must be divisible by 100. So in addition to being divisible by 10, the product must be divisible by 100. So that requires at least two factors of 2 and two factors of 5. So either one variable divisible by 10 and another by 10, or one divisible by 20 and another by5, or other combinations.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe my substitution approach was better, but it only captures solutions where a,b,c are multiples of10. Let me see how many solutions there are under that substitution, and then see if there are other solutions outside of that.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the question is asking for the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c). So if through substitution I found solutions where a,b,c are multiples of10, but there might be other solutions where they are not, but I have to consider them as well. So perhaps my earlier approach was incomplete. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all solutions require a,b,c to be multiples of10. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that a is not a multiple of10. Then, as per above, abc must be divisible by100. So suppose a is divisible by 2 but not 5, and b divisible by 5 but not2, then c must be divisible by 2 to get the second factor of2, but then a and c would both be even, so product divisible by4 and 5, but maybe that's possible. However, the equation may not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's too complicated, and all solutions actually are multiples of10. Let me see.\n\nLooking back at the solutions I found through substitution:\n\nThe solutions where one variable is zero (like (20,10,0)), but wait, in substitution terms, that would be a=200, b=100, c=0. Wait no, wait: Wait, in substitution, a=10x, so if x=20, then a=200. Wait, so the triples in terms of the original variables are (10x,10y,10z). So when we had the solution (x,y,z)=(20,10,0), that corresponds to (a,b,c)=(200,100,0). Similarly, (15,10,5) corresponds to (150,100,50), etc.\n\nBut if all solutions must be multiples of10, then the substitution is valid. But perhaps there are solutions outside of this substitution. Let me test with an example.\n\nSuppose there exists a solution where a=10, b=10, c=300-20=280. Let me see if that works.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na + b + c = 10 +10 +280=300, which is good.\n\nCompute the given equation:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b =100*10=1000,\n\na\u00b2c=100*280=28,000,\n\nb\u00b2a=100*10=1000,\n\nb\u00b2c=100*280=28,000,\n\nc\u00b2a=280\u00b2*10=78,400*10=784,000,\n\nc\u00b2b=280\u00b2*10= same as above? Wait, c\u00b2b= (280)^2 *10= same as c\u00b2a, since a and b are both 10. Wait, no:\n\nWait, c\u00b2a is (280)^2 *10,\n\nc\u00b2b is (280)^2 *10,\n\nso total of those two terms is 2*(280\u00b2 *10).\n\nWait, let me compute all terms:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= a\u00b2(b +c) +b\u00b2(a +c) +c\u00b2(a +b)\n\n=10\u00b2*(10 +280) +10\u00b2*(10 +280) +280\u00b2*(10 +10)\n\n= 100*(290) +100*(290) + (280)^2*(20)\n\n= 29,000 +29,000 + (78,400)*20\n\n=58,000 +1,568,000 =1,626,000\n\nWhich is way larger than 6,000,000. Wait, no, 1,626,000 is less than 6,000,000. Wait, but it's not equal. So that's not a solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another example.\n\nSuppose a=10, b=20, c=270.\n\nThen compute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\n=100*20 +100*270 +400*10 +400*270 + (270)^2*10 + (270)^2*20\n\n=2000 +27,000 +4,000 +108,000 +72,900*10 +72,900*20\n\nWait, this is going to be huge. Probably not equal to 6,000,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a= 20, b=20, c=260.\n\nWait, this might take too long. Alternatively, maybe the substitution approach is valid and all solutions are multiples of10, so the substitution didn't miss any solutions.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc =2,000,000.\n\nSuppose that a,b,c are multiples of10, then the equation is satisfied, but if they are not, then perhaps it's difficult to satisfy. Since when we set variables as multiples of10, we can find solutions, but maybe those are the only solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that all solutions must have a,b,c multiples of10. Therefore, the substitution is valid, and we can proceed with that.\n\nTherefore, proceeding under the assumption that all solutions are multiples of10, so the substitution is valid. So then, the variables x,y,z must be nonnegative integers adding to30, and the equation reduces to 10(xy + yz +zx) -xyz =2000.\n\nEarlier, I found that when one variable is10, the other two can be any pair adding to20, which gives 21 solutions (since x,y can be 0-20). But in the earlier examples, when I set z=10, then (x,y,z)=(20,0,10) was a solution, but also (15,5,10), etc. So those are all valid.\n\nHowever, in the problem statement, the triples (a,b,c) are ordered, so each permutation counts separately, except when variables are equal.\n\nWait, but in the substitution approach, the variables x,y,z correspond to a/10, b/10, c/10. So each solution in x,y,z corresponds to a solution in a,b,c scaled by10. So the number of triples (a,b,c) is the same as the number of triples (x,y,z).\n\nTherefore, to count the number of triples (x,y,z), we need to count all triples of nonnegative integers x,y,z with x+y+z=30, and 10(xy+yz+zx) -xyz=2000.\n\nNow, we found several cases:\n\n1. All variables equal to10: (10,10,10). Only 1 solution.\n\n2. One variable is0, and the other two are20 and10: for example (20,10,0). The number of such solutions: there are 3 choices for which variable is0, and for each, the other two variables can be arranged in 2 ways (since 20 and10 are distinct). So 3*2=6 solutions.\n\n3. One variable is10, and the other two add up to20. The number of solutions here:\n\nIf one variable is fixed as10, say z=10, then x + y =20. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to x + y=20 is21 (from x=0 to20). However, each such solution (x,y,10) is a distinct ordered triple only when considering permutations.\n\nWait, but in terms of unordered triples, but since the problem counts ordered triples, we need to consider all permutations.\n\nWait, actually, if we fix one variable as10, say the third variable is10, then the first two variables can be any pair adding to20, which gives21 ordered pairs (since x and y are ordered). However, when considering all permutations, we have to consider all positions where the 10 can be.\n\nWait, let me think carefully.\n\nSuppose we have triples where one of the variables is10, and the other two add up to20. The total number of ordered triples is as follows:\n\nFor each position of the10 (3 choices), the other two variables can be any pair (a,b) with a + b =20, where a and b are nonnegative integers. For each such pair, the two variables can be arranged in two ways unless a = b. However, since a and b can be zero, but the variables are ordered, so each pair (a,b) where a and b are nonnegative integers adding to20 gives exactly one ordered triple for each arrangement.\n\nWait, actually, for each of the three positions where the10 can be placed, the other two variables can be any ordered pair (x,y) with x + y=20. The number of ordered pairs (x,y) with x + y=20 is21 (since x can be0 to20, y=20\u2212x). So for each of the three positions of the10, there are21 ordered triples. However, this would count triples where two variables are10 as well? Wait, if x=10 and y=10, then the triple would be (10,10,10) if the third variable is also10. But in our current count, we are considering cases where exactly one variable is10 and the other two add to20. But (10,10,10) has all three variables as10, so that case is already counted separately. So to avoid overcounting, when we count the cases with one variable as10, we need to exclude the case where the other two variables are both10. Since x + y=20, if x=10 and y=10, then that's a valid solution, but in that case, the triple would be (10,10,10), which is already counted in the first case. Therefore, when counting the cases with exactly one10, we need to subtract those.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me structure it properly:\n\nTotal number of triples where at least one variable is10 and the other two add to20:\n\n- First, count all triples where one variable is10 and the other two add to20, including those where the other two variables might also be10.\n\n- Then subtract the overcounted cases where more than one variable is10.\n\nBut actually, since we are considering exactly one variable being10, but in the case where two variables are10, that would have been counted twice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute:\n\nNumber of triples with exactly one10 and the other two adding to20: For each of the three positions of10, the other two variables can be any pair (a,b) with a + b=20 and neither a nor b is10. Wait no, actually, even if one of them is10, but then the third variable is already10. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of all triples where one variable is10 and the other two variables add to20, allowing the other two variables to be anything (including10). The total number is 3 *21=63. But among these, the triple (10,10,10) is counted three times (once in each position). So to get the number of triples with exactly one10, we need to subtract 2*(1) for overcounts, but actually, the triple (10,10,10) has three10s, so it was counted three times in the 63, but should be excluded from the \"exactly one10\" count. However, since we are considering all cases where one variable is10 and the other two add to20, even if another variable is10, like (10,10,10) is included here because 10+10=20? Wait no, if one variable is10, then the other two variables add to20, so if another variable is10, the third must be10. So (10,10,10) is indeed included here, because 10+10=20. So in the count of triples with one variable as10 and the other two adding to20, the triple (10,10,10) is counted three times (once for each position of the \"first\"10). So to count the number of distinct triples where exactly one variable is10 and the other two add to20 (but not both10), we need to subtract the overcounts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the total number of triples where one variable is10 and the other two add to20 (regardless of other variables being10), then subtract the cases where two or three variables are10.\n\nWait, but in our case, the equation allows for triples where two variables are10 and the third is10 as well (the all-10 case). So perhaps it's better to separate the counts:\n\nCase1: All three variables are10: 1 triple.\n\nCase2: Exactly two variables are10: Let's see. If two variables are10, then the third must be10 as well because 10+10 + third =30 \u21d2 third=10. So there are no triples with exactly two10s.\n\nCase3: Exactly one variable is10: So the other two variables add to20, and neither is10. The number here is, for each position of the10 (3 choices), the number of ordered pairs (a,b) with a + b=20 and a \u226010, b\u226010. The total pairs where a + b=20 are21. Among them, the pair (10,10) is the only one where both are10, so subtracting that, we have20 pairs where neither is10. However, in ordered pairs, (10,10) is one pair, so the remaining are20. So for each position of the10, there are20 ordered pairs, so total 3\u00d720=60.\n\nCase4: No variables are10: Then, all three variables are different from10. But earlier, we found solutions like (15,10,5) but that has a10. Wait no, in this case, if no variables are10, then they must add to30 and satisfy the equation. But earlier solutions like (15,10,5) include a10, so they are excluded from this case. So need to see if there are solutions with no variables equal to10.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered (x,y,z)=(15,10,5), that has a10, so it's in case3. If there are solutions with none of the variables being10, then those would be in case4. Let me see if such solutions exist.\n\nSuppose none of x,y,z is10. Let me try to find such a solution.\n\nSuppose x=14, y=6, z=10. Wait, but that has a10. Let me try x=12, y=8, z=10 again, which has a10. Hmm, how about x=16, y=4, z=10. Also has a10.\n\nWait, let me try to find a solution where none of the variables is10.\n\nLet me suppose x=5, y=5, z=20. Then check equation (3):\n\n10*(5*5 +5*20 +5*20) -5*5*20 =10*(25+100+100) -500=10*225 -500=2250-500=1750\u22602000. Not good.\n\nHow about x=18, y=2, z=10, which is in case3.\n\nWhat about x=13, y=7, z=10? Still has a10.\n\nHmm, maybe there are no solutions where none of the variables is10. Let me see.\n\nSuppose all variables are different from10. Let me assume that x,y,z are all different from10 and see if the equation can hold.\n\nLet me suppose that x,y,z are all different from10. Let me try to find such a solution.\n\nLet me pick x=15, y=5, z=10. But z=10 is not allowed here. So set z= something else.\n\nLet me try x=12, y=8, z=10. Again has a10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x=14, y=6, z=10. Still has a10.\n\nWait, maybe it's impossible. Let me see.\n\nSuppose none of x,y,z is10. Then, we need to solve:\n\nx + y + z =30,\n\n10(xy + yz +zx) -xyz =2000.\n\nLet me see if such a solution exists.\n\nLet me assume variables are x,y,z \u226010.\n\nLet me try x=16, y=9, z=5. Then sum is30.\n\nCompute equation:\n\n10*(16*9 +9*5 +16*5) -16*9*5.\n\nFirst compute terms inside:\n\n16*9=144, 9*5=45,16*5=80. Sum:144+45+80=269. Multiply by10:2690.\n\nSubtract 16*9*5=720. 2690-720=1970\u22602000.\n\nClose but no.\n\nTry x=17, y=8, z=5. Sum30.\n\nCompute:\n\n10*(17*8 +8*5 +17*5)=10*(136+40+85)=10*(261)=2610.\n\nSubtract 17*8*5=680. 2610-680=1930.\n\nNot enough.\n\nTry x=19, y=6, z=5.\n\nSum30.\n\n10*(19*6 +6*5 +19*5)=10*(114 +30 +95)=10*(239)=2390.\n\nSubtract 19*6*5=570. 2390-570=1820.\n\nHmm.\n\nTry x=14, y=7, z=9.\n\nSum30.\n\n10*(14*7 +7*9 +14*9)=10*(98 +63 +126)=10*(287)=2870.\n\nSubtract 14*7*9=882. 2870-882=1988. Close.\n\nHmm.\n\nTrying x=13, y=7, z=10 (but z=10 is not allowed).\n\nHmm, maybe it's difficult to find such a solution, suggesting that maybe there are no solutions where none of the variables is10. Let me try another approach.\n\nSuppose that none of x,y,z is10. Then, since x+y+z=30, and each variable is at least0, but not10.\n\nLet me see if we can rewrite the equation 10(xy + yz +zx) -xyz =2000.\n\nLet me rearrange it as:\n\nxyz -10(xy + yz +zx) +2000 =0.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume variables are in arithmetic progression or something.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if none of the variables is10, then perhaps the equation can't be satisfied. Given that all the solutions I found so far have at least one variable as10, perhaps that is indeed the case.\n\nTherefore, proceeding under the assumption that all solutions have at least one variable equal to10. So then the total number of triples is:\n\nCase1: All variables10:1.\n\nCase2: Exactly one variable10 and the other two add to20:60.\n\nCase3: One variable0 and the other two are20 and10:6.\n\nWait, but wait, in case2, when exactly one variable is10, the other two add to20. The triples where one variable is0 and the other two are20 and10 are included in case2? Because if one variable is0, then the other two variables are20 and10, so one of them is10 and the other is20, so the third variable (the0) is not10. Therefore, those triples are included in case2. Wait, but in case2, we considered exactly one variable is10, but in the case where one variable is0 and the others are20 and10, there is exactly one variable10, so those are included in case2's count of60. But earlier I thought case2 was60, but case3 was6, but actually case3 is part of case2. Therefore, I made a mistake in separating them.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe cases are:\n\n1. All variables10:1.\n\n2. Exactly one variable10 and the other two add to20 (including cases where one of them is0): the count is3*(21 -1)=3*20=60? Wait, no, earlier analysis said that for each position of10, there are21 ordered pairs (a,b) where a + b=20. Among those, the pair (10,10) would lead to three10s, so for each position, the number of triples with exactly one10 is21 -1 (excluding the (10,10) case), so 20 per position, totaling 3\u00d720=60. The remaining triples where one variable is10 and the other two include a10 are the all10s case, which is counted three times in the initial 3\u00d721 count, but we subtract those to get60 for exactly one10. Therefore, the triples where one variable is0 and others are20 and10 are included in the exactly one10 case. So the6 solutions I thought of earlier (with a zero) are part of the60.\n\nTherefore, total solutions are case1 + case2=1+60=61.\n\nWait, but previously I found other triples like (15,10,5) which are in case2, and (12,10,8), etc. So the total number would be61. But wait, let me confirm:\n\nThe equation with x,y,z:\n\nTotal solutions are:\n\n- 1 solution where all are10.\n\n- For each of the three positions of the10, there are20 ordered pairs (a,b) where a + b=20 and neither a nor b is10. Wait, but actually, when you fix one variable as10, say x=10, then y and z must add to20. The number of ordered pairs (y,z) with y + z=20 is21. Among these, the pair (10,10) would give the triple (10,10,10). So to count exactly one10, we subtract that one case, so20 per position. So total of3\u00d720=60.\n\nThus, total solutions are61.\n\nBut wait, let me think of the triples where one variable is0:\n\nFor example, (20,10,0). Here, one variable is10, another is20, and the third is0. This is counted in case2 (exactly one10). Similarly, (10,20,0) is another, etc. So all such triples are part of the60.\n\nThus, the total number of triples (x,y,z) is61, so the number of triples (a,b,c) is also61, since they are in bijection via scaling.\n\nWait, but in the substitution, a=10x, so each solution (x,y,z) corresponds to exactly one (a,b,c). So the total number is61.\n\nWait but let me verify with the examples I found earlier:\n\n- The all-10 case:1.\n\n- The triples with exactly one10 and the other two adding to20 (including zeros):\n\nFor example, (20,10,0) is counted in the60.\n\nSimilarly, (15,10,5) is counted there,\n\n(12,10,8),\n\n(18,10,2),\n\n(16,10,4),\n\n(14,10,6),\n\nand their permutations.\n\nEach of these permutations is counted in the60.\n\nTherefore, total61.\n\nBut let me check the count again:\n\nTotal solutions for (x,y,z):\n\n- 1 triple with all10s.\n\n- For each of the three variables being the one that's10, there are20 possibilities for the other two numbers (since they can be any pair adding to20 except (10,10)), so 3\u00d720=60.\n\nTotal is61.\n\nTherefore, the number of triples (x,y,z) is61, so the number of triples (a,b,c) is also61. However, let me confirm with an example count.\n\nLet me consider the triples where one variable is10 and the other two are (0,20):\n\nThere are3 positions for the10, and for each, two permutations (since (0,20) and (20,0)), but since the variables are ordered, each of the three positions with the10 gives two ordered triples except when the other two are0 and20. Wait, no, actually, when the non-10 variables are0 and20, there are two orderings for each position of the10. For example, if the10 is in the first position, the other two can be (0,20) or (20,0). So for each of the three positions of the10, there are2 ordered triples where the other two are0 and20. So that's6 triples, which matches the earlier count of the zero cases.\n\nSimilarly, for the pair (5,15), there are two orderings for each position of the10, so 3\u00d72=6 triples.\n\nSimilarly for all other pairs except (10,10).\n\nTherefore, the total is indeed61.\n\nWait but let me confirm with another angle.\n\nThe equation in x,y,z is symmetric, so the total number of ordered triples is equal to the number of ordered triples with x+y+z=30 and 10(xy+yz+zx)\u2212xyz=2000.\n\nWe can also think of the solutions as:\n\n- 1 solution with (10,10,10).\n\n- For each permutation of (a,b,c) where one is10, one isk, and one is20\u2212k, where k ranges from0 to20 except10.\n\nWait, for each k from0 to20 except10, there are6 permutations (since three positions for the10, and two for the other two numbers unless they are equal).\n\nWait, actually, when k=0, the numbers are10,0,20, which are all distinct, so there are6 permutations.\n\nWhen k=20, same as k=0, since20\u221220=0.\n\nWhen k=5 and20\u2212k=15, they are distinct, so6 permutations each.\n\nSimilarly for k=8 and12, etc.\n\nExcept when k=10, which would give (10,10,10), which is already counted.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions with exactly one10 is:\n\nFor each k from0 to20 excluding10:\n\nFor each k (0 to20 except10), the triplet is (10,k,20\u2212k). However, when k=10, it's the all10s case. For other k, each pair (k,20\u2212k) is unique except when k=10. For each such k, the number of ordered triples is6 unless k=20\u2212k \u21d2k=10, but we already excluded that.\n\nWait, but when k=0, it's (10,0,20), which has two zeros? No, only one zero. Each triplet with distinct elements has6 permutations. So for each k from0 to20 excluding10 and excluding the duplicates where k>20\u2212k (to avoid double-counting). Wait, actually, since k ranges from0 to20, each pair (k,20\u2212k) is unique for each k, so there are21 terms (from0 to20), but excluding k=10 (which gives (10,10)), so20 terms. Each of these corresponds to a distinct unordered triplet, each of which has6 ordered permutations except when the two non-10 numbers are equal.\n\nWait, when are the two non-10 numbers equal? When k=20\u2212k \u21d2k=10. Which is excluded. So all other k give distinct pairs, so each unordered triplet has6 permutations.\n\nThus, the number of ordered triples is20\u00d76=120. Wait, but that contradicts previous count of60.\n\nHmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, this approach says:\n\nFor each k from0 to20 except10:\n\n- The triplet (10, k, 20\u2212k) where k\u226010.\n\nEach of these corresponds to an unordered triplet with elements10, k, and20\u2212k. Since k can be from0 to20 excluding10, there are20 such k.\n\nEach unordered triplet has6 permutations unless two elements are equal. Since k\u226020\u2212k (except whenk=10), so all these triplets have three distinct elements except when k=10. So each of the20 k gives an unordered triplet with three distinct elements, so each has6 permutations. Thus total is20\u00d76=120. But this contradicts the previous count of60.\n\nWhere is the mistake?\n\nAh! Because when I fix one variable as10, the other two arek and20\u2212k, but varying the position of the10. Wait, no, the above approach counts all permutations, so if I consider all ordered triples where one element is10 and the other two add to20, then it's indeed:\n\nFor each of the three positions of the10:\n\n- The other two elements can be any pair (a,b) witha +b=20. The number of ordered pairs (a,b) is21 (from a=0 tob=20).\n\nThus, total is3\u00d721=63 ordered triples. Among these, the triplet (10,10,10) is counted three times (once for each position of the10). So subtract2 duplicates to get1 triplet counted once, so total is63\u22122\u00d71=61? Wait, no.\n\nActually, the triplet (10,10,10) is counted three times in the63. To count the number of distinct ordered triples with at least one10 and the other two adding to20:\n\nTotal is63, but subtract the overcounts of the all-10 case which was counted three times but should only be counted once. So total is63\u22122=61. Which matches the previous count.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ordered triples (x,y,z) is indeed61.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be61. But wait, let me confirm once more:\n\nTotal solutions:\n\n- 1 all-10.\n\n- The rest are the60 with exactly one10 and the other two adding to20 (including zeros). So total61.\n\nTherefore, the number of triples (a,b,c) is61, since each corresponds to exactly one (x,y,z).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is61. But let me check with some examples.\n\nEarlier, I found:\n\n- The all-10:1.\n\n- The (20,10,0) and permutations:6.\n\n- The (15,10,5) and permutations:6.\n\n- The (12,10,8) and permutations:6.\n\n- The (18,10,2) and permutations:6.\n\n- The (16,10,4) and permutations:6.\n\n- The (14,10,6) and permutations:6.\n\nTotal so far:1 +6+6+6+6+6+6= 1 + 6\u00d76=1+36=37. But this is missing many more.\n\nWait, perhaps my enumeration was incomplete. For example, for k=1 to19 (excluding10), each gives6 permutations, so19\u00d76=114, plus the all-10: total115? No, no, I must be mixing up.\n\nAlternatively, the correct total is61 as per the systematic count. So I should trust that.\n\nThus, the answer is61, so boxed:\n\n\\boxed{61}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{61}\n\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the number of triples of nonnegative integers \\((a, b, c)\\) satisfying \\(a + b + c = 300\\) and \\(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\\), we start by simplifying the given expression.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the given expression using the identity:\n\\[\na^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3)\n\\]\nGiven \\(a + b + c = 300\\), we substitute \\(S = 300\\) into the equation:\n\\[\n300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000\n\\]\nUsing the identities for sums of squares and cubes, we convert this into terms of \\(ab + bc + ca\\) and \\(abc\\). After simplification, we find:\n\\[\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\n\\]\nWe then substitute \\(a = 10x\\), \\(b = 10y\\), \\(c = 10z\\) to simplify further, leading to:\n\\[\n10(xy + yz + zx) - xyz = 2000\n\\]\nwith \\(x + y + z = 30\\).\n\nWe analyze the solutions for \\((x, y, z)\\):\n1. **All variables equal to 10**: This gives the solution \\((10, 10, 10)\\), contributing 1 triple.\n2. **One variable is 10, others add to 20**: For each position of the 10 (3 choices), the other two variables can be any pair \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(a + b = 20\\). Excluding the case where both are 10 (which is already counted), each position contributes 20 solutions, totaling \\(3 \\times 20 = 60\\).\n\nSumming these cases, we get:\n- 1 solution for all 10s.\n- 60 solutions for exactly one 10 and the other two adding to 20.\n\nThus, the total number of triples \\((x, y, z)\\) is \\(1 + 60 = 61\\). Each of these corresponds to a unique triple \\((a, b, c)\\) by scaling back by 10.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{61}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It's a classic stars and bars problem if there were no other constraints, but here we have another condition involving the sum of these quadratic terms. The second equation looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor it or find some symmetry.\n\nLet me write down the second equation again: a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b. Hmm, I notice that each term has two variables, one squared and the other to the first power. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow.\n\nLooking at each pair of terms, for example, a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c = a\u00b2(b + c). Similarly, the other terms can be grouped as b\u00b2(a + c) and c\u00b2(a + b). So the entire expression becomes:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b).\n\nHmm, that's better. Now, since we know that a + b + c = 300, maybe we can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), right?\n\nLet me try that substitution:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c).\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me see if I can simplify this expression further. Let's expand each term:\n\na\u00b2*300 - a\u00b3 + b\u00b2*300 - b\u00b3 + c\u00b2*300 - c\u00b3 = 6,000,000.\n\nSo that's 300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, so maybe I can relate this to other symmetric sums. Let's recall that in symmetric equations, sometimes we can use the identities involving (a + b + c), (ab + bc + ca), and (abc). Let me see if I can express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 and a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 in terms of these.\n\nFirst, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c = 300, that would be 300\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nThen, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 can be expressed as (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. Plugging in the known sum:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 300\u00b3 - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.\n\nSo substituting these into the equation:\n\n300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) - [300\u00b3 - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, this might get a bit messy, but let's compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)):\n\n300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000\n\n300*(-2)(ab + bc + ca) = -600(ab + bc + ca)\n\nThen subtract the second part:\n\n- [300\u00b3 - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc]\n\nFirst compute 300\u00b3: 300*300*300 = 27,000,000\n\nThen, -3*300*(ab + bc + ca) = -900(ab + bc + ca)\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) - [27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me distribute the negative sign into the brackets:\n\n27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) -27,000,000 + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\n27,000,000 -27,000,000 cancels out.\n\nThen, -600(ab + bc + ca) + 900(ab + bc + ca) = 300(ab + bc + ca)\n\nAnd then the remaining term is -3abc.\n\nSo overall, we have:\n\n300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 3 to simplify:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so now we have an equation involving ab + bc + ca and abc. Let's denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ca. Then the equation becomes:\n\n100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nNow, perhaps we can find relationships between Q and S. Since S = 300, we know that Q is related to the squares. Wait, but maybe we can use other symmetric equations here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to consider variables in terms of each other. Let me think if there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use substitution. Let me think of variables such that two variables are equal, given the symmetry of the problem. Since the equation is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps the solutions have some symmetry. Maybe two variables are equal, or all three are equal?\n\nFirst, let's check if all three variables are equal. If a = b = c, then each would be 100, since 3a = 300. Let's check if this satisfies the second equation.\n\nCompute a\u00b2b + ... etc. Each term would be a\u00b2*a = a\u00b3, so each term is a\u00b3, and there are 6 terms (since each pair is counted twice). Wait, actually, let me see:\n\nWait, the original equation is a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b. If a = b = c = 100, then each term is 100\u00b2 * 100 = 100^3, and there are 6 terms. So total is 6*(10^6) = 6,000,000. Hey, that's exactly the value we need!\n\nSo (100, 100, 100) is a solution. But are there others?\n\nHmm, so that's one solution, but maybe there are more. Let's see.\n\nSuppose two variables are equal, say a = b, and c is different. Let me set a = b = x, then c = 300 - 2x. Then we can plug into the equation.\n\nFirst, let's compute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\nSince a = b = x, this becomes:\n\nx\u00b2x + x\u00b2c + x\u00b2x + x\u00b2c + c\u00b2x + c\u00b2x\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b3 + x\u00b2c + x\u00b3 + x\u00b2c + 2c\u00b2x\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2c + 2x c\u00b2\n\nFactor out 2x:\n\n2x(x\u00b2 + x c + c\u00b2)\n\nHmm, but let's compute it step by step.\n\nWait, actually, let me compute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = x\u00b2 * x = x\u00b3\n\na\u00b2c = x\u00b2 * c\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2a = x\u00b2 *x = x\u00b3\n\nb\u00b2c = x\u00b2 * c\n\nc\u00b2a = c\u00b2 * x\n\nc\u00b2b = c\u00b2 * x\n\nSo total:\n\nx\u00b3 + x\u00b2c + x\u00b3 + x\u00b2c + c\u00b2x + c\u00b2x\n\nSo total is 2x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2c + 2x c\u00b2.\n\nFactor 2x:\n\n2x(x\u00b2 + x c + c\u00b2)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor further?\n\nAlternatively, note that x\u00b2 + x c + c\u00b2 is the same as (x^3 - c^3)/(x - c) if x \u2260 c, but maybe that's complicating.\n\nAlternatively, let's substitute c = 300 - 2x.\n\nSo, c = 300 - 2x. Let me plug that into the expression.\n\nFirst, compute 2x(x\u00b2 + x c + c\u00b2):\n\nLet me compute x\u00b2 + x c + c\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 + x*(300 - 2x) + (300 - 2x)^2\n\nCompute term by term:\n\nx\u00b2 + 300x - 2x\u00b2 + (90000 - 1200x + 4x\u00b2)\n\nCombine terms:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2x\u00b2 + 4x\u00b2 = 3x\u00b2\n\n300x -1200x = -900x\n\n+90000\n\nSo total x\u00b2 + x c + c\u00b2 = 3x\u00b2 - 900x + 90000\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 2x*(3x\u00b2 - 900x + 90000)\n\nSo the entire equation becomes:\n\n2x*(3x\u00b2 - 900x + 90000) = 6,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx*(3x\u00b2 - 900x + 90000) = 3,000,000\n\nMultiply out the left side:\n\n3x\u00b3 - 900x\u00b2 + 90,000x = 3,000,000\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n3x\u00b3 - 900x\u00b2 + 90,000x - 3,000,000 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + 30,000x - 1,000,000 = 0\n\nHmm, need to solve this cubic equation. Let's see if there are integer roots. Since x is an integer (as a, b, c are nonnegative integers), and since c = 300 - 2x must be nonnegative, so 300 - 2x \u2265 0 \u21d2 x \u2264 150. Also, since x must be nonnegative, x \u22650. So x is between 0 and 150.\n\nLet me try possible integer roots. Let's try x = 100, since we know (100,100,100) is a solution. Let's plug in x=100:\n\n100\u00b3 - 300*(100)^2 +30,000*(100) -1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 -1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 -1,000,000 = 0. Yes, so x=100 is a root. Therefore, (x - 100) is a factor.\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or factor it.\n\nDivide the cubic polynomial by (x - 100):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000\n\nRoot at x=100:\n\nBring down 1\n\nMultiply by 100: 100\n\nAdd to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200\n\nMultiply by 100: -20,000\n\nAdd to next coefficient: 30,000 + (-20,000) = 10,000\n\nMultiply by 100: 1,000,000\n\nAdd to last term: -1,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 0. Perfect.\n\nThus, the cubic factors as (x - 100)(x\u00b2 - 200x + 10,000).\n\nSo now, set equal to zero:\n\n(x - 100)(x\u00b2 - 200x + 10,000) = 0\n\nSo the roots are x=100 and roots of x\u00b2 -200x +10,000 =0\n\nSolving x\u00b2 -200x +10,000 =0:\n\nDiscriminant D = (200)^2 -4*1*10,000 = 40,000 -40,000 =0\n\nThus, a double root at x = (200)/2 =100. Wait, that's the same as before?\n\nWait, discriminant is zero, so x = [200 \u00b1 0]/2 =100. So actually, the quadratic factor is (x -100)^2. Therefore, the cubic is (x -100)^3 =0. Wait, but that contradicts our previous factorization. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, if the quadratic is x\u00b2 -200x +10,000, then discriminant is 40,000 -40,000 =0, so yes, it's (x -100)^2. Therefore, the cubic is (x -100)^3. So the only real root is x=100 with multiplicity 3. Therefore, the equation x\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + 30,000x -1,000,000=0 has x=100 as the only real solution. Therefore, in this case, the only solution when a = b is when x=100, so a = b =100, then c=300 - 200=100. Which gives back the triple (100,100,100). So in the case of two variables equal, that's the only solution.\n\nHmm, so maybe the only solution where two variables are equal is the all-equal case. Let's see if there are solutions where all variables are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another case where one variable is zero? Let's try that.\n\nSuppose c =0. Then the equations become a + b =300, and the second equation becomes a\u00b2b +a\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2*0 +0 +0 = a\u00b2b +ab\u00b2 =ab(a +b)=ab*300=6,000,000. So ab*300 =6,000,000 \u21d2 ab=20,000.\n\nSo we need a and b nonnegative integers with a + b =300 and ab=20,000. Let's see if such integers exist.\n\nLet me denote a and b as roots of the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -300x +20,000=0. Let's compute discriminant:\n\nD = 300\u00b2 -4*1*20,000 =90,000 -80,000=10,000.\n\nSquare root of D is 100. So roots are [300 \u00b1100]/2 = (400)/2=200 and (200)/2=100. So a and b are 200 and 100. Therefore, the solutions when c=0 are (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). Since order matters, but since variables can be permuted, but in this case, since we set c=0, we have two solutions here. However, since the problem counts ordered triples, but actually, when c=0, the triples are (a,b,0), (b,a,0), but also (a,0,b), etc. Wait, actually, since we set c=0, but variables can be permuted. So actually, the solutions with one zero would have permutations where any of a,b,c can be zero. Let me think.\n\nWait, let's see. If we set c=0, then we have two solutions (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). But if we set a=0 instead, then similarly we can get (0,200,100) and (0,100,200). Similarly setting b=0 gives (200,0,100) and (100,0,200). So total of 6 permutations? Wait, but actually, each of the three variables could be the zero, and for each case, there are two ordered triples. So 3 variables \u00d72 permutations each =6 triples where one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100.\n\nBut let's check if these actually satisfy the second equation.\n\nTake (200,100,0):\n\nCompute a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nPlug in a=200, b=100, c=0:\n\n200\u00b2*100 + 200\u00b2*0 +100\u00b2*200 +100\u00b2*0 +0\u00b2*200 +0\u00b2*100\n\n= 200\u00b2*100 +100\u00b2*200\n\nCompute 200\u00b2*100 = (40,000)*100 =4,000,000\n\n100\u00b2*200 =10,000*200=2,000,000\n\nTotal is 6,000,000. Perfect, that works. Similarly for the others. So these are valid solutions.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 such triples where one variable is zero and the other two are 100 and 200.\n\nAdditionally, the all-100 case is another solution. So so far, we have 6 +1=7 solutions? Wait, but maybe there are more?\n\nWait, are there solutions where two variables are zero? Let's check.\n\nSuppose two variables are zero, say b=0 and c=0. Then a=300. Then the second equation becomes a\u00b2*0 + a\u00b2*0 +0 +0 +0 +0 =0, which is not equal to 6,000,000. So that doesn't work. Similarly, any two variables being zero would give zero, which is too small. So no solutions there.\n\nWhat about other cases where variables are not equal and none are zero?\n\nHmm, maybe we can consider other possibilities. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the equation 100Q - P =2,000,000, where Q =ab + bc + ca and P=abc.\n\nSince S =a + b + c =300, perhaps we can relate Q and P via some inequalities or other relationships.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express Q in terms of S and the variance. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, let's see if there are other triples besides the ones we found.\n\nSuppose that one of the numbers is 200, another 100, and the third 0, which we already considered. What if all three numbers are different and non-zero?\n\nSuppose a, b, c are all different, none zero. Let me see if such triples can satisfy the equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are triples where two variables are the same but not 100? Wait, earlier when we considered two variables equal, we found that only the triple with all equal variables works. Let me confirm that again.\n\nSuppose a = b =x, then c=300 -2x. We had the equation leading to x=100 as the only solution. So that case only gives the all-100 triple. So if two variables are equal but not 100, then no solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider another case where variables are in some ratio?\n\nAlternatively, let me try some trial values. For example, suppose one variable is 150, another 150, then c=0. Let's see:\n\na=150, b=150, c=0. Then compute the second equation:\n\n150\u00b2*150 +150\u00b2*0 +150\u00b2*150 +150\u00b2*0 +0 +0 = 2*(150)^3.\n\n150\u00b3 is 3,375,000, so times 2 is 6,750,000 which is more than 6,000,000. So that's too big.\n\nHmm, so that doesn't work.\n\nHow about a= 150, b=100, c=50. Let's compute:\n\na + b +c = 300. Check second equation:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b\n\n=150\u00b2*100 +150\u00b2*50 +100\u00b2*150 +100\u00b2*50 +50\u00b2*150 +50\u00b2*100\n\nCompute each term:\n\n150\u00b2=22,500; 22,500*100=2,250,000; 22,500*50=1,125,000\n\n100\u00b2=10,000; 10,000*150=1,500,000; 10,000*50=500,000\n\n50\u00b2=2,500; 2,500*150=375,000; 2,500*100=250,000\n\nAdding all up: 2,250,000 +1,125,000 = 3,375,000\n\n+1,500,000 +500,000 = 2,000,000 \u2192 total so far 5,375,000\n\n+375,000 +250,000 =625,000 \u2192 total 6,000,000.\n\nWait a minute! That adds up to exactly 6,000,000. Wait, so (150, 100, 50) is another solution?\n\nWait, let me verify again:\n\nWait, let me recalculate step by step:\n\nFirst term: a\u00b2b =150\u00b2*100 = (22500)*100=2,250,000\n\nSecond term: a\u00b2c =150\u00b2*50=22500*50=1,125,000\n\nThird term: b\u00b2a =100\u00b2*150=10,000*150=1,500,000\n\nFourth term: b\u00b2c =100\u00b2*50=10,000*50=500,000\n\nFifth term: c\u00b2a =50\u00b2*150=2500*150=375,000\n\nSixth term: c\u00b2b =50\u00b2*100=2500*100=250,000\n\nNow adding all together:\n\n2,250,000 +1,125,000 = 3,375,000\n\n+1,500,000 = 4,875,000\n\n+500,000 =5,375,000\n\n+375,000 =5,750,000\n\n+250,000 =6,000,000. Yes, exactly. So (150,100,50) is a solution. Wait, so this is a new solution where all three numbers are different and non-zero. So my earlier assumption that only the all-100 and the ones with a zero were solutions was wrong. So there are more solutions.\n\nHmm, so that complicates things. So how did that happen? Let me see.\n\nWait, so maybe there are more triples where the numbers are in different proportions. So perhaps there are triples where variables are in arithmetic progression? Let's see.\n\nWait, the example above (150,100,50) is an arithmetic progression with difference -50. Let me see if that's a coincidence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here. Let me see if I can find another solution.\n\nSuppose I take a = 200, b = 50, c =50. Let's check:\n\na + b +c =200 +50+50=300.\n\nCompute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b=200\u00b2*50=40,000*50=2,000,000\n\na\u00b2c=40,000*50=2,000,000\n\nb\u00b2a=2500*200=500,000\n\nb\u00b2c=2500*50=125,000\n\nc\u00b2a=2500*200=500,000\n\nc\u00b2b=2500*50=125,000\n\nAdding them up:\n\n2,000,000 +2,000,000 =4,000,000\n\n+500,000 =4,500,000\n\n+125,000 =4,625,000\n\n+500,000 =5,125,000\n\n+125,000 =5,250,000. Not 6,000,000. So that's not a solution.\n\nHmm, maybe another combination. Let's try a= 120, b= 130, c=50. Wait, but maybe a better approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the equation we derived earlier: 100Q - P = 2,000,000 where Q = ab + bc + ca and P = abc.\n\nWe also know that a + b + c =300. Let me see if there's a way to parameterize variables here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express variables as 100 + x, 100 + y, 100 + z, where x + y + z =0. Since 100 +100 +100 =300, so any deviation from that would require variables to be offset.\n\nLet me try that substitution. Let me set:\n\nLet a =100 + x,\n\nb =100 + y,\n\nc =100 + z,\n\nso that x + y + z =0.\n\nThen, substitute into the equations.\n\nFirst, compute Q =ab + bc + ca.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nab = (100 +x)(100 + y) =100\u00b2 +100y +100x +xy\n\nSimilarly,\n\nbc = (100 + y)(100 + z) =100\u00b2 +100z +100y + y z,\n\nca = (100 + z)(100 +x) =100\u00b2 +100x +100 z + z x.\n\nAdding these together:\n\nab + bc + ca =3*100\u00b2 + 100(y + z +x + y + z +x) + (xy + y z + z x).\n\nWait, let me compute term by term:\n\nFirst, the constants: 3*(100)^2 =30,000.\n\nThen, the linear terms in x, y, z:\n\nLooking at the terms with x, y, z:\n\nIn ab: 100y +100x,\n\nIn bc:100z +100y,\n\nIn ca:100x +100z.\n\nAdding all together:\n\nFor x terms:100x (from ab) +100x (from ca) = 200x,\n\nSimilarly for y:100y (ab) +100y (bc) =200y,\n\nSimilarly for z:100z (bc) +100z (ca)=200z,\n\nSo total linear terms:200x +200y +200z =200(x + y + z). But since x + y + z =0, this term is zero.\n\nThen the cross terms: xy + y z + z x.\n\nTherefore, Q=30,000 + (xy + y z + z x).\n\nSimilarly, compute P = abc.\n\nabc = (100 +x)(100 + y)(100 + z).\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nFirst multiply two terms: (100 +x)(100 + y) =100\u00b2 +100(y +x) + xy,\n\nThen multiply by (100 + z):\n\n= [100\u00b2 +100(x + y) + xy]*(100 + z)\n\n=100\u00b2*100 +100\u00b2 z +100(x + y)*100 +100(x + y) z + xy*100 + xy z\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: 100^3,\n\nSecond term:100\u00b2 z,\n\nThird term:100(x + y)*100 =100\u00b2(x + y),\n\nFourth term:100(x + y) z,\n\nFifth term: xy*100,\n\nSixth term: xy z.\n\nCombine terms:\n\n=100^3 +100\u00b2(z +x + y) +100[ (x + y) z + xy ] + xyz.\n\nBut since x + y + z=0, so z = -x - y,\n\nTherefore, substitute z = -x - y:\n\nFirst term remains 1,000,000.\n\nSecond term:100\u00b2*(-x - y +x + y)=100\u00b2*(0)=0.\n\nThird term:\n\n100[ (x + y)(-x - y) + xy ]\n\nLet me compute (x + y)(-x - y) = - (x + y)^2,\n\nThus, the third term becomes 100[ - (x + y)^2 + xy ]\n\nFourth term: xyz =x y (-x - y) = -x\u00b2 y -x y\u00b2.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nP =1,000,000 +100[ - (x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2) + xy ] - x\u00b2 y - x y\u00b2\n\nSimplify the third term inside:\n\n- (x\u00b2 +2xy + y\u00b2) +xy = -x\u00b2 -2xy -y\u00b2 +xy = -x\u00b2 -xy - y\u00b2\n\nThus, third term:100*(-x\u00b2 -xy - y\u00b2)\n\nFourth term: -x\u00b2 y -x y\u00b2.\n\nThus,\n\nP =1,000,000 -100x\u00b2 -100xy -100y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 y -x y\u00b2.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but maybe we can relate this to Q.\n\nRecall that Q =30,000 + (xy + y z + z x). Since z = -x -y,\n\nCompute cross terms:\n\nxy + y z + z x = xy + y*(-x -y) + (-x -y)*x\n\n= xy -xy - y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 -xy\n\n= -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 -xy.\n\nTherefore, Q =30,000 + ( -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 -xy )\n\nSo, Q =30,000 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +xy).\n\nTherefore, the equation 100Q - P =2,000,000 becomes:\n\n100*(30,000 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +xy)) - [1,000,000 -100x\u00b2 -100xy -100y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 y -x y\u00b2 ] =2,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst term:100*(30,000 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +xy)) = 3,000,000 -100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 -100xy.\n\nSecond term: - [1,000,000 -100x\u00b2 -100xy -100y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 y -x y\u00b2 ]\n\n= -1,000,000 +100x\u00b2 +100xy +100y\u00b2 +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2.\n\nSo adding both terms together:\n\nFirst terms:3,000,000 -100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 -100xy\n\nSecond terms: -1,000,000 +100x\u00b2 +100xy +100y\u00b2 +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2\n\nCombine:\n\n3,000,000 -1,000,000 =2,000,000\n\n-100x\u00b2 +100x\u00b2=0\n\n-100y\u00b2 +100y\u00b2=0\n\n-100xy +100xy=0\n\nThen remaining terms: +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2.\n\nThus, total expression is:\n\n2,000,000 + x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2 =2,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the equation reduces to:\n\nx\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2 =0.\n\nFactor out xy:\n\nxy(x + y) =0.\n\nSo this equation holds if either x=0, y=0, or x + y=0.\n\nBut remember that z = -x - y, so x + y = -z. So x + y =0 would mean z=0.\n\nTherefore, the equation reduces to:\n\nEither x=0, y=0, or z=0 (since x + y = -z, so x + y =0 \u21d2 z=0).\n\nTherefore, the solutions must satisfy that at least one of x, y, z is zero.\n\nBut since x + y + z=0, if one of them is zero, say x=0, then y + z=0 \u21d2 z= -y. So variables would be a=100 +0=100, b=100 + y, c=100 - y. So in this case, two variables would be 100 + y and 100 - y, and the third is 100. So, for example, if x=0, then a=100, and b and c are symmetric around 100. Similarly if y=0 or z=0.\n\nAlternatively, if two variables are zero, say x=0 and y=0, then z=0, so all variables are 100. Which is the all-100 case.\n\nTherefore, the only solutions are those where at least one of the variables is 100, and the other two are symmetric around 100 (i.e., differing by some y and -y). Wait, but let's see.\n\nWait, let's consider the cases:\n\nCase 1: x=0. Then variables are (100, 100 + y, 100 - y). To ensure nonnegative integers, we need 100 + y \u22650 and 100 - y \u22650 \u21d2 y can range from -100 to +100, but since variables are nonnegative, 100 + y \u22650 and 100 - y \u22650 \u21d2 y between -100 and 100. But since y must be integer, but also a, b, c must be nonnegative integers. So y can be from -100 to +100, but such that 100 + y and 100 - y are nonnegative. So y can be from -100 to +100, but effectively y must be between -100 and 100, but such that 100 + y and 100 - y are nonnegative. So actually y can be from -100 to +100, but if y is negative, say y = -k where k \u22650, then 100 + y =100 -k and 100 - y =100 +k. So in any case, variables are (100, 100 + |y|, 100 - |y|). So the variables are 100, 100 +k, 100 -k where k is a nonnegative integer such that 100 -k \u22650 \u21d2k \u2264100.\n\nTherefore, in this case, for each k from 0 to 100, we can have triples (100, 100 +k, 100 -k). But note that when k=0, this gives (100,100,100). For k=1 to 100, this gives distinct triples. However, note that for each k, the triples can be arranged in different permutations. For example, if k=50, then the triple is (100, 150,50). But this can also be arranged as (150,100,50), etc. Wait, but in our substitution, we fixed a=100. So actually, in this case, the variable a is fixed as 100, so the triples are (100, 100+k, 100 -k). To account for permutations, we need to consider all orderings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solutions are all triples where one of the variables is 100, and the other two add up to 200 and differ by 2k. Wait, actually, let me see.\n\nWait, the case when x=0 gives triples with a=100, and the other two variables being 100 + y and 100 - y. Similarly, if y=0, then b=100, and a and c are 100 \u00b1x, and similarly for z=0. Therefore, all solutions where one variable is 100, and the other two add up to 200 and are symmetric around 100.\n\nTherefore, all such triples can be obtained by choosing one variable to be 100, and then the other two variables being 100 +k and 100 -k for some integer k between 0 and 100. However, we have to consider permutations. Let's see.\n\nFirst, for each variable being the fixed 100, there are three possibilities (a=100, b=100, or c=100). For each of these, the other two variables can be (100 +k, 100 -k) for k from 0 to 100. However, note that when k=0, this gives the triple (100,100,100), which is the same regardless of which variable is fixed. So when considering permutations, we have to be careful not to overcount.\n\nLet me think of all possible triples:\n\nCase 1: All three variables are 100: (100,100,100). This is counted once.\n\nCase 2: Exactly one variable is 100, and the other two are (100 +k, 100 -k) where k \u22600. For each such k (1 \u2264k \u2264100), there are three permutations depending on which variable is 100. For example, if k=50, the triples would be (100,150,50), (150,100,50), (150,50,100), etc. Each of these is distinct unless the other two variables are equal, but since k\u22600, 100 +k \u2260100 -k unless k=0. So each k gives 3 distinct triples. However, when k=100, then 100 -k =0, so one of the variables becomes 0. Wait, so when k=100, the other two variables are 200 and 0. So the triples would be (100,200,0) and permutations. But earlier when we considered c=0, we had (200,100,0) etc. So actually, the case where one variable is 100 and another is 200, and the third 0 is included here.\n\nTherefore, for each k from 1 to100, we have three ordered triples (since the 100 can be in any of the three positions). But when k=100, the non-100 variables are 200 and 0. Similarly for k=1, you get (101,99,100) etc.\n\nHowever, note that when k and -k are considered, but since k is positive, we don't have duplicates here. So total number of triples in case 2 is 3*(100) since k ranges from 1 to100. However, when k=100, the triple includes a zero, but those are already counted in this approach.\n\nWait, but actually, when k ranges from 1 to100, each gives three ordered triples, so total 3*100=300. But then adding the all-100 case gives 301? But that can't be right, because when k=100, the triples are (100,200,0), (200,100,0), (200,0,100), etc. which are 3 triples, which were already counted in the previous consideration when we considered one variable zero. Wait, but actually, in the earlier analysis, when we considered c=0, we had 6 triples where one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100. But according to this method, when k=100, each of the three positions can be the 100, leading to three triples where the other two are 200 and 0. So (100,200,0), (200,100,0), (200,0,100). But the sixth triple would be (100,0,200), (0,100,200), (0,200,100). Wait, but in this approach, if we fix the 100 in different positions, we are only getting three triples for each k. So where are the other three?\n\nAh, because when k=100, the variable that is 100 is fixed, but the other two are 200 and 0. However, if we instead fix the 200 as the non-zero non-100 variable, then perhaps? Wait no, in this case, the variables are (100 +k, 100 -k). When k=100, that becomes 200 and 0, so the variables are 100, 200,0. The other permutations where the 0 is in different positions would require different k's? Wait, perhaps not. Because if we fix a different variable as 100, like b=100, then the variables would be (200,100,0), which is the same as above. So actually, for k=100, you get exactly three triples where one variable is 100, another is 200, and the last is 0. Similarly for other k's.\n\nHowever, the triples where the zero is in different positions but the 100 is fixed in different positions are accounted for by permuting which variable is set to 100.\n\nWait, let me see. Suppose k=50, then the triples would be:\n\n(100, 150,50), (150,100,50), (150,50,100). So three triples where one variable is 100, another 150, and third 50. These are all distinct. Similarly, when k=100, (100,200,0), (200,100,0), (200,0,100). So three triples with a zero. So total triples when considering all k from 1 to 100 would be 3*100 =300. Adding the all-100 case gives 301. But this seems conflicting with previous examples.\n\nWait, but earlier I found that (150,100,50) is a solution, which is counted here as part of k=50 when a is set to 100, but actually in that case, the 100 is the second variable. Wait, but in the substitution above, when we set a=100, then the other variables are 100\u00b1k, but if we set b=100, then the variables are (100 +k, 100, 100 -k). So the triple (150,100,50) is indeed included when k=50 and b is set to 100. So each of the triples with variables in different positions are accounted for by permuting which variable is fixed as 100.\n\nHowever, when considering the case where two variables are 200 and 0 with the third being 100, there are three permutations, so that's three triples. Similarly, the triple (150,100,50) has three permutations. So in total, the total number of triples would be 3*100 (for k=1 to 100) plus 1 (the all-100 case) equals 301. But this contradicts my earlier thought that there are 6 triples with a zero and the all-100, but maybe I miscalculated before.\n\nWait, let me see. If k ranges from 1 to100, then for each k, we get three triples. So 300 triples plus the all-100 gives 301. However, when k=100, the triples are those with a zero. So the triples with a zero are exactly 3. But earlier, when I considered setting c=0, I thought there were 6 triples because any of the variables could be zero, but according to this, only 3. Wait, what's the discrepancy here?\n\nAh! Because in this substitution, the zero is always paired with 200 and 100. So for example, when k=100, the variables are 100, 200,0. But if I set a different variable to 100, like the third variable is 100, then the variables would be 200,0,100. Which is the same as (200,0,100). So each permutation is already accounted for by choosing which variable is fixed as 100. Therefore, there are exactly 3 triples where one variable is 0 and the others are 200 and100. But earlier, I thought there were 6 because I considered all permutations of (200,100,0). Wait, but actually, (200,100,0) can be arranged in 6 ways? No, actually, the number of distinct permutations of (200,100,0) is 3! /1! =6 since all elements are distinct. But according to this method, only three of them are counted. Wait, why?\n\nBecause in this substitution, the variable set to 100 is fixed. For example, to get (0,100,200), you would need to set, say, the second variable to 100, then the first variable would be 100 -100=0 and third 100 +100=200. So that's included when we set the second variable as 100 and k=100. So actually, all six permutations are included in the three cases where each variable is set to 100. Wait no, actually, if you set each of the three variables to 100 in turn, then you can get all permutations. Let's see:\n\nFor the triple (0,100,200):\n\n- Set the second variable to 100, then first is 0, third is200.\n\n- Set the first variable to 100, then second is 0, third is200? No, that would require k=-100? Wait, no, let's see.\n\nWait, when you fix the first variable as 100, then the other two variables are 100 +k and 100 -k. To get 0, you need 100 -k =0 \u21d2k=100, so the other variables are 200 and0. So the triple is (100,200,0). To get (0,100,200), you need to set the second variable as 100, so then first is 0, third is200. Similarly for third variable as 100. Thus, each permutation is obtained by fixing a different variable as 100. So for each permutation of (0,100,200), it's counted once when you set the corresponding variable to 100. So there are three triples where one variable is 100, another is 200, and the third is 0. The other permutations where the 100 is not present would require another approach, but in our case, all triples must have one variable as 100, so those permutations where two variables are 200 and0 without a 100 are not allowed. Wait, but in our analysis earlier, when we set c=0, then a +b=300, so we could have (200,100,0) but also (100,200,0), etc. So actually, the three permutations where exactly one variable is 100, another is200, and third is0 are indeed the only ones possible, because if you have two variables as 200 and0, then the third would have to be 100 to make the sum 300.\n\nWait, if you have two variables as 200 and0, then the third must be 100. So the triples with a zero must have exactly one 100, one 200, and one 0. Therefore, there are indeed 3 permutations of (100,200,0), which is three triples, not six. So my earlier mistake was thinking there were six, but actually there are three. So that reconciles with the substitution method.\n\nTherefore, according to substitution method, total triples are:\n\n- 1 triple where all are 100.\n\n- For each k from1 to100, 3 triples, so 3*100=300.\n\nTotal triples:301.\n\nWait, but when k=50, for example, gives three triples: (100,150,50), (150,100,50), (150,50,100). These are all distinct and valid.\n\nSimilarly, when k=1, we get triples like (100,101,99), (101,100,99), (101,99,100), etc.\n\nThus, the total number of triples is 301.\n\nBut earlier, when I found the triple (150,100,50), which is counted here, and the triples with zeros are also counted here.\n\nHowever, in the problem statement, the triples are ordered? Wait, no, the problem says \"triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c)\". In combinatorics, usually, a triple (a,b,c) is considered ordered unless stated otherwise. Wait, but in some cases, triples are considered unordered. Wait, the problem says \"the number of triples\", so probably ordered triples. Let me confirm the problem statement:\n\n\"Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c) satisfying a + b + c = 300 and ...\"\n\nSince it specifies the triple as (a,b,c), it's likely ordered triples. Therefore, the total number is 301. But wait, hold on, let me check if there are overlapping cases.\n\nWait, when k=100, we get triples like (100,200,0). Similarly when k= -100? Wait, but k is from1 to100. So no overlaps. Each k from1 to100 is unique. So total is indeed 301.\n\nBut wait, let me check if when k=100, the variables are (100,200,0) and permutations. But when k=100, the variables are 100 +100=200 and 100 -100=0. So that's correct. So each k gives three ordered triples, so 3*100=300, plus the all-100 case gives 301.\n\nBut wait, earlier, when I considered the case where c=0, I thought there were three triples with a zero, but according to this, those are included in the 300. So total is 301.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that all these triples actually satisfy the second equation.\n\nWait, let's test another triple from the substitution method. Let's take k=1, so the triples would be (100,101,99). Let's compute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nLet me compute for (100,101,99):\n\na=100, b=101, c=99.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b =100\u00b2*101 =10,000*101=1,010,000\n\na\u00b2c =100\u00b2*99 =10,000*99=990,000\n\nb\u00b2a =101\u00b2*100= (10,201)*100=1,020,100\n\nb\u00b2c =101\u00b2*99=10,201*99=1,009,899\n\nc\u00b2a =99\u00b2*100=9,801*100=980,100\n\nc\u00b2b =99\u00b2*101=9,801*101=990, 901? Wait let's compute:\n\n99\u00b2 is 9801. 9801 *101 =9801*(100 +1)=980,100 +9,801= 990, 901? Wait 980,100 +9,801= 990, 901? Wait 980,100 +9,801= 989,901. Wait, let me compute:\n\n9801 *101:\n\nFirst, 9801 *100=980,100,\n\nplus 9801*1=9,801,\n\nTotal: 980,100 +9,801 =990,  (980,100 +9,801)= 990,  (980,100+9,801)=989,901? Wait 980,100 +9,801 is 980,100 +9,801 = 989,901.\n\nWait, so c\u00b2b=990,901? Wait no, that's 989,901.\n\nWait, let's sum all terms:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c =1,010,000 +990,000 =2,000,000\n\nb\u00b2a +b\u00b2c =1,020,100 +1,009,899 =2,030,  (1,020,100 +1,009,899 = 2,029,999?)\n\nWait let me compute 1,020,100 +1,009,899:\n\n1,020,100 +1,009,899 = (1,020,000 +1,009,000) + (100 +899) = 2,029,000 +999 =2,030,  (2,029,000 +999)=2,029,999.\n\nThen c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b =980,100 +989,901 =1,970,001?\n\nWait 980,100 +989,901 = 1,970,001?\n\nWait, 980,100 +989,901:\n\n980,100 + 989,901 = (980,000 +989,900) + (100 +1) = 1,969,900 +101 =1,969,  (1,969,900 +101)=1,970,001.\n\nSo total sum:\n\n2,000,000 +2,029,999 +1,970,001.\n\nFirst, 2,000,000 +2,029,999 =4,029,999\n\nThen +1,970,001 =4,029,999 +1,970,001 =6,000,000. Perfect, so it works. So this triple is valid.\n\nTherefore, the substitution method works. So total triples are 301. But wait, but let me think again.\n\nWait, the substitution approach assumes that one variable is exactly 100. But could there be triples where none of the variables are 100, but still satisfy the equation? Earlier, we found that the equation reduces to xy(x + y)=0 when expressed in terms of x,y,z. Which requires at least one of x,y,z is zero, meaning at least one variable is 100. Therefore, all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100. So there are no solutions with all variables different from 100. Therefore, the total number of triples is indeed 301.\n\nWait, but the problem says nonnegative integers. So including zeros. But according to substitution, we have all triples accounted for where one variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200 and differ by 2k. So for each k from0 to100 (where k=0 gives all 100s), and for each k from1 to100, three ordered triples. So total is 1 + 3*100 = 301.\n\nHowever, let me check when k=0, it's only one triple (all 100s). For k from1 to100, each gives three ordered triples. So total is 301.\n\nBut the problem asks for the number of triples of nonnegative integers. So that would be 301. But wait, in the earlier example where I found (150,100,50), which is counted here, and the triples with a zero are also counted here. So why did I initially think there were 6 triples with a zero? Because I considered permutations where the zero can be in any position, but in reality, each such permutation is counted once when you fix the 100 in a specific position. So total number is indeed 301.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify with another example. Let me take k=50, which gives triples (100,150,50), (150,100,50), (150,50,100). Each of these is distinct and valid, and they are all counted in the substitution approach. Similarly, for k=100, the triples (100,200,0), (200,100,0), (200,0,100) are all valid and distinct. So yes, that's 3 each. So 3*100 +1=301.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if there are any overlaps. For instance, if k=50 and another k gives the same triple in a different way? Probably not, since each k defines a unique spread from 100. So no overlaps. So total is 301.\n\nWait, but let me think of another way. The equation reduces to needing one variable to be 100. So the problem reduces to finding all ordered triples where one variable is 100, and the other two add up to 200 and are symmetric around 100. So the two variables can be (100 +k, 100 -k) where k is from 0 to100. For each such pair, and for each choice of which variable is fixed at 100, we have an ordered triple. \n\nThe number of such triples is calculated as follows:\n\n- Choose which variable is fixed at 100: 3 choices.\n\n- For each such choice, the other two variables can be (100 +k,100 -k) where k ranges from 0 to100. However, when k=0, this is (100,100), so the triple is (100,100,100) regardless of which variable is chosen. Therefore, the all-100 triple is counted three times in this method (once for each variable being chosen as the fixed 100). To correct this overcounting, we need to adjust:\n\nTotal triples counted with this method (without considering overcount):\n\n3 (choices for fixed variable) \u00d7 (101 values of k from 0 to100) = 3\u00d7101=303.\n\nBut the all-100 triple is counted three times (once for each variable), but it should be only once. So subtract 2 duplicates: 303 -2=301. So that matches.\n\nTherefore, the correct total is 301.\n\nWait, but let me see:\n\nAlternatively, the number of ordered triples where one specific variable is fixed at 100, and the other two variables are (100 +k,100 -k). For each variable (a,b,c), we have:\n\nFor each variable being fixed (3 options), and for each k from 0 to100 (101 options), we have a triple. But when k=0, all triples for the three variables are the same (all 100s). So total triples would be:\n\n3*(101) - 2*(1) =303 -2=301. Because when k=0, we have three triples that are all the same, so we subtract two duplicates.\n\nTherefore, the total is 301.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 301. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"nonnegative integers\", so k can be from 0 to100 inclusive. For each variable (a,b,c), choosing to fix it as 100, and then for each k from 0 to100, you have a triple. So for each variable:\n\nNumber of triples where that variable is fixed at 100: 101 (k from 0 to100). But when k=0, this is the all-100 triple. So total triples counted this way would be 3\u00d7101=303, but overlapping at the all-100 case which is counted three times. So subtract 2 duplicates to get 301.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as:\n\nThe total number of triples where at least one variable is 100, and the other two add to 200 and are symmetric around 100. To count this without overcounting:\n\n- The all-100 triple: 1.\n\n- Triples with exactly one 100: For each of the three positions where the 100 can be, and for each k from1 to100, giving 3\u00d7100=300.\n\nTotal is 1+300=301. That's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 301.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me confirm with another example. Let's take k=1 and see how many triples that is. For k=1, and choosing a to be fixed at 100, we get (100,101,99). Choosing b to be 100 gives (101,100,99). Choosing c to be 100 gives (101,99,100). So three distinct triples. Similarly, for each k from1 to100, three triples. So 3\u00d7100=300. Plus the all-100 case. So total 301.\n\nTherefore, I think this is correct.\n\nBut the problem is from an Olympiad, perhaps the answer is different? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution approach.\n\nWait, let me think of the equation 100Q - P =2,000,000. We derived that this requires one variable to be 100. So all solutions must have at least one 100. Therefore, the total number is indeed 301.\n\nHowever, I want to make sure that in the case when two variables are 100. For instance, if two variables are 100, say a=100, b=100, then c=100. So that's the all-100 case. If two variables are 100, but the third isn't, like (100,100,100) is the only case. Because if two variables are 100, then the third must be 100 to sum to 300. So there are no triples with exactly two 100s. So the only triples are either all three 100s or exactly one 100 and the other two adding to 200 and differing by 2k.\n\nTherefore, the count is correct as 301.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so zero is allowed. So the triples like (100,200,0) are allowed and are counted here.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 301.\n\nWait, but let me see if there's another way to think of it. The number of ordered triples with a + b + c =300, and one of a,b,c is 100. Let me compute that:\n\nThe number of triples where a=100, then b + c =200. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to b +c =200 is 201 (from b=0 to200). Similarly for b=100 and c=100. So total is 3\u00d7201=603. But this counts triples where two variables are 100 multiple times. For example, the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times (once in each category). Similarly, a triple like (100,100,100) is counted three times, and triples with two 100s are counted twice. But wait, actually, if two variables are 100, say a=100 and b=100, then c=100, which is the all-100 case. There are no triples with exactly two 100s because a + b +c=300 would require the third variable to also be 100. So actually, all triples counted in the 3\u00d7201 are either:\n\n- All three variables 100: counted three times.\n\n- Exactly one variable 100: counted once.\n\nTherefore, to get the correct count:\n\nTotal triples with at least one 100 = (3\u00d7201) - 2\u00d71 (subtracting the duplicates of the all-100 case counted three times, so subtract 2 to leave one). So total is 603 -2=601? Wait, that contradicts previous result. Wait, what's happening here?\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe count of triples where a=100 is 201 (b and c from 0 to200).\n\nSimilarly for b=100 and c=100. So total is 3\u00d7201=603.\n\nBut triples with two 100s would be triples where, say, a=100 and b=100, which requires c=100. So only the all-100 triple is counted three times in the total 603. So to get the correct count of triples with at least one 100, we have:\n\nTotal = (number with a=100) + (number with b=100) + (number with c=100) - 2*(number with all three 100). Because the all-100 triple is counted three times, so subtract twice to leave one.\n\nWait, inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\nNumber with at least one 100 = (A + B + C) - (AB + AC + BC) + ABC,\n\nwhere A is triples with a=100, etc. But since triples with two 100s are only possible if all three are 100. Because if two are 100, the third must be 100. So AB (triples with a=100 and b=100) is just the all-100 triple. Similarly for AC and BC. And ABC is also the same triple.\n\nTherefore,\n\nNumber with at least one 100 = (3\u00d7201) - (3\u00d71) +1 =603 -3 +1=601.\n\nWait, so according to inclusion-exclusion, it's 601. But that contradicts the previous result of 301.\n\nHmm, so now I'm confused. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait a second, the problem isn't all triples with at least one 100, but triples with at least one 100 AND satisfying the second equation. The substitution method gave 301, but the inclusion-exclusion here is for all triples with at least one 100, but we have constraints from the second equation. So the inclusion-exclusion here is not applicable here because we have an additional condition.\n\nAh, right. So the 301 comes from the fact that not all triples with a 100 will satisfy the second equation, but in our substitution, we found that exactly those triples where one variable is 100 and the other two are symmetric around 100 (i.e., differing by 2k) satisfy the equation. So the count of 301 is correct for the equation's solutions.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion counts all triples with at least one 100, but most of those won't satisfy the second equation. Therefore, my previous calculation of 301 is correct for the problem's constraints.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 301.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another angle.\n\nLet me think of variables a, b, c with one of them being 100. Let\u2019s say a=100, then b +c =200. The second equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 100\u00b2(b +c) +ab\u00b2 +ac\u00b2 + bc\u00b2 +cb\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe better to substitute a=100 into the second equation:\n\nGiven a=100, then b +c =200.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n=100\u00b2b +100\u00b2c + b\u00b2*100 +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2*100 +c\u00b2b\n\n=100\u00b2(b +c) +100(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) + bc(b +c).\n\nSince b +c =200,\n\n=100\u00b2*200 +100(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) + bc*200.\n\nWe need this to equal 6,000,000.\n\nCompute 100\u00b2*200 =10,000*200 =2,000,000.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n2,000,000 +100(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) +200bc =6,000,000.\n\nSubtract 2,000,000:\n\n100(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) +200bc =4,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 100:\n\nb\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2bc =40,000.\n\nBut b\u00b2 +2bc +c\u00b2 = (b +c)^2 =200\u00b2=40,000.\n\nSo this equation reduces to 40,000 =40,000. Which is always true!\n\nWait, that's interesting. So whenever a=100 and b +c=200, the equation is automatically satisfied?\n\nWait, so that means that all triples where one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200 satisfy the second equation?\n\nWait, that's a big deal. Then my previous substitution approach was correct, but the conclusion is even stronger. If one variable is 100 and the others add to 200, then the second equation is satisfied regardless of their values? Let me verify with an example.\n\nTake a=100, b=0, c=200. Then compute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b\n\n=100\u00b2*0 +100\u00b2*200 +0\u00b2*100 +0\u00b2*200 +200\u00b2*100 +200\u00b2*0\n\n=0 +20,000*100 +0 +0 +40,000*100 +0\n\n=2,000,000 +4,000,000=6,000,000. Correct.\n\nAnother example, a=100, b=50, c=150:\n\nCompute:\n\n100\u00b2*50 +100\u00b2*150 +50\u00b2*100 +50\u00b2*150 +150\u00b2*100 +150\u00b2*50\n\n=500,000 +1,500,000 +250,000 +375,000 +225,000*100 +225,000*50\n\nWait wait, let me compute term by term:\n\na\u00b2b =100\u00b2*50=500,000\n\na\u00b2c=100\u00b2*150=1,500,000\n\nb\u00b2a=2500*100=250,000\n\nb\u00b2c=2500*150=375,000\n\nc\u00b2a=22,500*100=2,250,000\n\nc\u00b2b=22,500*50=1,125,000\n\nNow adding all together:\n\n500,000 +1,500,000 =2,000,000\n\n+250,000 =2,250,000\n\n+375,000 =2,625,000\n\n+2,250,000 =4,875,000\n\n+1,125,000 =6,000,000. Perfect.\n\nSo indeed, any a=100 with b +c=200 will satisfy the equation. Therefore, the second equation is automatically satisfied when one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200. Therefore, the number of triples is exactly the number of ordered triples where one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200.\n\nTherefore, to count them:\n\nFor each of the three variables (a, b, c), set it to 100, then the other two variables must be nonnegative integers adding to 200. The number of solutions for each case is 201 (since for two nonnegative integers summing to 200, there are 201 solutions: from 0 to200). Therefore, total is 3\u00d7201=603. But this counts triples where two variables are 100 multiple times.\n\nSpecifically, the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times (once for each variable being set to 100). All other triples with exactly one 100 are counted once. Triples with two 100s are impossible because the third would have to be 100 as well.\n\nThus, using inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal triples =3\u00d7201 -2\u00d71=603 -2=601. Wait, but this contradicts the previous conclusion that all such triples satisfy the equation. Wait, but if the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times, but should only be counted once, so we subtract 2 duplicates. But according to the problem's conditions, the triple (100,100,100) is valid and should be counted once. The other triples are counted correctly.\n\nHowever, the problem requires the triples to satisfy both equations. Since all triples with one variable as 100 and the other two adding to 200 satisfy the second equation, then the total number is indeed 3\u00d7201 - 2\u00d71=601? But this contradicts the earlier analysis where we saw that when substituting, the equation requires that the other two variables are symmetric around 100, i.e., differing by 2k. But according to this, any pair adding to 200 works, regardless of their difference.\n\nWait, so there's a contradiction here. Where is the mistake?\n\nWait, let me re-examine the substitution approach:\n\nEarlier, I thought that when substituting variables as a=100 +x, etc., we ended up with the equation requiring that one of x,y,z is zero, but perhaps I made a mistake there?\n\nWait, let me re-express the problem.\n\nSuppose we have a triple where one variable is 100, say a=100, then b +c =200. Then the second equation reduces to 6,000,000 automatically. So in fact, any such triple satisfies the equation. So there's no requirement that the other two variables are symmetric around 100. For example, the triple (100, 200,0) is valid, but also (100, 199,1) is valid. So why did the substitution approach suggest that variables must be symmetric?\n\nAh! Here's the mistake. Earlier, when I set a =100 +x, b=100 +y, c=100 +z with x+y+z=0, I assumed that the variables are expressed as deviations from 100. But when we set a=100, and b +c =200, then variables b and c can be anything as long as they sum to 200, so their deviations from 100 can be anything as long as they sum to zero (since b -100 +c -100 = (b +c) -200=0). So actually, in this substitution, variables b and c can be any pair adding to 200, so their deviations y and z must satisfy y + z =0, so z =-y. Therefore, variables are (100,100 +y,100 -y). Thus, variables b and c must be symmetric around 100. Therefore, the earlier substitution approach is correct, and my later thought that any pair adding to 200 works is incorrect.\n\nWait, but in the example above with (100, 200,0), that is (100,100+100,100-100), which fits the substitution. Similarly, (100,199,1) would require y=99 and z= -99, so variables are 100+99=199 and100-99=1. So yes, this is allowed. So actually, the substitution approach allows any y from -100 to +100, but when expressed in terms of the variables, it's allowed as long as they are symmetric around 100. So the variables can be any pair adding to 200, but their deviations must be symmetric. So in effect, any pair (b,c) with b +c=200 can be written as (100 +y, 100 -y). Therefore, the substitution approach is correct, and the variables are indeed constrained to be symmetric around 100. However, when I considered the general case of setting a=100 and b +c=200, I thought that any b and c would work, but actually, the substitution shows that they must be symmetric. But wait, in the algebra above, when we set a=100, the equation reduces to an identity, so it must be that any b and c with b +c=200 work, regardless of their individual values.\n\nThere's a contradiction here. Let me re-examine the algebra:\n\nWhen a=100 and b +c=200, then the second equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2(b +c) +ab\u00b2 +ac\u00b2 + bc(b +c) = ?\n\nWait, let me recompute the second equation with a=100, b +c=200.\n\nThe second equation is:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= a\u00b2(b + c) + a(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + bc(b + c)\n\nSubstituting a=100, b +c=200:\n\n=100\u00b2*200 +100*(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) + bc*200\n\nWe need this to equal 6,000,000.\n\nBut let's see what b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 is in terms of (b +c)^2:\n\nb\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = (b +c)^2 - 2bc =200\u00b2 -2bc =40,000 -2bc.\n\nTherefore:\n\n100*(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2)=100*(40,000 -2bc)=4,000,000 -200bc.\n\nAdding the other terms:\n\n100\u00b2*200 =2,000,000,\n\n+4,000,000 -200bc,\n\n+200bc*(from bc*200 term)\n\nWait, the last term is bc*200.\n\nSo total expression:\n\n2,000,000 +4,000,000 -200bc +200bc =6,000,000.\n\nThe -200bc and +200bc cancel out, so the equation reduces to 6,000,000=6,000,000. So it's always true, regardless of bc. Therefore, any b and c with b +c=200 will satisfy the equation when a=100. Therefore, my substitution approach was incorrect in requiring symmetry. The substitution introduced the symmetry because I expressed variables as deviations from 100, but in reality, the equation allows any b and c as long as they sum to 200, even if they aren't symmetric. Therefore, there's a mistake in the substitution approach earlier.\n\nWait, but how does this reconcile with the substitution method?\n\nAh! In the substitution approach where we set a=100 +x, etc., we ended up with the condition that xy(x + y)=0. However, in this case, when we set a=100, that corresponds to x=0, and then the condition reduces to 0*y*(y)=0, which is always true, so there's no restriction on y. Therefore, variables b and c can be anything as long as their deviations from 100 sum to zero (since x +y +z=0). Wait, but if a=100 (x=0), then y +z=0 \u21d2 z = -y, so variables b=100 +y, c=100 -y. So their deviations must be negatives of each other, meaning they are symmetric around 100. But according to the direct substitution above, they can be any values adding to 200. So which is correct?\n\nWait, if we set a=100, then variables b and c must satisfy b +c=200, but in the substitution variables, b=100 +y and c=100 -y, so b +c=200, but also bc = (100 +y)(100 -y)=100\u00b2 -y\u00b2. However, in the general case, b and c can be any numbers adding to 200, so bc can vary. But according to the substitution approach, bc is constrained to 100\u00b2 -y\u00b2. So there is a discrepancy.\n\nWait, the mistake must be in the substitution approach's derivation. Let me go back.\n\nWhen I set a=100 +x, b=100 +y, c=100 +z with x+y+z=0, then the equation reduced to xy(x + y)=0. However, if a is set to 100 (x=0), then this equation becomes 0*y*(y)=0, which is always true, so there's no restriction on y and z (as long as z=-y). Therefore, the substitution approach allows any y, so variables b and c can be any pair adding to 200 (since b +c =200). Therefore, the substitution approach actually does allow any b and c adding to 200, which matches the direct computation.\n\nTherefore, my earlier mistake was thinking that the substitution required the variables to be symmetric in some other way, but actually, it's okay. So in this case, when a=100, b and c can be any pair adding to 200, so their deviations can be any y and -y. Thus, the number of triples where a=100 is indeed 201 (from y=-100 to +100, but since b and c must be nonnegative, y ranges from -100 to +100, but ensuring that 100 +y \u22650 and 100 -y \u22650 \u21d2 y between -100 and +100. But actually, when y is from -100 to +100, the values are:\n\nFor b=100 +y and c=100 -y:\n\n- When y ranges from -100 to +100:\n\n- For y=-100: b=0, c=200\n\n- For y=+100: b=200, c=0\n\n- So the values of b go from 0 to200, and c correspondingly from200 to0. Thus, there are 201 possibilities (from y=-100 to y=+100, which is 201 values). So yes, each variable can be set to 100, giving 201 triples, and three variables give 3\u00d7201=603, but subtract duplicates for the all-100 case counted three times, so total 603-2=601.\n\nBut this contradicts the substitution approach where we had 301.\n\nWait, now I'm really confused. There must be a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf the second equation is satisfied for any triple where one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200, then the number of solutions is indeed the number of ordered triples where one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200. \n\nTo count this:\n\nFor each of the three variables (a, b, c), set it to 100, then the other two variables must be nonnegative integers adding to 200. The number of solutions for two variables adding to200 is 201 (since they can be (0,200), (1,199), ..., (200,0)). So for each variable, 201 solutions, totaling 3\u00d7201=603. However, the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times (once for each variable being set to 100), so we subtract 2 duplicates to get 603\u22122=601.\n\nBut in the substitution approach, I had a different count. Where is the error?\n\nWait, the substitution approach required that variables are expressed as (100 +x, 100 +y, 100 +z) with x+y+z=0 and the equation reducing to xy(x+y)=0, leading to variables needing at least one of x,y,z to be zero. Which allows for variables like (100, 200,0), (100, 0,200), etc., but also (100, 1,199), (100,199,1), etc. So that should also allow all those cases. Therefore, the substitution approach's total count is indeed 3\u00d7201 -2=601.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the substitution approach gave 301 because I considered that for each k from 0 to100, there are three triples. But that was a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me re-examine that substitution approach:\n\nWhen I set a=100 +x, b=100 +y, c=100 +z with x+y+z=0, the equation reduces to requiring that at least one of x,y,z is zero. So for each variable being zero, we can have solutions.\n\nIf x=0 (i.e., a=100), then y + z =0, so z=-y. Therefore, the other variables are b=100 +y and c=100 -y, with y ranging over all integers such that b and c are nonnegative. Since y can be from -100 to +100, giving 201 possibilities. Similarly for y=0 and z=0.\n\nTherefore, for each variable being zero (i.e., a=100, b=100, or c=100), there are 201 triples. Thus, total is 3\u00d7201=603, subtract 2 for the triple counted three times, giving 601.\n\nTherefore, my initial substitution approach had an error in counting. I incorrectly considered k from 1 to100 and multiplied by 3, but actually, k can range from -100 to +100 (201 possibilities) for each variable. Hence the correct total is 601.\n\nBut this contradicts the earlier example where I thought the answer was 301. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in my first substitution approach, I considered k from 1 to100 and thought that each gives three triples, but that was incorrect because when you set a variable to 100, the other variables can range over all pairs adding to 200, which is 201 possibilities, not 100. So the correct count is 201 per variable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 601?\n\nBut let me verify with the example triples:\n\n- (100,100,100) is one triple.\n\n- For triples with a=100 and b ranging from0 to200, there are 201 triples where a=100.\n\nSimilarly for b=100 and c=100. So total triples where a=100:201, same for others. The overlap is only the all-100 triple counted three times. Thus, total triples are 3\u00d7201 -2\u00d71=601.\n\nBut let me check with the triple (100, 200,0). This is counted once in a=100 (when b=200, c=0), once in b=100 (when a=200, c=0), and once in c=100 (when a=200, b=0). Wait, no, actually:\n\nWait, the triple (100,200,0):\n\n- When considering a=100, it is counted as (100,200,0).\n\n- When considering b=100, it would be (200,100,0).\n\n- When considering c=100, it would be (200,0,100).\n\nSo each permutation is counted in a different variable's count, so the triple (100,200,0) is only counted once in the a=100 count, and similarly for the other permutations. The only triple that's counted multiple times is the all-100 one.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct triples is indeed 3\u00d7201 - 2 =601.\n\nBut then why did the substitution approach initially give me 301? Because I incorrectly limited k to 1 to100 and considered only triples where the other two variables were symmetric around 100 with k from1 to100, but in reality, the variables can be any pair adding to 200, so there are 201 possibilities for each variable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 601.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's take a specific case: the triple (100, 1,199). Is this a valid solution?\n\nCompute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\na=100, b=1, c=199.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b =100\u00b2*1 =10,000.\n\na\u00b2c =100\u00b2*199 =1,990,000.\n\nb\u00b2a =1\u00b2*100=100.\n\nb\u00b2c =1\u00b2*199=199.\n\nc\u00b2a =199\u00b2*100 = (39,601)*100=3,960,100.\n\nc\u00b2b =199\u00b2*1=39,601.\n\nNow sum all terms:\n\n10,000 +1,990,000 =2,000,000\n\n+100 =2,000,100\n\n+199 =2,000,300-?\n\nWait step by step:\n\nFirst two terms:10,000 +1,990,000 =2,000,000\n\nAdd b\u00b2a: +100 \u21922,000,100\n\nAdd b\u00b2c: +199 \u21922,000,299\n\nAdd c\u00b2a: +3,960,100 \u21922,000,299 +3,960,100 =5,960,399\n\nAdd c\u00b2b: +39,601 \u21925,960,399 +39,601 =6,000,000.\n\nYes, it works. So (100,1,199) is a valid solution. Therefore, indeed any triple where one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200 is valid, so there are 201\u00d73 -2=601 solutions.\n\nTherefore, my initial substitution approach was incorrect because I limited k to 1 to100, but actually k can range from -100 to +100, giving 201 possibilities for each variable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 601.\n\nBut then why did the equation derived through substitution give that variables must be symmetric? Let me see:\n\nWhen I set a=100 +x, b=100 +y, c=100 +z, with x+y+z=0, the condition derived was that xy(x+y)=0. If x=0 (a=100), then this condition is satisfied regardless of y and z (since x=0). Therefore, variables b and c can be any values as long as they add to 200. So there's no requirement for symmetry, so the substitution approach does allow all such triples. Therefore, the total count is indeed 601.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial substitution analysis where I thought the variables had to be symmetric. The error was in thinking that variables needed to be symmetric, but in reality, the substitution allows any pair adding to 200.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 601.\n\nWait, but this contradicts the earlier example where I thought of the triple (150,100,50). Which is counted in the 601.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe triple (150,100,50) has a=150, b=100, c=50. Here, b=100, so it is counted in the b=100 case. The other two variables a +c =200. So it's a valid solution, and is counted once in the b=100 count. So yes, it's included.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 601.\n\nBut then why did I get 301 earlier? Because I was considering only the cases where the two variables are symmetric around 100 (i.e., their deviations are y and -y), which is a subset of all possible pairs adding to 200. However, the equation allows any pairs adding to 200, so there are twice as many possibilities as I initially considered (since for each k from0 to100, you have two triples except when symmetric). Wait, no, actually the number of ordered triples where a=100 and b and c add to200 is 201, which includes all possible ordered pairs (b,c). For example, when b=0, c=200 and vice versa are both counted. So the total is indeed 201 per variable.\n\nTherefore, the correct total number is 3\u00d7201\u22122=601.\n\nHmm, so I must have made a mistake in my initial substitution analysis where I thought the variables needed to be symmetric. The key realization is that the second equation is automatically satisfied when one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200, regardless of their individual values. Therefore, all such triples are valid, leading to 601 solutions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so including zero. Let me confirm once again with the count:\n\nFor each variable set to 100:\n\n- The number of ordered triples where a=100 is the number of solutions to b +c=200 where b and c are nonnegative integers. This is 201 (from b=0 to 200).\n\nSimilarly for b=100 and c=100.\n\nTotal: 3\u00d7201=603.\n\nSubtract duplicates of the all-100 triple, which was counted three times, so subtract 2: 603\u22122=601.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 601.\n\nBut now I'm really confused because my initial substitution approach led me to 301 due to a misunderstanding, but upon re-examining the algebra, it's clear that the second equation is satisfied for any triple with one variable 100 and the others adding to 200, so the count is 601.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in my first substitution analysis where I thought there was a symmetry requirement, but actually there isn't. The key is that when one variable is fixed at 100, the equation reduces to an identity, so any pair adding to 200 works.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 601.\n\nWait, but let me check with another example: (100, 150, 50) is one triple, and (100, 50, 150) is another, both counted in the a=100 case. Similarly, (150,100,50) is counted in the b=100 case, etc. So each permutation is counted once, so there are indeed 201 per variable.\n\nTherefore, I'm now convinced the correct answer is 601.\n\nBut then why did the substitution approach initially suggest that variables must be symmetric? Because in the substitution variables, when you set a=100 +x, etc., and required that variables are expressed as deviations, but the condition only required that one of the deviations is zero (i.e., one variable is 100), and the other two can be any pair adding to 200, so their deviations can be anything as long as they sum to the negative of the first variable's deviation. So they can be asymmetric. So there is no symmetry requirement except that their deviations must sum to the negative of the first variable's deviation. So the substitution approach does allow all pairs adding to200, hence the total is 601.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 601.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"triples of nonnegative integers\". Let me see if there are overlapping triples when considering different variables.\n\nFor example, the triple (100, 200, 0) is counted in the a=100 case, the b=100 case would have (200, 100, 0), and the c=100 case would have (200,0,100). So each permutation is unique and counted once. The only overlap is the all-100 triple. Thus, the total is indeed 601.\n\nTherefore, my initial answer of 301 was wrong because I misunderstood the substitution's constraints. The correct answer is 601.\n\nWait, but I must have made a mistake in the problem's equation.\n\nWait, let me re-express the second equation:\n\nThe second equation is a\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b =6,000,000.\n\nWhen one variable is 100, say a=100, then b +c=200. The equation becomes:\n\n100\u00b2b +100\u00b2c +b\u00b2*100 +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2*100 +c\u00b2b.\n\nWhich simplifies to 100\u00b2*(b +c) +100*(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) + bc*(b +c).\n\nSince b +c=200, this is 100\u00b2*200 +100*(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) + bc*200.\n\nAs shown earlier, this simplifies to 2,000,000 + 100*( (b +c)^2 - 2bc ) +200 bc =2,000,000 +100*(40,000 -2bc) +200 bc =2,000,000 +4,000,000 -200 bc +200 bc =6,000,000.\n\nThus, it holds for any b and c adding to200. Therefore, the count is indeed 601.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in the initial substitution analysis where I thought variables had to be symmetric, but that was incorrect. The correct answer is 601.\n\nWait, but the problem might have a different answer. Let me think again.\n\nWait, let me check with another example where variables are not symmetric:\n\nTake a=100, b=1, c=199. As before, this works.\n\nAnother example: a=100, b=2, c=198. Let's compute:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b\n\n=100\u00b2*2 +100\u00b2*198 +2\u00b2*100 +2\u00b2*198 +198\u00b2*100 +198\u00b2*2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n100\u00b2*2=20,000,\n\n100\u00b2*198=19,800*100=1,980,000,\n\n2\u00b2*100=400,\n\n2\u00b2*198=792,\n\n198\u00b2*100=(39,204)*100=3,920,400,\n\n198\u00b2*2=39,204*2=78,408.\n\nNow sum all terms:\n\n20,000 +1,980,000=2,000,000\n\n+400=2,000,400\n\n+792=2,001,192\n\n+3,920,400=5,921,592\n\n+78,408=6,000,000.\n\nYes, it works. So the count is indeed 601.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 601.\n\nBut I must have made a mistake in my first substitution approach where I thought the variables needed to be symmetric. The key was that the equation reduces to an identity when one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200, so all such triples are valid.\n\nTherefore, the number of ordered triples is 3\u00d7201 \u22122=601.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 601.\n\nWait, but let me check the total number of non-negative integer triples with a +b +c =300 is C(300 +3 -1, 3-1)=C(302,2)= (302\u00d7301)/2=45,551. So 601 is a small fraction of that, which makes sense.\n\nTherefore, after correcting my mistake, the answer should be 601.\n\nBut I need to make sure that when I set variables like a=100, the other two variables can be anything adding to200. For example, (100, 200,0), (100, 0,200), (100,1,199), etc., all are valid and counted once each in their respective variable's count. The only overlap is the all-100 triple.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 601.\n\nHowever, the problem might have a different answer if there are additional constraints. Wait, the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so zeros are allowed, which we have considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the inclusion-exclusion. Let me recalculate:\n\nNumber of triples where a=100:201.\n\nSame for b=100 and c=100.\n\nTotal triples counted this way: 3\u00d7201=603.\n\nBut the triple where a=100, b=100, c=100 is counted three times (once in each category). All other triples where exactly one variable is 100 are counted once. Thus, the correct total is:\n\nTotal = (3\u00d7201) - 2*(number of triples with all three variables 100).\n\nSince the all-100 triple is counted three times, subtract 2 to get it counted once.\n\nHence, 603 -2=601.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 601.\n\nBut I'm really confused because my first approach led me to 301, but after re-examining the algebra, it's clear that the correct answer is 601. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the first substitution approach by incorrectly assuming a symmetry requirement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{601}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It's a classic stars and bars problem if there were no other constraints, but here we have another condition involving the sum of these quadratic terms. The second equation looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor it or find some symmetry.\n\nLet me write down the second equation again: a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b. Hmm, I notice that each term has two variables, one squared and the other to the first power. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow.\n\nLooking at each pair of terms, for example, a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c = a\u00b2(b + c). Similarly, the other terms can be grouped as b\u00b2(a + c) and c\u00b2(a + b). So the entire expression becomes:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b).\n\nHmm, that's better. Now, since we know that a + b + c = 300, maybe we can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), right?\n\nLet me try that substitution:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c).\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me see if I can simplify this expression further. Let's expand each term:\n\na\u00b2*300 - a\u00b3 + b\u00b2*300 - b\u00b3 + c\u00b2*300 - c\u00b3 = 6,000,000.\n\nSo that's 300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, so maybe I can relate this to other symmetric sums. Let's recall that in symmetric equations, sometimes we can use the identities involving (a + b + c), (ab + bc + ca), and (abc). Let me see if I can express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 and a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 in terms of these.\n\nFirst, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c = 300, that would be 300\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nThen, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 can be expressed as (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. Plugging in the known sum:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 300\u00b3 - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.\n\nSo substituting these into the equation:\n\n300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) - [300\u00b3 - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, this might get a bit messy, but let's compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)):\n\n300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000\n\n300*(-2)(ab + bc + ca) = -600(ab + bc + ca)\n\nThen subtract the second part:\n\n- [300\u00b3 - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc]\n\nFirst compute 300\u00b3: 300*300*300 = 27,000,000\n\nThen, -3*300*(ab + bc + ca) = -900(ab + bc + ca)\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) - [27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me distribute the negative sign into the brackets:\n\n27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) -27,000,000 + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\n27,000,000 -27,000,000 cancels out.\n\nThen, -600(ab + bc + ca) + 900(ab + bc + ca) = 300(ab + bc + ca)\n\nAnd then the remaining term is -3abc.\n\nSo overall, we have:\n\n300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 3 to simplify:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so now we have an equation involving ab + bc + ca and abc. Let's denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ca. Then the equation becomes:\n\n100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nNow, perhaps we can find relationships between Q and S. Since S = 300, we know that Q is related to the squares. Wait, but maybe we can use other symmetric equations here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to consider variables in terms of each other. Let me think if there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use substitution. Let me think of variables such that two variables are equal, given the symmetry of the problem. Since the equation is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps the solutions have some symmetry. Maybe two variables are equal, or all three are equal?\n\nFirst, let's check if all three variables are equal. If a = b = c, then each would be 100, since 3a = 300. Let's check if this satisfies the second equation.\n\nCompute a\u00b2b + ... etc. Each term would be a\u00b2*a = a\u00b3, so each term is a\u00b3, and there are 6 terms (since each pair is counted twice). Wait, actually, let me see:\n\nWait, the original equation is a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b. If a = b = c = 100, then each term is 100\u00b2 * 100 = 100^3, and there are 6 terms. So total is 6*(10^6) = 6,000,000. Hey, that's exactly the value we need!\n\nSo (100, 100, 100) is a solution. But are there others?\n\nHmm, so that's one solution, but maybe there are more. Let's see.\n\nSuppose two variables are equal, say a = b, and c is different. Let me set a = b = x, then c = 300 - 2x. Then we can plug into the equation.\n\nFirst, let's compute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\nSince a = b = x, this becomes:\n\nx\u00b2x + x\u00b2c + x\u00b2x + x\u00b2c + c\u00b2x + c\u00b2x\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b3 + x\u00b2c + x\u00b3 + x\u00b2c + 2c\u00b2x\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2c + 2x c\u00b2\n\nFactor out 2x:\n\n2x(x\u00b2 + x c + c\u00b2)\n\nHmm, but let's compute it step by step.\n\nWait, actually, let me compute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = x\u00b2 * x = x\u00b3\n\na\u00b2c = x\u00b2 * c\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2a = x\u00b2 *x = x\u00b3\n\nb\u00b2c = x\u00b2 * c\n\nc\u00b2a = c\u00b2 * x\n\nc\u00b2b = c\u00b2 * x\n\nSo total:\n\nx\u00b3 + x\u00b2c + x\u00b3 + x\u00b2c + c\u00b2x + c\u00b2x\n\nSo total is 2x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2c + 2x c\u00b2.\n\nFactor 2x:\n\n2x(x\u00b2 + x c + c\u00b2)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor further?\n\nAlternatively, note that x\u00b2 + x c + c\u00b2 is the same as (x^3 - c^3)/(x - c) if x \u2260 c, but maybe that's complicating.\n\nAlternatively, let's substitute c = 300 - 2x.\n\nSo, c = 300 - 2x. Let me plug that into the expression.\n\nFirst, compute 2x(x\u00b2 + x c + c\u00b2):\n\nLet me compute x\u00b2 + x c + c\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 + x*(300 - 2x) + (300 - 2x)^2\n\nCompute term by term:\n\nx\u00b2 + 300x - 2x\u00b2 + (90000 - 1200x + 4x\u00b2)\n\nCombine terms:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2x\u00b2 + 4x\u00b2 = 3x\u00b2\n\n300x -1200x = -900x\n\n+90000\n\nSo total x\u00b2 + x c + c\u00b2 = 3x\u00b2 - 900x + 90000\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 2x*(3x\u00b2 - 900x + 90000)\n\nSo the entire equation becomes:\n\n2x*(3x\u00b2 - 900x + 90000) = 6,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx*(3x\u00b2 - 900x + 90000) = 3,000,000\n\nMultiply out the left side:\n\n3x\u00b3 - 900x\u00b2 + 90,000x = 3,000,000\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n3x\u00b3 - 900x\u00b2 + 90,000x - 3,000,000 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + 30,000x - 1,000,000 = 0\n\nHmm, need to solve this cubic equation. Let's see if there are integer roots. Since x is an integer (as a, b, c are nonnegative integers), and since c = 300 - 2x must be nonnegative, so 300 - 2x \u2265 0 \u21d2 x \u2264 150. Also, since x must be nonnegative, x \u22650. So x is between 0 and 150.\n\nLet me try possible integer roots. Let's try x = 100, since we know (100,100,100) is a solution. Let's plug in x=100:\n\n100\u00b3 - 300*(100)^2 +30,000*(100) -1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 -1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 -1,000,000 = 0. Yes, so x=100 is a root. Therefore, (x - 100) is a factor.\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or factor it.\n\nDivide the cubic polynomial by (x - 100):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000\n\nRoot at x=100:\n\nBring down 1\n\nMultiply by 100: 100\n\nAdd to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200\n\nMultiply by 100: -20,000\n\nAdd to next coefficient: 30,000 + (-20,000) = 10,000\n\nMultiply by 100: 1,000,000\n\nAdd to last term: -1,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 0. Perfect.\n\nThus, the cubic factors as (x - 100)(x\u00b2 - 200x + 10,000).\n\nSo now, set equal to zero:\n\n(x - 100)(x\u00b2 - 200x + 10,000) = 0\n\nSo the roots are x=100 and roots of x\u00b2 -200x +10,000 =0\n\nSolving x\u00b2 -200x +10,000 =0:\n\nDiscriminant D = (200)^2 -4*1*10,000 = 40,000 -40,000 =0\n\nThus, a double root at x = (200)/2 =100. Wait, that's the same as before?\n\nWait, discriminant is zero, so x = [200 \u00b1 0]/2 =100. So actually, the quadratic factor is (x -100)^2. Therefore, the cubic is (x -100)^3 =0. Wait, but that contradicts our previous factorization. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, if the quadratic is x\u00b2 -200x +10,000, then discriminant is 40,000 -40,000 =0, so yes, it's (x -100)^2. Therefore, the cubic is (x -100)^3. So the only real root is x=100 with multiplicity 3. Therefore, the equation x\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + 30,000x -1,000,000=0 has x=100 as the only real solution. Therefore, in this case, the only solution when a = b is when x=100, so a = b =100, then c=300 - 200=100. Which gives back the triple (100,100,100). So in the case of two variables equal, that's the only solution.\n\nHmm, so maybe the only solution where two variables are equal is the all-equal case. Let's see if there are solutions where all variables are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another case where one variable is zero? Let's try that.\n\nSuppose c =0. Then the equations become a + b =300, and the second equation becomes a\u00b2b +a\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2*0 +0 +0 = a\u00b2b +ab\u00b2 =ab(a +b)=ab*300=6,000,000. So ab*300 =6,000,000 \u21d2 ab=20,000.\n\nSo we need a and b nonnegative integers with a + b =300 and ab=20,000. Let's see if such integers exist.\n\nLet me denote a and b as roots of the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -300x +20,000=0. Let's compute discriminant:\n\nD = 300\u00b2 -4*1*20,000 =90,000 -80,000=10,000.\n\nSquare root of D is 100. So roots are [300 \u00b1100]/2 = (400)/2=200 and (200)/2=100. So a and b are 200 and 100. Therefore, the solutions when c=0 are (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). Since order matters, but since variables can be permuted, but in this case, since we set c=0, we have two solutions here. However, since the problem counts ordered triples, but actually, when c=0, the triples are (a,b,0), (b,a,0), but also (a,0,b), etc. Wait, actually, since we set c=0, but variables can be permuted. So actually, the solutions with one zero would have permutations where any of a,b,c can be zero. Let me think.\n\nWait, let's see. If we set c=0, then we have two solutions (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). But if we set a=0 instead, then similarly we can get (0,200,100) and (0,100,200). Similarly setting b=0 gives (200,0,100) and (100,0,200). So total of 6 permutations? Wait, but actually, each of the three variables could be the zero, and for each case, there are two ordered triples. So 3 variables \u00d72 permutations each =6 triples where one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100.\n\nBut let's check if these actually satisfy the second equation.\n\nTake (200,100,0):\n\nCompute a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nPlug in a=200, b=100, c=0:\n\n200\u00b2*100 + 200\u00b2*0 +100\u00b2*200 +100\u00b2*0 +0\u00b2*200 +0\u00b2*100\n\n= 200\u00b2*100 +100\u00b2*200\n\nCompute 200\u00b2*100 = (40,000)*100 =4,000,000\n\n100\u00b2*200 =10,000*200=2,000,000\n\nTotal is 6,000,000. Perfect, that works. Similarly for the others. So these are valid solutions.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 such triples where one variable is zero and the other two are 100 and 200.\n\nAdditionally, the all-100 case is another solution. So so far, we have 6 +1=7 solutions? Wait, but maybe there are more?\n\nWait, are there solutions where two variables are zero? Let's check.\n\nSuppose two variables are zero, say b=0 and c=0. Then a=300. Then the second equation becomes a\u00b2*0 + a\u00b2*0 +0 +0 +0 +0 =0, which is not equal to 6,000,000. So that doesn't work. Similarly, any two variables being zero would give zero, which is too small. So no solutions there.\n\nWhat about other cases where variables are not equal and none are zero?\n\nHmm, maybe we can consider other possibilities. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the equation 100Q - P =2,000,000, where Q =ab + bc + ca and P=abc.\n\nSince S =a + b + c =300, perhaps we can relate Q and P via some inequalities or other relationships.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express Q in terms of S and the variance. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, let's see if there are other triples besides the ones we found.\n\nSuppose that one of the numbers is 200, another 100, and the third 0, which we already considered. What if all three numbers are different and non-zero?\n\nSuppose a, b, c are all different, none zero. Let me see if such triples can satisfy the equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are triples where two variables are the same but not 100? Wait, earlier when we considered two variables equal, we found that only the triple with all equal variables works. Let me confirm that again.\n\nSuppose a = b =x, then c=300 -2x. We had the equation leading to x=100 as the only solution. So that case only gives the all-100 triple. So if two variables are equal but not 100, then no solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider another case where variables are in some ratio?\n\nAlternatively, let me try some trial values. For example, suppose one variable is 150, another 150, then c=0. Let's see:\n\na=150, b=150, c=0. Then compute the second equation:\n\n150\u00b2*150 +150\u00b2*0 +150\u00b2*150 +150\u00b2*0 +0 +0 = 2*(150)^3.\n\n150\u00b3 is 3,375,000, so times 2 is 6,750,000 which is more than 6,000,000. So that's too big.\n\nHmm, so that doesn't work.\n\nHow about a= 150, b=100, c=50. Let's compute:\n\na + b +c = 300. Check second equation:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b\n\n=150\u00b2*100 +150\u00b2*50 +100\u00b2*150 +100\u00b2*50 +50\u00b2*150 +50\u00b2*100\n\nCompute each term:\n\n150\u00b2=22,500; 22,500*100=2,250,000; 22,500*50=1,125,000\n\n100\u00b2=10,000; 10,000*150=1,500,000; 10,000*50=500,000\n\n50\u00b2=2,500; 2,500*150=375,000; 2,500*100=250,000\n\nAdding all up: 2,250,000 +1,125,000 = 3,375,000\n\n+1,500,000 +500,000 = 2,000,000 \u2192 total so far 5,375,000\n\n+375,000 +250,000 =625,000 \u2192 total 6,000,000.\n\nWait a minute! That adds up to exactly 6,000,000. Wait, so (150, 100, 50) is another solution?\n\nWait, let me verify again:\n\nWait, let me recalculate step by step:\n\nFirst term: a\u00b2b =150\u00b2*100 = (22500)*100=2,250,000\n\nSecond term: a\u00b2c =150\u00b2*50=22500*50=1,125,000\n\nThird term: b\u00b2a =100\u00b2*150=10,000*150=1,500,000\n\nFourth term: b\u00b2c =100\u00b2*50=10,000*50=500,000\n\nFifth term: c\u00b2a =50\u00b2*150=2500*150=375,000\n\nSixth term: c\u00b2b =50\u00b2*100=2500*100=250,000\n\nNow adding all together:\n\n2,250,000 +1,125,000 = 3,375,000\n\n+1,500,000 = 4,875,000\n\n+500,000 =5,375,000\n\n+375,000 =5,750,000\n\n+250,000 =6,000,000. Yes, exactly. So (150,100,50) is a solution. Wait, so this is a new solution where all three numbers are different and non-zero. So my earlier assumption that only the all-100 and the ones with a zero were solutions was wrong. So there are more solutions.\n\nHmm, so that complicates things. So how did that happen? Let me see.\n\nWait, so maybe there are more triples where the numbers are in different proportions. So perhaps there are triples where variables are in arithmetic progression? Let's see.\n\nWait, the example above (150,100,50) is an arithmetic progression with difference -50. Let me see if that's a coincidence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here. Let me see if I can find another solution.\n\nSuppose I take a = 200, b = 50, c =50. Let's check:\n\na + b +c =200 +50+50=300.\n\nCompute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b=200\u00b2*50=40,000*50=2,000,000\n\na\u00b2c=40,000*50=2,000,000\n\nb\u00b2a=2500*200=500,000\n\nb\u00b2c=2500*50=125,000\n\nc\u00b2a=2500*200=500,000\n\nc\u00b2b=2500*50=125,000\n\nAdding them up:\n\n2,000,000 +2,000,000 =4,000,000\n\n+500,000 =4,500,000\n\n+125,000 =4,625,000\n\n+500,000 =5,125,000\n\n+125,000 =5,250,000. Not 6,000,000. So that's not a solution.\n\nHmm, maybe another combination. Let's try a= 120, b= 130, c=50. Wait, but maybe a better approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the equation we derived earlier: 100Q - P = 2,000,000 where Q = ab + bc + ca and P = abc.\n\nWe also know that a + b + c =300. Let me see if there's a way to parameterize variables here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express variables as 100 + x, 100 + y, 100 + z, where x + y + z =0. Since 100 +100 +100 =300, so any deviation from that would require variables to be offset.\n\nLet me try that substitution. Let me set:\n\nLet a =100 + x,\n\nb =100 + y,\n\nc =100 + z,\n\nso that x + y + z =0.\n\nThen, substitute into the equations.\n\nFirst, compute Q =ab + bc + ca.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nab = (100 +x)(100 + y) =100\u00b2 +100y +100x +xy\n\nSimilarly,\n\nbc = (100 + y)(100 + z) =100\u00b2 +100z +100y + y z,\n\nca = (100 + z)(100 +x) =100\u00b2 +100x +100 z + z x.\n\nAdding these together:\n\nab + bc + ca =3*100\u00b2 + 100(y + z +x + y + z +x) + (xy + y z + z x).\n\nWait, let me compute term by term:\n\nFirst, the constants: 3*(100)^2 =30,000.\n\nThen, the linear terms in x, y, z:\n\nLooking at the terms with x, y, z:\n\nIn ab: 100y +100x,\n\nIn bc:100z +100y,\n\nIn ca:100x +100z.\n\nAdding all together:\n\nFor x terms:100x (from ab) +100x (from ca) = 200x,\n\nSimilarly for y:100y (ab) +100y (bc) =200y,\n\nSimilarly for z:100z (bc) +100z (ca)=200z,\n\nSo total linear terms:200x +200y +200z =200(x + y + z). But since x + y + z =0, this term is zero.\n\nThen the cross terms: xy + y z + z x.\n\nTherefore, Q=30,000 + (xy + y z + z x).\n\nSimilarly, compute P = abc.\n\nabc = (100 +x)(100 + y)(100 + z).\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nFirst multiply two terms: (100 +x)(100 + y) =100\u00b2 +100(y +x) + xy,\n\nThen multiply by (100 + z):\n\n= [100\u00b2 +100(x + y) + xy]*(100 + z)\n\n=100\u00b2*100 +100\u00b2 z +100(x + y)*100 +100(x + y) z + xy*100 + xy z\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: 100^3,\n\nSecond term:100\u00b2 z,\n\nThird term:100(x + y)*100 =100\u00b2(x + y),\n\nFourth term:100(x + y) z,\n\nFifth term: xy*100,\n\nSixth term: xy z.\n\nCombine terms:\n\n=100^3 +100\u00b2(z +x + y) +100[ (x + y) z + xy ] + xyz.\n\nBut since x + y + z=0, so z = -x - y,\n\nTherefore, substitute z = -x - y:\n\nFirst term remains 1,000,000.\n\nSecond term:100\u00b2*(-x - y +x + y)=100\u00b2*(0)=0.\n\nThird term:\n\n100[ (x + y)(-x - y) + xy ]\n\nLet me compute (x + y)(-x - y) = - (x + y)^2,\n\nThus, the third term becomes 100[ - (x + y)^2 + xy ]\n\nFourth term: xyz =x y (-x - y) = -x\u00b2 y -x y\u00b2.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nP =1,000,000 +100[ - (x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2) + xy ] - x\u00b2 y - x y\u00b2\n\nSimplify the third term inside:\n\n- (x\u00b2 +2xy + y\u00b2) +xy = -x\u00b2 -2xy -y\u00b2 +xy = -x\u00b2 -xy - y\u00b2\n\nThus, third term:100*(-x\u00b2 -xy - y\u00b2)\n\nFourth term: -x\u00b2 y -x y\u00b2.\n\nThus,\n\nP =1,000,000 -100x\u00b2 -100xy -100y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 y -x y\u00b2.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but maybe we can relate this to Q.\n\nRecall that Q =30,000 + (xy + y z + z x). Since z = -x -y,\n\nCompute cross terms:\n\nxy + y z + z x = xy + y*(-x -y) + (-x -y)*x\n\n= xy -xy - y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 -xy\n\n= -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 -xy.\n\nTherefore, Q =30,000 + ( -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 -xy )\n\nSo, Q =30,000 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +xy).\n\nTherefore, the equation 100Q - P =2,000,000 becomes:\n\n100*(30,000 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +xy)) - [1,000,000 -100x\u00b2 -100xy -100y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 y -x y\u00b2 ] =2,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst term:100*(30,000 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +xy)) = 3,000,000 -100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 -100xy.\n\nSecond term: - [1,000,000 -100x\u00b2 -100xy -100y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 y -x y\u00b2 ]\n\n= -1,000,000 +100x\u00b2 +100xy +100y\u00b2 +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2.\n\nSo adding both terms together:\n\nFirst terms:3,000,000 -100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 -100xy\n\nSecond terms: -1,000,000 +100x\u00b2 +100xy +100y\u00b2 +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2\n\nCombine:\n\n3,000,000 -1,000,000 =2,000,000\n\n-100x\u00b2 +100x\u00b2=0\n\n-100y\u00b2 +100y\u00b2=0\n\n-100xy +100xy=0\n\nThen remaining terms: +x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2.\n\nThus, total expression is:\n\n2,000,000 + x\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2 =2,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the equation reduces to:\n\nx\u00b2 y +x y\u00b2 =0.\n\nFactor out xy:\n\nxy(x + y) =0.\n\nSo this equation holds if either x=0, y=0, or x + y=0.\n\nBut remember that z = -x - y, so x + y = -z. So x + y =0 would mean z=0.\n\nTherefore, the equation reduces to:\n\nEither x=0, y=0, or z=0 (since x + y = -z, so x + y =0 \u21d2 z=0).\n\nTherefore, the solutions must satisfy that at least one of x, y, z is zero.\n\nBut since x + y + z=0, if one of them is zero, say x=0, then y + z=0 \u21d2 z= -y. So variables would be a=100 +0=100, b=100 + y, c=100 - y. So in this case, two variables would be 100 + y and 100 - y, and the third is 100. So, for example, if x=0, then a=100, and b and c are symmetric around 100. Similarly if y=0 or z=0.\n\nAlternatively, if two variables are zero, say x=0 and y=0, then z=0, so all variables are 100. Which is the all-100 case.\n\nTherefore, the only solutions are those where at least one of the variables is 100, and the other two are symmetric around 100 (i.e., differing by some y and -y). Wait, but let's see.\n\nWait, let's consider the cases:\n\nCase 1: x=0. Then variables are (100, 100 + y, 100 - y). To ensure nonnegative integers, we need 100 + y \u22650 and 100 - y \u22650 \u21d2 y can range from -100 to +100, but since variables are nonnegative, 100 + y \u22650 and 100 - y \u22650 \u21d2 y between -100 and 100. But since y must be integer, but also a, b, c must be nonnegative integers. So y can be from -100 to +100, but such that 100 + y and 100 - y are nonnegative. So y can be from -100 to +100, but effectively y must be between -100 and 100, but such that 100 + y and 100 - y are nonnegative. So actually y can be from -100 to +100, but if y is negative, say y = -k where k \u22650, then 100 + y =100 -k and 100 - y =100 +k. So in any case, variables are (100, 100 + |y|, 100 - |y|). So the variables are 100, 100 +k, 100 -k where k is a nonnegative integer such that 100 -k \u22650 \u21d2k \u2264100.\n\nTherefore, in this case, for each k from 0 to 100, we can have triples (100, 100 +k, 100 -k). But note that when k=0, this gives (100,100,100). For k=1 to 100, this gives distinct triples. However, note that for each k, the triples can be arranged in different permutations. For example, if k=50, then the triple is (100, 150,50). But this can also be arranged as (150,100,50), etc. Wait, but in our substitution, we fixed a=100. So actually, in this case, the variable a is fixed as 100, so the triples are (100, 100+k, 100 -k). To account for permutations, we need to consider all orderings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solutions are all triples where one of the variables is 100, and the other two add up to 200 and differ by 2k. Wait, actually, let me see.\n\nWait, the case when x=0 gives triples with a=100, and the other two variables being 100 + y and 100 - y. Similarly, if y=0, then b=100, and a and c are 100 \u00b1x, and similarly for z=0. Therefore, all solutions where one variable is 100, and the other two add up to 200 and are symmetric around 100.\n\nTherefore, all such triples can be obtained by choosing one variable to be 100, and then the other two variables being 100 +k and 100 -k for some integer k between 0 and 100. However, we have to consider permutations. Let's see.\n\nFirst, for each variable being the fixed 100, there are three possibilities (a=100, b=100, or c=100). For each of these, the other two variables can be (100 +k, 100 -k) for k from 0 to 100. However, note that when k=0, this gives the triple (100,100,100), which is the same regardless of which variable is fixed. So when considering permutations, we have to be careful not to overcount.\n\nLet me think of all possible triples:\n\nCase 1: All three variables are 100: (100,100,100). This is counted once.\n\nCase 2: Exactly one variable is 100, and the other two are (100 +k, 100 -k) where k \u22600. For each such k (1 \u2264k \u2264100), there are three permutations depending on which variable is 100. For example, if k=50, the triples would be (100,150,50), (150,100,50), (150,50,100), etc. Each of these is distinct unless the other two variables are equal, but since k\u22600, 100 +k \u2260100 -k unless k=0. So each k gives 3 distinct triples. However, when k=100, then 100 -k =0, so one of the variables becomes 0. Wait, so when k=100, the other two variables are 200 and 0. So the triples would be (100,200,0) and permutations. But earlier when we considered c=0, we had (200,100,0) etc. So actually, the case where one variable is 100 and another is 200, and the third 0 is included here.\n\nTherefore, for each k from 1 to100, we have three ordered triples (since the 100 can be in any of the three positions). But when k=100, the non-100 variables are 200 and 0. Similarly for k=1, you get (101,99,100) etc.\n\nHowever, note that when k and -k are considered, but since k is positive, we don't have duplicates here. So total number of triples in case 2 is 3*(100) since k ranges from 1 to100. However, when k=100, the triple includes a zero, but those are already counted in this approach.\n\nWait, but actually, when k ranges from 1 to100, each gives three ordered triples, so total 3*100=300. But then adding the all-100 case gives 301? But that can't be right, because when k=100, the triples are (100,200,0), (200,100,0), (200,0,100), etc. which are 3 triples, which were already counted in the previous consideration when we considered one variable zero. Wait, but actually, in the earlier analysis, when we considered c=0, we had 6 triples where one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100. But according to this method, when k=100, each of the three positions can be the 100, leading to three triples where the other two are 200 and 0. So (100,200,0), (200,100,0), (200,0,100). But the sixth triple would be (100,0,200), (0,100,200), (0,200,100). Wait, but in this approach, if we fix the 100 in different positions, we are only getting three triples for each k. So where are the other three?\n\nAh, because when k=100, the variable that is 100 is fixed, but the other two are 200 and 0. However, if we instead fix the 200 as the non-zero non-100 variable, then perhaps? Wait no, in this case, the variables are (100 +k, 100 -k). When k=100, that becomes 200 and 0, so the variables are 100, 200,0. The other permutations where the 0 is in different positions would require different k's? Wait, perhaps not. Because if we fix a different variable as 100, like b=100, then the variables would be (200,100,0), which is the same as above. So actually, for k=100, you get exactly three triples where one variable is 100, another is 200, and the last is 0. Similarly for other k's.\n\nHowever, the triples where the zero is in different positions but the 100 is fixed in different positions are accounted for by permuting which variable is set to 100.\n\nWait, let me see. Suppose k=50, then the triples would be:\n\n(100, 150,50), (150,100,50), (150,50,100). So three triples where one variable is 100, another 150, and third 50. These are all distinct. Similarly, when k=100, (100,200,0), (200,100,0), (200,0,100). So three triples with a zero. So total triples when considering all k from 1 to 100 would be 3*100 =300. Adding the all-100 case gives 301. But this seems conflicting with previous examples.\n\nWait, but earlier I found that (150,100,50) is a solution, which is counted here as part of k=50 when a is set to 100, but actually in that case, the 100 is the second variable. Wait, but in the substitution above, when we set a=100, then the other variables are 100\u00b1k, but if we set b=100, then the variables are (100 +k, 100, 100 -k). So the triple (150,100,50) is indeed included when k=50 and b is set to 100. So each of the triples with variables in different positions are accounted for by permuting which variable is fixed as 100.\n\nHowever, when considering the case where two variables are 200 and 0 with the third being 100, there are three permutations, so that's three triples. Similarly, the triple (150,100,50) has three permutations. So in total, the total number of triples would be 3*100 (for k=1 to 100) plus 1 (the all-100 case) equals 301. But this contradicts my earlier thought that there are 6 triples with a zero and the all-100, but maybe I miscalculated before.\n\nWait, let me see. If k ranges from 1 to100, then for each k, we get three triples. So 300 triples plus the all-100 gives 301. However, when k=100, the triples are those with a zero. So the triples with a zero are exactly 3. But earlier, when I considered setting c=0, I thought there were 6 triples because any of the variables could be zero, but according to this, only 3. Wait, what's the discrepancy here?\n\nAh! Because in this substitution, the zero is always paired with 200 and 100. So for example, when k=100, the variables are 100, 200,0. But if I set a different variable to 100, like the third variable is 100, then the variables would be 200,0,100. Which is the same as (200,0,100). So each permutation is already accounted for by choosing which variable is fixed as 100. Therefore, there are exactly 3 triples where one variable is 0 and the others are 200 and100. But earlier, I thought there were 6 because I considered all permutations of (200,100,0). Wait, but actually, (200,100,0) can be arranged in 6 ways? No, actually, the number of distinct permutations of (200,100,0) is 3! /1! =6 since all elements are distinct. But according to this method, only three of them are counted. Wait, why?\n\nBecause in this substitution, the variable set to 100 is fixed. For example, to get (0,100,200), you would need to set, say, the second variable to 100, then the first variable would be 100 -100=0 and third 100 +100=200. So that's included when we set the second variable as 100 and k=100. So actually, all six permutations are included in the three cases where each variable is set to 100. Wait no, actually, if you set each of the three variables to 100 in turn, then you can get all permutations. Let's see:\n\nFor the triple (0,100,200):\n\n- Set the second variable to 100, then first is 0, third is200.\n\n- Set the first variable to 100, then second is 0, third is200? No, that would require k=-100? Wait, no, let's see.\n\nWait, when you fix the first variable as 100, then the other two variables are 100 +k and 100 -k. To get 0, you need 100 -k =0 \u21d2k=100, so the other variables are 200 and0. So the triple is (100,200,0). To get (0,100,200), you need to set the second variable as 100, so then first is 0, third is200. Similarly for third variable as 100. Thus, each permutation is obtained by fixing a different variable as 100. So for each permutation of (0,100,200), it's counted once when you set the corresponding variable to 100. So there are three triples where one variable is 100, another is 200, and the third is 0. The other permutations where the 100 is not present would require another approach, but in our case, all triples must have one variable as 100, so those permutations where two variables are 200 and0 without a 100 are not allowed. Wait, but in our analysis earlier, when we set c=0, then a +b=300, so we could have (200,100,0) but also (100,200,0), etc. So actually, the three permutations where exactly one variable is 100, another is200, and third is0 are indeed the only ones possible, because if you have two variables as 200 and0, then the third would have to be 100 to make the sum 300.\n\nWait, if you have two variables as 200 and0, then the third must be 100. So the triples with a zero must have exactly one 100, one 200, and one 0. Therefore, there are indeed 3 permutations of (100,200,0), which is three triples, not six. So my earlier mistake was thinking there were six, but actually there are three. So that reconciles with the substitution method.\n\nTherefore, according to substitution method, total triples are:\n\n- 1 triple where all are 100.\n\n- For each k from1 to100, 3 triples, so 3*100=300.\n\nTotal triples:301.\n\nWait, but when k=50, for example, gives three triples: (100,150,50), (150,100,50), (150,50,100). These are all distinct and valid.\n\nSimilarly, when k=1, we get triples like (100,101,99), (101,100,99), (101,99,100), etc.\n\nThus, the total number of triples is 301.\n\nBut earlier, when I found the triple (150,100,50), which is counted here, and the triples with zeros are also counted here.\n\nHowever, in the problem statement, the triples are ordered? Wait, no, the problem says \"triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c)\". In combinatorics, usually, a triple (a,b,c) is considered ordered unless stated otherwise. Wait, but in some cases, triples are considered unordered. Wait, the problem says \"the number of triples\", so probably ordered triples. Let me confirm the problem statement:\n\n\"Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c) satisfying a + b + c = 300 and ...\"\n\nSince it specifies the triple as (a,b,c), it's likely ordered triples. Therefore, the total number is 301. But wait, hold on, let me check if there are overlapping cases.\n\nWait, when k=100, we get triples like (100,200,0). Similarly when k= -100? Wait, but k is from1 to100. So no overlaps. Each k from1 to100 is unique. So total is indeed 301.\n\nBut wait, let me check if when k=100, the variables are (100,200,0) and permutations. But when k=100, the variables are 100 +100=200 and 100 -100=0. So that's correct. So each k gives three ordered triples, so 3*100=300, plus the all-100 case gives 301.\n\nBut wait, earlier, when I considered the case where c=0, I thought there were three triples with a zero, but according to this, those are included in the 300. So total is 301.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that all these triples actually satisfy the second equation.\n\nWait, let's test another triple from the substitution method. Let's take k=1, so the triples would be (100,101,99). Let's compute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nLet me compute for (100,101,99):\n\na=100, b=101, c=99.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b =100\u00b2*101 =10,000*101=1,010,000\n\na\u00b2c =100\u00b2*99 =10,000*99=990,000\n\nb\u00b2a =101\u00b2*100= (10,201)*100=1,020,100\n\nb\u00b2c =101\u00b2*99=10,201*99=1,009,899\n\nc\u00b2a =99\u00b2*100=9,801*100=980,100\n\nc\u00b2b =99\u00b2*101=9,801*101=990, 901? Wait let's compute:\n\n99\u00b2 is 9801. 9801 *101 =9801*(100 +1)=980,100 +9,801= 990, 901? Wait 980,100 +9,801= 990, 901? Wait 980,100 +9,801= 989,901. Wait, let me compute:\n\n9801 *101:\n\nFirst, 9801 *100=980,100,\n\nplus 9801*1=9,801,\n\nTotal: 980,100 +9,801 =990,  (980,100 +9,801)= 990,  (980,100+9,801)=989,901? Wait 980,100 +9,801 is 980,100 +9,801 = 989,901.\n\nWait, so c\u00b2b=990,901? Wait no, that's 989,901.\n\nWait, let's sum all terms:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c =1,010,000 +990,000 =2,000,000\n\nb\u00b2a +b\u00b2c =1,020,100 +1,009,899 =2,030,  (1,020,100 +1,009,899 = 2,029,999?)\n\nWait let me compute 1,020,100 +1,009,899:\n\n1,020,100 +1,009,899 = (1,020,000 +1,009,000) + (100 +899) = 2,029,000 +999 =2,030,  (2,029,000 +999)=2,029,999.\n\nThen c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b =980,100 +989,901 =1,970,001?\n\nWait 980,100 +989,901 = 1,970,001?\n\nWait, 980,100 +989,901:\n\n980,100 + 989,901 = (980,000 +989,900) + (100 +1) = 1,969,900 +101 =1,969,  (1,969,900 +101)=1,970,001.\n\nSo total sum:\n\n2,000,000 +2,029,999 +1,970,001.\n\nFirst, 2,000,000 +2,029,999 =4,029,999\n\nThen +1,970,001 =4,029,999 +1,970,001 =6,000,000. Perfect, so it works. So this triple is valid.\n\nTherefore, the substitution method works. So total triples are 301. But wait, but let me think again.\n\nWait, the substitution approach assumes that one variable is exactly 100. But could there be triples where none of the variables are 100, but still satisfy the equation? Earlier, we found that the equation reduces to xy(x + y)=0 when expressed in terms of x,y,z. Which requires at least one of x,y,z is zero, meaning at least one variable is 100. Therefore, all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100. So there are no solutions with all variables different from 100. Therefore, the total number of triples is indeed 301.\n\nWait, but the problem says nonnegative integers. So including zeros. But according to substitution, we have all triples accounted for where one variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200 and differ by 2k. So for each k from0 to100 (where k=0 gives all 100s), and for each k from1 to100, three ordered triples. So total is 1 + 3*100 = 301.\n\nHowever, let me check when k=0, it's only one triple (all 100s). For k from1 to100, each gives three ordered triples. So total is 301.\n\nBut the problem asks for the number of triples of nonnegative integers. So that would be 301. But wait, in the earlier example where I found (150,100,50), which is counted here, and the triples with a zero are also counted here. So why did I initially think there were 6 triples with a zero? Because I considered permutations where the zero can be in any position, but in reality, each such permutation is counted once when you fix the 100 in a specific position. So total number is indeed 301.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify with another example. Let me take k=50, which gives triples (100,150,50), (150,100,50), (150,50,100). Each of these is distinct and valid, and they are all counted in the substitution approach. Similarly, for k=100, the triples (100,200,0), (200,100,0), (200,0,100) are all valid and distinct. So yes, that's 3 each. So 3*100 +1=301.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if there are any overlaps. For instance, if k=50 and another k gives the same triple in a different way? Probably not, since each k defines a unique spread from 100. So no overlaps. So total is 301.\n\nWait, but let me think of another way. The equation reduces to needing one variable to be 100. So the problem reduces to finding all ordered triples where one variable is 100, and the other two add up to 200 and are symmetric around 100. So the two variables can be (100 +k, 100 -k) where k is from 0 to100. For each such pair, and for each choice of which variable is fixed at 100, we have an ordered triple. \n\nThe number of such triples is calculated as follows:\n\n- Choose which variable is fixed at 100: 3 choices.\n\n- For each such choice, the other two variables can be (100 +k,100 -k) where k ranges from 0 to100. However, when k=0, this is (100,100), so the triple is (100,100,100) regardless of which variable is chosen. Therefore, the all-100 triple is counted three times in this method (once for each variable being chosen as the fixed 100). To correct this overcounting, we need to adjust:\n\nTotal triples counted with this method (without considering overcount):\n\n3 (choices for fixed variable) \u00d7 (101 values of k from 0 to100) = 3\u00d7101=303.\n\nBut the all-100 triple is counted three times (once for each variable), but it should be only once. So subtract 2 duplicates: 303 -2=301. So that matches.\n\nTherefore, the correct total is 301.\n\nWait, but let me see:\n\nAlternatively, the number of ordered triples where one specific variable is fixed at 100, and the other two variables are (100 +k,100 -k). For each variable (a,b,c), we have:\n\nFor each variable being fixed (3 options), and for each k from 0 to100 (101 options), we have a triple. But when k=0, all triples for the three variables are the same (all 100s). So total triples would be:\n\n3*(101) - 2*(1) =303 -2=301. Because when k=0, we have three triples that are all the same, so we subtract two duplicates.\n\nTherefore, the total is 301.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 301. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"nonnegative integers\", so k can be from 0 to100 inclusive. For each variable (a,b,c), choosing to fix it as 100, and then for each k from 0 to100, you have a triple. So for each variable:\n\nNumber of triples where that variable is fixed at 100: 101 (k from 0 to100). But when k=0, this is the all-100 triple. So total triples counted this way would be 3\u00d7101=303, but overlapping at the all-100 case which is counted three times. So subtract 2 duplicates to get 301.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as:\n\nThe total number of triples where at least one variable is 100, and the other two add to 200 and are symmetric around 100. To count this without overcounting:\n\n- The all-100 triple: 1.\n\n- Triples with exactly one 100: For each of the three positions where the 100 can be, and for each k from1 to100, giving 3\u00d7100=300.\n\nTotal is 1+300=301. That's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 301.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me confirm with another example. Let's take k=1 and see how many triples that is. For k=1, and choosing a to be fixed at 100, we get (100,101,99). Choosing b to be 100 gives (101,100,99). Choosing c to be 100 gives (101,99,100). So three distinct triples. Similarly, for each k from1 to100, three triples. So 3\u00d7100=300. Plus the all-100 case. So total 301.\n\nTherefore, I think this is correct.\n\nBut the problem is from an Olympiad, perhaps the answer is different? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution approach.\n\nWait, let me think of the equation 100Q - P =2,000,000. We derived that this requires one variable to be 100. So all solutions must have at least one 100. Therefore, the total number is indeed 301.\n\nHowever, I want to make sure that in the case when two variables are 100. For instance, if two variables are 100, say a=100, b=100, then c=100. So that's the all-100 case. If two variables are 100, but the third isn't, like (100,100,100) is the only case. Because if two variables are 100, then the third must be 100 to sum to 300. So there are no triples with exactly two 100s. So the only triples are either all three 100s or exactly one 100 and the other two adding to 200 and differing by 2k.\n\nTherefore, the count is correct as 301.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so zero is allowed. So the triples like (100,200,0) are allowed and are counted here.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 301.\n\nWait, but let me see if there's another way to think of it. The number of ordered triples with a + b + c =300, and one of a,b,c is 100. Let me compute that:\n\nThe number of triples where a=100, then b + c =200. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to b +c =200 is 201 (from b=0 to200). Similarly for b=100 and c=100. So total is 3\u00d7201=603. But this counts triples where two variables are 100 multiple times. For example, the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times (once in each category). Similarly, a triple like (100,100,100) is counted three times, and triples with two 100s are counted twice. But wait, actually, if two variables are 100, say a=100 and b=100, then c=100, which is the all-100 case. There are no triples with exactly two 100s because a + b +c=300 would require the third variable to also be 100. So actually, all triples counted in the 3\u00d7201 are either:\n\n- All three variables 100: counted three times.\n\n- Exactly one variable 100: counted once.\n\nTherefore, to get the correct count:\n\nTotal triples with at least one 100 = (3\u00d7201) - 2\u00d71 (subtracting the duplicates of the all-100 case counted three times, so subtract 2 to leave one). So total is 603 -2=601? Wait, that contradicts previous result. Wait, what's happening here?\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe count of triples where a=100 is 201 (b and c from 0 to200).\n\nSimilarly for b=100 and c=100. So total is 3\u00d7201=603.\n\nBut triples with two 100s would be triples where, say, a=100 and b=100, which requires c=100. So only the all-100 triple is counted three times in the total 603. So to get the correct count of triples with at least one 100, we have:\n\nTotal = (number with a=100) + (number with b=100) + (number with c=100) - 2*(number with all three 100). Because the all-100 triple is counted three times, so subtract twice to leave one.\n\nWait, inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\nNumber with at least one 100 = (A + B + C) - (AB + AC + BC) + ABC,\n\nwhere A is triples with a=100, etc. But since triples with two 100s are only possible if all three are 100. Because if two are 100, the third must be 100. So AB (triples with a=100 and b=100) is just the all-100 triple. Similarly for AC and BC. And ABC is also the same triple.\n\nTherefore,\n\nNumber with at least one 100 = (3\u00d7201) - (3\u00d71) +1 =603 -3 +1=601.\n\nWait, so according to inclusion-exclusion, it's 601. But that contradicts the previous result of 301.\n\nHmm, so now I'm confused. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait a second, the problem isn't all triples with at least one 100, but triples with at least one 100 AND satisfying the second equation. The substitution method gave 301, but the inclusion-exclusion here is for all triples with at least one 100, but we have constraints from the second equation. So the inclusion-exclusion here is not applicable here because we have an additional condition.\n\nAh, right. So the 301 comes from the fact that not all triples with a 100 will satisfy the second equation, but in our substitution, we found that exactly those triples where one variable is 100 and the other two are symmetric around 100 (i.e., differing by 2k) satisfy the equation. So the count of 301 is correct for the equation's solutions.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion counts all triples with at least one 100, but most of those won't satisfy the second equation. Therefore, my previous calculation of 301 is correct for the problem's constraints.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 301.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another angle.\n\nLet me think of variables a, b, c with one of them being 100. Let\u2019s say a=100, then b +c =200. The second equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 100\u00b2(b +c) +ab\u00b2 +ac\u00b2 + bc\u00b2 +cb\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe better to substitute a=100 into the second equation:\n\nGiven a=100, then b +c =200.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n=100\u00b2b +100\u00b2c + b\u00b2*100 +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2*100 +c\u00b2b\n\n=100\u00b2(b +c) +100(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) + bc(b +c).\n\nSince b +c =200,\n\n=100\u00b2*200 +100(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) + bc*200.\n\nWe need this to equal 6,000,000.\n\nCompute 100\u00b2*200 =10,000*200 =2,000,000.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n2,000,000 +100(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) +200bc =6,000,000.\n\nSubtract 2,000,000:\n\n100(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) +200bc =4,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 100:\n\nb\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2bc =40,000.\n\nBut b\u00b2 +2bc +c\u00b2 = (b +c)^2 =200\u00b2=40,000.\n\nSo this equation reduces to 40,000 =40,000. Which is always true!\n\nWait, that's interesting. So whenever a=100 and b +c=200, the equation is automatically satisfied?\n\nWait, so that means that all triples where one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200 satisfy the second equation?\n\nWait, that's a big deal. Then my previous substitution approach was correct, but the conclusion is even stronger. If one variable is 100 and the others add to 200, then the second equation is satisfied regardless of their values? Let me verify with an example.\n\nTake a=100, b=0, c=200. Then compute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b\n\n=100\u00b2*0 +100\u00b2*200 +0\u00b2*100 +0\u00b2*200 +200\u00b2*100 +200\u00b2*0\n\n=0 +20,000*100 +0 +0 +40,000*100 +0\n\n=2,000,000 +4,000,000=6,000,000. Correct.\n\nAnother example, a=100, b=50, c=150:\n\nCompute:\n\n100\u00b2*50 +100\u00b2*150 +50\u00b2*100 +50\u00b2*150 +150\u00b2*100 +150\u00b2*50\n\n=500,000 +1,500,000 +250,000 +375,000 +225,000*100 +225,000*50\n\nWait wait, let me compute term by term:\n\na\u00b2b =100\u00b2*50=500,000\n\na\u00b2c=100\u00b2*150=1,500,000\n\nb\u00b2a=2500*100=250,000\n\nb\u00b2c=2500*150=375,000\n\nc\u00b2a=22,500*100=2,250,000\n\nc\u00b2b=22,500*50=1,125,000\n\nNow adding all together:\n\n500,000 +1,500,000 =2,000,000\n\n+250,000 =2,250,000\n\n+375,000 =2,625,000\n\n+2,250,000 =4,875,000\n\n+1,125,000 =6,000,000. Perfect.\n\nSo indeed, any a=100 with b +c=200 will satisfy the equation. Therefore, the second equation is automatically satisfied when one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200. Therefore, the number of triples is exactly the number of ordered triples where one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200.\n\nTherefore, to count them:\n\nFor each of the three variables (a, b, c), set it to 100, then the other two variables must be nonnegative integers adding to 200. The number of solutions for each case is 201 (since for two nonnegative integers summing to 200, there are 201 solutions: from 0 to200). Therefore, total is 3\u00d7201=603. But this counts triples where two variables are 100 multiple times.\n\nSpecifically, the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times (once for each variable being set to 100). All other triples with exactly one 100 are counted once. Triples with two 100s are impossible because the third would have to be 100 as well.\n\nThus, using inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal triples =3\u00d7201 -2\u00d71=603 -2=601. Wait, but this contradicts the previous conclusion that all such triples satisfy the equation. Wait, but if the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times, but should only be counted once, so we subtract 2 duplicates. But according to the problem's conditions, the triple (100,100,100) is valid and should be counted once. The other triples are counted correctly.\n\nHowever, the problem requires the triples to satisfy both equations. Since all triples with one variable as 100 and the other two adding to 200 satisfy the second equation, then the total number is indeed 3\u00d7201 - 2\u00d71=601? But this contradicts the earlier analysis where we saw that when substituting, the equation requires that the other two variables are symmetric around 100, i.e., differing by 2k. But according to this, any pair adding to 200 works, regardless of their difference.\n\nWait, so there's a contradiction here. Where is the mistake?\n\nWait, let me re-examine the substitution approach:\n\nEarlier, I thought that when substituting variables as a=100 +x, etc., we ended up with the equation requiring that one of x,y,z is zero, but perhaps I made a mistake there?\n\nWait, let me re-express the problem.\n\nSuppose we have a triple where one variable is 100, say a=100, then b +c =200. Then the second equation reduces to 6,000,000 automatically. So in fact, any such triple satisfies the equation. So there's no requirement that the other two variables are symmetric around 100. For example, the triple (100, 200,0) is valid, but also (100, 199,1) is valid. So why did the substitution approach suggest that variables must be symmetric?\n\nAh! Here's the mistake. Earlier, when I set a =100 +x, b=100 +y, c=100 +z with x+y+z=0, I assumed that the variables are expressed as deviations from 100. But when we set a=100, and b +c =200, then variables b and c can be anything as long as they sum to 200, so their deviations from 100 can be anything as long as they sum to zero (since b -100 +c -100 = (b +c) -200=0). So actually, in this substitution, variables b and c can be any pair adding to 200, so their deviations y and z must satisfy y + z =0, so z =-y. Therefore, variables are (100,100 +y,100 -y). Thus, variables b and c must be symmetric around 100. Therefore, the earlier substitution approach is correct, and my later thought that any pair adding to 200 works is incorrect.\n\nWait, but in the example above with (100, 200,0), that is (100,100+100,100-100), which fits the substitution. Similarly, (100,199,1) would require y=99 and z= -99, so variables are 100+99=199 and100-99=1. So yes, this is allowed. So actually, the substitution approach allows any y from -100 to +100, but when expressed in terms of the variables, it's allowed as long as they are symmetric around 100. So the variables can be any pair adding to 200, but their deviations must be symmetric. So in effect, any pair (b,c) with b +c=200 can be written as (100 +y, 100 -y). Therefore, the substitution approach is correct, and the variables are indeed constrained to be symmetric around 100. However, when I considered the general case of setting a=100 and b +c=200, I thought that any b and c would work, but actually, the substitution shows that they must be symmetric. But wait, in the algebra above, when we set a=100, the equation reduces to an identity, so it must be that any b and c with b +c=200 work, regardless of their individual values.\n\nThere's a contradiction here. Let me re-examine the algebra:\n\nWhen a=100 and b +c=200, then the second equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2(b +c) +ab\u00b2 +ac\u00b2 + bc(b +c) = ?\n\nWait, let me recompute the second equation with a=100, b +c=200.\n\nThe second equation is:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= a\u00b2(b + c) + a(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + bc(b + c)\n\nSubstituting a=100, b +c=200:\n\n=100\u00b2*200 +100*(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) + bc*200\n\nWe need this to equal 6,000,000.\n\nBut let's see what b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 is in terms of (b +c)^2:\n\nb\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = (b +c)^2 - 2bc =200\u00b2 -2bc =40,000 -2bc.\n\nTherefore:\n\n100*(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2)=100*(40,000 -2bc)=4,000,000 -200bc.\n\nAdding the other terms:\n\n100\u00b2*200 =2,000,000,\n\n+4,000,000 -200bc,\n\n+200bc*(from bc*200 term)\n\nWait, the last term is bc*200.\n\nSo total expression:\n\n2,000,000 +4,000,000 -200bc +200bc =6,000,000.\n\nThe -200bc and +200bc cancel out, so the equation reduces to 6,000,000=6,000,000. So it's always true, regardless of bc. Therefore, any b and c with b +c=200 will satisfy the equation when a=100. Therefore, my substitution approach was incorrect in requiring symmetry. The substitution introduced the symmetry because I expressed variables as deviations from 100, but in reality, the equation allows any b and c as long as they sum to 200, even if they aren't symmetric. Therefore, there's a mistake in the substitution approach earlier.\n\nWait, but how does this reconcile with the substitution method?\n\nAh! In the substitution approach where we set a=100 +x, etc., we ended up with the condition that xy(x + y)=0. However, in this case, when we set a=100, that corresponds to x=0, and then the condition reduces to 0*y*(y)=0, which is always true, so there's no restriction on y. Therefore, variables b and c can be anything as long as their deviations from 100 sum to zero (since x +y +z=0). Wait, but if a=100 (x=0), then y +z=0 \u21d2 z = -y, so variables b=100 +y, c=100 -y. So their deviations must be negatives of each other, meaning they are symmetric around 100. But according to the direct substitution above, they can be any values adding to 200. So which is correct?\n\nWait, if we set a=100, then variables b and c must satisfy b +c=200, but in the substitution variables, b=100 +y and c=100 -y, so b +c=200, but also bc = (100 +y)(100 -y)=100\u00b2 -y\u00b2. However, in the general case, b and c can be any numbers adding to 200, so bc can vary. But according to the substitution approach, bc is constrained to 100\u00b2 -y\u00b2. So there is a discrepancy.\n\nWait, the mistake must be in the substitution approach's derivation. Let me go back.\n\nWhen I set a=100 +x, b=100 +y, c=100 +z with x+y+z=0, then the equation reduced to xy(x + y)=0. However, if a is set to 100 (x=0), then this equation becomes 0*y*(y)=0, which is always true, so there's no restriction on y and z (as long as z=-y). Therefore, the substitution approach allows any y, so variables b and c can be any pair adding to 200 (since b +c =200). Therefore, the substitution approach actually does allow any b and c adding to 200, which matches the direct computation.\n\nTherefore, my earlier mistake was thinking that the substitution required the variables to be symmetric in some other way, but actually, it's okay. So in this case, when a=100, b and c can be any pair adding to 200, so their deviations can be any y and -y. Thus, the number of triples where a=100 is indeed 201 (from y=-100 to +100, but since b and c must be nonnegative, y ranges from -100 to +100, but ensuring that 100 +y \u22650 and 100 -y \u22650 \u21d2 y between -100 and +100. But actually, when y is from -100 to +100, the values are:\n\nFor b=100 +y and c=100 -y:\n\n- When y ranges from -100 to +100:\n\n- For y=-100: b=0, c=200\n\n- For y=+100: b=200, c=0\n\n- So the values of b go from 0 to200, and c correspondingly from200 to0. Thus, there are 201 possibilities (from y=-100 to y=+100, which is 201 values). So yes, each variable can be set to 100, giving 201 triples, and three variables give 3\u00d7201=603, but subtract duplicates for the all-100 case counted three times, so total 603-2=601.\n\nBut this contradicts the substitution approach where we had 301.\n\nWait, now I'm really confused. There must be a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf the second equation is satisfied for any triple where one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200, then the number of solutions is indeed the number of ordered triples where one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200. \n\nTo count this:\n\nFor each of the three variables (a, b, c), set it to 100, then the other two variables must be nonnegative integers adding to 200. The number of solutions for two variables adding to200 is 201 (since they can be (0,200), (1,199), ..., (200,0)). So for each variable, 201 solutions, totaling 3\u00d7201=603. However, the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times (once for each variable being set to 100), so we subtract 2 duplicates to get 603\u22122=601.\n\nBut in the substitution approach, I had a different count. Where is the error?\n\nWait, the substitution approach required that variables are expressed as (100 +x, 100 +y, 100 +z) with x+y+z=0 and the equation reducing to xy(x+y)=0, leading to variables needing at least one of x,y,z to be zero. Which allows for variables like (100, 200,0), (100, 0,200), etc., but also (100, 1,199), (100,199,1), etc. So that should also allow all those cases. Therefore, the substitution approach's total count is indeed 3\u00d7201 -2=601.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the substitution approach gave 301 because I considered that for each k from 0 to100, there are three triples. But that was a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me re-examine that substitution approach:\n\nWhen I set a=100 +x, b=100 +y, c=100 +z with x+y+z=0, the equation reduces to requiring that at least one of x,y,z is zero. So for each variable being zero, we can have solutions.\n\nIf x=0 (i.e., a=100), then y + z =0, so z=-y. Therefore, the other variables are b=100 +y and c=100 -y, with y ranging over all integers such that b and c are nonnegative. Since y can be from -100 to +100, giving 201 possibilities. Similarly for y=0 and z=0.\n\nTherefore, for each variable being zero (i.e., a=100, b=100, or c=100), there are 201 triples. Thus, total is 3\u00d7201=603, subtract 2 for the triple counted three times, giving 601.\n\nTherefore, my initial substitution approach had an error in counting. I incorrectly considered k from 1 to100 and multiplied by 3, but actually, k can range from -100 to +100 (201 possibilities) for each variable. Hence the correct total is 601.\n\nBut this contradicts the earlier example where I thought the answer was 301. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in my first substitution approach, I considered k from 1 to100 and thought that each gives three triples, but that was incorrect because when you set a variable to 100, the other variables can range over all pairs adding to 200, which is 201 possibilities, not 100. So the correct count is 201 per variable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 601?\n\nBut let me verify with the example triples:\n\n- (100,100,100) is one triple.\n\n- For triples with a=100 and b ranging from0 to200, there are 201 triples where a=100.\n\nSimilarly for b=100 and c=100. So total triples where a=100:201, same for others. The overlap is only the all-100 triple counted three times. Thus, total triples are 3\u00d7201 -2\u00d71=601.\n\nBut let me check with the triple (100, 200,0). This is counted once in a=100 (when b=200, c=0), once in b=100 (when a=200, c=0), and once in c=100 (when a=200, b=0). Wait, no, actually:\n\nWait, the triple (100,200,0):\n\n- When considering a=100, it is counted as (100,200,0).\n\n- When considering b=100, it would be (200,100,0).\n\n- When considering c=100, it would be (200,0,100).\n\nSo each permutation is counted in a different variable's count, so the triple (100,200,0) is only counted once in the a=100 count, and similarly for the other permutations. The only triple that's counted multiple times is the all-100 one.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct triples is indeed 3\u00d7201 - 2 =601.\n\nBut then why did the substitution approach initially give me 301? Because I incorrectly limited k to 1 to100 and considered only triples where the other two variables were symmetric around 100 with k from1 to100, but in reality, the variables can be any pair adding to 200, so there are 201 possibilities for each variable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 601.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's take a specific case: the triple (100, 1,199). Is this a valid solution?\n\nCompute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\na=100, b=1, c=199.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b =100\u00b2*1 =10,000.\n\na\u00b2c =100\u00b2*199 =1,990,000.\n\nb\u00b2a =1\u00b2*100=100.\n\nb\u00b2c =1\u00b2*199=199.\n\nc\u00b2a =199\u00b2*100 = (39,601)*100=3,960,100.\n\nc\u00b2b =199\u00b2*1=39,601.\n\nNow sum all terms:\n\n10,000 +1,990,000 =2,000,000\n\n+100 =2,000,100\n\n+199 =2,000,300-?\n\nWait step by step:\n\nFirst two terms:10,000 +1,990,000 =2,000,000\n\nAdd b\u00b2a: +100 \u21922,000,100\n\nAdd b\u00b2c: +199 \u21922,000,299\n\nAdd c\u00b2a: +3,960,100 \u21922,000,299 +3,960,100 =5,960,399\n\nAdd c\u00b2b: +39,601 \u21925,960,399 +39,601 =6,000,000.\n\nYes, it works. So (100,1,199) is a valid solution. Therefore, indeed any triple where one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200 is valid, so there are 201\u00d73 -2=601 solutions.\n\nTherefore, my initial substitution approach was incorrect because I limited k to 1 to100, but actually k can range from -100 to +100, giving 201 possibilities for each variable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 601.\n\nBut then why did the equation derived through substitution give that variables must be symmetric? Let me see:\n\nWhen I set a=100 +x, b=100 +y, c=100 +z, with x+y+z=0, the condition derived was that xy(x+y)=0. If x=0 (a=100), then this condition is satisfied regardless of y and z (since x=0). Therefore, variables b and c can be any values as long as they add to 200. So there's no requirement for symmetry, so the substitution approach does allow all such triples. Therefore, the total count is indeed 601.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial substitution analysis where I thought the variables had to be symmetric. The error was in thinking that variables needed to be symmetric, but in reality, the substitution allows any pair adding to 200.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 601.\n\nWait, but this contradicts the earlier example where I thought of the triple (150,100,50). Which is counted in the 601.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe triple (150,100,50) has a=150, b=100, c=50. Here, b=100, so it is counted in the b=100 case. The other two variables a +c =200. So it's a valid solution, and is counted once in the b=100 count. So yes, it's included.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 601.\n\nBut then why did I get 301 earlier? Because I was considering only the cases where the two variables are symmetric around 100 (i.e., their deviations are y and -y), which is a subset of all possible pairs adding to 200. However, the equation allows any pairs adding to 200, so there are twice as many possibilities as I initially considered (since for each k from0 to100, you have two triples except when symmetric). Wait, no, actually the number of ordered triples where a=100 and b and c add to200 is 201, which includes all possible ordered pairs (b,c). For example, when b=0, c=200 and vice versa are both counted. So the total is indeed 201 per variable.\n\nTherefore, the correct total number is 3\u00d7201\u22122=601.\n\nHmm, so I must have made a mistake in my initial substitution analysis where I thought the variables needed to be symmetric. The key realization is that the second equation is automatically satisfied when one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200, regardless of their individual values. Therefore, all such triples are valid, leading to 601 solutions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so including zero. Let me confirm once again with the count:\n\nFor each variable set to 100:\n\n- The number of ordered triples where a=100 is the number of solutions to b +c=200 where b and c are nonnegative integers. This is 201 (from b=0 to 200).\n\nSimilarly for b=100 and c=100.\n\nTotal: 3\u00d7201=603.\n\nSubtract duplicates of the all-100 triple, which was counted three times, so subtract 2: 603\u22122=601.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 601.\n\nBut now I'm really confused because my initial substitution approach led me to 301 due to a misunderstanding, but upon re-examining the algebra, it's clear that the second equation is satisfied for any triple with one variable 100 and the others adding to 200, so the count is 601.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in my first substitution analysis where I thought there was a symmetry requirement, but actually there isn't. The key is that when one variable is fixed at 100, the equation reduces to an identity, so any pair adding to 200 works.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 601.\n\nWait, but let me check with another example: (100, 150, 50) is one triple, and (100, 50, 150) is another, both counted in the a=100 case. Similarly, (150,100,50) is counted in the b=100 case, etc. So each permutation is counted once, so there are indeed 201 per variable.\n\nTherefore, I'm now convinced the correct answer is 601.\n\nBut then why did the substitution approach initially suggest that variables must be symmetric? Because in the substitution variables, when you set a=100 +x, etc., and required that variables are expressed as deviations, but the condition only required that one of the deviations is zero (i.e., one variable is 100), and the other two can be any pair adding to 200, so their deviations can be anything as long as they sum to the negative of the first variable's deviation. So they can be asymmetric. So there is no symmetry requirement except that their deviations must sum to the negative of the first variable's deviation. So the substitution approach does allow all pairs adding to200, hence the total is 601.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 601.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"triples of nonnegative integers\". Let me see if there are overlapping triples when considering different variables.\n\nFor example, the triple (100, 200, 0) is counted in the a=100 case, the b=100 case would have (200, 100, 0), and the c=100 case would have (200,0,100). So each permutation is unique and counted once. The only overlap is the all-100 triple. Thus, the total is indeed 601.\n\nTherefore, my initial answer of 301 was wrong because I misunderstood the substitution's constraints. The correct answer is 601.\n\nWait, but I must have made a mistake in the problem's equation.\n\nWait, let me re-express the second equation:\n\nThe second equation is a\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b =6,000,000.\n\nWhen one variable is 100, say a=100, then b +c=200. The equation becomes:\n\n100\u00b2b +100\u00b2c +b\u00b2*100 +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2*100 +c\u00b2b.\n\nWhich simplifies to 100\u00b2*(b +c) +100*(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) + bc*(b +c).\n\nSince b +c=200, this is 100\u00b2*200 +100*(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) + bc*200.\n\nAs shown earlier, this simplifies to 2,000,000 + 100*( (b +c)^2 - 2bc ) +200 bc =2,000,000 +100*(40,000 -2bc) +200 bc =2,000,000 +4,000,000 -200 bc +200 bc =6,000,000.\n\nThus, it holds for any b and c adding to200. Therefore, the count is indeed 601.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in the initial substitution analysis where I thought variables had to be symmetric, but that was incorrect. The correct answer is 601.\n\nWait, but the problem might have a different answer. Let me think again.\n\nWait, let me check with another example where variables are not symmetric:\n\nTake a=100, b=1, c=199. As before, this works.\n\nAnother example: a=100, b=2, c=198. Let's compute:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b\n\n=100\u00b2*2 +100\u00b2*198 +2\u00b2*100 +2\u00b2*198 +198\u00b2*100 +198\u00b2*2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n100\u00b2*2=20,000,\n\n100\u00b2*198=19,800*100=1,980,000,\n\n2\u00b2*100=400,\n\n2\u00b2*198=792,\n\n198\u00b2*100=(39,204)*100=3,920,400,\n\n198\u00b2*2=39,204*2=78,408.\n\nNow sum all terms:\n\n20,000 +1,980,000=2,000,000\n\n+400=2,000,400\n\n+792=2,001,192\n\n+3,920,400=5,921,592\n\n+78,408=6,000,000.\n\nYes, it works. So the count is indeed 601.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 601.\n\nBut I must have made a mistake in my first substitution approach where I thought the variables needed to be symmetric. The key was that the equation reduces to an identity when one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200, so all such triples are valid.\n\nTherefore, the number of ordered triples is 3\u00d7201 \u22122=601.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 601.\n\nWait, but let me check the total number of non-negative integer triples with a +b +c =300 is C(300 +3 -1, 3-1)=C(302,2)= (302\u00d7301)/2=45,551. So 601 is a small fraction of that, which makes sense.\n\nTherefore, after correcting my mistake, the answer should be 601.\n\nBut I need to make sure that when I set variables like a=100, the other two variables can be anything adding to200. For example, (100, 200,0), (100, 0,200), (100,1,199), etc., all are valid and counted once each in their respective variable's count. The only overlap is the all-100 triple.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 601.\n\nHowever, the problem might have a different answer if there are additional constraints. Wait, the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so zeros are allowed, which we have considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the inclusion-exclusion. Let me recalculate:\n\nNumber of triples where a=100:201.\n\nSame for b=100 and c=100.\n\nTotal triples counted this way: 3\u00d7201=603.\n\nBut the triple where a=100, b=100, c=100 is counted three times (once in each category). All other triples where exactly one variable is 100 are counted once. Thus, the correct total is:\n\nTotal = (3\u00d7201) - 2*(number of triples with all three variables 100).\n\nSince the all-100 triple is counted three times, subtract 2 to get it counted once.\n\nHence, 603 -2=601.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 601.\n\nBut I'm really confused because my first approach led me to 301, but after re-examining the algebra, it's clear that the correct answer is 601. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the first substitution approach by incorrectly assuming a symmetry requirement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{601}\n\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the number of triples of nonnegative integers \\((a, b, c)\\) satisfying \\(a + b + c = 300\\) and \\(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\\), we start by analyzing the given equations.\n\nFirst, we note that the second equation can be rewritten using the identity:\n\\[\na^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b)\n\\]\nGiven \\(a + b + c = 300\\), we substitute \\(b + c = 300 - a\\), \\(a + c = 300 - b\\), and \\(a + b = 300 - c\\) into the equation:\n\\[\na^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying this equation, we find that it reduces to:\n\\[\n300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000\n\\]\nUsing the identities for symmetric sums and further simplification, we derive the equation:\n\\[\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the substitution \\(a = 100 + x\\), \\(b = 100 + y\\), \\(c = 100 + z\\) with \\(x + y + z = 0\\). This leads to the condition that at least one of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), or \\(z\\) must be zero, implying that at least one of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), or \\(c\\) must be 100. \n\nWe then analyze the cases where one of the variables is fixed at 100. For each variable (e.g., \\(a = 100\\)), the other two variables must sum to 200. The number of non-negative integer solutions to \\(b + c = 200\\) is 201. Considering all three variables, we have \\(3 \\times 201 = 603\\) solutions. However, the triple \\((100, 100, 100)\\) is counted three times, so we subtract 2 duplicates, leading to:\n\\[\n603 - 2 = 601\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of triples \\((a, b, c)\\) that satisfy the given conditions is \\(\\boxed{601}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b equals 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit complex, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem involves three variables with a linear equation and a quadratic expression. Maybe I can use some algebraic manipulation here. Let me recall some identities or formulas that might relate these terms. \n\nThe given quadratic expression is a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b. Hmm, this looks symmetric in a, b, and c. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me see:\n\nLooking at each term, each is of the form (variable squared times another variable). Let me group them:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b). \n\nYes, that's a way to factor it. Since a + b + c = 300, maybe we can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), and similarly for the others. Let me try that.\n\nSo substituting, the expression becomes:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c). \n\nWait, let me check that substitution again. Since b + c = 300 - a, so replacing that in the first term gives a\u00b2*(300 - a). Similarly for the other terms. So the entire expression is:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that's an interesting form. Let me write that down:\n\nSum_{cyc} [a\u00b2(300 - a)] = 6,000,000.\n\nAlternatively, expanding each term:\n\na\u00b2*300 - a\u00b3 + b\u00b2*300 - b\u00b3 + c\u00b2*300 - c\u00b3 = 6,000,000.\n\nSo that can be written as:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, okay. Maybe I can relate this to other symmetric sums. Let me recall that (a + b + c)^3 = a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) or something like that? Wait, perhaps better to recall the standard expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 in terms of (a + b + c)^3 and other terms. Let me recall that:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me verify:\n\nYes, the expansion of (a + b + c)^3 is a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3(a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) + 6abc.\n\nTherefore, rearranged:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) - 6abc.\n\nHmm, but in our problem, the given expression is exactly a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ... + c\u00b2a, which is the same as the term in the above equation. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000, and let me also note that the problem gives Q = 6,000,000.\n\nTherefore, substituting into the expansion:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S\u00b3 - 3Q - 6abc.\n\nTherefore, substituting back into the equation we had earlier:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nReplace a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 with the above expression:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - [S\u00b3 - 3Q - 6abc] = 6,000,000.\n\nBut S is 300, so S\u00b3 = 300^3 = 27,000,000. Let me plug that in:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - [27,000,000 - 3*(6,000,000) - 6abc] = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify the terms inside the brackets:\n\n27,000,000 - 18,000,000 - 6abc = 9,000,000 - 6abc.\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (9,000,000 - 6abc) = 6,000,000.\n\nThen:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - 9,000,000 + 6abc = 6,000,000.\n\nBring the 9,000,000 to the right side:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 6abc = 6,000,000 + 9,000,000 = 15,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 6 to simplify:\n\n50(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + abc = 2,500,000.\n\nHmm, okay. So now we have another equation: 50(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + abc = 2,500,000. \n\nHmm, this might be a bit more manageable? Not sure yet. Let me see if I can find another relation. Since we know that a + b + c = 300, perhaps express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 in terms of (a + b + c)^2 and ab + bc + ca. \n\nYes, recall that:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nSo substituting S = 300, that gives:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 300\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nTherefore, substitute this into the equation above:\n\n50[90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)] + abc = 2,500,000.\n\nCompute 50*90,000 = 4,500,000 and 50*(-2)(ab + bc + ca) = -100(ab + bc + ca). So:\n\n4,500,000 - 100(ab + bc + ca) + abc = 2,500,000.\n\nSubtract 2,500,000 from both sides:\n\n2,000,000 - 100(ab + bc + ca) + abc = 0.\n\nRearranged:\n\nabc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0.\n\nHmm. So now we have an equation involving abc and ab + bc + ca. Let me denote P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc. Then the equation becomes:\n\nQ - 100P + 2,000,000 = 0 => Q = 100P - 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, but I need another equation involving P and Q. Since we know a + b + c = 300, perhaps we can recall that for three variables, the relationships between sums are:\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) => we already used that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express in terms of symmetric sums. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a smarter substitution here. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of variables in terms of two variables. Let me suppose that two variables are equal, maybe? Since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps the solutions are symmetric or have some symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that two variables are equal. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose that a = b. Then since a + b + c = 300, we have 2a + c = 300 => c = 300 - 2a.\n\nThen, let's compute Q = a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nSince a = b, this becomes:\n\na\u00b2a + a\u00b2c + a\u00b2a + a\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2a\n\n= 2a\u00b3 + 2a\u00b2c + 2a c\u00b2\n\n= 2a\u00b3 + 2a\u00b2c + 2a c\u00b2.\n\nBut since c = 300 - 2a, substitute:\n\n2a\u00b3 + 2a\u00b2(300 - 2a) + 2a(300 - 2a)^2.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 2a\u00b3\n\nSecond term: 2a\u00b2*(300 - 2a) = 600a\u00b2 - 4a\u00b3\n\nThird term: 2a*(300 - 2a)^2.\n\nFirst compute (300 - 2a)^2 = 90000 - 1200a + 4a\u00b2. Then multiply by 2a:\n\n2a*(90000 - 1200a +4a\u00b2) = 180000a - 2400a\u00b2 + 8a\u00b3.\n\nNow sum all three terms:\n\nFirst term: 2a\u00b3\n\nSecond term: 600a\u00b2 -4a\u00b3\n\nThird term: 180000a -2400a\u00b2 +8a\u00b3\n\nAdding together:\n\n2a\u00b3 -4a\u00b3 +8a\u00b3 = (2 -4 +8)a\u00b3 = 6a\u00b3\n\n600a\u00b2 -2400a\u00b2 = -1800a\u00b2\n\n180000a remains.\n\nSo total Q = 6a\u00b3 -1800a\u00b2 + 180000a.\n\nSet this equal to 6,000,000:\n\n6a\u00b3 -1800a\u00b2 + 180000a = 6,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30000a = 1,000,000.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30000a - 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nHmm, need to solve this cubic equation for integer a (since a is nonnegative integer, and c = 300 - 2a must also be nonnegative, so 300 - 2a \u2265 0 => a \u2264 150). So a is between 0 and 150.\n\nHmm, solving the cubic equation a\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30000a - 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nMaybe factor this? Let me try possible integer roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1, so possible a values could be divisors of 1,000,000. But since a is between 0 and 150, let me test a = 100:\n\nPlugging a = 100: 1,000,000 - 300*(10,000) + 30000*100 - 1,000,000\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\n100\u00b3 = 1,000,000\n\n-300*(100)^2 = -300*10,000 = -3,000,000\n\n+30000*100 = +3,000,000\n\n-1,000,000 = -1,000,000\n\nTotal: 1,000,000 -3,000,000 +3,000,000 -1,000,000 = 0. \n\nOh! a=100 is a root. Great!\n\nTherefore, (a - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.\n\nDivide the cubic by (a - 100):\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division.\n\nLet me use synthetic division with root 100:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30000 | -1,000,000\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 100: 100. Add to -300: -200.\n\nMultiply -200 by 100: -20,000. Add to 30,000: 10,000.\n\nMultiply 10,000 by 100: 1,000,000. Add to -1,000,000: 0.\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000).\n\nNow set the quadratic factor equal to zero:\n\na\u00b2 -200a +10,000 =0.\n\nUse quadratic formula:\n\na = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(200\u00b2 - 4*1*10,000)] /2\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n40,000 - 40,000 = 0.\n\nThus, a = 200/(2) = 100. So the quadratic has a double root at a=100.\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as (a -100)^3 =0. Wait, but wait:\n\nWait, the quadratic is (a -100)^2, since discriminant is zero. Therefore, the cubic is (a -100)^3? Let me check:\n\nWait, (a -100)^3 = a\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000. Which matches exactly the cubic equation. So yes, the equation is (a -100)^3 =0, so the only real root is a=100. But since we are looking for integer a between 0 and 150, the only solution here is a=100. \n\nTherefore, in the case when a = b, we have a = b = 100, and c = 300 - 2*100 = 100. So the triple is (100, 100, 100). Let me check if this satisfies the original equation:\n\nCompute a + b + c = 300, which is 300. Good.\n\nNow compute the quadratic expression:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ... etc. Since all are 100, each term is 100\u00b2*100 = 1,000,000. There are 6 terms, so total is 6,000,000. Perfect, that works.\n\nSo (100, 100, 100) is a solution. But are there other solutions where variables are not equal?\n\nHmm, so far we considered the case when a = b. But maybe there are solutions where all three variables are different, or two are equal but not all three.\n\nWait, perhaps trying another case where two variables are equal, say a = b, but we saw only a=100 gives a solution. Maybe trying when a = c?\n\nWait, but since the problem is symmetric, if we assume any two variables equal, it would lead to the same result. So perhaps the only solution with two variables equal is the fully symmetric one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are solutions where all variables are different. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables in terms of two variables. Let me let c = 300 - a - b, then substitute into the equations. But that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps consider the equation we had earlier:\n\nabc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0.\n\nLet me see if I can manipulate this equation. Let me factor terms:\n\nabc -100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor terms with ab, bc, etc. Let me see:\n\nabc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000 =0.\n\nAlternatively, let me factor:\n\nab(c -100) + c(a + b)(-100) +2,000,000? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe factor in terms of (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) or something similar?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider shifting variables. Let me set x = a - 100, y = b -100, z = c -100. Then, since a + b + c = 300, we have x + y + z = 0. Then perhaps the equation can be rewritten in terms of x, y, z. Maybe this substitution can help?\n\nLet me try. Let x = a - 100, y = b -100, z = c -100. So x + y + z = (a + b + c) - 300 = 0. So z = -x - y.\n\nThen, let me substitute into the equation:\n\nabc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000 =0.\n\nFirst, compute abc:\n\n(a)(b)(c) = (100 + x)(100 + y)(100 + z).\n\nSimilarly, ab + bc + ca = (100 + x)(100 + y) + (100 + y)(100 + z) + (100 + z)(100 + x).\n\nThis might be messy, but let me see if plugging z = -x - y can simplify things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute each term:\n\nFirst, let me compute abc:\n\n(100 + x)(100 + y)(100 + z) = (100 + x)(100 + y)(100 -x - y).\n\nSimilarly, ab + bc + ca:\n\n(100 + x)(100 + y) + (100 + y)(100 + z) + (100 + z)(100 + x).\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this substitution is getting too complicated. Let me think of another approach.\n\nWait, going back to the equation:\n\nabc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000 =0.\n\nLet me try to see if (a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100) is the only solution. Suppose there exists another solution where one variable is different.\n\nSuppose that one variable is 100 + k, another is 100 + m, and the third is 100 - (k + m). Let me see.\n\nLet me set a = 100 + k, b = 100 + m, c = 100 - (k + m). Then, since a + b + c = 300, that works. Let me substitute into the equation:\n\nabc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000 =0.\n\nFirst compute abc:\n\n(100 +k)(100 +m)(100 -k -m).\n\nSimilarly, compute ab + bc + ca.\n\nThis might be tedious, but let's try.\n\nLet me first compute abc:\n\nLet me denote term1 = (100 +k)(100 +m) = 10000 + 100(m +k) + km.\n\nMultiply by (100 - (k + m)):\n\n[10000 + 100(k + m) + km][100 - (k + m)]\n\nLet me denote S = k + m, so the expression becomes:\n\n[10000 + 100S + km][100 - S].\n\nExpanding this:\n\n10000*(100 - S) + 100S*(100 - S) + km*(100 - S)\n\n= 1,000,000 -10,000S + 10,000S -100S\u00b2 + 100km - km S\n\n= 1,000,000 -100S\u00b2 +100km - km S.\n\nHmm, so abc = 1,000,000 -100S\u00b2 +100km - km S.\n\nNow compute ab + bc + ca:\n\nab = (100 +k)(100 +m) = 10000 +100(m +k) + km.\n\nbc = (100 +m)(100 - S) since c = 100 - S (since S = k + m). Wait, c = 100 - (k + m) = 100 - S.\n\nTherefore, bc = (100 + m)(100 - S).\n\nSimilarly, ca = (100 +k)(100 - S).\n\nThus, ab + bc + ca = ab + bc + ca = [10000 +100(m +k) + km] + (100 +m)(100 - S) + (100 +k)(100 - S).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: ab = 10000 +100(m +k) + km.\n\nSecond term: bc = (100 + m)(100 - S) = 100*100 -100S +100m - m S.\n\nThird term: ca = (100 +k)(100 - S) = 100*100 -100S +100k -k S.\n\nAdding these together:\n\nFirst term: 10000 +100(m +k) + km\n\nSecond term: 10,000 -100S +100m -m S\n\nThird term: 10,000 -100S +100k -k S\n\nTotal sum:\n\n10000 + 10,000 +10,000 + [100(m +k) + km] + [ -100S +100m -m S] + [ -100S +100k -k S]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nSum of constants: 30,000.\n\nNow the terms with m and k:\n\n100(m +k) + km + (-100S +100m -m S) + (-100S +100k -k S)\n\nLet me note that S = k + m, so substitute S:\n\nFirst, 100(m +k) = 100S.\n\nThen, km is just km.\n\nThen, the second term:\n\n-100S +100m -m S = -100S +100m -m(k + m) = -100S +100m - mk - m\u00b2.\n\nThird term similarly:\n\n-100S +100k -k S = -100S +100k -k(k + m) = -100S +100k -k\u00b2 - km.\n\nTherefore, combining all terms:\n\n100S + km + [ -100S +100m - mk - m\u00b2 ] + [ -100S +100k -k\u00b2 - km ]\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\n100S + km -100S +100m - mk - m\u00b2 -100S +100k -k\u00b2 - km.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n100S -100S -100S = -100S\n\nkm - mk - km = km - mk - km = - mk - km? Wait, perhaps better step by step.\n\nWait, km is the first term, then -mk (from second bracket), then -km (from third bracket). So km - mk - km = - mk.\n\nWait, but km = mk, so km - mk = 0, then - km? Hmm, perhaps miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me track each term:\n\nStarting with:\n\n100S + km \n\n+ ( -100S +100m - mk - m\u00b2 )\n\n+ ( -100S +100k -k\u00b2 - km )\n\nSo term by term:\n\n100S + km -100S +100m - mk - m\u00b2 -100S +100k -k\u00b2 - km.\n\nNow, let's group similar terms:\n\n100S -100S -100S = -100S.\n\nkm - mk - km: km - mk is zero because km = mk, so km - mk =0, then minus another km gives -km.\n\nWait, actually, km is the first term, then in the second bracket, -mk, which is -km, and in the third bracket, -km. So altogether:\n\nkm - km - km = -km.\n\nThen, the remaining terms:\n\n100m +100k - m\u00b2 -k\u00b2.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n-100S - km +100(m +k) - (m\u00b2 +k\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, the entire ab + bc + ca expression is:\n\n30,000 -100S - km +100(m +k) - (m\u00b2 +k\u00b2).\n\nHmm, that's complicated, but let's see if we can write it in terms of S and other terms.\n\nSince S = m +k, so m +k = S.\n\nThus,\n\nab + bc + ca = 30,000 -100S - km +100S - (m\u00b2 +k\u00b2).\n\nThe -100S and +100S cancel, so:\n\n=30,000 - km - (m\u00b2 +k\u00b2).\n\nHmm, so ab + bc + ca = 30,000 - (m\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + km).\n\nNow, going back to the main equation:\n\nabc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000 =0.\n\nWe have abc from earlier as:\n\nabc = 1,000,000 -100S\u00b2 +100km - km S.\n\nWait, let me recall:\n\nEarlier, abc was:\n\n1,000,000 -100S\u00b2 +100km - km S.\n\nSo substituting into the equation:\n\n[1,000,000 -100S\u00b2 +100km - km S] -100*(30,000 - (m\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + km)) +2,000,000 =0.\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: 1,000,000 -100S\u00b2 +100km - km S.\n\nSecond term: -100*(30,000 - m\u00b2 -k\u00b2 - km) = -3,000,000 +100m\u00b2 +100k\u00b2 +100km.\n\nThird term: +2,000,000.\n\nAdding all together:\n\nFirst term components:\n\n1,000,000 -100S\u00b2 +100km - km S\n\nSecond term components:\n\n-3,000,000 +100m\u00b2 +100k\u00b2 +100km\n\nThird term: +2,000,000\n\nCombine constants:\n\n1,000,000 -3,000,000 +2,000,000 = 0.\n\nTerms with S\u00b2: -100S\u00b2\n\nTerms with m\u00b2 and k\u00b2: +100m\u00b2 +100k\u00b2.\n\nTerms with km: 100km +100km = 200km, but there's also a -km S term.\n\nWait, let's do step by step:\n\nTerms with S\u00b2: -100S\u00b2.\n\nTerms with m\u00b2 and k\u00b2: 100m\u00b2 +100k\u00b2.\n\nTerms with km:\n\n100km (from first term) +100km (from second term) - km S.\n\nSo total km terms: 200km - km S.\n\nOther terms:\n\n- km S.\n\nWait, so putting all together:\n\n-100S\u00b2 +100m\u00b2 +100k\u00b2 +200km - km S =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor terms:\n\nLet me note that S = m + k, so S\u00b2 = m\u00b2 + 2mk +k\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, substituting S\u00b2:\n\n-100(m\u00b2 + 2mk +k\u00b2) +100m\u00b2 +100k\u00b2 +200mk - km S =0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-100m\u00b2 -200mk -100k\u00b2 +100m\u00b2 +100k\u00b2 +200mk - km S.\n\nSimplify:\n\n-100m\u00b2 +100m\u00b2 cancels.\n\n-200mk +200mk cancels.\n\n-100k\u00b2 +100k\u00b2 cancels.\n\nLeft with: - km S =0.\n\nTherefore, the equation reduces to:\n\n- km S =0.\n\nSo -km(m +k) =0.\n\nThus, the equation reduces to km(m +k)=0.\n\nSo this must hold.\n\nTherefore, either k =0, m=0, or m +k =0.\n\nBut since k and m are integers (since a, b, c are integers and a =100 +k, etc.), and variables a, b, c are nonnegative, so:\n\nLet me consider the possibilities:\n\nCase 1: k =0. Then, since S =k +m = m, so m can be anything, but then m +k = m must also satisfy variables nonnegative. Let me see:\n\nIf k =0, then a =100 +0 =100, and m can be any integer such that b =100 +m, c =100 - m (since S = m +0 = m, so c =100 - S =100 -m).\n\nWait, since c must be nonnegative, 100 - m \u22650 \u21d2 m \u2264100. Also, b =100 + m must be nonnegative \u21d2 m \u2265-100. But since m = S = k + m, but since k=0, m can be from -100 to 100. However, since a, b, c are nonnegative, let me see:\n\na =100 is fixed. b =100 + m must be \u22650 \u21d2 m \u2265-100. c =100 -m must be \u22650 \u21d2 m \u2264100. So m \u2208 [-100, 100].\n\nBut also, in this case, the original equation reduces to km(m +k)=0, which with k=0 is satisfied for any m. However, we need to ensure that the original equation is satisfied. Wait, but in this substitution approach, we already derived that the equation reduces to -km S =0, so when k=0, the equation holds regardless of m, but does that mean all triples where a=100 and b and c vary such that b + c =200 would satisfy the original equation?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because in this substitution, we assumed a =100 +k, etc., but the substitution led us to the conclusion that if k=0, then the equation holds for any m, but we need to verify whether those actually satisfy the original equation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check this. Let me take an example.\n\nSuppose k =0, so a=100. Let me choose m=50. Then b =150, c=50. So the triple is (100,150,50). Let me check if this satisfies the original equations.\n\nFirst, a + b + c =100 +150 +50 = 300. Good.\n\nNow compute the quadratic expression:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b =100\u00b2*150 = 1,000,000*1.5=1,500,000\n\na\u00b2c =100\u00b2*50= 1,000,000*0.5=500,000\n\nb\u00b2a =150\u00b2*100=22,500*100=2,250,000\n\nb\u00b2c=150\u00b2*50=22,500*50=1,125,000\n\nc\u00b2a=50\u00b2*100=2,500*100=250,000\n\nc\u00b2b=50\u00b2*150=2,500*150=375,000\n\nAdding all together:\n\n1,500,000 +500,000 = 2,000,000\n\n2,250,000 +1,125,000 = 3,375,000\n\n250,000 +375,000 =625,000\n\nTotal sum: 2,000,000 +3,375,000 +625,000 =6,000,000. Wow, it works!\n\nSo this triple (100,150,50) also satisfies the equation. But in my earlier assumption when a = b, the only solution was (100,100,100). So this suggests that there are more solutions when two variables are not equal, but one is fixed at 100. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, so in this substitution approach, we considered shifting variables around 100, and found that if k=0 (so a=100), then any m (so varying b and c such that b + c=200) would satisfy the equation? But why?\n\nWait, actually, in the substitution approach, when I set a =100 +k, etc., and derived that the equation reduces to km(m +k)=0, so when k=0, then any m is allowed. Therefore, in that case, the equation is satisfied for any m. Therefore, this suggests that all triples where a=100 and b + c =200 will satisfy the original equation. But when I tested with (100,150,50), it worked, so that's a valid solution. So that suggests there are more solutions.\n\nWait a second, so perhaps the solutions are all triples where one of the variables is 100, and the other two sum to 200. Wait, but let's test another one. Let me take m=100, so b=200, c=0. Then the triple is (100,200,0). Let me check the quadratic expression:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b =100\u00b2*200 =1,000,000*2=2,000,000\n\na\u00b2c =100\u00b2*0=0\n\nb\u00b2a =200\u00b2*100 =40,000*100=4,000,000\n\nb\u00b2c=200\u00b2*0=0\n\nc\u00b2a =0\u00b2*100=0\n\nc\u00b2b=0\u00b2*200=0\n\nTotal sum:2,000,000 +4,000,000 =6,000,000. So that works too!\n\nSimilarly, if m = -50, then b = 100 -50 =50, c =100 - (-50) =150. So triple (100,50,150), which is the same as the previous one but reordered, so it also works.\n\nTherefore, this suggests that whenever one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200, the equation holds. So this gives a family of solutions. Similarly, if instead of fixing a=100, we fix b=100 or c=100, then those would also work. So in total, all triples where one of the variables is 100, and the other two add to 200. \n\nTherefore, the solutions are all triples where one variable is 100 and the other two variables are nonnegative integers summing to 200. \n\nWait, but we also need to ensure that all variables are nonnegative. So for example, if we fix a=100, then b and c can be any nonnegative integers with b +c =200. Similarly for fixing b=100 or c=100. \n\nHowever, we need to be careful not to overcount the case where all three variables are 100, since that case is counted three times (once in each variable being fixed at 100). \n\nTherefore, total number of solutions is:\n\nNumber of triples where a=100: (100, b, c) with b +c =200. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to b +c =200 is 201 (from b=0 to 200).\n\nSimilarly for triples where b=100: 201 solutions, and same for c=100:201 solutions.\n\nTotal would be 3*201 =603, but subtract the overlaps where two variables are 100. Wait, how many overlaps are there?\n\nThe overlaps occur when two variables are 100, say a=100 and b=100, then c=100. Because a + b + c =300, so if a=100 and b=100, then c=100. So the only triple where two variables are 100 is actually the triple (100,100,100). So each pair of variables being 100 leads to the same triple. Therefore, the overlap is only the single triple (100,100,100). Since each of the three cases (a=100, b=100, c=100) includes this triple, so when we added 3*201, we counted this triple three times. So to get the correct total, we need to subtract 2 instances of it (since we want to count it only once).\n\nTherefore total solutions would be 3*201 - 2*1 = 603 -2 =601? Wait, wait, inclusion-exclusion principle says:\n\nTotal = (A + B + C) - (AB + AC + BC) + ABC, where A is the set with a=100, B with b=100, C with c=100.\n\nHere, A, B, C each have 201 elements. The intersections AB is the set where a=100 and b=100, which requires c=100, so only 1 element. Similarly AC and BC each have 1 element. The intersection ABC is also that same single triple. \n\nThus, inclusion-exclusion gives:\n\nTotal = |A| + |B| + |C| - |AB| - |AC| - |BC| + |ABC|\n\n= 201 +201 +201 -1 -1 -1 +1\n\n= 603 -3 +1 = 601.\n\nWait, 201*3 is 603, subtract 3 (each intersection AB, AC, BC is 1), then add back 1 for ABC. So 603 -3 +1 =601. \n\nTherefore the total number of triples is 601. \n\nBut hold on, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me check with another example. Suppose the triple is (100, 200, 0). This is counted in set A (a=100). Similarly (200, 100,0) is in set B, and (0,100,200) is in set C. The triple (100,100,100) is in all three sets. So the inclusion-exclusion calculation should be correct.\n\nBut let me verify with a smaller case. Suppose instead of 300, we had a smaller total, say a + b + c = 2, and similar equation. Maybe that would help.\n\nWait, but maybe proceed.\n\nWait, but before I get too confident, let me check another triple not in the overlap. Take (100, 0, 200). That's valid, and it's counted once in A. Similarly (0,100,200) once in B, etc. So yes, the inclusion-exclusion is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is 601. But wait, but let me think again: when a=100, the number of triples is 201 (from b=0 to 200). Similarly for the others, so 3*201 counts all triples where at least one variable is 100. But the triple (100,100,100) is included three times, so we subtract 2 copies to leave one, hence total 3*201 -2 = 603 -2 =601? Wait but inclusion-exclusion says 603 -3 +1 =601. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 601? Hmm, but let me check if there are other solutions outside of this case. Because in the substitution approach, we assumed that a=100 +k, but perhaps there are solutions where none of the variables are 100?\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose there exists a solution where all variables are different from 100. Let me suppose such a triple exists. Let me see if that is possible.\n\nSuppose a, b, c are all different from 100. Then, in the equation km(m +k)=0 (from substitution variables), where k and m are deviations from 100, we must have km(m +k)=0. But if none of the variables are 100, then neither k, m nor their sum can be zero. Wait, but if variables are not 100, then for example, if a \u2260100, then k \u22600, and similarly for b\u2260100, so m \u22600, and since c = 300 -a -b, then S = m +k \u22600 (since a + b \u2260200, so c \u2260100). Therefore, km(m +k) would not be zero, so the equation would not hold. Therefore, there can be no solutions where none of the variables are 100. Thus all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100. Therefore, the total number is indeed 601.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the substitution approach, we considered a =100 +k, but actually, the variables can be permuted. So the only solutions are those with at least one variable equal to 100, so indeed inclusion-exclusion gives 601.\n\nHowever, let me check with another example where two variables are 100. For example, (100,100,100) is the only triple where all three are 100, but also triples like (100,100,100) is the only one where two variables are 100? Wait, suppose two variables are 100, say a=100 and b=100, then c=100. So indeed, any two variables being 100 forces the third to be 100. So there are no triples with exactly two variables as 100, only triples with all three or just one.\n\nTherefore, the count via inclusion-exclusion is correct: 3*201 - 3*1 +1? Wait no, inclusion-exclusion formula is |A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|.\n\nHere, each |A| = |B| = |C| =201,\n\neach |A\u2229B| = |A\u2229C| = |B\u2229C| =1 (the triple (100,100,100)),\n\nand |A\u2229B\u2229C| =1.\n\nTherefore,\n\nTotal =201*3 - 3*1 +1 =603 -3 +1=601.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 601.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so zero is allowed. So all triples where one variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200, including when one is zero. So that's correct.\n\nBut hold on, let me check if there is another possible solution where variables are not in this form. Suppose someone has a=0, b=0, c=300. Let me check if that works.\n\nCompute the quadratic expression:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nAll terms are zero except c\u00b2a and c\u00b2b, but a and b are zero, so all terms are zero. So the total is zero, which is not 6,000,000. So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother test case: suppose a=200, b=100, c=0. Wait, this is the same as (200,100,0), which is part of the count where b=100. Let me check the expression:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\n=200\u00b2*100 +200\u00b2*0 +100\u00b2*200 +100\u00b2*0 +0\u00b2*200 +0\u00b2*100.\n\n= (40,000*100) +0 + (10,000*200) +0 +0 +0 =4,000,000 + 2,000,000=6,000,000. Yes, that works. So it is counted in the B set (b=100). So that's okay.\n\nAnother test: a=150, b=100, c=50. This is (150,100,50). Let me compute:\n\na\u00b2b =150\u00b2*100 =22500*100=2,250,000\n\na\u00b2c =150\u00b2*50=22500*50=1,125,000\n\nb\u00b2a=100\u00b2*150=10,000*150=1,500,000\n\nb\u00b2c=100\u00b2*50=10,000*50=500,000\n\nc\u00b2a=50\u00b2*150=2,500*150=375,000\n\nc\u00b2b=50\u00b2*100=2,500*100=250,000\n\nTotal: 2,250,000 +1,125,000 =3,375,000; 1,500,000 +500,000=2,000,000; 375,000 +250,000=625,000. Total sum 3,375,000 +2,000,000 +625,000 =6,000,000. Correct. So yes, that works and is part of the count when b=100.\n\nTherefore, it seems the only solutions are those with at least one variable equal to 100, and the total number is 601.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the equation abc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000 =0. Suppose that none of a,b,c are 100, but the equation still holds. Is that possible?\n\nSuppose, for instance, take a=99, b=101, c=100. Wait, but here c=100, so that is included in our previous count. So variables must have at least one 100.\n\nAlternatively, suppose all variables different from 100. Let me try a=101, b=100, c=99. Wait, but b=100 is still there.\n\nAlternatively, a=150, b=150, c=0. Then a +b +c=300. Check the quadratic expression:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\n=150\u00b2*150 +150\u00b2*0 +150\u00b2*150 +150\u00b2*0 +0\u00b2*150 +0\u00b2*150.\n\n=2*(150)^3 +0=2*(3,375,000)=6,750,000 \u22606,000,000. So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother test: a=140, b=110, c=50. Let's see:\n\nSum is 140+110+50=300.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b =140\u00b2*110=19,600*110=2,156,000\n\na\u00b2c=140\u00b2*50=19,600*50=980,000\n\nb\u00b2a=110\u00b2*140=12,100*140=1,694,000\n\nb\u00b2c=110\u00b2*50=12,100*50=605,000\n\nc\u00b2a=50\u00b2*140=2,500*140=350,000\n\nc\u00b2b=50\u00b2*110=2,500*110=275,000\n\nTotal: 2,156,000 +980,000 =3,136,000; 1,694,000 +605,000=2,299,000; 350,000 +275,000=625,000.\n\nTotal sum: 3,136,000 +2,299,000 =5,435,000 +625,000 =6,060,000. Not 6,000,000. Close, but not exact. So this doesn't work.\n\nHmm, so it seems that only the triples with at least one 100 work. Therefore, the total number is indeed 601. \n\nWait, but let me confirm once more with another example where two variables are 100. Wait, but that forces the third to be 100, so (100,100,100) is the only one. So in the count, that's included once in each set A,B,C, but via inclusion-exclusion, it's counted once in total. So that's okay.\n\nTherefore, I think the final answer is 601. But let me check the arithmetic again for inclusion-exclusion:\n\nEach of the three sets (A,B,C) has 201 elements. The intersections of two sets each have 1 element (the triple with all three 100). The intersection of all three sets is also that same triple. So:\n\nTotal = 3*201 - 3*(1) + 1*(1) = 603 -3 +1 = 601. Yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of triples is 601.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Wait, the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so including zero. When we count the number of solutions for a=100, then b and c are nonnegative integers with b + c =200. The number of solutions is 201 (from 0 to 200 inclusive). Similarly for the others. So that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 601. Hmm.\n\nBut I feel like the problem might have a trick where the answer is different. Wait, let me think again. Let me see if the equation allows variables greater than 300, but no, since a +b +c=300, so each variable is at most 300. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a miscalculation in the inclusion-exclusion. Let me recast the problem.\n\nThe number of triples where a=100 is 201. Similarly for b=100 and c=100. The overlap between a=100 and b=100 is exactly the triple (100,100,100). Similarly overlaps between a=100 and c=100, and b=100 and c=100 are the same triple. The intersection of all three is also that triple. \n\nTherefore, using inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal = (201 +201 +201) - (1 +1 +1) +1 = 603 -3 +1 =601.\n\nYes, so that is correct. So the answer is 601. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again. The problem says \"triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c)\", so ordered triples? Yes, because in counting like (100,150,50) and (150,100,50) are different triples. So when we count the number for a=100, it includes all permutations where the first element is 100, but when we do 3*201, are we overcounting the permutations?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen we count the set A (a=100), it includes all triples where the first variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200. So for example, (100, 150,50) is in set A, but (150,100,50) is in set B. Therefore, all ordered triples are considered, and the total count via inclusion-exclusion correctly counts all ordered triples where at least one variable is 100.\n\nTherefore, 601 is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Wait, when you fix a=100, you have 201 ordered triples where the first variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200. Similarly for b=100 and c=100. Thus, the total number is indeed 3*201 minus overlaps. \n\nAlternatively, if we think of unordered triples, but the problem says \"triples\", which are ordered. So the count is correct as 601.\n\nHmm. I think this is right. Therefore, I will go with 601 as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{601}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b equals 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit complex, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem involves three variables with a linear equation and a quadratic expression. Maybe I can use some algebraic manipulation here. Let me recall some identities or formulas that might relate these terms. \n\nThe given quadratic expression is a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b. Hmm, this looks symmetric in a, b, and c. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me see:\n\nLooking at each term, each is of the form (variable squared times another variable). Let me group them:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b). \n\nYes, that's a way to factor it. Since a + b + c = 300, maybe we can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), and similarly for the others. Let me try that.\n\nSo substituting, the expression becomes:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c). \n\nWait, let me check that substitution again. Since b + c = 300 - a, so replacing that in the first term gives a\u00b2*(300 - a). Similarly for the other terms. So the entire expression is:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that's an interesting form. Let me write that down:\n\nSum_{cyc} [a\u00b2(300 - a)] = 6,000,000.\n\nAlternatively, expanding each term:\n\na\u00b2*300 - a\u00b3 + b\u00b2*300 - b\u00b3 + c\u00b2*300 - c\u00b3 = 6,000,000.\n\nSo that can be written as:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, okay. Maybe I can relate this to other symmetric sums. Let me recall that (a + b + c)^3 = a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) or something like that? Wait, perhaps better to recall the standard expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 in terms of (a + b + c)^3 and other terms. Let me recall that:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me verify:\n\nYes, the expansion of (a + b + c)^3 is a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3(a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) + 6abc.\n\nTherefore, rearranged:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) - 6abc.\n\nHmm, but in our problem, the given expression is exactly a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ... + c\u00b2a, which is the same as the term in the above equation. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000, and let me also note that the problem gives Q = 6,000,000.\n\nTherefore, substituting into the expansion:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S\u00b3 - 3Q - 6abc.\n\nTherefore, substituting back into the equation we had earlier:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nReplace a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 with the above expression:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - [S\u00b3 - 3Q - 6abc] = 6,000,000.\n\nBut S is 300, so S\u00b3 = 300^3 = 27,000,000. Let me plug that in:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - [27,000,000 - 3*(6,000,000) - 6abc] = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify the terms inside the brackets:\n\n27,000,000 - 18,000,000 - 6abc = 9,000,000 - 6abc.\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (9,000,000 - 6abc) = 6,000,000.\n\nThen:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - 9,000,000 + 6abc = 6,000,000.\n\nBring the 9,000,000 to the right side:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 6abc = 6,000,000 + 9,000,000 = 15,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 6 to simplify:\n\n50(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + abc = 2,500,000.\n\nHmm, okay. So now we have another equation: 50(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + abc = 2,500,000. \n\nHmm, this might be a bit more manageable? Not sure yet. Let me see if I can find another relation. Since we know that a + b + c = 300, perhaps express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 in terms of (a + b + c)^2 and ab + bc + ca. \n\nYes, recall that:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nSo substituting S = 300, that gives:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 300\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nTherefore, substitute this into the equation above:\n\n50[90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)] + abc = 2,500,000.\n\nCompute 50*90,000 = 4,500,000 and 50*(-2)(ab + bc + ca) = -100(ab + bc + ca). So:\n\n4,500,000 - 100(ab + bc + ca) + abc = 2,500,000.\n\nSubtract 2,500,000 from both sides:\n\n2,000,000 - 100(ab + bc + ca) + abc = 0.\n\nRearranged:\n\nabc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0.\n\nHmm. So now we have an equation involving abc and ab + bc + ca. Let me denote P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc. Then the equation becomes:\n\nQ - 100P + 2,000,000 = 0 => Q = 100P - 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, but I need another equation involving P and Q. Since we know a + b + c = 300, perhaps we can recall that for three variables, the relationships between sums are:\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) => we already used that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express in terms of symmetric sums. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a smarter substitution here. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of variables in terms of two variables. Let me suppose that two variables are equal, maybe? Since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps the solutions are symmetric or have some symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that two variables are equal. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose that a = b. Then since a + b + c = 300, we have 2a + c = 300 => c = 300 - 2a.\n\nThen, let's compute Q = a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nSince a = b, this becomes:\n\na\u00b2a + a\u00b2c + a\u00b2a + a\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2a\n\n= 2a\u00b3 + 2a\u00b2c + 2a c\u00b2\n\n= 2a\u00b3 + 2a\u00b2c + 2a c\u00b2.\n\nBut since c = 300 - 2a, substitute:\n\n2a\u00b3 + 2a\u00b2(300 - 2a) + 2a(300 - 2a)^2.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 2a\u00b3\n\nSecond term: 2a\u00b2*(300 - 2a) = 600a\u00b2 - 4a\u00b3\n\nThird term: 2a*(300 - 2a)^2.\n\nFirst compute (300 - 2a)^2 = 90000 - 1200a + 4a\u00b2. Then multiply by 2a:\n\n2a*(90000 - 1200a +4a\u00b2) = 180000a - 2400a\u00b2 + 8a\u00b3.\n\nNow sum all three terms:\n\nFirst term: 2a\u00b3\n\nSecond term: 600a\u00b2 -4a\u00b3\n\nThird term: 180000a -2400a\u00b2 +8a\u00b3\n\nAdding together:\n\n2a\u00b3 -4a\u00b3 +8a\u00b3 = (2 -4 +8)a\u00b3 = 6a\u00b3\n\n600a\u00b2 -2400a\u00b2 = -1800a\u00b2\n\n180000a remains.\n\nSo total Q = 6a\u00b3 -1800a\u00b2 + 180000a.\n\nSet this equal to 6,000,000:\n\n6a\u00b3 -1800a\u00b2 + 180000a = 6,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30000a = 1,000,000.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30000a - 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nHmm, need to solve this cubic equation for integer a (since a is nonnegative integer, and c = 300 - 2a must also be nonnegative, so 300 - 2a \u2265 0 => a \u2264 150). So a is between 0 and 150.\n\nHmm, solving the cubic equation a\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30000a - 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nMaybe factor this? Let me try possible integer roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1, so possible a values could be divisors of 1,000,000. But since a is between 0 and 150, let me test a = 100:\n\nPlugging a = 100: 1,000,000 - 300*(10,000) + 30000*100 - 1,000,000\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\n100\u00b3 = 1,000,000\n\n-300*(100)^2 = -300*10,000 = -3,000,000\n\n+30000*100 = +3,000,000\n\n-1,000,000 = -1,000,000\n\nTotal: 1,000,000 -3,000,000 +3,000,000 -1,000,000 = 0. \n\nOh! a=100 is a root. Great!\n\nTherefore, (a - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.\n\nDivide the cubic by (a - 100):\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division.\n\nLet me use synthetic division with root 100:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30000 | -1,000,000\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 100: 100. Add to -300: -200.\n\nMultiply -200 by 100: -20,000. Add to 30,000: 10,000.\n\nMultiply 10,000 by 100: 1,000,000. Add to -1,000,000: 0.\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000).\n\nNow set the quadratic factor equal to zero:\n\na\u00b2 -200a +10,000 =0.\n\nUse quadratic formula:\n\na = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(200\u00b2 - 4*1*10,000)] /2\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n40,000 - 40,000 = 0.\n\nThus, a = 200/(2) = 100. So the quadratic has a double root at a=100.\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as (a -100)^3 =0. Wait, but wait:\n\nWait, the quadratic is (a -100)^2, since discriminant is zero. Therefore, the cubic is (a -100)^3? Let me check:\n\nWait, (a -100)^3 = a\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000. Which matches exactly the cubic equation. So yes, the equation is (a -100)^3 =0, so the only real root is a=100. But since we are looking for integer a between 0 and 150, the only solution here is a=100. \n\nTherefore, in the case when a = b, we have a = b = 100, and c = 300 - 2*100 = 100. So the triple is (100, 100, 100). Let me check if this satisfies the original equation:\n\nCompute a + b + c = 300, which is 300. Good.\n\nNow compute the quadratic expression:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ... etc. Since all are 100, each term is 100\u00b2*100 = 1,000,000. There are 6 terms, so total is 6,000,000. Perfect, that works.\n\nSo (100, 100, 100) is a solution. But are there other solutions where variables are not equal?\n\nHmm, so far we considered the case when a = b. But maybe there are solutions where all three variables are different, or two are equal but not all three.\n\nWait, perhaps trying another case where two variables are equal, say a = b, but we saw only a=100 gives a solution. Maybe trying when a = c?\n\nWait, but since the problem is symmetric, if we assume any two variables equal, it would lead to the same result. So perhaps the only solution with two variables equal is the fully symmetric one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are solutions where all variables are different. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables in terms of two variables. Let me let c = 300 - a - b, then substitute into the equations. But that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps consider the equation we had earlier:\n\nabc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0.\n\nLet me see if I can manipulate this equation. Let me factor terms:\n\nabc -100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor terms with ab, bc, etc. Let me see:\n\nabc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000 =0.\n\nAlternatively, let me factor:\n\nab(c -100) + c(a + b)(-100) +2,000,000? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe factor in terms of (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) or something similar?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider shifting variables. Let me set x = a - 100, y = b -100, z = c -100. Then, since a + b + c = 300, we have x + y + z = 0. Then perhaps the equation can be rewritten in terms of x, y, z. Maybe this substitution can help?\n\nLet me try. Let x = a - 100, y = b -100, z = c -100. So x + y + z = (a + b + c) - 300 = 0. So z = -x - y.\n\nThen, let me substitute into the equation:\n\nabc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000 =0.\n\nFirst, compute abc:\n\n(a)(b)(c) = (100 + x)(100 + y)(100 + z).\n\nSimilarly, ab + bc + ca = (100 + x)(100 + y) + (100 + y)(100 + z) + (100 + z)(100 + x).\n\nThis might be messy, but let me see if plugging z = -x - y can simplify things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute each term:\n\nFirst, let me compute abc:\n\n(100 + x)(100 + y)(100 + z) = (100 + x)(100 + y)(100 -x - y).\n\nSimilarly, ab + bc + ca:\n\n(100 + x)(100 + y) + (100 + y)(100 + z) + (100 + z)(100 + x).\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this substitution is getting too complicated. Let me think of another approach.\n\nWait, going back to the equation:\n\nabc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000 =0.\n\nLet me try to see if (a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100) is the only solution. Suppose there exists another solution where one variable is different.\n\nSuppose that one variable is 100 + k, another is 100 + m, and the third is 100 - (k + m). Let me see.\n\nLet me set a = 100 + k, b = 100 + m, c = 100 - (k + m). Then, since a + b + c = 300, that works. Let me substitute into the equation:\n\nabc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000 =0.\n\nFirst compute abc:\n\n(100 +k)(100 +m)(100 -k -m).\n\nSimilarly, compute ab + bc + ca.\n\nThis might be tedious, but let's try.\n\nLet me first compute abc:\n\nLet me denote term1 = (100 +k)(100 +m) = 10000 + 100(m +k) + km.\n\nMultiply by (100 - (k + m)):\n\n[10000 + 100(k + m) + km][100 - (k + m)]\n\nLet me denote S = k + m, so the expression becomes:\n\n[10000 + 100S + km][100 - S].\n\nExpanding this:\n\n10000*(100 - S) + 100S*(100 - S) + km*(100 - S)\n\n= 1,000,000 -10,000S + 10,000S -100S\u00b2 + 100km - km S\n\n= 1,000,000 -100S\u00b2 +100km - km S.\n\nHmm, so abc = 1,000,000 -100S\u00b2 +100km - km S.\n\nNow compute ab + bc + ca:\n\nab = (100 +k)(100 +m) = 10000 +100(m +k) + km.\n\nbc = (100 +m)(100 - S) since c = 100 - S (since S = k + m). Wait, c = 100 - (k + m) = 100 - S.\n\nTherefore, bc = (100 + m)(100 - S).\n\nSimilarly, ca = (100 +k)(100 - S).\n\nThus, ab + bc + ca = ab + bc + ca = [10000 +100(m +k) + km] + (100 +m)(100 - S) + (100 +k)(100 - S).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: ab = 10000 +100(m +k) + km.\n\nSecond term: bc = (100 + m)(100 - S) = 100*100 -100S +100m - m S.\n\nThird term: ca = (100 +k)(100 - S) = 100*100 -100S +100k -k S.\n\nAdding these together:\n\nFirst term: 10000 +100(m +k) + km\n\nSecond term: 10,000 -100S +100m -m S\n\nThird term: 10,000 -100S +100k -k S\n\nTotal sum:\n\n10000 + 10,000 +10,000 + [100(m +k) + km] + [ -100S +100m -m S] + [ -100S +100k -k S]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nSum of constants: 30,000.\n\nNow the terms with m and k:\n\n100(m +k) + km + (-100S +100m -m S) + (-100S +100k -k S)\n\nLet me note that S = k + m, so substitute S:\n\nFirst, 100(m +k) = 100S.\n\nThen, km is just km.\n\nThen, the second term:\n\n-100S +100m -m S = -100S +100m -m(k + m) = -100S +100m - mk - m\u00b2.\n\nThird term similarly:\n\n-100S +100k -k S = -100S +100k -k(k + m) = -100S +100k -k\u00b2 - km.\n\nTherefore, combining all terms:\n\n100S + km + [ -100S +100m - mk - m\u00b2 ] + [ -100S +100k -k\u00b2 - km ]\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\n100S + km -100S +100m - mk - m\u00b2 -100S +100k -k\u00b2 - km.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n100S -100S -100S = -100S\n\nkm - mk - km = km - mk - km = - mk - km? Wait, perhaps better step by step.\n\nWait, km is the first term, then -mk (from second bracket), then -km (from third bracket). So km - mk - km = - mk.\n\nWait, but km = mk, so km - mk = 0, then - km? Hmm, perhaps miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me track each term:\n\nStarting with:\n\n100S + km \n\n+ ( -100S +100m - mk - m\u00b2 )\n\n+ ( -100S +100k -k\u00b2 - km )\n\nSo term by term:\n\n100S + km -100S +100m - mk - m\u00b2 -100S +100k -k\u00b2 - km.\n\nNow, let's group similar terms:\n\n100S -100S -100S = -100S.\n\nkm - mk - km: km - mk is zero because km = mk, so km - mk =0, then minus another km gives -km.\n\nWait, actually, km is the first term, then in the second bracket, -mk, which is -km, and in the third bracket, -km. So altogether:\n\nkm - km - km = -km.\n\nThen, the remaining terms:\n\n100m +100k - m\u00b2 -k\u00b2.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n-100S - km +100(m +k) - (m\u00b2 +k\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, the entire ab + bc + ca expression is:\n\n30,000 -100S - km +100(m +k) - (m\u00b2 +k\u00b2).\n\nHmm, that's complicated, but let's see if we can write it in terms of S and other terms.\n\nSince S = m +k, so m +k = S.\n\nThus,\n\nab + bc + ca = 30,000 -100S - km +100S - (m\u00b2 +k\u00b2).\n\nThe -100S and +100S cancel, so:\n\n=30,000 - km - (m\u00b2 +k\u00b2).\n\nHmm, so ab + bc + ca = 30,000 - (m\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + km).\n\nNow, going back to the main equation:\n\nabc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000 =0.\n\nWe have abc from earlier as:\n\nabc = 1,000,000 -100S\u00b2 +100km - km S.\n\nWait, let me recall:\n\nEarlier, abc was:\n\n1,000,000 -100S\u00b2 +100km - km S.\n\nSo substituting into the equation:\n\n[1,000,000 -100S\u00b2 +100km - km S] -100*(30,000 - (m\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + km)) +2,000,000 =0.\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: 1,000,000 -100S\u00b2 +100km - km S.\n\nSecond term: -100*(30,000 - m\u00b2 -k\u00b2 - km) = -3,000,000 +100m\u00b2 +100k\u00b2 +100km.\n\nThird term: +2,000,000.\n\nAdding all together:\n\nFirst term components:\n\n1,000,000 -100S\u00b2 +100km - km S\n\nSecond term components:\n\n-3,000,000 +100m\u00b2 +100k\u00b2 +100km\n\nThird term: +2,000,000\n\nCombine constants:\n\n1,000,000 -3,000,000 +2,000,000 = 0.\n\nTerms with S\u00b2: -100S\u00b2\n\nTerms with m\u00b2 and k\u00b2: +100m\u00b2 +100k\u00b2.\n\nTerms with km: 100km +100km = 200km, but there's also a -km S term.\n\nWait, let's do step by step:\n\nTerms with S\u00b2: -100S\u00b2.\n\nTerms with m\u00b2 and k\u00b2: 100m\u00b2 +100k\u00b2.\n\nTerms with km:\n\n100km (from first term) +100km (from second term) - km S.\n\nSo total km terms: 200km - km S.\n\nOther terms:\n\n- km S.\n\nWait, so putting all together:\n\n-100S\u00b2 +100m\u00b2 +100k\u00b2 +200km - km S =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor terms:\n\nLet me note that S = m + k, so S\u00b2 = m\u00b2 + 2mk +k\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, substituting S\u00b2:\n\n-100(m\u00b2 + 2mk +k\u00b2) +100m\u00b2 +100k\u00b2 +200mk - km S =0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-100m\u00b2 -200mk -100k\u00b2 +100m\u00b2 +100k\u00b2 +200mk - km S.\n\nSimplify:\n\n-100m\u00b2 +100m\u00b2 cancels.\n\n-200mk +200mk cancels.\n\n-100k\u00b2 +100k\u00b2 cancels.\n\nLeft with: - km S =0.\n\nTherefore, the equation reduces to:\n\n- km S =0.\n\nSo -km(m +k) =0.\n\nThus, the equation reduces to km(m +k)=0.\n\nSo this must hold.\n\nTherefore, either k =0, m=0, or m +k =0.\n\nBut since k and m are integers (since a, b, c are integers and a =100 +k, etc.), and variables a, b, c are nonnegative, so:\n\nLet me consider the possibilities:\n\nCase 1: k =0. Then, since S =k +m = m, so m can be anything, but then m +k = m must also satisfy variables nonnegative. Let me see:\n\nIf k =0, then a =100 +0 =100, and m can be any integer such that b =100 +m, c =100 - m (since S = m +0 = m, so c =100 - S =100 -m).\n\nWait, since c must be nonnegative, 100 - m \u22650 \u21d2 m \u2264100. Also, b =100 + m must be nonnegative \u21d2 m \u2265-100. But since m = S = k + m, but since k=0, m can be from -100 to 100. However, since a, b, c are nonnegative, let me see:\n\na =100 is fixed. b =100 + m must be \u22650 \u21d2 m \u2265-100. c =100 -m must be \u22650 \u21d2 m \u2264100. So m \u2208 [-100, 100].\n\nBut also, in this case, the original equation reduces to km(m +k)=0, which with k=0 is satisfied for any m. However, we need to ensure that the original equation is satisfied. Wait, but in this substitution approach, we already derived that the equation reduces to -km S =0, so when k=0, the equation holds regardless of m, but does that mean all triples where a=100 and b and c vary such that b + c =200 would satisfy the original equation?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because in this substitution, we assumed a =100 +k, etc., but the substitution led us to the conclusion that if k=0, then the equation holds for any m, but we need to verify whether those actually satisfy the original equation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check this. Let me take an example.\n\nSuppose k =0, so a=100. Let me choose m=50. Then b =150, c=50. So the triple is (100,150,50). Let me check if this satisfies the original equations.\n\nFirst, a + b + c =100 +150 +50 = 300. Good.\n\nNow compute the quadratic expression:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b =100\u00b2*150 = 1,000,000*1.5=1,500,000\n\na\u00b2c =100\u00b2*50= 1,000,000*0.5=500,000\n\nb\u00b2a =150\u00b2*100=22,500*100=2,250,000\n\nb\u00b2c=150\u00b2*50=22,500*50=1,125,000\n\nc\u00b2a=50\u00b2*100=2,500*100=250,000\n\nc\u00b2b=50\u00b2*150=2,500*150=375,000\n\nAdding all together:\n\n1,500,000 +500,000 = 2,000,000\n\n2,250,000 +1,125,000 = 3,375,000\n\n250,000 +375,000 =625,000\n\nTotal sum: 2,000,000 +3,375,000 +625,000 =6,000,000. Wow, it works!\n\nSo this triple (100,150,50) also satisfies the equation. But in my earlier assumption when a = b, the only solution was (100,100,100). So this suggests that there are more solutions when two variables are not equal, but one is fixed at 100. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, so in this substitution approach, we considered shifting variables around 100, and found that if k=0 (so a=100), then any m (so varying b and c such that b + c=200) would satisfy the equation? But why?\n\nWait, actually, in the substitution approach, when I set a =100 +k, etc., and derived that the equation reduces to km(m +k)=0, so when k=0, then any m is allowed. Therefore, in that case, the equation is satisfied for any m. Therefore, this suggests that all triples where a=100 and b + c =200 will satisfy the original equation. But when I tested with (100,150,50), it worked, so that's a valid solution. So that suggests there are more solutions.\n\nWait a second, so perhaps the solutions are all triples where one of the variables is 100, and the other two sum to 200. Wait, but let's test another one. Let me take m=100, so b=200, c=0. Then the triple is (100,200,0). Let me check the quadratic expression:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b =100\u00b2*200 =1,000,000*2=2,000,000\n\na\u00b2c =100\u00b2*0=0\n\nb\u00b2a =200\u00b2*100 =40,000*100=4,000,000\n\nb\u00b2c=200\u00b2*0=0\n\nc\u00b2a =0\u00b2*100=0\n\nc\u00b2b=0\u00b2*200=0\n\nTotal sum:2,000,000 +4,000,000 =6,000,000. So that works too!\n\nSimilarly, if m = -50, then b = 100 -50 =50, c =100 - (-50) =150. So triple (100,50,150), which is the same as the previous one but reordered, so it also works.\n\nTherefore, this suggests that whenever one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200, the equation holds. So this gives a family of solutions. Similarly, if instead of fixing a=100, we fix b=100 or c=100, then those would also work. So in total, all triples where one of the variables is 100, and the other two add to 200. \n\nTherefore, the solutions are all triples where one variable is 100 and the other two variables are nonnegative integers summing to 200. \n\nWait, but we also need to ensure that all variables are nonnegative. So for example, if we fix a=100, then b and c can be any nonnegative integers with b +c =200. Similarly for fixing b=100 or c=100. \n\nHowever, we need to be careful not to overcount the case where all three variables are 100, since that case is counted three times (once in each variable being fixed at 100). \n\nTherefore, total number of solutions is:\n\nNumber of triples where a=100: (100, b, c) with b +c =200. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to b +c =200 is 201 (from b=0 to 200).\n\nSimilarly for triples where b=100: 201 solutions, and same for c=100:201 solutions.\n\nTotal would be 3*201 =603, but subtract the overlaps where two variables are 100. Wait, how many overlaps are there?\n\nThe overlaps occur when two variables are 100, say a=100 and b=100, then c=100. Because a + b + c =300, so if a=100 and b=100, then c=100. So the only triple where two variables are 100 is actually the triple (100,100,100). So each pair of variables being 100 leads to the same triple. Therefore, the overlap is only the single triple (100,100,100). Since each of the three cases (a=100, b=100, c=100) includes this triple, so when we added 3*201, we counted this triple three times. So to get the correct total, we need to subtract 2 instances of it (since we want to count it only once).\n\nTherefore total solutions would be 3*201 - 2*1 = 603 -2 =601? Wait, wait, inclusion-exclusion principle says:\n\nTotal = (A + B + C) - (AB + AC + BC) + ABC, where A is the set with a=100, B with b=100, C with c=100.\n\nHere, A, B, C each have 201 elements. The intersections AB is the set where a=100 and b=100, which requires c=100, so only 1 element. Similarly AC and BC each have 1 element. The intersection ABC is also that same single triple. \n\nThus, inclusion-exclusion gives:\n\nTotal = |A| + |B| + |C| - |AB| - |AC| - |BC| + |ABC|\n\n= 201 +201 +201 -1 -1 -1 +1\n\n= 603 -3 +1 = 601.\n\nWait, 201*3 is 603, subtract 3 (each intersection AB, AC, BC is 1), then add back 1 for ABC. So 603 -3 +1 =601. \n\nTherefore the total number of triples is 601. \n\nBut hold on, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me check with another example. Suppose the triple is (100, 200, 0). This is counted in set A (a=100). Similarly (200, 100,0) is in set B, and (0,100,200) is in set C. The triple (100,100,100) is in all three sets. So the inclusion-exclusion calculation should be correct.\n\nBut let me verify with a smaller case. Suppose instead of 300, we had a smaller total, say a + b + c = 2, and similar equation. Maybe that would help.\n\nWait, but maybe proceed.\n\nWait, but before I get too confident, let me check another triple not in the overlap. Take (100, 0, 200). That's valid, and it's counted once in A. Similarly (0,100,200) once in B, etc. So yes, the inclusion-exclusion is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is 601. But wait, but let me think again: when a=100, the number of triples is 201 (from b=0 to 200). Similarly for the others, so 3*201 counts all triples where at least one variable is 100. But the triple (100,100,100) is included three times, so we subtract 2 copies to leave one, hence total 3*201 -2 = 603 -2 =601? Wait but inclusion-exclusion says 603 -3 +1 =601. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 601? Hmm, but let me check if there are other solutions outside of this case. Because in the substitution approach, we assumed that a=100 +k, but perhaps there are solutions where none of the variables are 100?\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose there exists a solution where all variables are different from 100. Let me suppose such a triple exists. Let me see if that is possible.\n\nSuppose a, b, c are all different from 100. Then, in the equation km(m +k)=0 (from substitution variables), where k and m are deviations from 100, we must have km(m +k)=0. But if none of the variables are 100, then neither k, m nor their sum can be zero. Wait, but if variables are not 100, then for example, if a \u2260100, then k \u22600, and similarly for b\u2260100, so m \u22600, and since c = 300 -a -b, then S = m +k \u22600 (since a + b \u2260200, so c \u2260100). Therefore, km(m +k) would not be zero, so the equation would not hold. Therefore, there can be no solutions where none of the variables are 100. Thus all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100. Therefore, the total number is indeed 601.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the substitution approach, we considered a =100 +k, but actually, the variables can be permuted. So the only solutions are those with at least one variable equal to 100, so indeed inclusion-exclusion gives 601.\n\nHowever, let me check with another example where two variables are 100. For example, (100,100,100) is the only triple where all three are 100, but also triples like (100,100,100) is the only one where two variables are 100? Wait, suppose two variables are 100, say a=100 and b=100, then c=100. So indeed, any two variables being 100 forces the third to be 100. So there are no triples with exactly two variables as 100, only triples with all three or just one.\n\nTherefore, the count via inclusion-exclusion is correct: 3*201 - 3*1 +1? Wait no, inclusion-exclusion formula is |A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|.\n\nHere, each |A| = |B| = |C| =201,\n\neach |A\u2229B| = |A\u2229C| = |B\u2229C| =1 (the triple (100,100,100)),\n\nand |A\u2229B\u2229C| =1.\n\nTherefore,\n\nTotal =201*3 - 3*1 +1 =603 -3 +1=601.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 601.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so zero is allowed. So all triples where one variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200, including when one is zero. So that's correct.\n\nBut hold on, let me check if there is another possible solution where variables are not in this form. Suppose someone has a=0, b=0, c=300. Let me check if that works.\n\nCompute the quadratic expression:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nAll terms are zero except c\u00b2a and c\u00b2b, but a and b are zero, so all terms are zero. So the total is zero, which is not 6,000,000. So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother test case: suppose a=200, b=100, c=0. Wait, this is the same as (200,100,0), which is part of the count where b=100. Let me check the expression:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\n=200\u00b2*100 +200\u00b2*0 +100\u00b2*200 +100\u00b2*0 +0\u00b2*200 +0\u00b2*100.\n\n= (40,000*100) +0 + (10,000*200) +0 +0 +0 =4,000,000 + 2,000,000=6,000,000. Yes, that works. So it is counted in the B set (b=100). So that's okay.\n\nAnother test: a=150, b=100, c=50. This is (150,100,50). Let me compute:\n\na\u00b2b =150\u00b2*100 =22500*100=2,250,000\n\na\u00b2c =150\u00b2*50=22500*50=1,125,000\n\nb\u00b2a=100\u00b2*150=10,000*150=1,500,000\n\nb\u00b2c=100\u00b2*50=10,000*50=500,000\n\nc\u00b2a=50\u00b2*150=2,500*150=375,000\n\nc\u00b2b=50\u00b2*100=2,500*100=250,000\n\nTotal: 2,250,000 +1,125,000 =3,375,000; 1,500,000 +500,000=2,000,000; 375,000 +250,000=625,000. Total sum 3,375,000 +2,000,000 +625,000 =6,000,000. Correct. So yes, that works and is part of the count when b=100.\n\nTherefore, it seems the only solutions are those with at least one variable equal to 100, and the total number is 601.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the equation abc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000 =0. Suppose that none of a,b,c are 100, but the equation still holds. Is that possible?\n\nSuppose, for instance, take a=99, b=101, c=100. Wait, but here c=100, so that is included in our previous count. So variables must have at least one 100.\n\nAlternatively, suppose all variables different from 100. Let me try a=101, b=100, c=99. Wait, but b=100 is still there.\n\nAlternatively, a=150, b=150, c=0. Then a +b +c=300. Check the quadratic expression:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\n=150\u00b2*150 +150\u00b2*0 +150\u00b2*150 +150\u00b2*0 +0\u00b2*150 +0\u00b2*150.\n\n=2*(150)^3 +0=2*(3,375,000)=6,750,000 \u22606,000,000. So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother test: a=140, b=110, c=50. Let's see:\n\nSum is 140+110+50=300.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b =140\u00b2*110=19,600*110=2,156,000\n\na\u00b2c=140\u00b2*50=19,600*50=980,000\n\nb\u00b2a=110\u00b2*140=12,100*140=1,694,000\n\nb\u00b2c=110\u00b2*50=12,100*50=605,000\n\nc\u00b2a=50\u00b2*140=2,500*140=350,000\n\nc\u00b2b=50\u00b2*110=2,500*110=275,000\n\nTotal: 2,156,000 +980,000 =3,136,000; 1,694,000 +605,000=2,299,000; 350,000 +275,000=625,000.\n\nTotal sum: 3,136,000 +2,299,000 =5,435,000 +625,000 =6,060,000. Not 6,000,000. Close, but not exact. So this doesn't work.\n\nHmm, so it seems that only the triples with at least one 100 work. Therefore, the total number is indeed 601. \n\nWait, but let me confirm once more with another example where two variables are 100. Wait, but that forces the third to be 100, so (100,100,100) is the only one. So in the count, that's included once in each set A,B,C, but via inclusion-exclusion, it's counted once in total. So that's okay.\n\nTherefore, I think the final answer is 601. But let me check the arithmetic again for inclusion-exclusion:\n\nEach of the three sets (A,B,C) has 201 elements. The intersections of two sets each have 1 element (the triple with all three 100). The intersection of all three sets is also that same triple. So:\n\nTotal = 3*201 - 3*(1) + 1*(1) = 603 -3 +1 = 601. Yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of triples is 601.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Wait, the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so including zero. When we count the number of solutions for a=100, then b and c are nonnegative integers with b + c =200. The number of solutions is 201 (from 0 to 200 inclusive). Similarly for the others. So that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 601. Hmm.\n\nBut I feel like the problem might have a trick where the answer is different. Wait, let me think again. Let me see if the equation allows variables greater than 300, but no, since a +b +c=300, so each variable is at most 300. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a miscalculation in the inclusion-exclusion. Let me recast the problem.\n\nThe number of triples where a=100 is 201. Similarly for b=100 and c=100. The overlap between a=100 and b=100 is exactly the triple (100,100,100). Similarly overlaps between a=100 and c=100, and b=100 and c=100 are the same triple. The intersection of all three is also that triple. \n\nTherefore, using inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal = (201 +201 +201) - (1 +1 +1) +1 = 603 -3 +1 =601.\n\nYes, so that is correct. So the answer is 601. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again. The problem says \"triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c)\", so ordered triples? Yes, because in counting like (100,150,50) and (150,100,50) are different triples. So when we count the number for a=100, it includes all permutations where the first element is 100, but when we do 3*201, are we overcounting the permutations?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen we count the set A (a=100), it includes all triples where the first variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200. So for example, (100, 150,50) is in set A, but (150,100,50) is in set B. Therefore, all ordered triples are considered, and the total count via inclusion-exclusion correctly counts all ordered triples where at least one variable is 100.\n\nTherefore, 601 is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Wait, when you fix a=100, you have 201 ordered triples where the first variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200. Similarly for b=100 and c=100. Thus, the total number is indeed 3*201 minus overlaps. \n\nAlternatively, if we think of unordered triples, but the problem says \"triples\", which are ordered. So the count is correct as 601.\n\nHmm. I think this is right. Therefore, I will go with 601 as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{601}\n\n\nTo find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \\((a, b, c)\\) satisfying \\(a + b + c = 300\\) and \\(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\\), we start by analyzing the given quadratic expression. \n\nFirst, we rewrite the quadratic expression using the identity:\n\\[\na^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b)\n\\]\nGiven \\(a + b + c = 300\\), we substitute \\(b + c = 300 - a\\), \\(a + c = 300 - b\\), and \\(a + b = 300 - c\\) into the expression:\n\\[\na^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\\[\n300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000\n\\]\nUsing the identity for the sum of cubes and other symmetric sums, we derive:\n\\[\n50(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + abc = 2,500,000\n\\]\nFurther simplification using \\(a + b + c = 300\\) leads to:\n\\[\nabc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0\n\\]\nWe find that the solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100. For each variable being 100, the other two variables must sum to 200. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to \\(b + c = 200\\) is 201. \n\nConsidering all permutations and using inclusion-exclusion principle to avoid overcounting:\n- Each set where one variable is 100 has 201 solutions.\n- The intersection of any two sets (all variables 100) is 1 solution.\n- The intersection of all three sets is also 1 solution.\n\nThus, the total number of solutions is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 201 - 3 \\times 1 + 1 = 603 - 3 + 1 = 601\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{601}\n\\]",
