      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and AD intersects \u03c9 again at P. The sides are given as AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The answer should be in the form m/n with m and n coprime, then find m + n.\n\nHmm, first, maybe I should recall some theorems related to tangents and circles. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the exsymmedian point or something? Wait, tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length. So DB = DC? Wait, no, actually, the two tangents from D to the circle would be DB and DC, so yes, DB = DC. That's a property. So triangle DBC has DB = DC, making it isoceles. Hmm, but how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using power of a point. The power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP, since AD is a secant line. That might be useful. Since P is the second intersection point of AD with \u03c9, so Power of a Point gives DB\u00b2 = DA * DP. So if I can find DA and DP, but I need to relate these.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use coordinates or trigonometry. Let me see. Since the triangle sides are given, perhaps using the Law of Cosines to find angles?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use inversion? Hmm, maybe overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, use coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me set coordinate system with point C at origin, maybe? Let me try.\n\nLet me set point C at (0,0), and point B at (9,0) since BC=9. Wait, but AC is 10, AB is 5. Wait, but then coordinates might need to be set more carefully. Let me think.\n\nLet me place point C at (0,0). Let me let point B be at (9,0), since BC is 9. Then point A is somewhere such that AC =10 and AB=5. Let me find coordinates of A.\n\nLet coordinates of A be (x,y). Then distance from A to C is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 10, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100. Distance from A to B is sqrt((x-9)^2 + y\u00b2) =5, so (x-9)^2 + y\u00b2 =25.\n\nSubtracting the two equations: (x-9)^2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =25 -100 \u21d2 x\u00b2 -18x +81 + y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -75 \u21d2 -18x +81 = -75 \u21d2 -18x = -156 \u21d2 x = 156/18 = 26/3 \u22488.666...\n\nThen x=26/3. Then y\u00b2 = 100 - x\u00b2 = 100 - (676/9) = (900 -676)/9 = 224/9 \u21d2 y=\u00b1sqrt(224)/3 = \u00b1(2*sqrt(56))/3 = \u00b1(2*2*sqrt(14))/3 = \u00b1(4\u221a14)/3. Let me take y positive, so A is at (26/3, 4\u221a14/3).\n\nHmm, okay. So coordinates:\n\nC=(0,0), B=(9,0), A=(26/3, (4\u221a14)/3).\n\nNow, need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC.\n\nFirst, find equations of the tangents at B and C.\n\nTo find the tangent at a point on a circle, we can use the fact that the tangent is perpendicular to the radius. So, if we can find the circumcircle equation, then find the tangent lines at B and C.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates for A, B, C, we can compute the circumcircle equation.\n\nLet me compute the circumcircle equation.\n\nLet me denote the circumcircle by equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nWe can plug in points A, B, C to find D, E, F.\n\nPoint C is (0,0): plugging in gives 0 +0 +0 +0 +F =0 \u21d2 F=0. Wait, but that can't be. Wait, no: the general circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0. For point C (0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +F=0 \u21d2 F=0. Hmm, okay.\n\nPoint B (9,0): 81 +0 + 9D +0 +0 =0 \u21d2 81 +9D =0 \u21d2 D= -9.\n\nPoint A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3):\n\n( (26/3)^2 + (4\u221a14/3)^2 ) + D*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) + F =0\n\nFirst compute (26/3)^2 = (676)/9,\n\n(4\u221a14 /3)^2 = 16*14 /9 = 224/9,\n\nSo total x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 term: (676 +224)/9 = 900/9 =100.\n\nSo 100 + D*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) + F =0.\n\nBut F=0, D is -9. So:\n\n100 + (-9)*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) =0\n\nCompute -9*(26/3)= -78.\n\nThus 100 -78 + (4\u221a14/3)E =0 \u21d2 22 + (4\u221a14/3)E =0 \u21d2 (4\u221a14/3)E = -22 \u21d2 E= (-22 *3)/(4\u221a14) = (-66)/(4\u221a14)= (-33)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalize denominator: E= (-33\u221a14)/(2*14)= (-33\u221a14)/28.\n\nThus the equation of the circumcircle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + [(-33\u221a14)/28]y =0. Hmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to compute the circumradius and center?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps find the tangent lines at B and C.\n\nThe tangent at point C (0,0). Wait, the tangent at C to the circle. The tangent at a point on the circle is given by the equation: xx1 + yy1 + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F =0? Wait, maybe I need another method.\n\nAlternatively, since the tangent at point (x1,y1) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is xx1 + yy1 + D*(x +x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F =0.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for tangent at (x1,y1):\n\nFor a general circle equation: (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, the tangent at (x1,y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = r\u00b2. Wait, no, actually, the tangent line is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = r\u00b2? Wait, no, that would be the equation for the circle itself. Wait, actually, the tangent line is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = r\u00b2 only if (x1,y1) is on the circle. Wait, no, actually, the equation of the tangent line at (x1,y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the standard formula is that the tangent line at (x1,y1) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is:\n\nxx1 + yy1 + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F =0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use calculus? Take derivative, but maybe overkill.\n\nAlternatively, since the tangent at point C (0,0) to the circle. Let me see, the center of the circle is at (-D/2, -E/2). Since the general equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0, so center is (h,k)= (-D/2, -E/2).\n\nWe had D = -9, so h = 9/2. E is (-33\u221a14)/28, so k = (33\u221a14)/56.\n\nThus center O is (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56).\n\nHmm, the tangent at point C (0,0). The tangent line is perpendicular to the radius OC. The radius OC is from center (9/2, 33\u221a14/56) to (0,0). So the direction vector of OC is (-9/2, -33\u221a14/56). Therefore, the tangent line at C is perpendicular to this vector. So the slope of OC is ( (-33\u221a14/56 ) / (-9/2) ) = (33\u221a14/56)/(9/2) ) = (33\u221a14/56)*(2/9) = (66\u221a14)/(504) = (11\u221a14)/84. Therefore, the slope of OC is 11\u221a14 /84. Therefore, the tangent line at C must have slope perpendicular to that, which is -84/(11\u221a14).\n\nSo the tangent at C is a line through (0,0) with slope -84/(11\u221a14). Let me rationalize that. Alternatively, write equation as y = [ -84/(11\u221a14) ] x.\n\nSimilarly, tangent at B (9,0). Let's find the tangent at B. The radius OB is from center (9/2, 33\u221a14/56) to B (9,0). The vector is (9 - 9/2, 0 - 33\u221a14/56) = (9/2, -33\u221a14/56). The slope of OB is ( -33\u221a14/56 ) / (9/2 ) = same as before but negative? Wait, same as before but the y-component is negative. So slope is (-33\u221a14/56)/(9/2)= same as before but negative? Let me compute:\n\nSlope of OB is (0 - 33\u221a14/56)/(9 - 9/2) = (-33\u221a14/56)/(9/2) = (-33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = same as before but negative. So slope is -11\u221a14 /84? Wait, no, let me compute again:\n\nWait, numerator is -33\u221a14/56, denominator is 9/2. So the slope is (-33\u221a14/56)/(9/2) = (-33\u221a14/56)*(2/9) = (-66\u221a14)/504 = (-11\u221a14)/84. So slope of OB is -11\u221a14/84. Therefore, the tangent line at B must be perpendicular to OB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: 84/(11\u221a14).\n\nTherefore, the tangent at B (9,0) has slope 84/(11\u221a14). So equation is y -0 = [84/(11\u221a14)](x -9).\n\nSo now, equations of the two tangent lines:\n\nTangent at C: y = [ -84/(11\u221a14) ] x.\n\nTangent at B: y = [84/(11\u221a14)](x -9).\n\nPoint D is the intersection of these two lines. Let me set them equal to find x-coordinate.\n\nSet [ -84/(11\u221a14) ] x = [84/(11\u221a14)](x -9).\n\nMultiply both sides by 11\u221a14 /84 to eliminate denominators:\n\n- x = (x -9)\n\nSo -x = x -9 \u21d2 -2x = -9 \u21d2 x = 9/2.\n\nThen plug back into tangent at C's equation: y = [ -84/(11\u221a14) ]*(9/2) = (-84*9)/(22\u221a14) = (-756)/(22\u221a14) = (-378)/(11\u221a14). Rationalize denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\ny = (-378\u221a14)/(11*14) = (-378\u221a14)/(154) = Simplify 378 and 154: divide numerator and denominator by 14? 378 \u00f714=27, 154 \u00f714=11. So y= (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nThus, coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy, but okay.\n\nNow, need to find point P, which is the second intersection of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, find parametric equation of line AD. Points A and D:\n\nPoint A is (26/3, 4\u221a14/3).\n\nPoint D is (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nLet me write parametric equations for AD. Let parameter t go from 0 to 1 for A to D, but since P is another intersection, we might need to go beyond.\n\nLet me denote the parametric equations as:\n\nx = x_A + t*(x_D - x_A)\n\ny = y_A + t*(y_D - y_A)\n\nCompute differences:\n\nx_D - x_A = (9/2 - 26/3) = (27/6 -52/6)= (-25/6)\n\ny_D - y_A = (-27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3) = \u221a14*(-81/33 -44/33)= \u221a14*(-125/33)\n\nThus, parametric equations:\n\nx = 26/3 - (25/6)t\n\ny = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t\n\nWe need to find the point P which is the other intersection with \u03c9. Since A is already on \u03c9 and on AD, so when t=0 we are at A, and when t=1 we are at D. The other intersection P will be at some t value, say t = k.\n\nTo find P, substitute the parametric equations into the circumcircle equation and solve for t. The equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + [(-33\u221a14)/28]y =0. Let me plug in x and y.\n\nThis might be algebraically intensive, but let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note that the parametric equations for x and y are:\n\nx(t) = 26/3 - (25/6)t,\n\ny(t) = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t.\n\nLet me write all terms in terms of fractions to make substitution easier.\n\nFirst, compute x(t)^2:\n\nx(t)^2 = [26/3 - (25/6)t]^2 = (26/3)^2 - 2*(26/3)*(25/6)t + (25/6 t)^2\n\nSimilarly, y(t)^2 = [ (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t ]^2 = (4\u221a14/3)^2 - 2*(4\u221a14/3)*(125\u221a14/33)t + (125\u221a14/33 t)^2\n\nThis is going to get really messy. Maybe there's a smarter way?\n\nAlternatively, since points A and P lie on the circle, and line AD intersects the circle at A and P, so the parameter t corresponds to points on the line, so substituting into the circle equation will give a quadratic equation in t, with roots at t=0 (point A) and t=k (point P). Therefore, by Vieta's theorem, the product of the roots is (constant term)/(coefficient of t^2). Since one root is t=0, the other root will be the other solution.\n\nWait, actually, Vieta's formula for quadratic equation: if equation is at\u00b2 + bt + c =0, then product is c/a. But if one root is 0, then c must be 0? Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, actually, the equation when substituting parametric into circle equation would be quadratic in t, so let me denote the equation as:\n\nA t\u00b2 + B t + C =0,\n\nwhere A is the coefficient of t\u00b2, B coefficient of t, and C constant term.\n\nSince point A is on the circle, when t=0, plugging into equation gives C =0? Wait, no. Wait, when t=0, x(t)=x_A, y(t)=y_A. Since A is on the circle, substituting t=0 into the equation should satisfy the circle equation. Therefore, the constant term C must be zero? Wait, perhaps not. Wait, let me think again.\n\nLet me denote the circle equation as F(x,y)=0. Then substituting x(t) and y(t) into F(x,y) gives a function F(x(t), y(t)) which is quadratic in t. Since A is on both the line and the circle, when t=0, F(x(0), y(0))=0, so the equation will have t=0 as a root. The other root is t corresponding to point P.\n\nTherefore, the quadratic equation in t will have roots t=0 and t = t_P. Therefore, the equation can be written as t*(Mt + N)=0, so the product of roots is 0 * t_P =0, so the constant term must be 0. Wait, but maybe I need to compute it properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute F(x(t), y(t)) =0, and since t=0 is a root, factor out t. Let me try.\n\nLet me compute F(x(t), y(t)) = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 -9x(t) + [(-33\u221a14)/28] y(t) =0.\n\nFirst, compute each term:\n\nCompute x(t)^2:\n\nx(t) = 26/3 - (25/6)t,\n\nso x(t)^2 = (26/3)^2 - 2*(26/3)*(25/6)t + (25/6)^2 t\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, y(t)^2:\n\ny(t) = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t,\n\nso y(t)^2 = (4\u221a14/3)^2 - 2*(4\u221a14/3)*(125\u221a14/33)t + (125\u221a14/33)^2 t\u00b2\n\nCompute each term step by step:\n\nFirst, x(t)^2:\n\nTerm1 = (26/3)^2 = (676)/9\n\nTerm2 = -2*(26/3)*(25/6)t = - (2*26*25)/(3*6) t = - (1300)/18 t = - (650)/9 t\n\nTerm3 = (25/6)^2 t\u00b2 = (625/36) t\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, y(t)^2:\n\nFirst term: (4\u221a14/3)^2 = 16*14 /9 = 224/9\n\nSecond term: -2*(4\u221a14/3)*(125\u221a14/33)t. Let's compute:\n\nFirst, multiply the constants:\n\n-2*(4)*(125)*(\u221a14)*(\u221a14)/(3*33) * t\n\n\u221a14*\u221a14 =14, so:\n\n-2*4*125*14 / (3*33) * t = -2*4*125*14 / 99 * t\n\nCompute numerator: 2*4=8; 8*125=1000; 1000*14=14,000.\n\nThus, -14,000 / 99 * t\n\nWait, let me check again step by step:\n\nWait, the second term in y(t)^2 is -2*(first term)*(second term):\n\nFirst term is (4\u221a14)/3,\n\nSecond term is (125\u221a14)/33,\n\nSo product: 4\u221a14 * 125\u221a14 = 4*125*(\u221a14)^2 = 500*14 = 7000,\n\nThen multiplied by -2: -2*7000 = -14000,\n\nDenominator: 3 * 33 =99,\n\nSo the second term is -14000/99 * t.\n\nThird term of y(t)^2 is (125\u221a14/33)^2 t\u00b2:\n\n(125^2)*(14)/(33^2) t\u00b2 = (15,625 *14)/1,089 t\u00b2 = 218,750 /1,089 t\u00b2.\n\nNow, moving on.\n\nNext terms in F(x,y):\n\n-9x(t) = -9*(26/3 -25/6 t) = -9*(26/3) + 9*(25/6)t = -78 + (225/6)t = -78 + (75/2)t\n\n[(-33\u221a14)/28] y(t) = [(-33\u221a14)/28]*(4\u221a14/3 -125\u221a14/33 t )\n\nCompute this term:\n\nFirst, distribute:\n\n= (-33\u221a14)/28 *4\u221a14/3 + (-33\u221a14)/28*(-125\u221a14/33)t\n\nFirst part:\n\n(-33\u221a14 *4\u221a14)/(28*3) = (-33*4*(\u221a14)^2)/(84) = (-132*14)/84\n\n14 divides into 84 six times:\n\n-132*14 /84 = -132/6 = -22\n\nSecond part:\n\n(-33\u221a14)/28 * (-125\u221a14/33)t = (125\u221a14 * \u221a14)/(28) t = (125*14)/28 t = (1750)/28 t = 62.5 t. Wait, let me compute:\n\nWait, numerator: 125 *14 = 1750, denominator 28: 1750/28 = 1750 \u00f714=125, 125/2 =62.5. So yes, 62.5 t, which is 125/2 t.\n\nThus, putting together:\n\n[(-33\u221a14)/28] y(t) = -22 + (125/2)t.\n\nNow, putting all terms into F(x(t), y(t)) =0:\n\nLet's collect all terms:\n\nx(t)^2 + y(t)^2 -9x(t) + [(-33\u221a14)/28] y(t) =\n\n[Term1 + Term2 + Term3] + [Term1y + Term2y + Term3y] + [Term_x_linear] + [Term_y_constant + Term_y_linear]\n\nWait, maybe better to group all terms step by step:\n\nFirst, x(t)^2 terms:\n\nTerm1 (x\u00b2): 676/9,\n\nTerm2 (x\u00b2 linear in t): -650/9 t,\n\nTerm3 (x\u00b2 quadratic in t): 625/36 t\u00b2,\n\ny(t)^2 terms:\n\nTerm1y (y\u00b2):224/9,\n\nTerm2y (y\u00b2 linear in t): -14000/99 t,\n\nTerm3y (y\u00b2 quadratic in t):218750/1089 t\u00b2,\n\n-9x(t) terms:\n\nLinear term: -78 +75/2 t,\n\n[(-33\u221a14)/28] y(t) terms:\n\nConstants: -22,\n\nLinear term:125/2 t,\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\nConstant terms (no t):\n\n676/9 +224/9 -78 -22\n\nLinear terms (coefficient of t):\n\n-650/9 t -14000/99 t +75/2 t +125/2 t\n\nQuadratic terms (coefficient of t\u00b2):\n\n625/36 t\u00b2 +218750/1089 t\u00b2\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst, constants:\n\n676/9 +224/9 = (676 +224)/9 = 900/9 =100,\n\nThen subtract 78 and 22:\n\n100 -78 -22 =0. So the constant terms cancel out, which makes sense because t=0 is a root.\n\nNow linear terms:\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n-650/9 t,\n\n-14000/99 t,\n\n75/2 t,\n\n125/2 t,\n\nFirst, combine the fractions:\n\nLet me convert all to denominators of 198 (LCM of 9,99,2):\n\n-650/9 = -650*22 /198 = -14,300/198,\n\n-14000/99 = -14000*2 /198 = -28,000/198,\n\n75/2 = 75*99 /198 = 7,425/198,\n\n125/2 = 125*99 /198 = 12,375/198,\n\nAdding all together:\n\n(-14,300 -28,000 +7,425 +12,375)/198 t\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n-14,300 -28,000 = -42,300,\n\n7,425 +12,375 =19,800,\n\nTotal: -42,300 +19,800 = -22,500,\n\nThus linear coefficient is -22,500 /198 t. Simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 6: -3,750 /33 t. Hmm, but let me check:\n\nWait, 22,500 divided by 6 is 3,750, 198 divided by 6 is 33. So yes, -3750/33 t.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again:\n\nWait, perhaps I made an arithmetic mistake. Let me recompute:\n\n-14,300 -28,000 is indeed -42,300,\n\n7,425 +12,375 =19,800,\n\nTotal: -42,300 +19,800 = -22,500. Yes, that's right.\n\nSo linear term is (-22,500)/198 t = (-22500 \u00f7 6)/ (198 \u00f76) = same as -3750/33 t.\n\nAlternatively, simplify further:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: -1250/11 t. Because 3750 \u00f73 =1250, 33 \u00f73=11. So linear term is -1250/11 t.\n\nNow quadratic terms:\n\n625/36 t\u00b2 + 218,750/1,089 t\u00b2.\n\nFind common denominator. Let me see, 36 and 1089. 36 = 4*9, 1089 = 33\u00b2 = 3*11 squared? 33\u00b2 = 1089. So 36 and 1089 are co-prime? Not sure. Let me compute LCM(36, 1089).\n\nFactor 36: 2\u00b2 *3\u00b2,\n\nFactor 1089: 3\u00b2 * 11\u00b2,\n\nThus LCM is 2\u00b2 *3\u00b2 *11\u00b2 = 4*9*121= 4*1089= 4356.\n\nSo convert both fractions to denominator 4356.\n\n625/36 = (625 *121)/4356 = (625*121)/4356,\n\n218,750/1089 = (218,750 *4)/4356 = (875,000)/4356,\n\nThus total quadratic term:\n\n[625*121 +875,000]/4356 t\u00b2.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nFirst, 625*121:\n\n625*121: 625*(120 +1)=625*120 +625=75,000 +625=75,625,\n\nAdding 875,000 gives 75,625 +875,000 = 950,625.\n\nThus quadratic coefficient is 950,625 /4356 t\u00b2.\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n950,625 \u00f73 = 316,875,\n\n4356 \u00f73=1,452,\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n316,875 \u00f73=105,625,\n\n1,452 \u00f73=484,\n\nAgain divide by common factors? Let me see:\n\n105,625 and 484.\n\n484 is 22\u00b2=4*121=4*11\u00b2.\n\n105,625: ends with 25, divisible by 25: 105,625 /25 =4,225.\n\n4,225: 65\u00b2=4,225. So 105,625 =25*65\u00b2.\n\nHmm, not sure if they have common factors. Let me check GCD(105,625,484):\n\n484 factors: 2\u00b2\u00d711\u00b2,\n\n105,625 factors: 5^3 \u00d7 5^2? Wait, 105,625 = 25*4225, and 4225=65\u00b2= (5\u00d713)\u00b2, so 105,625=5\u00b3\u00d713\u00b2. So GCD with 484 (2\u00b2\u00d711\u00b2) is 1. Thus the fraction reduces to 105,625/484.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nWait 105,625 divided by 4: 105,625 \u00f72=52,812.5, so not integer.\n\nThus, quadratic term is (105,625/484) t\u00b2.\n\nWait, but this seems really big. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me verify:\n\nOriginal terms:\n\n625/36 +218,750/1089,\n\nCompute 625/36 \u224817.361,\n\n218,750/1089\u2248200.87,\n\nTotal \u2248218.23, which is roughly 950,625/4356 \u2248218.23. Since 950,625 /4356 = (950,625 \u00f7 9)/(4356 \u00f79)=105,625/484 \u2248218.23, yes.\n\nSo quadratic term is (105,625/484) t\u00b2.\n\nThus, putting all together, the equation F(x(t), y(t))=0 becomes:\n\n(105,625/484) t\u00b2 + (-1250/11) t =0.\n\nFactor out t:\n\nt [ (105,625/484) t - 1250/11 ] =0.\n\nTherefore, solutions at t=0 (point A) and t= (1250/11)/(105,625/484).\n\nCompute that t value:\n\nt = (1250/11) \u00f7 (105,625/484) = (1250/11)*(484/105,625).\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst, note that 484 =4*121=4*11\u00b2,\n\n105,625 =25*4225=25*(65)^2=25*(5*13)^2=5^5*13\u00b2.\n\nHmm, but let's compute numerators and denominators:\n\n1250 *484 / (11 *105,625)\n\nLet me see:\n\n1250 / 105,625 = (1250 \u00f7125)/(105,625 \u00f7125)=10 /845.\n\n484 /11=44.\n\nSo overall:\n\n(10 /845)*44 = (440)/845.\n\nSimplify 440/845: divide numerator and denominator by 5: 88/169.\n\nThus, t=88/169.\n\nWait, let me check step by step:\n\n1250 divided by 105,625:\n\n1250 \u00f7105625 = divide numerator and denominator by 125: 10/845.\n\nThen 484 divided by 11 is 44.\n\nThus, (10/845)*(44) = 440/845.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 88/169. Yes. So t=88/169.\n\nTherefore, the parameter t for point P is 88/169.\n\nNow, to find AP, since A is at t=0 and P is at t=88/169, the distance AP can be found by the distance between A and P along the line AD. Since the parametric equations are linear, the distance would be the magnitude of the vector from A to P, which is the vector from t=0 to t=88/169.\n\nAlternatively, since the parameter t is scalar along the line, but the scaling might not be linear in distance. Wait, actually, in parametric equations, the parameter t is a scalar multiple, but the actual distance depends on the direction vector.\n\nAlternatively, compute coordinates of P using t=88/169, then compute distance from A to P.\n\nLet me compute coordinates of P:\n\nx_P = x(t)= 26/3 - (25/6)*(88/169)\n\nSimilarly, y_P = y(t)= (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)*(88/169)\n\nFirst compute x_P:\n\nCompute (25/6)*(88/169):\n\n25*88 =2200,\n\n6*169=1014,\n\nThus 2200/1014 = simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 1100/507.\n\nThus,\n\nx_P =26/3 -1100/507.\n\nConvert 26/3 to denominator 507:\n\n26/3 = (26*169)/ (3*169) =4394/507,\n\nSo 4394/507 -1100/507 = (4394 -1100)/507 = 3294/507.\n\nSimplify 3294 \u00f7 3=1098, 507 \u00f73=169,\n\nThus x_P =1098/169.\n\nSimilarly compute y_P:\n\nFirst term: (4\u221a14)/3,\n\nSecond term: (125\u221a14/33)*(88/169)\n\nCompute 125*88 = 11,000,\n\n33*169= 5,577,\n\nThus (11,000 /5577)\u221a14,\n\nBut 11,000 divided by 5577: let me see:\n\nWait, 125*88= (125*80)+(125*8)=10,000+1,000=11,000,\n\n33*169= 33*(170-1)=5610-33=5577.\n\nThus,\n\nSecond term: (11,000 /5577)\u221a14,\n\nThus,\n\ny_P = (4\u221a14)/3 - (11,000 /5577)\u221a14.\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\ny_P = \u221a14 [4/3 -11,000/5577].\n\nCompute 4/3 = (4*1859)/ (3*1859) =7436/5577,\n\nThus,\n\n4/3 -11,000/5577 = (7436 -11,000)/5577 = (-3564)/5577.\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n-3564 \u00f73 =-1188,\n\n5577 \u00f73=1859,\n\nSo y_P = \u221a14*(-1188/1859).\n\nThus coordinates of P are (1098/169, -1188\u221a14/1859).\n\nWait, let me check the calculation again for y_P:\n\nWait, the second term was subtracted, so:\n\ny_P = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)*(88/169)\n\n= \u221a14 [4/3 - (125*88)/(33*169)]\n\nCompute (125*88)/(33*169):\n\n125/33 *88/169,\n\n125/33 is approximately, but 88= 8*11, 33=3*11,\n\nSo 88/33= 8/3,\n\nThus, 125/33 *88/169 = (125)*(8)/ (3*169) =1000/(507).\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n125*88 = 125*(80+8)=10,000+1,000=11,000,\n\n33*169=5,577,\n\nSo 11,000/5,577.\n\nHmm, so 4/3 -11,000/5,577,\n\nConvert 4/3 to denominator 5,577:\n\n4/3 = (4*1859)/ (3*1859)=7436/5577,\n\nThus,\n\n7436 -11,000 = -3564,\n\nSo -3564/5577,\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n-1188/1859,\n\nYes, so y_P is indeed -1188\u221a14 /1859.\n\nNow, coordinates of A are (26/3, 4\u221a14/3).\n\nCoordinates of P are (1098/169, -1188\u221a14/1859).\n\nTo compute AP, use distance formula:\n\nAP = sqrt[(x_P -x_A)^2 + (y_P - y_A)^2].\n\nLet me compute the differences first.\n\n\u0394x =1098/169 -26/3 = (1098*3 -26*169)/(169*3).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n1098*3 =3294,\n\n26*169: 26*170=4420 minus 26=4394,\n\nThus 3294 -4394 = -1100,\n\nThus \u0394x= -1100/(169*3)= -1100/507.\n\n\u0394y = (-1188\u221a14/1859 -4\u221a14/3) = \u221a14*(-1188/1859 -4/3).\n\nCompute the terms inside:\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 1859*3=5577.\n\n-1188/1859 = -1188*3/5577 = -3564/5577,\n\n-4/3 = -4*1859/5577= -7436/5577,\n\nThus total: (-3564 -7436)/5577 = -11,000/5577,\n\nThus \u0394y = \u221a14*(-11,000/5577).\n\nTherefore, AP squared is (\u0394x)^2 + (\u0394y)^2:\n\n= ( (-1100/507)^2 ) + ( (-11,000\u221a14/5577)^2 )\n\nFactor out terms:\n\n= (1100^2)/(507^2) + (11,000^2 *14)/(5577^2 )\n\nNotice that 11,000 =10*1,100,\n\nThus 11,000^2 =100*(1100)^2,\n\nTherefore,\n\n= (1100^2)/(507^2) + (100*1100^2 *14)/(5577^2 )\n\nFactor out (1100)^2:\n\n= (1100)^2 [ 1/(507^2) + 1400/(5577^2) ]\n\nHmm, but this seems complex. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, notice that AP = |t| * |AD|, since in parametric terms, the parameter t was scaled such that from A (t=0) to D (t=1) is vector AD, and P is at t=88/169, so AP is t=88/169 times the length from A to D? Wait, no, actually, the parameter t in parametric equations isn't necessarily the Euclidean distance unless the parameter is scaled that way. Wait, let me check:\n\nThe parametric equations for AD are:\n\nx(t) = x_A + t*(x_D - x_A)\n\ny(t) = y_A + t*(y_D - y_A)\n\nThus, when t=1, you reach D. The vector from A to D is (x_D -x_A, y_D - y_A), so the length AD is sqrt[(x_D -x_A)^2 + (y_D - y_A)^2]. Then, the distance from A to P is t * AD, where t is the parameter value at point P. Since in our case, t=88/169, so AP = (88/169)*AD.\n\nTherefore, if I compute AD first, then multiply by 88/169, that would give AP.\n\nThis might be easier. Let me try.\n\nCompute AD length:\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3),\n\nCoordinates of D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nCompute \u0394x = 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6)= -25/6,\n\n\u0394y = (-27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3) = \u221a14*(-81/33 -44/33)= \u221a14*(-125/33),\n\nThus,\n\nAD = sqrt[ (\u0394x)^2 + (\u0394y)^2 ]\n\n= sqrt[ ( (-25/6)^2 + ( -125\u221a14 /33 )^2 ) ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(-25/6)^2 = 625/36,\n\n(-125\u221a14 /33)^2 = (125^2 *14)/(33^2) = (15,625 *14)/1,089 = 218,750/1,089,\n\nThus,\n\nAD\u00b2 =625/36 +218,750/1,089,\n\nTo add these, find common denominator. 36 and 1089: LCM(36, 1089)= 4356 as before.\n\nConvert 625/36 = (625*121)/4356 =75,625/4356,\n\n218,750/1,089 = (218,750*4)/4356= 875,000/4356,\n\nTotal AD\u00b2= (75,625 +875,000)/4356 =950,625 /4356,\n\nTherefore AD = sqrt(950,625 /4356)= sqrt(950625)/sqrt(4356).\n\nsqrt(4356)=66, because 66\u00b2=4356,\n\nsqrt(950,625). Let me see:\n\nWell, 975\u00b2 = (1000 -25)^2 =1,000,000 -50,000 +625=950,625. So sqrt(950,625)=975.\n\nThus AD =975 /66 = 975 \u00f7 66. Simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: 325/22.\n\nThus AD=325/22.\n\nTherefore, AP = (88/169)*(325/22).\n\nSimplify:\n\n88 and 22: 88 \u00f722=4,\n\n325 and 169: 169=13\u00b2, 325=25\u00d713,\n\nSo,\n\nAP = (4/169)*(325/1) [since 88/22=4, denominator 169 remains, numerator 325]\n\nWait:\n\nWait, 88/169 *325/22 = (88/22)*(325/169)=4*(325/169).\n\n325 divided by 13 is 25, 169 is 13\u00b2,\n\nSo 325/169 =25/13,\n\nThus AP=4*(25/13)=100/13.\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\n325 divided by 169: 169*2=338 which is more than 325, so 169*1.913?\n\nWait, 169*2=338, so 325=169 +156,\n\nWait 169*1 +156= 169+156=325,\n\nThus 325/169 =1 +156/169=1 + (12*13)/(13\u00b2)=1 +12/13=25/13? Wait, 12/13 +1=25/13? Wait 1 is 13/13, so 13/13 +12/13=25/13. Yes.\n\nThus, AP=4*(25/13)=100/13.\n\nThus AP=100/13, so m=100, n=13, which are coprime. Thus m +n=113.\n\nWait, that's the answer? Let me confirm.\n\nWait, AP = (88/169)*(325/22)\n\nCompute numerator:88 *325 = 88*(300 +25)=26,400 +2,200=28,600,\n\nDenominator:169*22=3,718,\n\nWait, 28,600 divided by 3,718?\n\nWait, but my previous step was different.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and AD intersects \u03c9 again at P. The sides are given as AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The answer should be in the form m/n with m and n coprime, then find m + n.\n\nHmm, first, maybe I should recall some theorems related to tangents and circles. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the exsymmedian point or something? Wait, tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length. So DB = DC? Wait, no, actually, the two tangents from D to the circle would be DB and DC, so yes, DB = DC. That's a property. So triangle DBC has DB = DC, making it isoceles. Hmm, but how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using power of a point. The power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP, since AD is a secant line. That might be useful. Since P is the second intersection point of AD with \u03c9, so Power of a Point gives DB\u00b2 = DA * DP. So if I can find DA and DP, but I need to relate these.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use coordinates or trigonometry. Let me see. Since the triangle sides are given, perhaps using the Law of Cosines to find angles?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use inversion? Hmm, maybe overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, use coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me set coordinate system with point C at origin, maybe? Let me try.\n\nLet me set point C at (0,0), and point B at (9,0) since BC=9. Wait, but AC is 10, AB is 5. Wait, but then coordinates might need to be set more carefully. Let me think.\n\nLet me place point C at (0,0). Let me let point B be at (9,0), since BC is 9. Then point A is somewhere such that AC =10 and AB=5. Let me find coordinates of A.\n\nLet coordinates of A be (x,y). Then distance from A to C is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 10, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100. Distance from A to B is sqrt((x-9)^2 + y\u00b2) =5, so (x-9)^2 + y\u00b2 =25.\n\nSubtracting the two equations: (x-9)^2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =25 -100 \u21d2 x\u00b2 -18x +81 + y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -75 \u21d2 -18x +81 = -75 \u21d2 -18x = -156 \u21d2 x = 156/18 = 26/3 \u22488.666...\n\nThen x=26/3. Then y\u00b2 = 100 - x\u00b2 = 100 - (676/9) = (900 -676)/9 = 224/9 \u21d2 y=\u00b1sqrt(224)/3 = \u00b1(2*sqrt(56))/3 = \u00b1(2*2*sqrt(14))/3 = \u00b1(4\u221a14)/3. Let me take y positive, so A is at (26/3, 4\u221a14/3).\n\nHmm, okay. So coordinates:\n\nC=(0,0), B=(9,0), A=(26/3, (4\u221a14)/3).\n\nNow, need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC.\n\nFirst, find equations of the tangents at B and C.\n\nTo find the tangent at a point on a circle, we can use the fact that the tangent is perpendicular to the radius. So, if we can find the circumcircle equation, then find the tangent lines at B and C.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates for A, B, C, we can compute the circumcircle equation.\n\nLet me compute the circumcircle equation.\n\nLet me denote the circumcircle by equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nWe can plug in points A, B, C to find D, E, F.\n\nPoint C is (0,0): plugging in gives 0 +0 +0 +0 +F =0 \u21d2 F=0. Wait, but that can't be. Wait, no: the general circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0. For point C (0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +F=0 \u21d2 F=0. Hmm, okay.\n\nPoint B (9,0): 81 +0 + 9D +0 +0 =0 \u21d2 81 +9D =0 \u21d2 D= -9.\n\nPoint A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3):\n\n( (26/3)^2 + (4\u221a14/3)^2 ) + D*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) + F =0\n\nFirst compute (26/3)^2 = (676)/9,\n\n(4\u221a14 /3)^2 = 16*14 /9 = 224/9,\n\nSo total x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 term: (676 +224)/9 = 900/9 =100.\n\nSo 100 + D*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) + F =0.\n\nBut F=0, D is -9. So:\n\n100 + (-9)*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) =0\n\nCompute -9*(26/3)= -78.\n\nThus 100 -78 + (4\u221a14/3)E =0 \u21d2 22 + (4\u221a14/3)E =0 \u21d2 (4\u221a14/3)E = -22 \u21d2 E= (-22 *3)/(4\u221a14) = (-66)/(4\u221a14)= (-33)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalize denominator: E= (-33\u221a14)/(2*14)= (-33\u221a14)/28.\n\nThus the equation of the circumcircle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + [(-33\u221a14)/28]y =0. Hmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to compute the circumradius and center?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps find the tangent lines at B and C.\n\nThe tangent at point C (0,0). Wait, the tangent at C to the circle. The tangent at a point on the circle is given by the equation: xx1 + yy1 + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F =0? Wait, maybe I need another method.\n\nAlternatively, since the tangent at point (x1,y1) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is xx1 + yy1 + D*(x +x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F =0.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for tangent at (x1,y1):\n\nFor a general circle equation: (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, the tangent at (x1,y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = r\u00b2. Wait, no, actually, the tangent line is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = r\u00b2? Wait, no, that would be the equation for the circle itself. Wait, actually, the tangent line is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = r\u00b2 only if (x1,y1) is on the circle. Wait, no, actually, the equation of the tangent line at (x1,y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the standard formula is that the tangent line at (x1,y1) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is:\n\nxx1 + yy1 + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F =0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use calculus? Take derivative, but maybe overkill.\n\nAlternatively, since the tangent at point C (0,0) to the circle. Let me see, the center of the circle is at (-D/2, -E/2). Since the general equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0, so center is (h,k)= (-D/2, -E/2).\n\nWe had D = -9, so h = 9/2. E is (-33\u221a14)/28, so k = (33\u221a14)/56.\n\nThus center O is (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56).\n\nHmm, the tangent at point C (0,0). The tangent line is perpendicular to the radius OC. The radius OC is from center (9/2, 33\u221a14/56) to (0,0). So the direction vector of OC is (-9/2, -33\u221a14/56). Therefore, the tangent line at C is perpendicular to this vector. So the slope of OC is ( (-33\u221a14/56 ) / (-9/2) ) = (33\u221a14/56)/(9/2) ) = (33\u221a14/56)*(2/9) = (66\u221a14)/(504) = (11\u221a14)/84. Therefore, the slope of OC is 11\u221a14 /84. Therefore, the tangent line at C must have slope perpendicular to that, which is -84/(11\u221a14).\n\nSo the tangent at C is a line through (0,0) with slope -84/(11\u221a14). Let me rationalize that. Alternatively, write equation as y = [ -84/(11\u221a14) ] x.\n\nSimilarly, tangent at B (9,0). Let's find the tangent at B. The radius OB is from center (9/2, 33\u221a14/56) to B (9,0). The vector is (9 - 9/2, 0 - 33\u221a14/56) = (9/2, -33\u221a14/56). The slope of OB is ( -33\u221a14/56 ) / (9/2 ) = same as before but negative? Wait, same as before but the y-component is negative. So slope is (-33\u221a14/56)/(9/2)= same as before but negative? Let me compute:\n\nSlope of OB is (0 - 33\u221a14/56)/(9 - 9/2) = (-33\u221a14/56)/(9/2) = (-33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = same as before but negative. So slope is -11\u221a14 /84? Wait, no, let me compute again:\n\nWait, numerator is -33\u221a14/56, denominator is 9/2. So the slope is (-33\u221a14/56)/(9/2) = (-33\u221a14/56)*(2/9) = (-66\u221a14)/504 = (-11\u221a14)/84. So slope of OB is -11\u221a14/84. Therefore, the tangent line at B must be perpendicular to OB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: 84/(11\u221a14).\n\nTherefore, the tangent at B (9,0) has slope 84/(11\u221a14). So equation is y -0 = [84/(11\u221a14)](x -9).\n\nSo now, equations of the two tangent lines:\n\nTangent at C: y = [ -84/(11\u221a14) ] x.\n\nTangent at B: y = [84/(11\u221a14)](x -9).\n\nPoint D is the intersection of these two lines. Let me set them equal to find x-coordinate.\n\nSet [ -84/(11\u221a14) ] x = [84/(11\u221a14)](x -9).\n\nMultiply both sides by 11\u221a14 /84 to eliminate denominators:\n\n- x = (x -9)\n\nSo -x = x -9 \u21d2 -2x = -9 \u21d2 x = 9/2.\n\nThen plug back into tangent at C's equation: y = [ -84/(11\u221a14) ]*(9/2) = (-84*9)/(22\u221a14) = (-756)/(22\u221a14) = (-378)/(11\u221a14). Rationalize denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\ny = (-378\u221a14)/(11*14) = (-378\u221a14)/(154) = Simplify 378 and 154: divide numerator and denominator by 14? 378 \u00f714=27, 154 \u00f714=11. So y= (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nThus, coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy, but okay.\n\nNow, need to find point P, which is the second intersection of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, find parametric equation of line AD. Points A and D:\n\nPoint A is (26/3, 4\u221a14/3).\n\nPoint D is (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nLet me write parametric equations for AD. Let parameter t go from 0 to 1 for A to D, but since P is another intersection, we might need to go beyond.\n\nLet me denote the parametric equations as:\n\nx = x_A + t*(x_D - x_A)\n\ny = y_A + t*(y_D - y_A)\n\nCompute differences:\n\nx_D - x_A = (9/2 - 26/3) = (27/6 -52/6)= (-25/6)\n\ny_D - y_A = (-27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3) = \u221a14*(-81/33 -44/33)= \u221a14*(-125/33)\n\nThus, parametric equations:\n\nx = 26/3 - (25/6)t\n\ny = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t\n\nWe need to find the point P which is the other intersection with \u03c9. Since A is already on \u03c9 and on AD, so when t=0 we are at A, and when t=1 we are at D. The other intersection P will be at some t value, say t = k.\n\nTo find P, substitute the parametric equations into the circumcircle equation and solve for t. The equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + [(-33\u221a14)/28]y =0. Let me plug in x and y.\n\nThis might be algebraically intensive, but let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note that the parametric equations for x and y are:\n\nx(t) = 26/3 - (25/6)t,\n\ny(t) = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t.\n\nLet me write all terms in terms of fractions to make substitution easier.\n\nFirst, compute x(t)^2:\n\nx(t)^2 = [26/3 - (25/6)t]^2 = (26/3)^2 - 2*(26/3)*(25/6)t + (25/6 t)^2\n\nSimilarly, y(t)^2 = [ (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t ]^2 = (4\u221a14/3)^2 - 2*(4\u221a14/3)*(125\u221a14/33)t + (125\u221a14/33 t)^2\n\nThis is going to get really messy. Maybe there's a smarter way?\n\nAlternatively, since points A and P lie on the circle, and line AD intersects the circle at A and P, so the parameter t corresponds to points on the line, so substituting into the circle equation will give a quadratic equation in t, with roots at t=0 (point A) and t=k (point P). Therefore, by Vieta's theorem, the product of the roots is (constant term)/(coefficient of t^2). Since one root is t=0, the other root will be the other solution.\n\nWait, actually, Vieta's formula for quadratic equation: if equation is at\u00b2 + bt + c =0, then product is c/a. But if one root is 0, then c must be 0? Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, actually, the equation when substituting parametric into circle equation would be quadratic in t, so let me denote the equation as:\n\nA t\u00b2 + B t + C =0,\n\nwhere A is the coefficient of t\u00b2, B coefficient of t, and C constant term.\n\nSince point A is on the circle, when t=0, plugging into equation gives C =0? Wait, no. Wait, when t=0, x(t)=x_A, y(t)=y_A. Since A is on the circle, substituting t=0 into the equation should satisfy the circle equation. Therefore, the constant term C must be zero? Wait, perhaps not. Wait, let me think again.\n\nLet me denote the circle equation as F(x,y)=0. Then substituting x(t) and y(t) into F(x,y) gives a function F(x(t), y(t)) which is quadratic in t. Since A is on both the line and the circle, when t=0, F(x(0), y(0))=0, so the equation will have t=0 as a root. The other root is t corresponding to point P.\n\nTherefore, the quadratic equation in t will have roots t=0 and t = t_P. Therefore, the equation can be written as t*(Mt + N)=0, so the product of roots is 0 * t_P =0, so the constant term must be 0. Wait, but maybe I need to compute it properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute F(x(t), y(t)) =0, and since t=0 is a root, factor out t. Let me try.\n\nLet me compute F(x(t), y(t)) = x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 -9x(t) + [(-33\u221a14)/28] y(t) =0.\n\nFirst, compute each term:\n\nCompute x(t)^2:\n\nx(t) = 26/3 - (25/6)t,\n\nso x(t)^2 = (26/3)^2 - 2*(26/3)*(25/6)t + (25/6)^2 t\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, y(t)^2:\n\ny(t) = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t,\n\nso y(t)^2 = (4\u221a14/3)^2 - 2*(4\u221a14/3)*(125\u221a14/33)t + (125\u221a14/33)^2 t\u00b2\n\nCompute each term step by step:\n\nFirst, x(t)^2:\n\nTerm1 = (26/3)^2 = (676)/9\n\nTerm2 = -2*(26/3)*(25/6)t = - (2*26*25)/(3*6) t = - (1300)/18 t = - (650)/9 t\n\nTerm3 = (25/6)^2 t\u00b2 = (625/36) t\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, y(t)^2:\n\nFirst term: (4\u221a14/3)^2 = 16*14 /9 = 224/9\n\nSecond term: -2*(4\u221a14/3)*(125\u221a14/33)t. Let's compute:\n\nFirst, multiply the constants:\n\n-2*(4)*(125)*(\u221a14)*(\u221a14)/(3*33) * t\n\n\u221a14*\u221a14 =14, so:\n\n-2*4*125*14 / (3*33) * t = -2*4*125*14 / 99 * t\n\nCompute numerator: 2*4=8; 8*125=1000; 1000*14=14,000.\n\nThus, -14,000 / 99 * t\n\nWait, let me check again step by step:\n\nWait, the second term in y(t)^2 is -2*(first term)*(second term):\n\nFirst term is (4\u221a14)/3,\n\nSecond term is (125\u221a14)/33,\n\nSo product: 4\u221a14 * 125\u221a14 = 4*125*(\u221a14)^2 = 500*14 = 7000,\n\nThen multiplied by -2: -2*7000 = -14000,\n\nDenominator: 3 * 33 =99,\n\nSo the second term is -14000/99 * t.\n\nThird term of y(t)^2 is (125\u221a14/33)^2 t\u00b2:\n\n(125^2)*(14)/(33^2) t\u00b2 = (15,625 *14)/1,089 t\u00b2 = 218,750 /1,089 t\u00b2.\n\nNow, moving on.\n\nNext terms in F(x,y):\n\n-9x(t) = -9*(26/3 -25/6 t) = -9*(26/3) + 9*(25/6)t = -78 + (225/6)t = -78 + (75/2)t\n\n[(-33\u221a14)/28] y(t) = [(-33\u221a14)/28]*(4\u221a14/3 -125\u221a14/33 t )\n\nCompute this term:\n\nFirst, distribute:\n\n= (-33\u221a14)/28 *4\u221a14/3 + (-33\u221a14)/28*(-125\u221a14/33)t\n\nFirst part:\n\n(-33\u221a14 *4\u221a14)/(28*3) = (-33*4*(\u221a14)^2)/(84) = (-132*14)/84\n\n14 divides into 84 six times:\n\n-132*14 /84 = -132/6 = -22\n\nSecond part:\n\n(-33\u221a14)/28 * (-125\u221a14/33)t = (125\u221a14 * \u221a14)/(28) t = (125*14)/28 t = (1750)/28 t = 62.5 t. Wait, let me compute:\n\nWait, numerator: 125 *14 = 1750, denominator 28: 1750/28 = 1750 \u00f714=125, 125/2 =62.5. So yes, 62.5 t, which is 125/2 t.\n\nThus, putting together:\n\n[(-33\u221a14)/28] y(t) = -22 + (125/2)t.\n\nNow, putting all terms into F(x(t), y(t)) =0:\n\nLet's collect all terms:\n\nx(t)^2 + y(t)^2 -9x(t) + [(-33\u221a14)/28] y(t) =\n\n[Term1 + Term2 + Term3] + [Term1y + Term2y + Term3y] + [Term_x_linear] + [Term_y_constant + Term_y_linear]\n\nWait, maybe better to group all terms step by step:\n\nFirst, x(t)^2 terms:\n\nTerm1 (x\u00b2): 676/9,\n\nTerm2 (x\u00b2 linear in t): -650/9 t,\n\nTerm3 (x\u00b2 quadratic in t): 625/36 t\u00b2,\n\ny(t)^2 terms:\n\nTerm1y (y\u00b2):224/9,\n\nTerm2y (y\u00b2 linear in t): -14000/99 t,\n\nTerm3y (y\u00b2 quadratic in t):218750/1089 t\u00b2,\n\n-9x(t) terms:\n\nLinear term: -78 +75/2 t,\n\n[(-33\u221a14)/28] y(t) terms:\n\nConstants: -22,\n\nLinear term:125/2 t,\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\nConstant terms (no t):\n\n676/9 +224/9 -78 -22\n\nLinear terms (coefficient of t):\n\n-650/9 t -14000/99 t +75/2 t +125/2 t\n\nQuadratic terms (coefficient of t\u00b2):\n\n625/36 t\u00b2 +218750/1089 t\u00b2\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst, constants:\n\n676/9 +224/9 = (676 +224)/9 = 900/9 =100,\n\nThen subtract 78 and 22:\n\n100 -78 -22 =0. So the constant terms cancel out, which makes sense because t=0 is a root.\n\nNow linear terms:\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n-650/9 t,\n\n-14000/99 t,\n\n75/2 t,\n\n125/2 t,\n\nFirst, combine the fractions:\n\nLet me convert all to denominators of 198 (LCM of 9,99,2):\n\n-650/9 = -650*22 /198 = -14,300/198,\n\n-14000/99 = -14000*2 /198 = -28,000/198,\n\n75/2 = 75*99 /198 = 7,425/198,\n\n125/2 = 125*99 /198 = 12,375/198,\n\nAdding all together:\n\n(-14,300 -28,000 +7,425 +12,375)/198 t\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n-14,300 -28,000 = -42,300,\n\n7,425 +12,375 =19,800,\n\nTotal: -42,300 +19,800 = -22,500,\n\nThus linear coefficient is -22,500 /198 t. Simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 6: -3,750 /33 t. Hmm, but let me check:\n\nWait, 22,500 divided by 6 is 3,750, 198 divided by 6 is 33. So yes, -3750/33 t.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again:\n\nWait, perhaps I made an arithmetic mistake. Let me recompute:\n\n-14,300 -28,000 is indeed -42,300,\n\n7,425 +12,375 =19,800,\n\nTotal: -42,300 +19,800 = -22,500. Yes, that's right.\n\nSo linear term is (-22,500)/198 t = (-22500 \u00f7 6)/ (198 \u00f76) = same as -3750/33 t.\n\nAlternatively, simplify further:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: -1250/11 t. Because 3750 \u00f73 =1250, 33 \u00f73=11. So linear term is -1250/11 t.\n\nNow quadratic terms:\n\n625/36 t\u00b2 + 218,750/1,089 t\u00b2.\n\nFind common denominator. Let me see, 36 and 1089. 36 = 4*9, 1089 = 33\u00b2 = 3*11 squared? 33\u00b2 = 1089. So 36 and 1089 are co-prime? Not sure. Let me compute LCM(36, 1089).\n\nFactor 36: 2\u00b2 *3\u00b2,\n\nFactor 1089: 3\u00b2 * 11\u00b2,\n\nThus LCM is 2\u00b2 *3\u00b2 *11\u00b2 = 4*9*121= 4*1089= 4356.\n\nSo convert both fractions to denominator 4356.\n\n625/36 = (625 *121)/4356 = (625*121)/4356,\n\n218,750/1089 = (218,750 *4)/4356 = (875,000)/4356,\n\nThus total quadratic term:\n\n[625*121 +875,000]/4356 t\u00b2.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nFirst, 625*121:\n\n625*121: 625*(120 +1)=625*120 +625=75,000 +625=75,625,\n\nAdding 875,000 gives 75,625 +875,000 = 950,625.\n\nThus quadratic coefficient is 950,625 /4356 t\u00b2.\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n950,625 \u00f73 = 316,875,\n\n4356 \u00f73=1,452,\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n316,875 \u00f73=105,625,\n\n1,452 \u00f73=484,\n\nAgain divide by common factors? Let me see:\n\n105,625 and 484.\n\n484 is 22\u00b2=4*121=4*11\u00b2.\n\n105,625: ends with 25, divisible by 25: 105,625 /25 =4,225.\n\n4,225: 65\u00b2=4,225. So 105,625 =25*65\u00b2.\n\nHmm, not sure if they have common factors. Let me check GCD(105,625,484):\n\n484 factors: 2\u00b2\u00d711\u00b2,\n\n105,625 factors: 5^3 \u00d7 5^2? Wait, 105,625 = 25*4225, and 4225=65\u00b2= (5\u00d713)\u00b2, so 105,625=5\u00b3\u00d713\u00b2. So GCD with 484 (2\u00b2\u00d711\u00b2) is 1. Thus the fraction reduces to 105,625/484.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nWait 105,625 divided by 4: 105,625 \u00f72=52,812.5, so not integer.\n\nThus, quadratic term is (105,625/484) t\u00b2.\n\nWait, but this seems really big. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me verify:\n\nOriginal terms:\n\n625/36 +218,750/1089,\n\nCompute 625/36 \u224817.361,\n\n218,750/1089\u2248200.87,\n\nTotal \u2248218.23, which is roughly 950,625/4356 \u2248218.23. Since 950,625 /4356 = (950,625 \u00f7 9)/(4356 \u00f79)=105,625/484 \u2248218.23, yes.\n\nSo quadratic term is (105,625/484) t\u00b2.\n\nThus, putting all together, the equation F(x(t), y(t))=0 becomes:\n\n(105,625/484) t\u00b2 + (-1250/11) t =0.\n\nFactor out t:\n\nt [ (105,625/484) t - 1250/11 ] =0.\n\nTherefore, solutions at t=0 (point A) and t= (1250/11)/(105,625/484).\n\nCompute that t value:\n\nt = (1250/11) \u00f7 (105,625/484) = (1250/11)*(484/105,625).\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst, note that 484 =4*121=4*11\u00b2,\n\n105,625 =25*4225=25*(65)^2=25*(5*13)^2=5^5*13\u00b2.\n\nHmm, but let's compute numerators and denominators:\n\n1250 *484 / (11 *105,625)\n\nLet me see:\n\n1250 / 105,625 = (1250 \u00f7125)/(105,625 \u00f7125)=10 /845.\n\n484 /11=44.\n\nSo overall:\n\n(10 /845)*44 = (440)/845.\n\nSimplify 440/845: divide numerator and denominator by 5: 88/169.\n\nThus, t=88/169.\n\nWait, let me check step by step:\n\n1250 divided by 105,625:\n\n1250 \u00f7105625 = divide numerator and denominator by 125: 10/845.\n\nThen 484 divided by 11 is 44.\n\nThus, (10/845)*(44) = 440/845.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 88/169. Yes. So t=88/169.\n\nTherefore, the parameter t for point P is 88/169.\n\nNow, to find AP, since A is at t=0 and P is at t=88/169, the distance AP can be found by the distance between A and P along the line AD. Since the parametric equations are linear, the distance would be the magnitude of the vector from A to P, which is the vector from t=0 to t=88/169.\n\nAlternatively, since the parameter t is scalar along the line, but the scaling might not be linear in distance. Wait, actually, in parametric equations, the parameter t is a scalar multiple, but the actual distance depends on the direction vector.\n\nAlternatively, compute coordinates of P using t=88/169, then compute distance from A to P.\n\nLet me compute coordinates of P:\n\nx_P = x(t)= 26/3 - (25/6)*(88/169)\n\nSimilarly, y_P = y(t)= (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)*(88/169)\n\nFirst compute x_P:\n\nCompute (25/6)*(88/169):\n\n25*88 =2200,\n\n6*169=1014,\n\nThus 2200/1014 = simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 1100/507.\n\nThus,\n\nx_P =26/3 -1100/507.\n\nConvert 26/3 to denominator 507:\n\n26/3 = (26*169)/ (3*169) =4394/507,\n\nSo 4394/507 -1100/507 = (4394 -1100)/507 = 3294/507.\n\nSimplify 3294 \u00f7 3=1098, 507 \u00f73=169,\n\nThus x_P =1098/169.\n\nSimilarly compute y_P:\n\nFirst term: (4\u221a14)/3,\n\nSecond term: (125\u221a14/33)*(88/169)\n\nCompute 125*88 = 11,000,\n\n33*169= 5,577,\n\nThus (11,000 /5577)\u221a14,\n\nBut 11,000 divided by 5577: let me see:\n\nWait, 125*88= (125*80)+(125*8)=10,000+1,000=11,000,\n\n33*169= 33*(170-1)=5610-33=5577.\n\nThus,\n\nSecond term: (11,000 /5577)\u221a14,\n\nThus,\n\ny_P = (4\u221a14)/3 - (11,000 /5577)\u221a14.\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\ny_P = \u221a14 [4/3 -11,000/5577].\n\nCompute 4/3 = (4*1859)/ (3*1859) =7436/5577,\n\nThus,\n\n4/3 -11,000/5577 = (7436 -11,000)/5577 = (-3564)/5577.\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n-3564 \u00f73 =-1188,\n\n5577 \u00f73=1859,\n\nSo y_P = \u221a14*(-1188/1859).\n\nThus coordinates of P are (1098/169, -1188\u221a14/1859).\n\nWait, let me check the calculation again for y_P:\n\nWait, the second term was subtracted, so:\n\ny_P = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)*(88/169)\n\n= \u221a14 [4/3 - (125*88)/(33*169)]\n\nCompute (125*88)/(33*169):\n\n125/33 *88/169,\n\n125/33 is approximately, but 88= 8*11, 33=3*11,\n\nSo 88/33= 8/3,\n\nThus, 125/33 *88/169 = (125)*(8)/ (3*169) =1000/(507).\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n125*88 = 125*(80+8)=10,000+1,000=11,000,\n\n33*169=5,577,\n\nSo 11,000/5,577.\n\nHmm, so 4/3 -11,000/5,577,\n\nConvert 4/3 to denominator 5,577:\n\n4/3 = (4*1859)/ (3*1859)=7436/5577,\n\nThus,\n\n7436 -11,000 = -3564,\n\nSo -3564/5577,\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n-1188/1859,\n\nYes, so y_P is indeed -1188\u221a14 /1859.\n\nNow, coordinates of A are (26/3, 4\u221a14/3).\n\nCoordinates of P are (1098/169, -1188\u221a14/1859).\n\nTo compute AP, use distance formula:\n\nAP = sqrt[(x_P -x_A)^2 + (y_P - y_A)^2].\n\nLet me compute the differences first.\n\n\u0394x =1098/169 -26/3 = (1098*3 -26*169)/(169*3).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n1098*3 =3294,\n\n26*169: 26*170=4420 minus 26=4394,\n\nThus 3294 -4394 = -1100,\n\nThus \u0394x= -1100/(169*3)= -1100/507.\n\n\u0394y = (-1188\u221a14/1859 -4\u221a14/3) = \u221a14*(-1188/1859 -4/3).\n\nCompute the terms inside:\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 1859*3=5577.\n\n-1188/1859 = -1188*3/5577 = -3564/5577,\n\n-4/3 = -4*1859/5577= -7436/5577,\n\nThus total: (-3564 -7436)/5577 = -11,000/5577,\n\nThus \u0394y = \u221a14*(-11,000/5577).\n\nTherefore, AP squared is (\u0394x)^2 + (\u0394y)^2:\n\n= ( (-1100/507)^2 ) + ( (-11,000\u221a14/5577)^2 )\n\nFactor out terms:\n\n= (1100^2)/(507^2) + (11,000^2 *14)/(5577^2 )\n\nNotice that 11,000 =10*1,100,\n\nThus 11,000^2 =100*(1100)^2,\n\nTherefore,\n\n= (1100^2)/(507^2) + (100*1100^2 *14)/(5577^2 )\n\nFactor out (1100)^2:\n\n= (1100)^2 [ 1/(507^2) + 1400/(5577^2) ]\n\nHmm, but this seems complex. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, notice that AP = |t| * |AD|, since in parametric terms, the parameter t was scaled such that from A (t=0) to D (t=1) is vector AD, and P is at t=88/169, so AP is t=88/169 times the length from A to D? Wait, no, actually, the parameter t in parametric equations isn't necessarily the Euclidean distance unless the parameter is scaled that way. Wait, let me check:\n\nThe parametric equations for AD are:\n\nx(t) = x_A + t*(x_D - x_A)\n\ny(t) = y_A + t*(y_D - y_A)\n\nThus, when t=1, you reach D. The vector from A to D is (x_D -x_A, y_D - y_A), so the length AD is sqrt[(x_D -x_A)^2 + (y_D - y_A)^2]. Then, the distance from A to P is t * AD, where t is the parameter value at point P. Since in our case, t=88/169, so AP = (88/169)*AD.\n\nTherefore, if I compute AD first, then multiply by 88/169, that would give AP.\n\nThis might be easier. Let me try.\n\nCompute AD length:\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3),\n\nCoordinates of D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nCompute \u0394x = 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6)= -25/6,\n\n\u0394y = (-27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3) = \u221a14*(-81/33 -44/33)= \u221a14*(-125/33),\n\nThus,\n\nAD = sqrt[ (\u0394x)^2 + (\u0394y)^2 ]\n\n= sqrt[ ( (-25/6)^2 + ( -125\u221a14 /33 )^2 ) ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(-25/6)^2 = 625/36,\n\n(-125\u221a14 /33)^2 = (125^2 *14)/(33^2) = (15,625 *14)/1,089 = 218,750/1,089,\n\nThus,\n\nAD\u00b2 =625/36 +218,750/1,089,\n\nTo add these, find common denominator. 36 and 1089: LCM(36, 1089)= 4356 as before.\n\nConvert 625/36 = (625*121)/4356 =75,625/4356,\n\n218,750/1,089 = (218,750*4)/4356= 875,000/4356,\n\nTotal AD\u00b2= (75,625 +875,000)/4356 =950,625 /4356,\n\nTherefore AD = sqrt(950,625 /4356)= sqrt(950625)/sqrt(4356).\n\nsqrt(4356)=66, because 66\u00b2=4356,\n\nsqrt(950,625). Let me see:\n\nWell, 975\u00b2 = (1000 -25)^2 =1,000,000 -50,000 +625=950,625. So sqrt(950,625)=975.\n\nThus AD =975 /66 = 975 \u00f7 66. Simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: 325/22.\n\nThus AD=325/22.\n\nTherefore, AP = (88/169)*(325/22).\n\nSimplify:\n\n88 and 22: 88 \u00f722=4,\n\n325 and 169: 169=13\u00b2, 325=25\u00d713,\n\nSo,\n\nAP = (4/169)*(325/1) [since 88/22=4, denominator 169 remains, numerator 325]\n\nWait:\n\nWait, 88/169 *325/22 = (88/22)*(325/169)=4*(325/169).\n\n325 divided by 13 is 25, 169 is 13\u00b2,\n\nSo 325/169 =25/13,\n\nThus AP=4*(25/13)=100/13.\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\n325 divided by 169: 169*2=338 which is more than 325, so 169*1.913?\n\nWait, 169*2=338, so 325=169 +156,\n\nWait 169*1 +156= 169+156=325,\n\nThus 325/169 =1 +156/169=1 + (12*13)/(13\u00b2)=1 +12/13=25/13? Wait, 12/13 +1=25/13? Wait 1 is 13/13, so 13/13 +12/13=25/13. Yes.\n\nThus, AP=4*(25/13)=100/13.\n\nThus AP=100/13, so m=100, n=13, which are coprime. Thus m +n=113.\n\nWait, that's the answer? Let me confirm.\n\nWait, AP = (88/169)*(325/22)\n\nCompute numerator:88 *325 = 88*(300 +25)=26,400 +2,200=28,600,\n\nDenominator:169*22=3,718,\n\nWait, 28,600 divided by 3,718?\n\nWait, but my previous step was different. Wait, perhaps miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nAP = (88/169)*(325/22)\n\n= (88 *325)/(169*22)\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\n88 = 8*11,\n\n325=25*13,\n\n169=13\u00b2,\n\n22=2*11,\n\nThus,\n\nNumerator:8*11*25*13,\n\nDenominator:13\u00b2*2*11,\n\nCancel terms:\n\n11 cancels,\n\n13 in numerator cancels with one 13 in denominator,\n\n2 in denominator cancels with 8 in numerator (8/2=4),\n\nSo remaining:\n\n(8/2)=4, 25 remains, 13 in denominator? Wait:\n\nWait:\n\nLet me write as:\n\n(8 *11 *25 *13) / (13^2 *2 *11) =\n\nCancel 11,\n\nCancel one 13,\n\nCancel 2 with 8 to get 4,\n\nThus:\n\n(4 *25)/13 =100/13.\n\nYes, so AP=100/13. Thus m=100, n=13, so m +n=113.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 113.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{113}\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that point \\(D\\) is the intersection of the tangents to the circumcircle \\(\\omega\\) of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\). By the power of a point theorem, we know \\(DB = DC\\) and \\(DB^2 = DC^2 = DA \\cdot DP\\). \n\nWe use coordinate geometry to find the coordinates of points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). Setting \\(C\\) at \\((0, 0)\\) and \\(B\\) at \\((9, 0)\\), we determine the coordinates of \\(A\\) by solving the system of equations derived from the distances \\(AC = 10\\) and \\(AB = 5\\). This gives \\(A\\) as \\(\\left(\\frac{26}{3}, \\frac{4\\sqrt{14}}{3}\\right)\\).\n\nNext, we find the equations of the tangents at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\). The tangent at \\(C\\) has a slope of \\(-\\frac{84}{11\\sqrt{14}}\\) and the tangent at \\(B\\) has a slope of \\(\\frac{84}{11\\sqrt{14}}\\). Solving these equations, we find the coordinates of \\(D\\) as \\(\\left(\\frac{9}{2}, -\\frac{27\\sqrt{14}}{11}\\right)\\).\n\nWe then parameterize the line \\(AD\\) and substitute into the circumcircle equation to find the parameter \\(t\\) corresponding to point \\(P\\). Using Vieta's theorem, we determine the parameter \\(t = \\frac{88}{169}\\) for point \\(P\\).\n\nFinally, we calculate the distance \\(AP\\) using the parameter \\(t\\) and the length of \\(AD\\). The length \\(AD\\) is found to be \\(\\frac{325}{22}\\), and multiplying by \\(t\\) gives \\(AP = \\frac{100}{13}\\). Thus, \\(m = 100\\) and \\(n = 13\\), leading to \\(m + n = 113\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{113}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and AD intersects \u03c9 again at P. The sides are given as AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The answer should be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Alright, let's start thinking.\n\nFirst, since ABC is inscribed in a circle, it's a cyclic triangle. The tangents from D to the circle at B and C mean that D is the exsymmedian point or something? Wait, maybe it's related to the symmedian. Hmm, tangents from a single point to a circle are equal in length, so DB = DC. Wait, no, actually, the two tangent segments from a single external point to a circle are equal. So, DB and DC are both tangents from D to the circle, so DB = DC. That might be important.\n\nI remember that in such configurations, there's a relation involving the power of point D with respect to the circle. The power of D is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP, since AD is a secant line. Wait, yes, power of a point says that if a line through D intersects the circle at A and P, then DA * DP = DB\u00b2. So that equation might be useful here. If I can find DA and DP, but I need to relate them somehow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use coordinates or trigonometry? Hmm, perhaps coordinate geometry could work, but the sides are given as 5, 9, 10, so maybe using the Law of Cosines first to find angles?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use inversion? Hmm, maybe overcomplicating. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall that in a triangle, the symmedian point is the intersection of the symmedians, which are reflections of the medians over the angle bisectors. But here, point D is where the tangents at B and C meet. The tangents at B and C would be related to the symmedian? Maybe the point D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC? Wait, actually, the intersection point of the tangents at B and C is the symmedian point? Wait, no, the symmedian point is the intersection of the reflections of the medians over the angle bisectors. But the tangents from D to the circle would be related to the symmedian. Alternatively, maybe D is the exsymmedian point?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using harmonic division or projective geometry concepts. Hmm, maybe too much. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, since we have lengths of sides, maybe use coordinates. Let me try to set up coordinate system. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point B at (9,0), since BC is 9. Wait, but AC is 10, AB is 5. Wait, maybe that's not the best. Alternatively, let me place points in coordinate system such that calculations are easier.\n\nAlternatively, use barycentric coordinates? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, use the Power of a Point theorem. Since D is outside the circle, power of D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. So, if I can compute DA and DP, but since DA * DP = DB\u00b2, then AP = DP - DA? Wait, no. Wait, AP is from A to P, so if AD is going from A to D, then the points are A, then P, then D? Wait, no. The line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then intersects the circle again at P? Wait, hold on. The problem says \"AD intersects \u03c9 at P\", so starting at A, going through D, and then P is another intersection point. Wait, but since D is outside the circle, the line AD would start at A (on the circle), go through D (outside), so P must be the other intersection point, which would be between A and D? Wait, no. Wait, if you have a secant starting inside the circle, going out, but A is on the circle, so AD starts at A (on the circle), goes through D (outside), so the other intersection point P must be on the extension beyond D? Wait, no, that would mean that the line AD passes through A, goes through D, and then P would be the other intersection with the circle? Wait, but since D is outside, the line AD starts at A, exits the circle, goes to D, and then if extended beyond D, it might not come back. Wait, perhaps I misread. The problem says \"AD intersect \u03c9 at P\". Since A is already on \u03c9, so the other intersection point is P, so P is the second point where AD meets \u03c9. So the order is A---P---D, so AP is from A to P, then PD is from P to D. Therefore, the Power of a Point theorem says that DA * DP = DB\u00b2. So DA is the entire length from D to A, and DP is from D to P, so DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Wait, but DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P? Wait, actually, the Power of a Point formula is: if a line through D intersects the circle at X and Y, then DX * DY = DB\u00b2. Here, the line is AD, which passes through A (on the circle) and P (the other intersection point). So, the Power of a Point gives DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Wait, but in terms of signed lengths? Hmm, perhaps in terms of lengths, we can write DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Since DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. But since P is on the extension beyond A? Wait, no, hold on.\n\nWait, if A is on the circle, and the line AD starts at A and goes through D, then the other intersection point P must be between A and D? Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me visualize: the circle \u03c9 has point A on it. The tangent at B and tangent at C meet at D, which is outside the circle. Then the line AD starts at A, goes through D, which is outside, so the other intersection with the circle must be on the other side of A from D? Wait, no. If you start at A, go towards D (outside), then the line AD would exit the circle at A, so the other intersection point P must be on the other side of A from D? Wait, that can't be. Wait, actually, if you have a line starting at A (on the circle) and going outward to D (outside), then the only other intersection with the circle would be on the opposite side of A from D. Wait, but then the line AD would pass through A, go towards D, but the other intersection is P, which would be on the opposite side. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe it's better to formalize:\n\nLet me denote the points: A is on \u03c9. The line AD starts at A, goes through D, which is outside \u03c9, so the other intersection point P must be between A and D? Wait, if you go from A towards D, you exit the circle, so there's no other intersection unless you go the other way. Wait, perhaps P is on the other side of A from D? That is, AP is a chord passing through D? Hmm, maybe the problem states that AD intersects \u03c9 again at P, so starting at A, going along AD, the next intersection with \u03c9 is P. So if D is on the extension beyond P from A, then P is between A and D. Wait, but since D is the external point, the line AD must pass through A, go out to D, but since D is outside, then the other intersection P must be between A and D? Wait, but then if P is between A and D, then AP is part of AD, so AP would be shorter than AD. But the problem says \"AP can be written as...\", so maybe that's okay.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to draw a diagram mentally. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place the triangle in coordinate plane.\n\nLet me set point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0), since BC is 9. Then point A is somewhere such that AC=10 and AB=5. Let me find coordinates of point A.\n\nLet\u2019s denote coordinates: Let\u2019s let C=(0,0), B=(9,0). Let A=(x,y). Then AC=10, so sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=10, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100. AB=5, so distance from A to B is 5: sqrt( (x-9)^2 + y^2 ) = 5, so (x-9)^2 + y^2 =25.\n\nSubtract the two equations: (x-9)^2 + y^2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =25 - 100 => x\u00b2 -18x +81 + y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -75 => -18x +81 = -75 => -18x = -156 => x=156/18 = 26/3 \u22488.666...\n\nThen x=26/3. Then y\u00b2 =100 -x\u00b2 =100 - (676/9)= (900 -676)/9=224/9, so y=\u00b1\u221a(224/9)=\u00b1(\u221a224)/3=\u00b1(4\u221a14)/3. Hmm, okay. Let's take y positive, so A is (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3).\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nA: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3)\n\nB: (9,0)\n\nC: (0,0)\n\nNow, need to find the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9. The point D is the intersection of these two tangents.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC. Since we have coordinates for A, B, C, we can compute it.\n\nLet me recall the general equation of a circle: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nPlugging in points:\n\nFor point C (0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 + F =0 => F=0.\n\nFor point B (9,0): 81 +0 +9D +0 +0=0 =>9D = -81 => D= -9.\n\nFor point A (26/3,4\u221a14/3):\n\n(26/3)^2 + (4\u221a14/3)^2 + D*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) + F =0.\n\nSince F=0 and D=-9:\n\nCompute (26/3)^2 = (676)/9,\n\n(4\u221a14/3)^2 = (16*14)/9 = 224/9,\n\nSo total first two terms: (676 +224)/9 = 900/9 =100,\n\nThen D*(26/3) = -9*(26/3)= -78,\n\nE*(4\u221a14/3),\n\nSo altogether:\n\n100 -78 + (4\u221a14/3)E =0,\n\nSo 22 + (4\u221a14/3)E =0,\n\n=> (4\u221a14/3)E = -22,\n\n=> E= (-22 *3)/(4\u221a14)= (-66)/(4\u221a14)= (-33)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing denominator: (-33\u221a14)/(2*14)= (-33\u221a14)/28.\n\nHmm, so the equation of the circle is:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + Ey =0, with E= -33\u221a14/(28).\n\nWait, actually, plugging back in:\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me recast:\n\nWait, the equation after plugging in A:\n\n(26/3)^2 + (4\u221a14/3)^2 + D*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) =0,\n\nWe had D=-9, so:\n\n(676/9 + 224/9) + (-9)*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3)=0,\n\nTotal of first two terms: 900/9 =100,\n\nThen -9*(26/3)= -78,\n\nSo 100 -78 + (4\u221a14/3)E =0,\n\nSo 22 + (4\u221a14/3)E =0,\n\nThus, solving for E: (4\u221a14/3)E = -22,\n\nSo E= (-22 *3)/(4\u221a14)= (-66)/(4\u221a14)= (-33)/(2\u221a14).\n\nYes, so E is that. So the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + [ (-33)/(2\u221a14) ] y =0.\n\nHmm, that might be a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the circumcircle using another method, like finding the perpendicular bisectors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute the circumradius? Wait, but perhaps it's better to find the equations of the tangents at B and C.\n\nAlternatively, the tangent at point (x0,y0) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is given by:\n\nxx0 + yy0 + D*(x + x0)/2 + E*(y + y0)/2 + F =0. Wait, is that right? Wait, perhaps better to recall that the tangent at point (x0,y0) is:\n\nxx1 + yy1 + D*(x +x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F =0, where (x1,y1) is the point?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for tangent lines. Alternatively, the tangent at point B (9,0):\n\nSince the circle passes through B(9,0), the tangent at B can be found by using the derivative or using the fact that it's perpendicular to the radius.\n\nThe center of the circle is at ( -D/2, -E/2 ). From the equation above, D=-9, E= (-33)/(2\u221a14). Wait, so center coordinates are ( -D/2, -E/2 ) = ( 9/2, (33)/(4\u221a14) ).\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, let me compute the center (h,k):\n\nThe general equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + Ey =0,\n\nSo center is (9/2, -E/2). Since E is (-33\u221a14)/(28), so:\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nThe standard form of circle equation is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2,\n\nExpanding gives x\u00b2 - 2hx + h\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2ky + k\u00b2 = r\u00b2,\n\nComparing with x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0,\n\nWe have D = -2h, E = -2k, F = h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 - r\u00b2.\n\nThus, in our case,\n\nD = -9 = -2h => h = 9/2,\n\nE = (-33\u221a14)/(28) = -2k => k = (33\u221a14)/(56),\n\nWait, no, let's recast:\n\nWait, in our equation, E is the coefficient of y, so from the standard equation, E = -2k,\n\nTherefore, k = -E/2.\n\nWait, in our case, E was found as (-33\u221a14)/(28). Therefore,\n\nk = - [ (-33\u221a14)/(28) ] /2 = (33\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo the center is at (h,k) = (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56).\n\nHmm, complicated coordinates, but okay.\n\nNow, the tangent at point B (9,0):\n\nThe tangent line at B is perpendicular to the radius OB, where O is the center (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56).\n\nSo the slope of OB is [ ( (33\u221a14)/56 - 0 ) / (9/2 -9) ].\n\nWait, let's compute coordinates:\n\nCoordinates of O: (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56),\n\nCoordinates of B: (9,0),\n\nSo the vector from O to B is (9 - 9/2, 0 - (33\u221a14)/56 ) = (9/2, - (33\u221a14)/56 ).\n\nThus, the slope of OB is [ - (33\u221a14)/56 ] / (9/2 ) = [ -33\u221a14 /56 ] / (9/2 ) = (-33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (-33\u221a14 *2)/(56*9) = (-66\u221a14)/(504) = (-11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to this, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: (84)/(11\u221a14).\n\nSimplify: 84/(11\u221a14) = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (6\u221a14)/11. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, reciprocal of (-11\u221a14)/84 is 84/(11\u221a14), so slope is positive 84/(11\u221a14). To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\n84\u221a14/(11*14) = (84/14)*(\u221a14)/11 = 6\u221a14/11. Yes, so slope is 6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at B has slope 6\u221a14/11, and passes through B(9,0). So its equation is:\n\ny -0 = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9).\n\nSimilarly, tangent at point C (0,0). Wait, point C is (0,0). Let me compute the tangent at C.\n\nFirst, the radius OC is from center O(9/2, (33\u221a14)/56 ) to point C(0,0). The slope of OC is [ ( (33\u221a14)/56 - 0 ) / (9/2 -0) ] = (33\u221a14)/56 divided by 9/2 = (33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (66\u221a14)/(504) = (11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: -84/(11\u221a14). Rationalizing similarly:\n\n-84/(11\u221a14) = -84\u221a14/(11*14) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C has slope -6\u221a14/11 and passes through C(0,0), so its equation is y = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nNow, point D is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) Tangent at B: y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9)\n\n2) Tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nSet them equal:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14) to eliminate coefficients:\n\n(x -9) = -x\n\nThus, x -9 = -x => 2x =9 => x= 9/2.\n\nThen plug back into equation 2 to find y:\n\ny= (-6\u221a14/11)(9/2)= (-6*9\u221a14)/(22)= (-54\u221a14)/22 = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nHmm, okay. Now, need to find point P, which is the second intersection of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, let's find the parametric equation of line AD. Points A and D are known.\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3)\n\nCoordinates of D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11)\n\nLet me write them as fractions to make calculations easier.\n\nFirst, convert 9/2 to thirds: 9/2 = 27/6, but maybe better to keep as fractions.\n\nLet me parametrize the line AD. Let parameter t go from 0 to 1 for A to D, but since we need to go beyond D to find P, perhaps use a different parameter.\n\nAlternatively, write the parametric equations:\n\nLet vector AD be D - A = (9/2 -26/3, -27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3 )\n\nCompute the differences:\n\nx-coordinate: 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6)= (-25/6 )\n\ny-coordinate: -27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3 = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3 ) = \u221a14*(- (81 +44)/33 ) = \u221a14*(-125/33 )\n\nSo the direction vector of AD is (-25/6, -125\u221a14/33 )\n\nThus, parametric equations for line AD can be written as:\n\nx = 26/3 + (-25/6)*t,\n\ny = (4\u221a14)/3 + (-125\u221a14/33)*t,\n\nwhere t=0 corresponds to A, and t=1 corresponds to D.\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of this line with the circle \u03c9. Since A is already on the circle, we can substitute the parametric equations into the circle equation and solve for t \u22600.\n\nFirst, let me write the circle equation again. Earlier, we had the equation as x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + Ey =0, with E= (-33\u221a14)/(28). Wait, let me confirm.\n\nWait, previously, we had E= (-33\u221a14)/(28). Let me check that again.\n\nWait, in the calculation earlier:\n\nWe had point A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3). Plugging into equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + Ey =0,\n\nSo (26/3)^2 + (4\u221a14/3)^2 -9*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3)=0,\n\nWhich was 676/9 + 224/9 - 234/3 + (4\u221a14/3)E =0,\n\nWait, 676 +224 is 900, so 900/9 =100,\n\nThen -9*(26/3)= -78,\n\nSo 100 -78 + (4\u221a14/3)E =0,\n\nThus, 22 + (4\u221a14/3)E=0,\n\nSo E= (-22*3)/(4\u221a14)= (-66)/(4\u221a14)= (-33)/(2\u221a14),\n\nWhich rationalizes to (-33\u221a14)/28, yes. So E= -33\u221a14/28.\n\nTherefore, the circle equation is:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + (-33\u221a14/28)y =0.\n\nSo substituting the parametric equations into this.\n\nLet me denote the parametric coordinates as:\n\nx(t) = 26/3 - (25/6)t,\n\ny(t) = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t.\n\nNow, plug into the circle equation:\n\n[x(t)]\u00b2 + [y(t)]\u00b2 -9x(t) + (-33\u221a14/28)[y(t)] =0.\n\nThis will result in a quadratic equation in t, and since t=0 is a solution (point A), the other solution will correspond to point P. Let's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute [x(t)]\u00b2:\n\nLet me compute x(t):\n\nx(t) = 26/3 - (25/6)t = (52/6 -25t/6) = (52 -25t)/6.\n\nTherefore, [x(t)]\u00b2 = (52 -25t)^2 / 36.\n\nSimilarly, y(t):\n\ny(t) = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t = \u221a14 [4/3 - (125/33)t].\n\nSo [y(t)]\u00b2 = 14*(4/3 - (125t)/33)^2.\n\nSimilarly, the other terms:\n\n-9x(t) = -9*(52 -25t)/6 = - (9/6)(52 -25t) = - (3/2)(52 -25t).\n\nThen, (-33\u221a14/28)*y(t) = (-33\u221a14/28)*\u221a14[4/3 - (125t)/33] = (-33*14/28)[4/3 - (125t)/33].\n\nSimplify that term:\n\nFirst, \u221a14 * \u221a14 =14,\n\nSo (-33\u221a14/28)*(\u221a14 y_part) becomes (-33*14)/28 multiplied by the bracket.\n\nThus:\n\n- (33*14)/(28) * [4/3 - (125t)/33] = - ( (33*14)/28 )*(4/3) + ( (33*14)/28 )*(125t/33 )\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: - (33*14*4)/(28*3) = - (33*4*14)/(84) = - (33*4*14)/(84). Since 14/84=1/6, so 4*(1/6)*33 = (4/6)*33 = (2/3)*33 =22. So first term is -22.\n\nSecond term: + (33*14*125t)/(28*33) = (14*125t)/(28) = (125t)/2.\n\nTherefore, the entire term (-33\u221a14/28)*y(t) simplifies to -22 + (125t)/2.\n\nPutting all together, the equation becomes:\n\n[x(t)]\u00b2 + [y(t)]\u00b2 -9x(t) + (-33\u221a14/28)*y(t) =0,\n\nSubstituting all the parts:\n\n[ (52 -25t)^2 /36 ] + [14*(4/3 - (125t)/33)^2 ] + [ - (3/2)(52 -25t) ] + [ -22 + (125t)/2 ] =0.\n\nThis is going to be very complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps instead of parametrizing, use the Power of a Point.\n\nEarlier, I thought of Power of Point D: DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Since DA is the distance from D to A, DP is the distance from D to P, so if I can compute DA, then DP = DB\u00b2 / DA, so AP = AD - DP? Wait, but need to be careful with the direction.\n\nWait, let me clarify the Power of a Point formula again.\n\nPower of D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 (since tangent squared) and also equal to DA * DP, where DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P along the line DA extended beyond A? Wait, actually, since P is the second intersection point, the Power of a Point formula states that for a point outside the circle, the power is equal to the product of the lengths from the point to each intersection point along a secant line. Since D is outside, and line DP intersects the circle at A and P, then the Power is DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Wait, but the Power of a Point formula is: if a line through D intersects the circle at two points X and Y, then DX * DY = power. Here, the line is AD, so the two points are A and P. Since D is outside, then DA * DP = DB\u00b2. However, DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. But if P is on the other side of A from D, then DA and DP would have different signs? Hmm, perhaps in terms of directed lengths, but since we are dealing with magnitudes, it's better to think of absolute values. Wait, actually, in Power of a Point, the formula is signed if using directed lengths, but if using magnitudes, it's DA * DP = DB\u00b2, where DA and DP are lengths along the line. But since D is outside, and the line passes through A (on the circle) and goes to P, which must be on the other side of the circle from D? Wait, maybe I need to think of the order. Let me see:\n\nIf D is outside, and the line DA passes through A (on the circle) and goes to D (outside), then the other intersection P must be between D and A? Wait, no, because starting at D, going towards A, you first hit P, then A? Wait, that can't be because A is on the circle. Wait, perhaps the points are arranged as D---P---A---? No, I need to be precise.\n\nWait, let me suppose that starting from D, the line goes through P first, then A. So the Power of a Point formula would be DP * DA = DB\u00b2. Since DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is from D to P, so if P is between D and A, then DA = DP + PA, so DP * (DP + PA) = DB\u00b2. But since we need AP, which is PA, perhaps it's better to denote variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote AP = x, and PD = y. Then DA = AP + PD = x + y. Wait, but depending on the order. If P is between A and D, then DA = AP + PD, so DA = AP + PD, so PD = DA - AP. Then Power of a Point gives DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Wait, DP would be the distance from D to P, which is DA - AP. Hmm, confusing.\n\nAlternatively, let me think in terms of coordinates. Since I have coordinates for A, D, and the circle equation, perhaps compute the parametric value t for point P, then compute AP.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to proceed with the Power of a Point approach. Let me compute DA and DB.\n\nFirst, compute DA: the distance between D(9/2, -27\u221a14/11) and A(26/3, 4\u221a14/3).\n\nCompute the differences:\n\n\u0394x = 26/3 -9/2 = (52/6 -27/6)=25/6,\n\n\u0394y = (4\u221a14/3) - (-27\u221a14/11)= 4\u221a14/3 +27\u221a14/11 = \u221a14*(4/3 +27/11)= \u221a14*( (44 +81)/33 )= \u221a14*(125/33).\n\nThus, DA = sqrt( (25/6)^2 + ( (125\u221a14)/33 )^2 )\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, (25/6)^2 = 625/36,\n\nSecond term: (125\u221a14 /33)^2 = (125^2)*(14)/(33^2) = (15625 *14)/1089 = 218750 /1089,\n\nTherefore, DA^2 = 625/36 + 218750/1089.\n\nTo add these, find a common denominator, which is 36*1089= 39196? Wait, 36 and 1089: 1089 is 33\u00b2= 1089, 36 is 6\u00b2. Let me compute LCM(36,1089). Factor 36=4*9, 1089= 9*121. So LCM is 4*9*121= 4*1089= 4356.\n\nThus,\n\n625/36 = (625 * 121)/4356,\n\n218750/1089 = (218750 *4)/4356,\n\nCompute numerators:\n\n625*121: 625*120=75,000, plus 625=75,625,\n\n218,750 *4 = 875,000,\n\nThus total numerator:75,625 +875,000 = 950,625,\n\nThus DA^2 =950,625 /4356,\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n950,625 \u00f73= 316,875,\n\n4356 \u00f73=1452,\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n316,875 \u00f73=105,625,\n\n1452 \u00f73=484,\n\nNow, 105,625 and 484: check GCD(105625,484). 484=4*121=4*11\u00b2. 105625 divided by 11: 11*9602.27\u2026 Not integer. Let me check:\n\n105625 \u00f7 4 = 26406.25, so not divisible by 4. So GCD is 1? Hmm, perhaps. So DA^2 =105625 /484,\n\nThus DA = sqrt(105625 /484)= (sqrt(105625))/sqrt(484)= 325 /22. Because sqrt(105625)=325, sqrt(484)=22. Therefore DA=325/22.\n\nWait, let me confirm sqrt(105625):\n\n325\u00b2 = (300 +25)^2 = 300\u00b2 +2*300*25 +25\u00b2=90,000 +15,000 +625=105,625. Yes. So DA=325/22.\n\nOkay, that's a relief.\n\nNow compute DB\u00b2. Since D is (9/2, -27\u221a14/11) and B is (9,0).\n\nCompute \u0394x =9 -9/2 =9/2,\n\n\u0394y=0 - (-27\u221a14/11)=27\u221a14/11,\n\nThus, DB\u00b2= (9/2)^2 + (27\u221a14/11)^2,\n\nCompute:\n\n(81/4) + ( (27^2)*(14) )/(11\u00b2),\n\n27\u00b2=729,\n\nSo,\n\n81/4 + (729*14)/121 = 81/4 + 10,206/121.\n\nAgain, common denominator. LCM(4,121)=484.\n\nConvert fractions:\n\n81/4 = (81*121)/484 = 9801/484,\n\n10,206/121 = (10,206 *4)/484 =40,824 /484,\n\nThus total DB\u00b2 = (9801 +40,824)/484 =50,625 /484.\n\nTherefore DB\u00b2=50625/484.\n\nTherefore, from Power of a Point:\n\nDA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nWe have DA=325/22, so DP= (DB\u00b2)/DA = (50625/484)/(325/22)= (50625/484)*(22/325)=\n\nSimplify:\n\n50625 divided by 325: Let's see, 325*156=50,700, which is 75 more, so 50,625=325*156 -75. Hmm, maybe factor numerator and denominator:\n\n50625 = 225 * 225? Wait 225\u00b2=50,625. Yes, 225\u00b2=50,625. So 50625=225\u00b2,\n\n325=25*13,\n\n484=22\u00b2,\n\n22=2*11,\n\nSo,\n\n(225\u00b2 /22\u00b2) * (22/(25*13)) = (225\u00b2 *22)/(22\u00b2 *25*13)= (225\u00b2)/(22*25*13)\n\nWait, let me write all factors:\n\n50625 =225\u00b2 = (15\u00b2)^2 =15^4,\n\nBut perhaps better:\n\nLet me compute numerator:50625 *22,\n\nDenominator:484*325,\n\nWait:\n\nWait, the expression is (50625 *22)/(484 *325),\n\nLet me factor each term:\n\n50625 = 225\u00b2 = (15\u00b2)^2 = 15^4 = (3*5)^4 =3^4 *5^4,\n\n22=2*11,\n\n484=22\u00b2= (2*11)^2=2\u00b2*11\u00b2,\n\n325=25*13=5\u00b2*13,\n\nSo putting together:\n\nNumerator:3^4 *5^4 *2*11,\n\nDenominator:2\u00b2 *11\u00b2 *5\u00b2 *13,\n\nThus,\n\nCancel terms:\n\n3^4 remains,\n\n5^(4-2)=5\u00b2,\n\n2^(1-2)=2^(-1),\n\n11^(1-2)=11^(-1),\n\nand denominator has 13.\n\nThus,\n\nOverall: (3^4 *5\u00b2)/(2*11*13) ) * (1/ (2^(-1) ? Wait, maybe better to do step by step:\n\nNumerator: 3^4 *5^4 *2*11,\n\nDenominator:2\u00b2 *11\u00b2 *5\u00b2 *13,\n\nSo,\n\n3^4 /1,\n\n5^4 /5\u00b2 =5\u00b2,\n\n2/2\u00b2 =1/2,\n\n11/11\u00b2=1/11,\n\nand denominator has 13,\n\nThus overall:\n\n(3^4 *5\u00b2)/(2 *11 *13).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n3^4=81,\n\n5\u00b2=25,\n\n81*25=2025,\n\nDenominator:2*11*13=286,\n\nThus DP=2025/286.\n\nWait, so DP=2025/286?\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again:\n\nOriginal expression: (50625/484) divided by (325/22) is (50625/484)*(22/325).\n\nYes, so 50625 *22 / (484 *325).\n\nBreaking down:\n\n50625 divided by 325: 50625 /325 = (50625 \u00f725)/(325 \u00f725)=2025/13.\n\nThen, 22/484 =22/(22*22)=1/22.\n\nThus overall: (2025/13)*(1/22)=2025/(13*22)=2025/286. Yes, so DP=2025/286.\n\nTherefore, from Power of a Point, DP=2025/286.\n\nNow, we need to find AP. Since AP is the distance from A to P along the line AD. Since D is outside, and the points are arranged as A---P---D or D---P---A? Wait, need to figure out the order.\n\nSince DA is the distance from D to A, which is 325/22 \u224814.77,\n\nDP is the distance from D to P, which is 2025/286 \u22487.08,\n\nWait, so if DP is less than DA, then P is between D and A?\n\nWait, but that would mean that going from D towards A, you reach P first, then A. So the order is D-P-A, so AP = DA - DP = (325/22) - (2025/286).\n\nCompute that:\n\nConvert to common denominator 286:\n\n325/22 = (325 *13)/286=4225/286,\n\n2025/286 is as is,\n\nThus AP =4225/286 -2025/286 = (4225 -2025)/286 =2200/286.\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: 1100/143,\n\nCheck if 1100 and 143 have common factors. 143=11*13, 1100 \u00f711=100. So 1100=11*100, 143=11*13,\n\nThus, divide numerator and denominator by 11: 100/13.\n\nTherefore AP=100/13.\n\nHence m=100, n=13, which are coprime. Thus m +n=113.\n\nWait, so the answer is 113?\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again.\n\nWait, AP is DA - DP only if P is between D and A. But let me think: since DA is 325/22\u224814.77, DP is 2025/286\u22487.08, so DP < DA, so P is between D and A, so AP = DA - DP, yes, which gives 100/13\u22487.69.\n\nAlternatively, if the points were in another order, but given the Power of a Point formula, DA * DP = DB\u00b2, where DA and DP are lengths from D to A and D to P. Since D is outside, the points must be arranged so that P is between D and A, so that DA * DP = DA * (DA - AP) = DA\u00b2 - DA*AP. Wait, but according to the formula, DA * DP=DB\u00b2,\n\nWait, perhaps my confusion arises from direction.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let AP = x,\n\nThen DP = DA + AP? Wait, no, if P is beyond A from D, then DP would be DA + AP,\n\nBut in that case, Power of a Point would be DA*(DA + AP)=DB\u00b2,\n\nBut in our case, DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nIf DP is the distance from D to P, if P is between D and A, then DP = DA - AP,\n\nSo DA*(DA - AP)= DB\u00b2,\n\nHence, DA^2 - DA*AP = DB^2,\n\nTherefore, AP = (DA^2 - DB^2)/DA,\n\nAlternatively, AP = DA - (DB^2)/DA,\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWe have DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nSo DP = DB\u00b2 / DA,\n\nAP = DA - DP = DA - (DB\u00b2 / DA) = (DA\u00b2 - DB\u00b2)/DA,\n\nTherefore, compute that:\n\nDA squared is (325/22)^2,\n\nDB squared is 50625/484,\n\nWait, let me compute DA\u00b2 - DB\u00b2:\n\n(325/22)^2 - (50625/484)= (325\u00b2 -50625)/22\u00b2,\n\nWait, 325\u00b2 is 105,625,\n\nSo 105,625 -50,625 =55,000,\n\nThus DA\u00b2 - DB\u00b2 =55,000 / (22\u00b2),\n\nThus AP = (55,000 / 484 ) / (325/22)= (55,000 /484)*(22/325)=,\n\n55,000 divided by 325: 55,000 /325 = 55,000 \u00f7 25= 2,200; 2,200 /13 \u2248169.23,\n\nBut let me factor:\n\n55,000=55*1000=5*11*1000,\n\n484=4*121=4*11\u00b2,\n\n22=2*11,\n\n325=25*13,\n\nThus,\n\n(55,000 *22)/(484 *325)= (5*11*1000 *2*11)/(4*11\u00b2 *25*13)=,\n\nCancel terms:\n\n5 cancels with 25 (leaves 5 in denominator),\n\n11 in numerator cancels with 11 in denominator,\n\n1000 /4=250,\n\nSo:\n\n(2*11*5*250)/(11*13)= (2*5*250)/13= (2500)/13,\n\nWait, let me track again:\n\nWait,\n\n55,000 = 5*11*1000,\n\n22=2*11,\n\nDenominator:484=4*11\u00b2, 325=25*13,\n\nSo,\n\nNumerator:5*11*1000 *2*11,\n\nDenominator:4*11\u00b2 *25*13,\n\nSo,\n\nCancel 11\u00b2 in numerator and denominator,\n\nCancel 5 in numerator (from 5) with 25 (5\u00b2) in denominator: leaves 5 in denominator,\n\nCancel 4 in denominator with 2*2 in numerator (from 2*1000?

Wait, but I thought it was 100/13 earlier. Hmm, conflicting results. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me recast:\n\nWait, AP = (DA\u00b2 - DB\u00b2)/DA,\n\nDA squared is (325/22)^2 = 105625/484,\n\nDB squared is 50625/484,\n\nSo DA\u00b2 - DB\u00b2 = (105625 -50625)/484 =55,000 /484,\n\nThen AP = (55,000 /484 ) divided by (325/22)= (55,000 /484)*(22/325)=,\n\n55,000 *22 = 1,210,000,\n\n484 *325= 157,300,\n\nSo 1,210,000 /157,300,\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100: 12,100 /1,573,\n\nHmm, 12,100 \u00f713 = 930.7\u2026 Wait, perhaps factor numerator and denominator:\n\n12,100 = 100*121 =100*11\u00b2,\n\n1,573: Let's see if divisible by 11: 1,573 \u00f711=143, which is 11*13. So 1,573=11*143=11*11*13=11\u00b2*13,\n\nThus,\n\n12,100 /1,573 = (100*11\u00b2)/(11\u00b2*13)=100/13,\n\nAh, so AP=100/13. Okay, so that's correct. So my initial calculation was right. The second approach also gives 100/13. So the error was in the intermediate step where I miscalculated the factors.\n\nTherefore, AP=100/13, so m=100, n=13, which are coprime. Thus, m +n=113.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 113.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{113}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and AD intersects \u03c9 again at P. The sides are given as AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The answer should be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Alright, let's start thinking.\n\nFirst, since ABC is inscribed in a circle, it's a cyclic triangle. The tangents from D to the circle at B and C mean that D is the exsymmedian point or something? Wait, maybe it's related to the symmedian. Hmm, tangents from a single point to a circle are equal in length, so DB = DC. Wait, no, actually, the two tangent segments from a single external point to a circle are equal. So, DB and DC are both tangents from D to the circle, so DB = DC. That might be important.\n\nI remember that in such configurations, there's a relation involving the power of point D with respect to the circle. The power of D is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP, since AD is a secant line. Wait, yes, power of a point says that if a line through D intersects the circle at A and P, then DA * DP = DB\u00b2. So that equation might be useful here. If I can find DA and DP, but I need to relate them somehow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use coordinates or trigonometry? Hmm, perhaps coordinate geometry could work, but the sides are given as 5, 9, 10, so maybe using the Law of Cosines first to find angles?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use inversion? Hmm, maybe overcomplicating. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall that in a triangle, the symmedian point is the intersection of the symmedians, which are reflections of the medians over the angle bisectors. But here, point D is where the tangents at B and C meet. The tangents at B and C would be related to the symmedian? Maybe the point D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC? Wait, actually, the intersection point of the tangents at B and C is the symmedian point? Wait, no, the symmedian point is the intersection of the reflections of the medians over the angle bisectors. But the tangents from D to the circle would be related to the symmedian. Alternatively, maybe D is the exsymmedian point?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using harmonic division or projective geometry concepts. Hmm, maybe too much. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, since we have lengths of sides, maybe use coordinates. Let me try to set up coordinate system. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point B at (9,0), since BC is 9. Wait, but AC is 10, AB is 5. Wait, maybe that's not the best. Alternatively, let me place points in coordinate system such that calculations are easier.\n\nAlternatively, use barycentric coordinates? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, use the Power of a Point theorem. Since D is outside the circle, power of D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. So, if I can compute DA and DP, but since DA * DP = DB\u00b2, then AP = DP - DA? Wait, no. Wait, AP is from A to P, so if AD is going from A to D, then the points are A, then P, then D? Wait, no. The line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then intersects the circle again at P? Wait, hold on. The problem says \"AD intersects \u03c9 at P\", so starting at A, going through D, and then P is another intersection point. Wait, but since D is outside the circle, the line AD would start at A (on the circle), go through D (outside), so P must be the other intersection point, which would be between A and D? Wait, no. Wait, if you have a secant starting inside the circle, going out, but A is on the circle, so AD starts at A (on the circle), goes through D (outside), so the other intersection point P must be on the extension beyond D? Wait, no, that would mean that the line AD passes through A, goes through D, and then P would be the other intersection with the circle? Wait, but since D is outside, the line AD starts at A, exits the circle, goes to D, and then if extended beyond D, it might not come back. Wait, perhaps I misread. The problem says \"AD intersect \u03c9 at P\". Since A is already on \u03c9, so the other intersection point is P, so P is the second point where AD meets \u03c9. So the order is A---P---D, so AP is from A to P, then PD is from P to D. Therefore, the Power of a Point theorem says that DA * DP = DB\u00b2. So DA is the entire length from D to A, and DP is from D to P, so DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Wait, but DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P? Wait, actually, the Power of a Point formula is: if a line through D intersects the circle at X and Y, then DX * DY = DB\u00b2. Here, the line is AD, which passes through A (on the circle) and P (the other intersection point). So, the Power of a Point gives DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Wait, but in terms of signed lengths? Hmm, perhaps in terms of lengths, we can write DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Since DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. But since P is on the extension beyond A? Wait, no, hold on.\n\nWait, if A is on the circle, and the line AD starts at A and goes through D, then the other intersection point P must be between A and D? Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me visualize: the circle \u03c9 has point A on it. The tangent at B and tangent at C meet at D, which is outside the circle. Then the line AD starts at A, goes through D, which is outside, so the other intersection with the circle must be on the other side of A from D? Wait, no. If you start at A, go towards D (outside), then the line AD would exit the circle at A, so the other intersection point P must be on the other side of A from D? Wait, that can't be. Wait, actually, if you have a line starting at A (on the circle) and going outward to D (outside), then the only other intersection with the circle would be on the opposite side of A from D. Wait, but then the line AD would pass through A, go towards D, but the other intersection is P, which would be on the opposite side. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe it's better to formalize:\n\nLet me denote the points: A is on \u03c9. The line AD starts at A, goes through D, which is outside \u03c9, so the other intersection point P must be between A and D? Wait, if you go from A towards D, you exit the circle, so there's no other intersection unless you go the other way. Wait, perhaps P is on the other side of A from D? That is, AP is a chord passing through D? Hmm, maybe the problem states that AD intersects \u03c9 again at P, so starting at A, going along AD, the next intersection with \u03c9 is P. So if D is on the extension beyond P from A, then P is between A and D. Wait, but since D is the external point, the line AD must pass through A, go out to D, but since D is outside, then the other intersection P must be between A and D? Wait, but then if P is between A and D, then AP is part of AD, so AP would be shorter than AD. But the problem says \"AP can be written as...\", so maybe that's okay.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to draw a diagram mentally. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place the triangle in coordinate plane.\n\nLet me set point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0), since BC is 9. Then point A is somewhere such that AC=10 and AB=5. Let me find coordinates of point A.\n\nLet\u2019s denote coordinates: Let\u2019s let C=(0,0), B=(9,0). Let A=(x,y). Then AC=10, so sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=10, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100. AB=5, so distance from A to B is 5: sqrt( (x-9)^2 + y^2 ) = 5, so (x-9)^2 + y^2 =25.\n\nSubtract the two equations: (x-9)^2 + y^2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =25 - 100 => x\u00b2 -18x +81 + y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -75 => -18x +81 = -75 => -18x = -156 => x=156/18 = 26/3 \u22488.666...\n\nThen x=26/3. Then y\u00b2 =100 -x\u00b2 =100 - (676/9)= (900 -676)/9=224/9, so y=\u00b1\u221a(224/9)=\u00b1(\u221a224)/3=\u00b1(4\u221a14)/3. Hmm, okay. Let's take y positive, so A is (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3).\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nA: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3)\n\nB: (9,0)\n\nC: (0,0)\n\nNow, need to find the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9. The point D is the intersection of these two tangents.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC. Since we have coordinates for A, B, C, we can compute it.\n\nLet me recall the general equation of a circle: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nPlugging in points:\n\nFor point C (0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 + F =0 => F=0.\n\nFor point B (9,0): 81 +0 +9D +0 +0=0 =>9D = -81 => D= -9.\n\nFor point A (26/3,4\u221a14/3):\n\n(26/3)^2 + (4\u221a14/3)^2 + D*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) + F =0.\n\nSince F=0 and D=-9:\n\nCompute (26/3)^2 = (676)/9,\n\n(4\u221a14/3)^2 = (16*14)/9 = 224/9,\n\nSo total first two terms: (676 +224)/9 = 900/9 =100,\n\nThen D*(26/3) = -9*(26/3)= -78,\n\nE*(4\u221a14/3),\n\nSo altogether:\n\n100 -78 + (4\u221a14/3)E =0,\n\nSo 22 + (4\u221a14/3)E =0,\n\n=> (4\u221a14/3)E = -22,\n\n=> E= (-22 *3)/(4\u221a14)= (-66)/(4\u221a14)= (-33)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing denominator: (-33\u221a14)/(2*14)= (-33\u221a14)/28.\n\nHmm, so the equation of the circle is:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + Ey =0, with E= -33\u221a14/(28).\n\nWait, actually, plugging back in:\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me recast:\n\nWait, the equation after plugging in A:\n\n(26/3)^2 + (4\u221a14/3)^2 + D*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) =0,\n\nWe had D=-9, so:\n\n(676/9 + 224/9) + (-9)*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3)=0,\n\nTotal of first two terms: 900/9 =100,\n\nThen -9*(26/3)= -78,\n\nSo 100 -78 + (4\u221a14/3)E =0,\n\nSo 22 + (4\u221a14/3)E =0,\n\nThus, solving for E: (4\u221a14/3)E = -22,\n\nSo E= (-22 *3)/(4\u221a14)= (-66)/(4\u221a14)= (-33)/(2\u221a14).\n\nYes, so E is that. So the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + [ (-33)/(2\u221a14) ] y =0.\n\nHmm, that might be a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the circumcircle using another method, like finding the perpendicular bisectors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute the circumradius? Wait, but perhaps it's better to find the equations of the tangents at B and C.\n\nAlternatively, the tangent at point (x0,y0) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is given by:\n\nxx0 + yy0 + D*(x + x0)/2 + E*(y + y0)/2 + F =0. Wait, is that right? Wait, perhaps better to recall that the tangent at point (x0,y0) is:\n\nxx1 + yy1 + D*(x +x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F =0, where (x1,y1) is the point?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for tangent lines. Alternatively, the tangent at point B (9,0):\n\nSince the circle passes through B(9,0), the tangent at B can be found by using the derivative or using the fact that it's perpendicular to the radius.\n\nThe center of the circle is at ( -D/2, -E/2 ). From the equation above, D=-9, E= (-33)/(2\u221a14). Wait, so center coordinates are ( -D/2, -E/2 ) = ( 9/2, (33)/(4\u221a14) ).\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, let me compute the center (h,k):\n\nThe general equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + Ey =0,\n\nSo center is (9/2, -E/2). Since E is (-33\u221a14)/(28), so:\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nThe standard form of circle equation is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2,\n\nExpanding gives x\u00b2 - 2hx + h\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2ky + k\u00b2 = r\u00b2,\n\nComparing with x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0,\n\nWe have D = -2h, E = -2k, F = h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 - r\u00b2.\n\nThus, in our case,\n\nD = -9 = -2h => h = 9/2,\n\nE = (-33\u221a14)/(28) = -2k => k = (33\u221a14)/(56),\n\nWait, no, let's recast:\n\nWait, in our equation, E is the coefficient of y, so from the standard equation, E = -2k,\n\nTherefore, k = -E/2.\n\nWait, in our case, E was found as (-33\u221a14)/(28). Therefore,\n\nk = - [ (-33\u221a14)/(28) ] /2 = (33\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo the center is at (h,k) = (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56).\n\nHmm, complicated coordinates, but okay.\n\nNow, the tangent at point B (9,0):\n\nThe tangent line at B is perpendicular to the radius OB, where O is the center (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56).\n\nSo the slope of OB is [ ( (33\u221a14)/56 - 0 ) / (9/2 -9) ].\n\nWait, let's compute coordinates:\n\nCoordinates of O: (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56),\n\nCoordinates of B: (9,0),\n\nSo the vector from O to B is (9 - 9/2, 0 - (33\u221a14)/56 ) = (9/2, - (33\u221a14)/56 ).\n\nThus, the slope of OB is [ - (33\u221a14)/56 ] / (9/2 ) = [ -33\u221a14 /56 ] / (9/2 ) = (-33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (-33\u221a14 *2)/(56*9) = (-66\u221a14)/(504) = (-11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to this, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: (84)/(11\u221a14).\n\nSimplify: 84/(11\u221a14) = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (6\u221a14)/11. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, reciprocal of (-11\u221a14)/84 is 84/(11\u221a14), so slope is positive 84/(11\u221a14). To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\n84\u221a14/(11*14) = (84/14)*(\u221a14)/11 = 6\u221a14/11. Yes, so slope is 6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at B has slope 6\u221a14/11, and passes through B(9,0). So its equation is:\n\ny -0 = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9).\n\nSimilarly, tangent at point C (0,0). Wait, point C is (0,0). Let me compute the tangent at C.\n\nFirst, the radius OC is from center O(9/2, (33\u221a14)/56 ) to point C(0,0). The slope of OC is [ ( (33\u221a14)/56 - 0 ) / (9/2 -0) ] = (33\u221a14)/56 divided by 9/2 = (33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (66\u221a14)/(504) = (11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: -84/(11\u221a14). Rationalizing similarly:\n\n-84/(11\u221a14) = -84\u221a14/(11*14) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C has slope -6\u221a14/11 and passes through C(0,0), so its equation is y = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nNow, point D is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) Tangent at B: y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9)\n\n2) Tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nSet them equal:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14) to eliminate coefficients:\n\n(x -9) = -x\n\nThus, x -9 = -x => 2x =9 => x= 9/2.\n\nThen plug back into equation 2 to find y:\n\ny= (-6\u221a14/11)(9/2)= (-6*9\u221a14)/(22)= (-54\u221a14)/22 = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nHmm, okay. Now, need to find point P, which is the second intersection of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, let's find the parametric equation of line AD. Points A and D are known.\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3)\n\nCoordinates of D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11)\n\nLet me write them as fractions to make calculations easier.\n\nFirst, convert 9/2 to thirds: 9/2 = 27/6, but maybe better to keep as fractions.\n\nLet me parametrize the line AD. Let parameter t go from 0 to 1 for A to D, but since we need to go beyond D to find P, perhaps use a different parameter.\n\nAlternatively, write the parametric equations:\n\nLet vector AD be D - A = (9/2 -26/3, -27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3 )\n\nCompute the differences:\n\nx-coordinate: 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6)= (-25/6 )\n\ny-coordinate: -27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3 = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3 ) = \u221a14*(- (81 +44)/33 ) = \u221a14*(-125/33 )\n\nSo the direction vector of AD is (-25/6, -125\u221a14/33 )\n\nThus, parametric equations for line AD can be written as:\n\nx = 26/3 + (-25/6)*t,\n\ny = (4\u221a14)/3 + (-125\u221a14/33)*t,\n\nwhere t=0 corresponds to A, and t=1 corresponds to D.\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of this line with the circle \u03c9. Since A is already on the circle, we can substitute the parametric equations into the circle equation and solve for t \u22600.\n\nFirst, let me write the circle equation again. Earlier, we had the equation as x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + Ey =0, with E= (-33\u221a14)/(28). Wait, let me confirm.\n\nWait, previously, we had E= (-33\u221a14)/(28). Let me check that again.\n\nWait, in the calculation earlier:\n\nWe had point A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3). Plugging into equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + Ey =0,\n\nSo (26/3)^2 + (4\u221a14/3)^2 -9*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3)=0,\n\nWhich was 676/9 + 224/9 - 234/3 + (4\u221a14/3)E =0,\n\nWait, 676 +224 is 900, so 900/9 =100,\n\nThen -9*(26/3)= -78,\n\nSo 100 -78 + (4\u221a14/3)E =0,\n\nThus, 22 + (4\u221a14/3)E=0,\n\nSo E= (-22*3)/(4\u221a14)= (-66)/(4\u221a14)= (-33)/(2\u221a14),\n\nWhich rationalizes to (-33\u221a14)/28, yes. So E= -33\u221a14/28.\n\nTherefore, the circle equation is:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + (-33\u221a14/28)y =0.\n\nSo substituting the parametric equations into this.\n\nLet me denote the parametric coordinates as:\n\nx(t) = 26/3 - (25/6)t,\n\ny(t) = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t.\n\nNow, plug into the circle equation:\n\n[x(t)]\u00b2 + [y(t)]\u00b2 -9x(t) + (-33\u221a14/28)[y(t)] =0.\n\nThis will result in a quadratic equation in t, and since t=0 is a solution (point A), the other solution will correspond to point P. Let's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute [x(t)]\u00b2:\n\nLet me compute x(t):\n\nx(t) = 26/3 - (25/6)t = (52/6 -25t/6) = (52 -25t)/6.\n\nTherefore, [x(t)]\u00b2 = (52 -25t)^2 / 36.\n\nSimilarly, y(t):\n\ny(t) = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t = \u221a14 [4/3 - (125/33)t].\n\nSo [y(t)]\u00b2 = 14*(4/3 - (125t)/33)^2.\n\nSimilarly, the other terms:\n\n-9x(t) = -9*(52 -25t)/6 = - (9/6)(52 -25t) = - (3/2)(52 -25t).\n\nThen, (-33\u221a14/28)*y(t) = (-33\u221a14/28)*\u221a14[4/3 - (125t)/33] = (-33*14/28)[4/3 - (125t)/33].\n\nSimplify that term:\n\nFirst, \u221a14 * \u221a14 =14,\n\nSo (-33\u221a14/28)*(\u221a14 y_part) becomes (-33*14)/28 multiplied by the bracket.\n\nThus:\n\n- (33*14)/(28) * [4/3 - (125t)/33] = - ( (33*14)/28 )*(4/3) + ( (33*14)/28 )*(125t/33 )\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: - (33*14*4)/(28*3) = - (33*4*14)/(84) = - (33*4*14)/(84). Since 14/84=1/6, so 4*(1/6)*33 = (4/6)*33 = (2/3)*33 =22. So first term is -22.\n\nSecond term: + (33*14*125t)/(28*33) = (14*125t)/(28) = (125t)/2.\n\nTherefore, the entire term (-33\u221a14/28)*y(t) simplifies to -22 + (125t)/2.\n\nPutting all together, the equation becomes:\n\n[x(t)]\u00b2 + [y(t)]\u00b2 -9x(t) + (-33\u221a14/28)*y(t) =0,\n\nSubstituting all the parts:\n\n[ (52 -25t)^2 /36 ] + [14*(4/3 - (125t)/33)^2 ] + [ - (3/2)(52 -25t) ] + [ -22 + (125t)/2 ] =0.\n\nThis is going to be very complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps instead of parametrizing, use the Power of a Point.\n\nEarlier, I thought of Power of Point D: DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Since DA is the distance from D to A, DP is the distance from D to P, so if I can compute DA, then DP = DB\u00b2 / DA, so AP = AD - DP? Wait, but need to be careful with the direction.\n\nWait, let me clarify the Power of a Point formula again.\n\nPower of D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 (since tangent squared) and also equal to DA * DP, where DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P along the line DA extended beyond A? Wait, actually, since P is the second intersection point, the Power of a Point formula states that for a point outside the circle, the power is equal to the product of the lengths from the point to each intersection point along a secant line. Since D is outside, and line DP intersects the circle at A and P, then the Power is DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Wait, but the Power of a Point formula is: if a line through D intersects the circle at two points X and Y, then DX * DY = power. Here, the line is AD, so the two points are A and P. Since D is outside, then DA * DP = DB\u00b2. However, DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. But if P is on the other side of A from D, then DA and DP would have different signs? Hmm, perhaps in terms of directed lengths, but since we are dealing with magnitudes, it's better to think of absolute values. Wait, actually, in Power of a Point, the formula is signed if using directed lengths, but if using magnitudes, it's DA * DP = DB\u00b2, where DA and DP are lengths along the line. But since D is outside, and the line passes through A (on the circle) and goes to P, which must be on the other side of the circle from D? Wait, maybe I need to think of the order. Let me see:\n\nIf D is outside, and the line DA passes through A (on the circle) and goes to D (outside), then the other intersection P must be between D and A? Wait, no, because starting at D, going towards A, you first hit P, then A? Wait, that can't be because A is on the circle. Wait, perhaps the points are arranged as D---P---A---? No, I need to be precise.\n\nWait, let me suppose that starting from D, the line goes through P first, then A. So the Power of a Point formula would be DP * DA = DB\u00b2. Since DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is from D to P, so if P is between D and A, then DA = DP + PA, so DP * (DP + PA) = DB\u00b2. But since we need AP, which is PA, perhaps it's better to denote variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote AP = x, and PD = y. Then DA = AP + PD = x + y. Wait, but depending on the order. If P is between A and D, then DA = AP + PD, so DA = AP + PD, so PD = DA - AP. Then Power of a Point gives DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Wait, DP would be the distance from D to P, which is DA - AP. Hmm, confusing.\n\nAlternatively, let me think in terms of coordinates. Since I have coordinates for A, D, and the circle equation, perhaps compute the parametric value t for point P, then compute AP.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to proceed with the Power of a Point approach. Let me compute DA and DB.\n\nFirst, compute DA: the distance between D(9/2, -27\u221a14/11) and A(26/3, 4\u221a14/3).\n\nCompute the differences:\n\n\u0394x = 26/3 -9/2 = (52/6 -27/6)=25/6,\n\n\u0394y = (4\u221a14/3) - (-27\u221a14/11)= 4\u221a14/3 +27\u221a14/11 = \u221a14*(4/3 +27/11)= \u221a14*( (44 +81)/33 )= \u221a14*(125/33).\n\nThus, DA = sqrt( (25/6)^2 + ( (125\u221a14)/33 )^2 )\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, (25/6)^2 = 625/36,\n\nSecond term: (125\u221a14 /33)^2 = (125^2)*(14)/(33^2) = (15625 *14)/1089 = 218750 /1089,\n\nTherefore, DA^2 = 625/36 + 218750/1089.\n\nTo add these, find a common denominator, which is 36*1089= 39196? Wait, 36 and 1089: 1089 is 33\u00b2= 1089, 36 is 6\u00b2. Let me compute LCM(36,1089). Factor 36=4*9, 1089= 9*121. So LCM is 4*9*121= 4*1089= 4356.\n\nThus,\n\n625/36 = (625 * 121)/4356,\n\n218750/1089 = (218750 *4)/4356,\n\nCompute numerators:\n\n625*121: 625*120=75,000, plus 625=75,625,\n\n218,750 *4 = 875,000,\n\nThus total numerator:75,625 +875,000 = 950,625,\n\nThus DA^2 =950,625 /4356,\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n950,625 \u00f73= 316,875,\n\n4356 \u00f73=1452,\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n316,875 \u00f73=105,625,\n\n1452 \u00f73=484,\n\nNow, 105,625 and 484: check GCD(105625,484). 484=4*121=4*11\u00b2. 105625 divided by 11: 11*9602.27\u2026 Not integer. Let me check:\n\n105625 \u00f7 4 = 26406.25, so not divisible by 4. So GCD is 1? Hmm, perhaps. So DA^2 =105625 /484,\n\nThus DA = sqrt(105625 /484)= (sqrt(105625))/sqrt(484)= 325 /22. Because sqrt(105625)=325, sqrt(484)=22. Therefore DA=325/22.\n\nWait, let me confirm sqrt(105625):\n\n325\u00b2 = (300 +25)^2 = 300\u00b2 +2*300*25 +25\u00b2=90,000 +15,000 +625=105,625. Yes. So DA=325/22.\n\nOkay, that's a relief.\n\nNow compute DB\u00b2. Since D is (9/2, -27\u221a14/11) and B is (9,0).\n\nCompute \u0394x =9 -9/2 =9/2,\n\n\u0394y=0 - (-27\u221a14/11)=27\u221a14/11,\n\nThus, DB\u00b2= (9/2)^2 + (27\u221a14/11)^2,\n\nCompute:\n\n(81/4) + ( (27^2)*(14) )/(11\u00b2),\n\n27\u00b2=729,\n\nSo,\n\n81/4 + (729*14)/121 = 81/4 + 10,206/121.\n\nAgain, common denominator. LCM(4,121)=484.\n\nConvert fractions:\n\n81/4 = (81*121)/484 = 9801/484,\n\n10,206/121 = (10,206 *4)/484 =40,824 /484,\n\nThus total DB\u00b2 = (9801 +40,824)/484 =50,625 /484.\n\nTherefore DB\u00b2=50625/484.\n\nTherefore, from Power of a Point:\n\nDA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nWe have DA=325/22, so DP= (DB\u00b2)/DA = (50625/484)/(325/22)= (50625/484)*(22/325)=\n\nSimplify:\n\n50625 divided by 325: Let's see, 325*156=50,700, which is 75 more, so 50,625=325*156 -75. Hmm, maybe factor numerator and denominator:\n\n50625 = 225 * 225? Wait 225\u00b2=50,625. Yes, 225\u00b2=50,625. So 50625=225\u00b2,\n\n325=25*13,\n\n484=22\u00b2,\n\n22=2*11,\n\nSo,\n\n(225\u00b2 /22\u00b2) * (22/(25*13)) = (225\u00b2 *22)/(22\u00b2 *25*13)= (225\u00b2)/(22*25*13)\n\nWait, let me write all factors:\n\n50625 =225\u00b2 = (15\u00b2)^2 =15^4,\n\nBut perhaps better:\n\nLet me compute numerator:50625 *22,\n\nDenominator:484*325,\n\nWait:\n\nWait, the expression is (50625 *22)/(484 *325),\n\nLet me factor each term:\n\n50625 = 225\u00b2 = (15\u00b2)^2 = 15^4 = (3*5)^4 =3^4 *5^4,\n\n22=2*11,\n\n484=22\u00b2= (2*11)^2=2\u00b2*11\u00b2,\n\n325=25*13=5\u00b2*13,\n\nSo putting together:\n\nNumerator:3^4 *5^4 *2*11,\n\nDenominator:2\u00b2 *11\u00b2 *5\u00b2 *13,\n\nThus,\n\nCancel terms:\n\n3^4 remains,\n\n5^(4-2)=5\u00b2,\n\n2^(1-2)=2^(-1),\n\n11^(1-2)=11^(-1),\n\nand denominator has 13.\n\nThus,\n\nOverall: (3^4 *5\u00b2)/(2*11*13) ) * (1/ (2^(-1) ? Wait, maybe better to do step by step:\n\nNumerator: 3^4 *5^4 *2*11,\n\nDenominator:2\u00b2 *11\u00b2 *5\u00b2 *13,\n\nSo,\n\n3^4 /1,\n\n5^4 /5\u00b2 =5\u00b2,\n\n2/2\u00b2 =1/2,\n\n11/11\u00b2=1/11,\n\nand denominator has 13,\n\nThus overall:\n\n(3^4 *5\u00b2)/(2 *11 *13).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n3^4=81,\n\n5\u00b2=25,\n\n81*25=2025,\n\nDenominator:2*11*13=286,\n\nThus DP=2025/286.\n\nWait, so DP=2025/286?\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again:\n\nOriginal expression: (50625/484) divided by (325/22) is (50625/484)*(22/325).\n\nYes, so 50625 *22 / (484 *325).\n\nBreaking down:\n\n50625 divided by 325: 50625 /325 = (50625 \u00f725)/(325 \u00f725)=2025/13.\n\nThen, 22/484 =22/(22*22)=1/22.\n\nThus overall: (2025/13)*(1/22)=2025/(13*22)=2025/286. Yes, so DP=2025/286.\n\nTherefore, from Power of a Point, DP=2025/286.\n\nNow, we need to find AP. Since AP is the distance from A to P along the line AD. Since D is outside, and the points are arranged as A---P---D or D---P---A? Wait, need to figure out the order.\n\nSince DA is the distance from D to A, which is 325/22 \u224814.77,\n\nDP is the distance from D to P, which is 2025/286 \u22487.08,\n\nWait, so if DP is less than DA, then P is between D and A?\n\nWait, but that would mean that going from D towards A, you reach P first, then A. So the order is D-P-A, so AP = DA - DP = (325/22) - (2025/286).\n\nCompute that:\n\nConvert to common denominator 286:\n\n325/22 = (325 *13)/286=4225/286,\n\n2025/286 is as is,\n\nThus AP =4225/286 -2025/286 = (4225 -2025)/286 =2200/286.\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: 1100/143,\n\nCheck if 1100 and 143 have common factors. 143=11*13, 1100 \u00f711=100. So 1100=11*100, 143=11*13,\n\nThus, divide numerator and denominator by 11: 100/13.\n\nTherefore AP=100/13.\n\nHence m=100, n=13, which are coprime. Thus m +n=113.\n\nWait, so the answer is 113?\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again.\n\nWait, AP is DA - DP only if P is between D and A. But let me think: since DA is 325/22\u224814.77, DP is 2025/286\u22487.08, so DP < DA, so P is between D and A, so AP = DA - DP, yes, which gives 100/13\u22487.69.\n\nAlternatively, if the points were in another order, but given the Power of a Point formula, DA * DP = DB\u00b2, where DA and DP are lengths from D to A and D to P. Since D is outside, the points must be arranged so that P is between D and A, so that DA * DP = DA * (DA - AP) = DA\u00b2 - DA*AP. Wait, but according to the formula, DA * DP=DB\u00b2,\n\nWait, perhaps my confusion arises from direction.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let AP = x,\n\nThen DP = DA + AP? Wait, no, if P is beyond A from D, then DP would be DA + AP,\n\nBut in that case, Power of a Point would be DA*(DA + AP)=DB\u00b2,\n\nBut in our case, DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nIf DP is the distance from D to P, if P is between D and A, then DP = DA - AP,\n\nSo DA*(DA - AP)= DB\u00b2,\n\nHence, DA^2 - DA*AP = DB^2,\n\nTherefore, AP = (DA^2 - DB^2)/DA,\n\nAlternatively, AP = DA - (DB^2)/DA,\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWe have DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nSo DP = DB\u00b2 / DA,\n\nAP = DA - DP = DA - (DB\u00b2 / DA) = (DA\u00b2 - DB\u00b2)/DA,\n\nTherefore, compute that:\n\nDA squared is (325/22)^2,\n\nDB squared is 50625/484,\n\nWait, let me compute DA\u00b2 - DB\u00b2:\n\n(325/22)^2 - (50625/484)= (325\u00b2 -50625)/22\u00b2,\n\nWait, 325\u00b2 is 105,625,\n\nSo 105,625 -50,625 =55,000,\n\nThus DA\u00b2 - DB\u00b2 =55,000 / (22\u00b2),\n\nThus AP = (55,000 / 484 ) / (325/22)= (55,000 /484)*(22/325)=,\n\n55,000 divided by 325: 55,000 /325 = 55,000 \u00f7 25= 2,200; 2,200 /13 \u2248169.23,\n\nBut let me factor:\n\n55,000=55*1000=5*11*1000,\n\n484=4*121=4*11\u00b2,\n\n22=2*11,\n\n325=25*13,\n\nThus,\n\n(55,000 *22)/(484 *325)= (5*11*1000 *2*11)/(4*11\u00b2 *25*13)=,\n\nCancel terms:\n\n5 cancels with 25 (leaves 5 in denominator),\n\n11 in numerator cancels with 11 in denominator,\n\n1000 /4=250,\n\nSo:\n\n(2*11*5*250)/(11*13)= (2*5*250)/13= (2500)/13,\n\nWait, let me track again:\n\nWait,\n\n55,000 = 5*11*1000,\n\n22=2*11,\n\nDenominator:484=4*11\u00b2, 325=25*13,\n\nSo,\n\nNumerator:5*11*1000 *2*11,\n\nDenominator:4*11\u00b2 *25*13,\n\nSo,\n\nCancel 11\u00b2 in numerator and denominator,\n\nCancel 5 in numerator (from 5) with 25 (5\u00b2) in denominator: leaves 5 in denominator,\n\nCancel 4 in denominator with 2*2 in numerator (from 2*1000? Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, 1000 is 10\u00b3, but perhaps better:\n\nLet me write all factors:\n\nNumerator:\n\n5 *11 *1000 *2 *11 =5 *2 *11\u00b2 *1000,\n\nDenominator:\n\n4 *11\u00b2 *25 *13,\n\nCancel 11\u00b2,\n\nCancel 5 in numerator (from 5) with 25 (5\u00b2) in denominator \u2192 5 left in denominator,\n\nCancel 2 in numerator with 4 in denominator \u2192 leaves 2 in denominator,\n\nThus,\n\nNumerator: 2 *1000,\n\nDenominator: 2*5*13,\n\nWait, wait:\n\nWait, let's re-express:\n\nAfter canceling:\n\nNumerator:5*2*1000,\n\nDenominator:4*25*13,\n\nWait, perhaps my previous step was wrong.\n\nWait, step-by-step:\n\nOriginal fraction after factoring:\n\n(5*11*1000 *2*11) / (4*11\u00b2 *25*13 )\n\nCancel 11\u00b2: numerator and denominator,\n\nLeaving:\n\n(5 *2 *1000) / (4 *25 *13 )\n\nThen,\n\n5 and 25: 5 cancels with 25, leaving 5 in denominator,\n\n2 and 4: 2 cancels with 4, leaving 2 in denominator,\n\nSo,\n\n(2*1000)/(2*5*13)= (2000)/(130)= 200/13.\n\nWait, so 200/13? Wait, but I thought it was 100/13 earlier. Hmm, conflicting results. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me recast:\n\nWait, AP = (DA\u00b2 - DB\u00b2)/DA,\n\nDA squared is (325/22)^2 = 105625/484,\n\nDB squared is 50625/484,\n\nSo DA\u00b2 - DB\u00b2 = (105625 -50625)/484 =55,000 /484,\n\nThen AP = (55,000 /484 ) divided by (325/22)= (55,000 /484)*(22/325)=,\n\n55,000 *22 = 1,210,000,\n\n484 *325= 157,300,\n\nSo 1,210,000 /157,300,\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100: 12,100 /1,573,\n\nHmm, 12,100 \u00f713 = 930.7\u2026 Wait, perhaps factor numerator and denominator:\n\n12,100 = 100*121 =100*11\u00b2,\n\n1,573: Let's see if divisible by 11: 1,573 \u00f711=143, which is 11*13. So 1,573=11*143=11*11*13=11\u00b2*13,\n\nThus,\n\n12,100 /1,573 = (100*11\u00b2)/(11\u00b2*13)=100/13,\n\nAh, so AP=100/13. Okay, so that's correct. So my initial calculation was right. The second approach also gives 100/13. So the error was in the intermediate step where I miscalculated the factors.\n\nTherefore, AP=100/13, so m=100, n=13, which are coprime. Thus, m +n=113.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 113.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{113}\n\n\nGiven triangle \\(ABC\\) inscribed in circle \\(\\omega\\) with \\(AB = 5\\), \\(BC = 9\\), and \\(AC = 10\\). The tangents to \\(\\omega\\) at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) intersect at point \\(D\\), and line \\(AD\\) intersects \\(\\omega\\) again at \\(P\\). We need to find \\(AP\\) in the form \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, and then determine \\(m + n\\).\n\nFirst, we use the Power of a Point theorem which states that for point \\(D\\) outside the circle, the power with respect to \\(\\omega\\) is given by \\(DB^2 = DC^2 = DA \\cdot DP\\). \n\nWe start by calculating the coordinates of points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). Placing \\(C\\) at \\((0, 0)\\) and \\(B\\) at \\((9, 0)\\), we find the coordinates of \\(A\\) using the given side lengths. Solving the system of equations from the distances \\(AC = 10\\) and \\(AB = 5\\), we find \\(A\\) at \\(\\left(\\frac{26}{3}, \\frac{4\\sqrt{14}}{3}\\right)\\).\n\nNext, we determine the equations of the tangents at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\). The tangent at \\(B\\) has a slope of \\(\\frac{6\\sqrt{14}}{11}\\) and passes through \\(B\\), giving the equation \\(y = \\frac{6\\sqrt{14}}{11}(x - 9)\\). The tangent at \\(C\\) has a slope of \\(-\\frac{6\\sqrt{14}}{11}\\) and passes through \\(C\\), giving the equation \\(y = -\\frac{6\\sqrt{14}}{11}x\\). Solving these equations, we find the coordinates of \\(D\\) as \\(\\left(\\frac{9}{2}, -\\frac{27\\sqrt{14}}{11}\\right)\\).\n\nUsing the distance formula, we calculate \\(DA\\) and \\(DB\\):\n- \\(DA = \\frac{325}{22}\\)\n- \\(DB^2 = \\frac{50625}{484}\\)\n\nApplying the Power of a Point theorem:\n\\[\nDA \\cdot DP = DB^2 \\implies \\frac{325}{22} \\cdot DP = \\frac{50625}{484}\n\\]\nSolving for \\(DP\\), we get:\n\\[\nDP = \\frac{2025}{286}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find \\(AP\\) as:\n\\[\nAP = DA - DP = \\frac{325}{22} - \\frac{2025}{286} = \\frac{100}{13}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(m = 100\\) and \\(n = 13\\), leading to \\(m + n = 113\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{113}\n\\]",
