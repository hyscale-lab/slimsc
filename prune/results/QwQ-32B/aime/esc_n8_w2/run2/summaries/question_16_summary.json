      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest prime number p such that there exists some positive integer n where p squared divides n^4 +1. Then, once I find that prime p, I have to find the smallest positive integer m where m^4 +1 is divisible by p squared. Alright, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, primes where p squared divides n^4 +1. That means n^4 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2. Hmm, so n^8 \u2261 1 mod p\u00b2. Because if n^4 \u2261 -1, then squaring both sides gives n^8 \u2261 1 mod p\u00b2. So the order of n modulo p\u00b2 must divide 8 but not divide 4, right? Wait, but actually, the multiplicative order of n modulo p\u00b2 has to divide \u03c6(p\u00b2) which is p(p-1). Since \u03c6(p\u00b2) = p\u00b2 - p = p(p-1). So the order of n modulo p\u00b2 must divide both 8 and p(p-1). Hmm, but maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, since n^4 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2, then -1 must be a quartic residue modulo p\u00b2. I remember that for primes, certain conditions must hold. Let me recall that for -1 to be a quadratic residue mod p, p must be 1 mod 4. But here it's a quartic residue. Maybe similar conditions?\n\nFirst, perhaps start by checking small primes and see if their squares divide any n^4 +1. Maybe start with primes like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.\n\nStarting with p=2: Let's see if 2\u00b2=4 divides n^4 +1. Let's check n even or odd. If n is even, n^4 is 0 mod 4, so n^4 +1 \u22611 mod4. If n is odd, n^2 is 1 mod4, so n^4 = (n\u00b2)^2 \u22611 mod4, so n^4 +1 \u22612 mod4. Neither case gives 0 mod4. So 4 cannot divide n^4 +1. So p=2 is out.\n\nNext p=3: Check 9 divides n^4 +1. Let's compute n^4 mod9 for n from 0 to 8:\n\n0^4=0, 1^4=1, 2^4=16\u22617, 3^4=81\u22610, 4^4=(4^2)^2=16\u00b2\u22617\u00b2=49\u22614, 5^4\u2261(5 mod3=2)^4\u226116\u22617, 6^4\u22610, 7^4\u2261(7 mod3=1)^4\u22611, 8^4\u2261(8 mod3=2)^4\u226116\u22617 mod9.\n\nSo n^4 mod9 can be 0,1,4,7. Adding 1 gives 1,2,5,8 mod9. So none of those are 0 mod9. Thus 3 squared can't divide n^4+1. So p=3 is out.\n\np=5: Check 25 divides n^4 +1. Let me compute n^4 mod25.\n\nHmm, maybe better to see if there exists n with n^4 \u2261-1 mod25. Let's see. Let me try n from 1 to 24:\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Since 25 is 5\u00b2, and 5 is prime. Let's first check if -1 is a quartic residue mod5, then maybe mod25?\n\nFirst mod5: Let's see n^4 mod5. Since by Fermat's little theorem, n^4 \u22611 mod5 for n not divisible by 5. So n^4 mod5 is either 0 or 1. Thus, n^4 \u2261-1 mod5 would require -1 \u22611 mod5, which is false. So there is no solution mod5, so certainly none mod25. So p=5 is out.\n\np=7: Check 49 divides n^4 +1. First check mod7:\n\nAgain, by Fermat's little theorem, n^6 \u22611 mod7 for n not divisible by7. So n^4 \u2261n^{-2} mod7. So n^4 \u2261-1 mod7 implies n^{-2}\u2261-1 mod7, so n^2\u2261-1 mod7. Let's see if -1 is a quadratic residue mod7. Quadratic residues mod7 are 0,1,2,4. Since 3^2=9\u22612, 4^2=16\u22612, 5^2=25\u22614, etc. So -1 mod7 is 6, which is not a quadratic residue. Therefore, no solution mod7, so no mod49. So p=7 is out.\n\np=11: Let's see. First check mod11. Let's see if n^4 \u2261-1 mod11. Let me compute the quartic residues mod11. Since 11 is 3 mod4, so maybe different.\n\nFirst, compute n^4 mod11 for n from 1 to 10:\n\n1:1, 2:16\u22615, 3:81\u22614, 4:256\u2261256-22*11=256-242=14\u22613, 5:625 mod11: 625-56*11=625-616=9, 6:1296 mod11: 1296-118*11=1296-1298? Wait, 11*118=1298, so 1296 is 1298-2\u2261-2 mod11. But 6^4=(6\u00b2)^2=36\u00b2. 36 mod11 is 3, so 3\u00b2=9 mod11. Wait, so 6^4\u22619 mod11. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated earlier. Let me recalculate all:\n\n1^4=1 mod11.\n\n2^4=16 mod11=5.\n\n3^4=81 mod11=81-7*11=81-77=4.\n\n4^4=(4^2)^2=16\u00b2. 16 mod11 is 5, so 5\u00b2=25 mod11=3.\n\n5^4=(5\u00b2)^2=25\u00b2. 25 mod11=3, so 3\u00b2=9 mod11.\n\n6^4=(6\u00b2)^2=36\u00b2. 36 mod11=3, so 3\u00b2=9 mod11.\n\n7^4: 7\u00b2=49\u22615, so 5\u00b2=25\u22613 mod11.\n\n8^4: 8\u00b2=64\u22619 mod11, so 9\u00b2=81\u22614 mod11.\n\n9^4: 9\u00b2=81\u22614 mod11, so 4\u00b2=16\u22615 mod11.\n\n10^4:10\u00b2=100\u22611 mod11, so 1\u00b2=1 mod11.\n\nSo quartic residues mod11 are 1,3,4,5,9. So -1 mod11 is 10. 10 is not among these, so no solution mod11. Thus p=11 is out.\n\np=13: Let's check mod13 first. Check if n^4 \u2261-1 mod13.\n\nCompute n^4 mod13 for n=1 to 12.\n\n1:1, 2:16\u22613, 3:81\u22613 (since 13*6=78, 81-78=3), 4:256 mod13. 13*19=247, 256-247=9. 4^4=256\u22619 mod13.\n\n5:5^4=(5\u00b2)^2=25\u00b2. 25 mod13=12, so 12\u00b2=144\u22611 mod13.\n\n6^4=(6\u00b2)^2=36\u00b2. 36 mod13=10, 10\u00b2=100\u22619 mod13.\n\n7^4: 7\u00b2=49\u226110 mod13, so 10\u00b2=100\u22619 mod13.\n\n8^4:8\u00b2=64\u226112 mod13, so 12\u00b2=144\u22611 mod13.\n\n9^4:9\u00b2=81\u22613 mod13, so 3\u00b2=9 mod13.\n\n10^4:10\u00b2=100\u22619 mod13, so 9\u00b2=81\u22613 mod13.\n\n11^4:11\u00b2=121\u22614 mod13, so 4\u00b2=16\u22613 mod13.\n\n12^4:12\u00b2=144\u22611 mod13, so 1\u00b2=1 mod13.\n\nSo quartic residues mod13 are 1,3,9. So -1 mod13 is 12, which isn't in the list. So no solution mod13. So p=13 is out.\n\nHmm, moving on to p=17. Let me check mod17 first.\n\nFirst, quartic residues mod17. Let me compute n^4 mod17 for n=1 to 16:\n\n1:1\n\n2:16 mod17=16, 2^4=16\u2261-1 mod17? Wait, 2^4=16, so mod17 is 16\u2261-1. Wait, so 2^4\u2261-1 mod17. That's interesting.\n\nWait, so if n=2 mod17, then n^4 \u2261-1 mod17. So that means that mod17, there is a solution. So maybe mod17\u00b2?\n\nWait, so p=17 might be a candidate. Let me check whether there exists n such that 17\u00b2 divides n^4 +1.\n\nSo we need n^4 \u2261-1 mod17\u00b2. Since n\u22612 mod17 is a solution mod17, perhaps we can use Hensel's lemma to lift this solution mod17 to mod17\u00b2.\n\nHensel's lemma says that if f(n) \u22610 mod p and f\u2019(n) \u2261/ 0 mod p, then there's a unique lift mod p\u00b2. Here f(n)=n^4 +1. f\u2019(n)=4n\u00b3. At n\u22612 mod17, f\u2019(2)=4*(8)=32\u226132-17=15 mod17. Which is not 0 mod17, so Hensel's condition is satisfied. Therefore, there is a unique solution mod17\u00b2 congruent to 2 mod17. So there exists some n such that n\u22612 mod17 and n^4\u2261-1 mod17\u00b2. Therefore, p=17 is a prime where such n exists. So maybe 17 is the smallest such prime?\n\nWait, but before jumping to conclusion, let me check primes between 13 and 17. The next prime after 13 is 17, so 17 is the next candidate. Let me check p=17 first. Let me confirm whether there exists n with n^4 +1 divisible by 17\u00b2.\n\nLet me try to compute n=2 +17k. Let's compute (2+17k)^4 +1 mod17\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute (2+17k)^4 using binomial expansion:\n\n=2^4 + 4*2^3*(17k) + 6*2^2*(17k)^2 +4*2*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4\n\nBut mod17\u00b2, terms with (17k)^2 or higher will have 17\u00b2 factor, so mod17\u00b2, they are 0. So:\n\n\u2261 16 + 4*(8)*(17k) mod17\u00b2\n\n=16 + 32*17k mod17\u00b2\n\nBut 32 mod17 is 15, so 32*17k \u226115*17k mod17\u00b2.\n\nSo total expression is 16 +15*17k mod17\u00b2.\n\nWe want this \u2261 -1 mod17\u00b2, so:\n\n16 +15*17k \u2261 -1 mod17\u00b2\n\nSo 15*17k \u2261 -17 mod17\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by 17:\n\n15k \u2261 -1 mod17\n\nThus 15k \u226116 mod17.\n\nWe need to solve for k: 15k \u226116 mod17.\n\n15 inverse mod17: 15 and 17 coprime. 15x \u22611 mod17.\n\n15*? Let's see: 15*1=15, 15*2=30\u226113, 15*3=45\u226111, 15*4=60\u22619, 15*5=75\u226175-68=7, 15*6=90\u226190-85=5, 15*7=105\u2261105-102=3, 15*8=120\u2261120-119=1 mod17. So inverse is 8.\n\nThus k\u226116*8 mod17. 16*8=128 mod17: 17*7=119, 128-119=9. So k\u22619 mod17.\n\nTherefore, the solution mod17\u00b2 is n \u22612 +17*9 mod17\u00b2. 17*9=153. So 2+153=155. So n=155 mod17\u00b2. Therefore, n=155 is a solution. Let me check n=155:\n\nCompute 155^4 +1 mod289 (since 17\u00b2=289). Let me compute 155 mod17 is 155-9*17=155-153=2, so 155\u22612 mod17, which is consistent.\n\nNow, compute 155^4 mod289:\n\nWe can compute 155^2 first: 155^2 = (150+5)^2 =150\u00b2 + 2*150*5 +5\u00b2 =22500 +1500 +25=24025. Then mod289. Hmm, that's a big number. Maybe better to compute step by step mod289.\n\nAlternatively, note that 155=2 +17*9, so (2+17*9)^4 mod17\u00b2. Wait, but we already did this earlier and found that it's 16 +15*17*9 mod289.\n\nWait, let me compute 15*17*9: 15*9=135, 135*17=2295. Then 16 +2295 mod289.\n\n2295 divided by 289: 289*7=2023, 2295-2023=272. 272 +16=288. 288 mod289 is 288. So 288 mod289 is -1 mod289. So yes, 155^4 +1 \u2261-1 +1=0 mod289? Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, the expression was (2+17k)^4 +1 \u226116 +15*17k + ... \u226116 +15*17k mod289. Then we set that equal to -1 mod289. So 16 +15*17k \u2261-1 mod289 \u21d2 15*17k \u2261-17 mod289 \u21d2 15k \u2261-1 mod17 \u21d2 k\u22619 mod17. So when k=9, 15*9*17=1215. 1215 mod289: 289*4=1156, 1215-1156=59. So 16 +1215=1231 mod289. 1231-4*289=1231-1156=75. Hmm, that contradicts previous? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, perhaps my initial expansion was wrong. Let me recalculate (2+17k)^4 mod17\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute (2 +17k)^4:\n\nFirst, expand using binomial theorem:\n\n= 2^4 + 4*2^3*(17k) + 6*2^2*(17k)^2 + 4*2*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4\n\nNow, mod17\u00b2, terms with (17k)^2 or higher will have 17\u00b2, so they are 0 mod17\u00b2. So:\n\n\u2261 16 + 4*(8)*(17k) mod17\u00b2\n\n=16 + 32*17k mod17\u00b2\n\n32 mod17 is 15, so 32*17k mod17\u00b2 = (15*17k) mod17\u00b2\n\nThus total is 16 +15*17k mod17\u00b2.\n\nSet this equal to -1 mod17\u00b2:\n\n16 +15*17k \u2261 -1 mod17\u00b2 \u21d2 15*17k \u2261 -17 mod17\u00b2 \u21d2 divide both sides by 17:\n\n15k \u2261 -1 mod17 \u21d2 15k \u226116 mod17\n\nThen solving for k, as before, k\u22619 mod17. So k=9 gives:\n\n15*17*9 = 15*153=2295. 2295 mod289: 289*8=2312, so 2295-2312= -17 mod289. So 16 + (-17) mod289 is -1 mod289. Therefore, (2+17*9)^4 +1 \u2261-1 +1=0 mod289? Wait, no, (2+17k)^4 \u2261-1 mod289, so adding 1 gives 0 mod289. Wait, no:\n\nWait, (2+17k)^4 \u2261 -1 mod289 \u21d2 (2+17k)^4 +1 \u22610 mod289. Exactly. So that works. So n=2+17*9=155 is a solution. So p=17 is indeed a prime where p\u00b2 divides n^4 +1 for n=155. So 17 is a candidate.\n\nBut before confirming it's the smallest, let me check primes between 13 and 17. The primes between 13 and 17 are none, since 17 is next. Wait, primes: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17. So 17 is next. But let me check p=17 is indeed the smallest. Wait, let's check p=17 first, but perhaps check p= 17 is the first prime where n^4 \u2261-1 mod p\u00b2 exists.\n\nWait, let's check p= 7,11, etc. Wait, we already checked up to p=13 and they didn't work. So 17 is the first candidate.\n\nWait, let me check p= 17 is indeed the smallest. Let me check p= 17, and see if maybe a smaller prime was missed?\n\nWait, let me check p= 2,3,5,7,11,13 again quickly. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nFor p=2: n^4 +1 mod4. As before, even n gives 1 mod4, odd gives 2 mod4. So no.\n\np=3: mod9. The residues were 0,1,4,7. Adding 1 gives 1,2,5,8 mod9, none 0.\n\np=5: mod25. Since mod5 had no solutions, mod25 can't either.\n\np=7: mod49, since mod7 had no solutions, so mod49 can't.\n\np=11: mod121. Since mod11 had no solutions, mod121 can't.\n\np=13: mod169. Since mod13 had no solutions, mod169 can't.\n\nSo indeed, p=17 is the first prime where modp has a solution, so modp\u00b2 can have a solution via Hensel. So p=17 is the least prime.\n\nTherefore, now the question is to find the minimal m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by 17\u00b2=289, so the minimal m.\n\nEarlier, we found that n=155 is such a number. But is that the minimal m?\n\nWait, perhaps m=155 is the minimal, but maybe there's a smaller m.\n\nWait, when we used Hensel's lemma, we found the solution congruent to 2 mod17. The minimal positive solution would be the minimal n \u22612 mod17 where n^4 \u2261-1 mod17\u00b2. Since we found n=155, but 155 mod17 is 2, but 155 is 2+17*9. The minimal positive n would be the smallest positive integer in that congruence class. Since the solutions mod17\u00b2 are of the form 2 +17k where k\u22619 mod17. Wait, no, actually, the solution is unique mod17\u00b2. Because Hensel's lemma gives a unique solution mod17\u00b2 once you lift from mod17. So there's only one solution mod17\u00b2. Since we started with n\u22612 mod17, then the solution mod17\u00b2 is n\u2261155 mod289. Wait, no, 155 mod289 is the solution. Wait, 155 is less than 289? 17\u00b2 is 289, so 155 is less than that, so 155 is the minimal positive solution?\n\nWait, let me check m=155. Let me compute 155^4 +1 mod289.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 155 mod17 is 2, so 155^4 \u22612^4 mod17\u00b2? Wait no, but mod17\u00b2 it's supposed to be -1. Let me compute 155^4 mod289.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute 155^2 first:\n\n155 squared: 155*155. Let's compute:\n\n155^2 = (150 +5)^2 =150\u00b2 + 2*150*5 +5\u00b2 =22500 +1500 +25=24025.\n\nNow divide 24025 by 289 to find mod289.\n\nFirst, compute how many times 289 goes into 24025.\n\n289*80=23120. 24025-23120=905.\n\n289*3=867. 905-867=38. So total is 80+3=83, remainder 38.\n\nThus 155\u00b2 \u226138 mod289.\n\nNow compute (155^2)^2 mod289, which is 38\u00b2 mod289.\n\n38\u00b2=1444. Divide 1444 by289:\n\n289*4=1156. 1444-1156=288. 288 mod289 is 288. So 38\u00b2\u2261288 mod289.\n\nTherefore, 155^4 \u2261288 mod289. Thus 155^4 +1 \u2261288+1=289\u22610 mod289. Perfect, so that works.\n\nNow, is there a smaller m?\n\nThe solutions mod289 are congruent to 155 mod289. So the minimal positive integer is 155. But let me check if there is a smaller number between 1 and 155 that satisfies m^4\u2261-1 mod289.\n\nSuppose m is less than 155. Since m\u22612 mod17, the numbers congruent to 2 mod17 less than 155 are 2, 19, 36, 53, 70, 87, 104, 121, 138, 155. So the candidates are these numbers. Let's check m=2:\n\n2^4 +1 =16 +1=17 mod289. Not 0.\n\nm=19: 19 mod17=2. Let's compute 19^4 mod289.\n\n19^2=361 mod289=361-289=72. Then 72\u00b2=5184 mod289. 289*17=4913. 5184-4913=271. So 19^4\u2261271 mod289. 271+1=272\u22600 mod289.\n\nm=36: 36 mod17=36-2*17=2. So 36\u22612 mod17. Compute 36^4 mod289.\n\n36^2=1296 mod289: 289*4=1156, 1296-1156=140. 140\u00b2 mod289: 140\u00b2=19600. Divide by289: 289*67=19363, 19600-19363=237. So 36^4\u2261237 mod289. 237+1=238\u22600.\n\nm=53: 53 mod17=53-3*17=53-51=2. Compute 53^4 mod289.\n\n53^2=2809 mod289. 289*9=2601, 2809-2601=208. 208\u00b2 mod289: 208\u00b2=43264. Let me divide 43264 by289:\n\n289*149=289*(150-1)=289*150 -289=43350 -289=43061. 43264-43061=203. So 53^4\u2261203 mod289. 203+1=204\u22600.\n\nm=70: 70 mod17: 70-4*17=70-68=2. Compute 70^4 mod289.\n\n70\u00b2=4900 mod289. 289*16=4624. 4900-4624=276. 276\u00b2 mod289. 276\u00b2=76176. Let me compute mod289:\n\n289*263=289*(260+3)=289*260 +289*3. 289*260=289*200 +289*60=57800 +17340=75140. 289*3=867. Total 75140+867=76007. 76176-76007=169. So 276\u00b2\u2261169 mod289. Thus 70^4\u2261169 mod289. 169+1=170\u22600.\n\nm=87: 87 mod17=87-5*17=87-85=2. Compute 87^4 mod289.\n\n87\u00b2=7569 mod289. 289*26=7514. 7569-7514=55. 55\u00b2 mod289=3025 mod289. 289*10=2890. 3025-2890=135. So 87^4\u2261135 mod289. 135+1=136\u22600.\n\nm=104: 104 mod17=104-6*17=104-102=2. Compute 104^4 mod289.\n\n104\u00b2=10816 mod289. Let's see 289*37=289*(30+7)=8670 +2023=10693. 10816-10693=123. 123\u00b2 mod289. 123\u00b2=15129. 289*52=15028. 15129-15028=101. So 104^4\u2261101 mod289. 101+1=102\u22600.\n\nm=121: 121 mod17=121-7*17=121-119=2. Compute 121^4 mod289.\n\n121\u00b2=14641 mod289. Let's see 289*50=14450. 14641-14450=191. 191 mod289=191. 191\u00b2 mod289. 191\u00b2=36481. 289*126=36414. 36481-36414=67. So 121^4\u226167 mod289. 67+1=68\u22600.\n\nm=138: 138 mod17=138-8*17=138-136=2. Compute 138^4 mod289.\n\n138\u00b2=19044 mod289. Let me compute 289*65=18785. 19044-18785=259. 259 mod289 is 259. 259\u00b2 mod289. 259\u00b2=67081. 289*232=289*(200+32)=57800 +9248=67048. 67081-67048=33. So 138^4\u226133 mod289. 33+1=34\u22600.\n\nm=155: already checked, gives 0 mod289. So indeed, 155 is the smallest m in this sequence. Therefore, the minimal m is 155.\n\nWait, but let me check m= 2 mod17 but less than 155. Wait, all the numbers we checked less than 155 didn't work, so 155 is indeed the smallest. Therefore, the answer is 155 and the prime is 17. So the problem asks for the least prime p is 17, then the minimal m is 155. Therefore, the final answer is 155.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more if there is any m less than 155 that is not congruent to 2 mod17 but still satisfies m^4 \u2261-1 mod289. Since Hensel's lemma gives a unique solution mod289, so only numbers congruent to 2 mod17 can satisfy the equation mod289? Wait, perhaps not necessarily. Let me think.\n\nSuppose there exists another solution not congruent to 2 mod17. But since mod17, the only solutions to n^4\u2261-1 mod17 are n\u22612 and n\u2261-2 mod17 (since 2^4\u2261-1 mod17, so (-2)^4=16\u2261-1 mod17 as well). Wait, actually, let me check:\n\nWait, (-2)^4 mod17 is (15)^4 mod17. Let me compute 15^4 mod17. Since 15\u2261-2 mod17, so (-2)^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. So indeed, both 2 and 15 mod17 satisfy n^4\u2261-1 mod17.\n\nTherefore, there are two solutions mod17: 2 and 15. So perhaps lifting both of these mod17\u00b2?\n\nTherefore, maybe there's another solution congruent to 15 mod17. Let me check that.\n\nLet me try n\u226115 mod17. Let me see if there is a solution mod17\u00b2. Let me set n=15 +17k. Then compute n^4 +1 mod17\u00b2.\n\nExpand (15 +17k)^4:\n\n15^4 +4*15\u00b3*(17k) +6*15\u00b2*(17k)^2 +4*15*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.\n\nMod17\u00b2, terms with (17k)^2 or higher vanish. So:\n\n\u226115^4 +4*(15)^3*(17k) mod17\u00b2.\n\nCompute 15^4 mod17\u00b2. Since 15\u2261-2 mod17, so 15^4 \u2261(-2)^4=16 mod17. Wait, but mod17\u00b2, let me compute 15^4:\n\n15^2=225. 225 mod289 is 225.\n\n15^4=(15^2)^2=225\u00b2 mod289. 225\u00b2=50625. 289*175=289*(170+5)=289*170 +289*5. 289*170=49130, 289*5=1445. Total 49130+1445=50575. 50625-50575=50. So 15^4\u226150 mod289.\n\nThen, the linear term:4*(15)^3*(17k).\n\nFirst compute 15^3=3375. 3375 mod17\u00b2? Wait, let's compute mod17 first, but maybe better mod289:\n\n15^3=15*15*15=15*225=3375. 3375 mod289:\n\n289*11=3179. 3375-3179=196. So 15^3\u2261196 mod289.\n\nThus, 4*196*17k mod289.\n\nCompute 4*196=784. 784 mod289: 289*2=578, 784-578=206. 206 mod289. Then 206*17k mod289.\n\nSo total expression:\n\n15^4 +4*(15)^3*(17k) \u226150 +206*17k mod289.\n\nSet this equal to -1 mod289:\n\n50 +206*17k \u2261-1 mod289 \u21d2206*17k \u2261-51 mod289 \u21d2\n\nDivide both sides by17:\n\n206k \u2261-3 mod17.\n\nCompute 206 mod17: 17*12=204, so 206\u22612 mod17. So equation is 2k \u2261-3 mod17 \u21d22k\u226114 mod17 \u21d2k\u22617 mod17 (since 2*7=14).\n\nTherefore, k=7 mod17. Thus the solution mod17\u00b2 is n=15 +17k=15 +17*7=15+119=134 mod289.\n\nSo n=134 is another solution. Let me check m=134.\n\nCheck 134^4 +1 mod289.\n\nCompute 134 mod17=134-7*17=134-119=15 mod17, which is correct.\n\nCompute 134^4 mod289:\n\nFirst compute 134 squared mod289. 134^2=17956 mod289. Let me divide 17956 by289:\n\n289*62=289*(60+2)=17340 +578=17918. 17956-17918=38. So 134^2\u226138 mod289.\n\nThen 38^2 mod289 is same as before: 38\u00b2=1444 mod289. 1444-289*4=1444-1156=288 mod289. So 134^4\u2261288 mod289. Thus 288+1=289\u22610 mod289. So that works.\n\nTherefore, m=134 is another solution. Now, 134 is less than 155, so maybe 134 is the minimal m?\n\nWait, 134 is smaller than 155. Let me check if there are smaller m between 1 and 134.\n\nThe solutions mod289 are n\u22612 mod17 and n\u226115 mod17 lifted to mod289, giving n\u2261155 mod289 and n\u2261134 mod289? Wait, actually, the two solutions mod289 are 155 and 134? Wait, no, actually each congruence mod17 lifts to a unique solution mod289. So there are two solutions mod289: one \u22612 mod17 (which is 155 mod289) and one \u226115 mod17 (which is 134 mod289).\n\nTherefore, the minimal m is the smaller of 134 and 155, so 134. Wait, but is 134 the minimal?\n\nWait, let's check m=134. But are there smaller numbers congruent to 15 mod17?\n\nNumbers congruent to 15 mod17 less than 134 are: 15, 32, 49, 66, 83, 100, 117, 134.\n\nCheck these:\n\nStart with m=15:\n\n15^4 mod289. As before, 15^4=50 mod289. 50+1=51\u22600.\n\nm=32: 32 mod17= 32-17=15. Compute 32^4 mod289.\n\n32^2=1024 mod289. 289*3=867. 1024-867=157. 157^2 mod289. 157\u00b2=24649. 289*85=24565. 24649-24565=84. So 32^4\u226184 mod289. 84+1=85\u22600.\n\nm=49: 49 mod17=49-2*17=15. Compute 49^4 mod289.\n\n49^2=2401 mod289. 289*8=2312. 2401-2312=89. 89\u00b2 mod289. 89\u00b2=7921. 289*27=7803. 7921-7803=118. So 49^4\u2261118 mod289. 118+1=119\u22600.\n\nm=66: 66 mod17=66-3*17=15. Compute 66^4 mod289.\n\n66\u00b2=4356 mod289. 289*15=4335. 4356-4335=21. 21\u00b2=441 mod289. 441-289=152. So 66^4\u2261152 mod289. 152+1=153\u22600.\n\nm=83: 83 mod17=83-4*17=15. Compute 83^4 mod289.\n\n83\u00b2=6889 mod289. 289*23=6647. 6889-6647=242 mod289. 242 mod289 is 242. 242\u00b2 mod289. 242\u00b2=58564. 289*202=58378. 58564-58378=186. So 83^4\u2261186 mod289. 186+1=187\u22600.\n\nm=100:100 mod17=100-5*17=100-85=15. Compute 100^4 mod289.\n\n100\u00b2=10000 mod289. 289*34=9826. 10000-9826=174. 174\u00b2 mod289. 174\u00b2=30276. 289*104=289*(100+4)=28900+1156=30056. 30276-30056=220 mod289. 220 mod289 is 220. So 100^4\u2261220 mod289. 220+1=221\u22600.\n\nm=117:117 mod17=117-6*17=117-102=15. Compute 117^4 mod289.\n\n117\u00b2=13689 mod289. 289*47=13583. 13689-13583=106. 106\u00b2 mod289. 106\u00b2=11236. 289*38=10982. 11236-10982=254 mod289. So 117^4\u2261254 mod289. 254+1=255\u22600.\n\nm=134: already checked, gives 0 mod289. So 134 is the minimal m congruent to15 mod17. Therefore, between 134 and 155, the minimal is 134.\n\nWait, so 134 is smaller than 155. But is there any smaller m?\n\nWait, let me check m=134 is indeed the smallest. Since all the numbers less than 134 congruent to 2 or15 mod17 were checked and none worked, then 134 is the smallest.\n\nWait, but let me confirm m=134. Let me compute 134^4 +1 mod289 again:\n\n134 mod17 is 15, so 15^4 mod17 is -1, so mod289, as above, we had 134^4 \u2261288 mod289, so +1 is 289\u22610 mod289. So correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal m is 134. Wait, but why did Hensel's lemma give me 155 when I started with n\u22612 mod17, but the other solution starting from n\u226115 mod17 gives 134, which is smaller. So the minimal m is 134.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake earlier. I thought the first solution was 155, but there is another solution at 134. Therefore, 134 is smaller. So the minimal m is 134.\n\nWait, but let me check if there is any m less than 134. Let me see.\n\nWait, 134 is the first in its congruence class (15 mod17) to satisfy the equation. The numbers before it in that class were 15,32,... up to 134, none worked. Similarly for the other congruence class (2 mod17), the first solution was 155. Therefore, 134 is indeed the smallest.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 134. Wait, but I need to make sure I didn't miss any other congruence classes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other solutions not congruent to 2 or 15 mod17? Let me see.\n\nSuppose there is some m not congruent to 2 or15 mod17, but m^4\u2261-1 mod289. Then mod17, m^4\u2261-1 mod17, which requires m\u22612 or15 mod17. Therefore, all solutions mod289 must be \u22612 or15 mod17. Therefore, the minimal solution is the smaller of the two lifted solutions, which are 134 and155. So 134 is smaller.\n\nThus, the minimal m is 134. Therefore, I need to correct my previous conclusion.\n\nWait, so my mistake was not considering the other solution from 15 mod17. So the minimal m is 134.\n\nWait, but let me check again the calculation for m=134.\n\nCompute m=134:\n\n134 divided by17 is 7*17=119, so 134=7*17 +15. So mod17 is15.\n\nCompute 134^4 mod289:\n\nFirst, 134 mod289 is134. Let me compute 134^2:\n\n134*134: 130\u00b2=16900, 2*130*4=1040, 4\u00b2=16. So total 16900+1040+16=17956. As before, mod289:\n\n289*62=17918. 17956-17918=38. So 134\u00b2\u226138 mod289.\n\nThen 38^2 mod289: 38\u00b2=1444. 289*5=1445, so 1444 mod289 is -1 mod289 (since 1444=1445-1). So 38\u00b2\u2261-1 mod289. Therefore, 134^4\u2261(38)^2\u2261-1 mod289. Therefore, 134^4 +1\u22610 mod289. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, m=134 works, and it's smaller than 155. So 134 is the minimal m.\n\nWait, so why did I get 155 earlier? Because I considered only the solution starting from 2 mod17, but the solution from 15 mod17 gives a smaller number. Therefore, the minimal m is 134.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 134.\n\nBut let me double-check if there is any m less than134.\n\nWait, 134 is the first in its congruence class (15 mod17) that works, so there are none smaller. Let me check m= 15 mod17:\n\nNumbers less than134 congruent to15 mod17: 15,32,49,66,83,100,117,134. All of these when tested didn't work except 134. So yes, 134 is the smallest.\n\nTherefore, the minimal m is 134. So I need to adjust my previous conclusion. So the prime is 17, and minimal m is134.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal solution is 134. Let me see if 134^4 +1 is divisible by289.\n\n134^4 +1 = (134^2)^2 +1 = (38)^2 +1 mod289? Wait, no. Wait, 134^2 mod289 is38, so 38 squared mod289 is -1. So 38\u00b2 is-1 mod289, so 134^4= (134\u00b2)^2\u2261(-1) mod289. Therefore, 134^4 +1\u2261-1+1=0 mod289. Correct.\n\nTherefore, yes, 134 is the minimal m. So the answer should be 134.\n\nWait, but why did I get 155 earlier? Because when I started with n\u22612 mod17, the solution mod289 is 2 +17k where k=9, giving 155. But the other solution from n\u226115 mod17 gives k=7, leading to 15+17*7=134.\n\nSo both solutions exist, and the minimal is 134.\n\nTherefore, the correct minimal m is 134.\n\nHmm, so I need to ensure that I didn't miss anything else. Let me confirm that 134 is indeed the smallest.\n\nWait, let me check m= 134 is indeed the smallest. Since 134 is the first one in its congruence class, and the other congruence class's first solution is 155, so 134 is smaller. Therefore, the answer is 134.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because different steps led to different answers, but upon considering both congruence classes, 134 is the minimal. So the correct answer should be 134.\n\nWait, but let me see if there's any mistake in calculations for m=134.\n\nCompute 134^4 +1:\n\nLet me compute 134^2 first:\n\n134 *134 = 17956. 17956 divided by289:\n\n289*62 = 289*(60+2)=289*60 +289*2 =17340 +578=17918. 17956 -17918 =38. So 134^2 =38 mod289.\n\nThen 38 squared is 38*38=1444. 1444 divided by289: 289*5=1445, so 1444= -1 mod289. Therefore, 38\u00b2 \u2261-1 mod289. Therefore, 134^4 \u2261-1 mod289. So indeed, 134^4 +1 \u22610 mod289.\n\nTherefore, 134 is correct. So my initial mistake was not considering the other solution from the 15 mod17 congruence.\n\nTherefore, the minimal m is 134. So the answer should be 134.\n\nWait, but let me check once more for any possible m smaller than134.\n\nSuppose someone claims m= something smaller like 47 or something. Let me check m= something like 24 mod17?\n\nWait, but any m must be congruent to 2 or15 mod17. So numbers not in those congruence classes can't work. So between the two congruence classes, the smallest solution is 134.\n\nTherefore, I think 134 is the correct minimal m. So I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 155. Therefore, the correct answer is 134.\n\nWait, but I need to check again the question. The problem says \"the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 +1 is divisible by p squared\". We found p=17, and then the minimal m is 134. So the final answer is 134.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm with another method. Let me compute 134^4 +1 divided by289.\n\n134^4 +1 = (134^2)^2 +1 =38^2 +1 mod289? Wait no, 38^2 is 1444, which is -1 mod289. So 38^2 +1 is 0 mod289. So yes.\n\nAlternatively, compute 134^4 +1 = (134^2)^2 +1 = (38)^2 +1 mod289 = (-1) +1=0 mod289.\n\nYes, so it works.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, the minimal m is 134. Therefore, the answer is 134.\n\nWait, but I need to check if 134 is indeed the minimal. Since 134 is the first in its congruence class and the other solution is 155, which is higher, then yes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{134}\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because I initially thought 155, but after considering both congruence classes, it's 134. Let me see if the problem specifies anything else.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the least prime number p for which there exists a positive integer n such that p squared divides n^4 +1\". We found p=17. Then \"Find the least positive integer m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by p squared.\" So m=134 is the minimal such m.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{134}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest prime number p such that there exists some positive integer n where p squared divides n^4 +1. Then, once I find that prime p, I have to find the smallest positive integer m where m^4 +1 is divisible by p squared. Alright, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, primes where p squared divides n^4 +1. That means n^4 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2. Hmm, so n^8 \u2261 1 mod p\u00b2. Because if n^4 \u2261 -1, then squaring both sides gives n^8 \u2261 1 mod p\u00b2. So the order of n modulo p\u00b2 must divide 8 but not divide 4, right? Wait, but actually, the multiplicative order of n modulo p\u00b2 has to divide \u03c6(p\u00b2) which is p(p-1). Since \u03c6(p\u00b2) = p\u00b2 - p = p(p-1). So the order of n modulo p\u00b2 must divide both 8 and p(p-1). Hmm, but maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, since n^4 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2, then -1 must be a quartic residue modulo p\u00b2. I remember that for primes, certain conditions must hold. Let me recall that for -1 to be a quadratic residue mod p, p must be 1 mod 4. But here it's a quartic residue. Maybe similar conditions?\n\nFirst, perhaps start by checking small primes and see if their squares divide any n^4 +1. Maybe start with primes like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.\n\nStarting with p=2: Let's see if 2\u00b2=4 divides n^4 +1. Let's check n even or odd. If n is even, n^4 is 0 mod 4, so n^4 +1 \u22611 mod4. If n is odd, n^2 is 1 mod4, so n^4 = (n\u00b2)^2 \u22611 mod4, so n^4 +1 \u22612 mod4. Neither case gives 0 mod4. So 4 cannot divide n^4 +1. So p=2 is out.\n\nNext p=3: Check 9 divides n^4 +1. Let's compute n^4 mod9 for n from 0 to 8:\n\n0^4=0, 1^4=1, 2^4=16\u22617, 3^4=81\u22610, 4^4=(4^2)^2=16\u00b2\u22617\u00b2=49\u22614, 5^4\u2261(5 mod3=2)^4\u226116\u22617, 6^4\u22610, 7^4\u2261(7 mod3=1)^4\u22611, 8^4\u2261(8 mod3=2)^4\u226116\u22617 mod9.\n\nSo n^4 mod9 can be 0,1,4,7. Adding 1 gives 1,2,5,8 mod9. So none of those are 0 mod9. Thus 3 squared can't divide n^4+1. So p=3 is out.\n\np=5: Check 25 divides n^4 +1. Let me compute n^4 mod25.\n\nHmm, maybe better to see if there exists n with n^4 \u2261-1 mod25. Let's see. Let me try n from 1 to 24:\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Since 25 is 5\u00b2, and 5 is prime. Let's first check if -1 is a quartic residue mod5, then maybe mod25?\n\nFirst mod5: Let's see n^4 mod5. Since by Fermat's little theorem, n^4 \u22611 mod5 for n not divisible by 5. So n^4 mod5 is either 0 or 1. Thus, n^4 \u2261-1 mod5 would require -1 \u22611 mod5, which is false. So there is no solution mod5, so certainly none mod25. So p=5 is out.\n\np=7: Check 49 divides n^4 +1. First check mod7:\n\nAgain, by Fermat's little theorem, n^6 \u22611 mod7 for n not divisible by7. So n^4 \u2261n^{-2} mod7. So n^4 \u2261-1 mod7 implies n^{-2}\u2261-1 mod7, so n^2\u2261-1 mod7. Let's see if -1 is a quadratic residue mod7. Quadratic residues mod7 are 0,1,2,4. Since 3^2=9\u22612, 4^2=16\u22612, 5^2=25\u22614, etc. So -1 mod7 is 6, which is not a quadratic residue. Therefore, no solution mod7, so no mod49. So p=7 is out.\n\np=11: Let's see. First check mod11. Let's see if n^4 \u2261-1 mod11. Let me compute the quartic residues mod11. Since 11 is 3 mod4, so maybe different.\n\nFirst, compute n^4 mod11 for n from 1 to 10:\n\n1:1, 2:16\u22615, 3:81\u22614, 4:256\u2261256-22*11=256-242=14\u22613, 5:625 mod11: 625-56*11=625-616=9, 6:1296 mod11: 1296-118*11=1296-1298? Wait, 11*118=1298, so 1296 is 1298-2\u2261-2 mod11. But 6^4=(6\u00b2)^2=36\u00b2. 36 mod11 is 3, so 3\u00b2=9 mod11. Wait, so 6^4\u22619 mod11. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated earlier. Let me recalculate all:\n\n1^4=1 mod11.\n\n2^4=16 mod11=5.\n\n3^4=81 mod11=81-7*11=81-77=4.\n\n4^4=(4^2)^2=16\u00b2. 16 mod11 is 5, so 5\u00b2=25 mod11=3.\n\n5^4=(5\u00b2)^2=25\u00b2. 25 mod11=3, so 3\u00b2=9 mod11.\n\n6^4=(6\u00b2)^2=36\u00b2. 36 mod11=3, so 3\u00b2=9 mod11.\n\n7^4: 7\u00b2=49\u22615, so 5\u00b2=25\u22613 mod11.\n\n8^4: 8\u00b2=64\u22619 mod11, so 9\u00b2=81\u22614 mod11.\n\n9^4: 9\u00b2=81\u22614 mod11, so 4\u00b2=16\u22615 mod11.\n\n10^4:10\u00b2=100\u22611 mod11, so 1\u00b2=1 mod11.\n\nSo quartic residues mod11 are 1,3,4,5,9. So -1 mod11 is 10. 10 is not among these, so no solution mod11. Thus p=11 is out.\n\np=13: Let's check mod13 first. Check if n^4 \u2261-1 mod13.\n\nCompute n^4 mod13 for n=1 to 12.\n\n1:1, 2:16\u22613, 3:81\u22613 (since 13*6=78, 81-78=3), 4:256 mod13. 13*19=247, 256-247=9. 4^4=256\u22619 mod13.\n\n5:5^4=(5\u00b2)^2=25\u00b2. 25 mod13=12, so 12\u00b2=144\u22611 mod13.\n\n6^4=(6\u00b2)^2=36\u00b2. 36 mod13=10, 10\u00b2=100\u22619 mod13.\n\n7^4: 7\u00b2=49\u226110 mod13, so 10\u00b2=100\u22619 mod13.\n\n8^4:8\u00b2=64\u226112 mod13, so 12\u00b2=144\u22611 mod13.\n\n9^4:9\u00b2=81\u22613 mod13, so 3\u00b2=9 mod13.\n\n10^4:10\u00b2=100\u22619 mod13, so 9\u00b2=81\u22613 mod13.\n\n11^4:11\u00b2=121\u22614 mod13, so 4\u00b2=16\u22613 mod13.\n\n12^4:12\u00b2=144\u22611 mod13, so 1\u00b2=1 mod13.\n\nSo quartic residues mod13 are 1,3,9. So -1 mod13 is 12, which isn't in the list. So no solution mod13. So p=13 is out.\n\nHmm, moving on to p=17. Let me check mod17 first.\n\nFirst, quartic residues mod17. Let me compute n^4 mod17 for n=1 to 16:\n\n1:1\n\n2:16 mod17=16, 2^4=16\u2261-1 mod17? Wait, 2^4=16, so mod17 is 16\u2261-1. Wait, so 2^4\u2261-1 mod17. That's interesting.\n\nWait, so if n=2 mod17, then n^4 \u2261-1 mod17. So that means that mod17, there is a solution. So maybe mod17\u00b2?\n\nWait, so p=17 might be a candidate. Let me check whether there exists n such that 17\u00b2 divides n^4 +1.\n\nSo we need n^4 \u2261-1 mod17\u00b2. Since n\u22612 mod17 is a solution mod17, perhaps we can use Hensel's lemma to lift this solution mod17 to mod17\u00b2.\n\nHensel's lemma says that if f(n) \u22610 mod p and f\u2019(n) \u2261/ 0 mod p, then there's a unique lift mod p\u00b2. Here f(n)=n^4 +1. f\u2019(n)=4n\u00b3. At n\u22612 mod17, f\u2019(2)=4*(8)=32\u226132-17=15 mod17. Which is not 0 mod17, so Hensel's condition is satisfied. Therefore, there is a unique solution mod17\u00b2 congruent to 2 mod17. So there exists some n such that n\u22612 mod17 and n^4\u2261-1 mod17\u00b2. Therefore, p=17 is a prime where such n exists. So maybe 17 is the smallest such prime?\n\nWait, but before jumping to conclusion, let me check primes between 13 and 17. The next prime after 13 is 17, so 17 is the next candidate. Let me check p=17 first. Let me confirm whether there exists n with n^4 +1 divisible by 17\u00b2.\n\nLet me try to compute n=2 +17k. Let's compute (2+17k)^4 +1 mod17\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute (2+17k)^4 using binomial expansion:\n\n=2^4 + 4*2^3*(17k) + 6*2^2*(17k)^2 +4*2*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4\n\nBut mod17\u00b2, terms with (17k)^2 or higher will have 17\u00b2 factor, so mod17\u00b2, they are 0. So:\n\n\u2261 16 + 4*(8)*(17k) mod17\u00b2\n\n=16 + 32*17k mod17\u00b2\n\nBut 32 mod17 is 15, so 32*17k \u226115*17k mod17\u00b2.\n\nSo total expression is 16 +15*17k mod17\u00b2.\n\nWe want this \u2261 -1 mod17\u00b2, so:\n\n16 +15*17k \u2261 -1 mod17\u00b2\n\nSo 15*17k \u2261 -17 mod17\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by 17:\n\n15k \u2261 -1 mod17\n\nThus 15k \u226116 mod17.\n\nWe need to solve for k: 15k \u226116 mod17.\n\n15 inverse mod17: 15 and 17 coprime. 15x \u22611 mod17.\n\n15*? Let's see: 15*1=15, 15*2=30\u226113, 15*3=45\u226111, 15*4=60\u22619, 15*5=75\u226175-68=7, 15*6=90\u226190-85=5, 15*7=105\u2261105-102=3, 15*8=120\u2261120-119=1 mod17. So inverse is 8.\n\nThus k\u226116*8 mod17. 16*8=128 mod17: 17*7=119, 128-119=9. So k\u22619 mod17.\n\nTherefore, the solution mod17\u00b2 is n \u22612 +17*9 mod17\u00b2. 17*9=153. So 2+153=155. So n=155 mod17\u00b2. Therefore, n=155 is a solution. Let me check n=155:\n\nCompute 155^4 +1 mod289 (since 17\u00b2=289). Let me compute 155 mod17 is 155-9*17=155-153=2, so 155\u22612 mod17, which is consistent.\n\nNow, compute 155^4 mod289:\n\nWe can compute 155^2 first: 155^2 = (150+5)^2 =150\u00b2 + 2*150*5 +5\u00b2 =22500 +1500 +25=24025. Then mod289. Hmm, that's a big number. Maybe better to compute step by step mod289.\n\nAlternatively, note that 155=2 +17*9, so (2+17*9)^4 mod17\u00b2. Wait, but we already did this earlier and found that it's 16 +15*17*9 mod289.\n\nWait, let me compute 15*17*9: 15*9=135, 135*17=2295. Then 16 +2295 mod289.\n\n2295 divided by 289: 289*7=2023, 2295-2023=272. 272 +16=288. 288 mod289 is 288. So 288 mod289 is -1 mod289. So yes, 155^4 +1 \u2261-1 +1=0 mod289? Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, the expression was (2+17k)^4 +1 \u226116 +15*17k + ... \u226116 +15*17k mod289. Then we set that equal to -1 mod289. So 16 +15*17k \u2261-1 mod289 \u21d2 15*17k \u2261-17 mod289 \u21d2 15k \u2261-1 mod17 \u21d2 k\u22619 mod17. So when k=9, 15*9*17=1215. 1215 mod289: 289*4=1156, 1215-1156=59. So 16 +1215=1231 mod289. 1231-4*289=1231-1156=75. Hmm, that contradicts previous? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, perhaps my initial expansion was wrong. Let me recalculate (2+17k)^4 mod17\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute (2 +17k)^4:\n\nFirst, expand using binomial theorem:\n\n= 2^4 + 4*2^3*(17k) + 6*2^2*(17k)^2 + 4*2*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4\n\nNow, mod17\u00b2, terms with (17k)^2 or higher will have 17\u00b2, so they are 0 mod17\u00b2. So:\n\n\u2261 16 + 4*(8)*(17k) mod17\u00b2\n\n=16 + 32*17k mod17\u00b2\n\n32 mod17 is 15, so 32*17k mod17\u00b2 = (15*17k) mod17\u00b2\n\nThus total is 16 +15*17k mod17\u00b2.\n\nSet this equal to -1 mod17\u00b2:\n\n16 +15*17k \u2261 -1 mod17\u00b2 \u21d2 15*17k \u2261 -17 mod17\u00b2 \u21d2 divide both sides by 17:\n\n15k \u2261 -1 mod17 \u21d2 15k \u226116 mod17\n\nThen solving for k, as before, k\u22619 mod17. So k=9 gives:\n\n15*17*9 = 15*153=2295. 2295 mod289: 289*8=2312, so 2295-2312= -17 mod289. So 16 + (-17) mod289 is -1 mod289. Therefore, (2+17*9)^4 +1 \u2261-1 +1=0 mod289? Wait, no, (2+17k)^4 \u2261-1 mod289, so adding 1 gives 0 mod289. Wait, no:\n\nWait, (2+17k)^4 \u2261 -1 mod289 \u21d2 (2+17k)^4 +1 \u22610 mod289. Exactly. So that works. So n=2+17*9=155 is a solution. So p=17 is indeed a prime where p\u00b2 divides n^4 +1 for n=155. So 17 is a candidate.\n\nBut before confirming it's the smallest, let me check primes between 13 and 17. The primes between 13 and 17 are none, since 17 is next. Wait, primes: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17. So 17 is next. But let me check p=17 is indeed the smallest. Wait, let's check p=17 first, but perhaps check p= 17 is the first prime where n^4 \u2261-1 mod p\u00b2 exists.\n\nWait, let's check p= 7,11, etc. Wait, we already checked up to p=13 and they didn't work. So 17 is the first candidate.\n\nWait, let me check p= 17 is indeed the smallest. Let me check p= 17, and see if maybe a smaller prime was missed?\n\nWait, let me check p= 2,3,5,7,11,13 again quickly. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nFor p=2: n^4 +1 mod4. As before, even n gives 1 mod4, odd gives 2 mod4. So no.\n\np=3: mod9. The residues were 0,1,4,7. Adding 1 gives 1,2,5,8 mod9, none 0.\n\np=5: mod25. Since mod5 had no solutions, mod25 can't either.\n\np=7: mod49, since mod7 had no solutions, so mod49 can't.\n\np=11: mod121. Since mod11 had no solutions, mod121 can't.\n\np=13: mod169. Since mod13 had no solutions, mod169 can't.\n\nSo indeed, p=17 is the first prime where modp has a solution, so modp\u00b2 can have a solution via Hensel. So p=17 is the least prime.\n\nTherefore, now the question is to find the minimal m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by 17\u00b2=289, so the minimal m.\n\nEarlier, we found that n=155 is such a number. But is that the minimal m?\n\nWait, perhaps m=155 is the minimal, but maybe there's a smaller m.\n\nWait, when we used Hensel's lemma, we found the solution congruent to 2 mod17. The minimal positive solution would be the minimal n \u22612 mod17 where n^4 \u2261-1 mod17\u00b2. Since we found n=155, but 155 mod17 is 2, but 155 is 2+17*9. The minimal positive n would be the smallest positive integer in that congruence class. Since the solutions mod17\u00b2 are of the form 2 +17k where k\u22619 mod17. Wait, no, actually, the solution is unique mod17\u00b2. Because Hensel's lemma gives a unique solution mod17\u00b2 once you lift from mod17. So there's only one solution mod17\u00b2. Since we started with n\u22612 mod17, then the solution mod17\u00b2 is n\u2261155 mod289. Wait, no, 155 mod289 is the solution. Wait, 155 is less than 289? 17\u00b2 is 289, so 155 is less than that, so 155 is the minimal positive solution?\n\nWait, let me check m=155. Let me compute 155^4 +1 mod289.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 155 mod17 is 2, so 155^4 \u22612^4 mod17\u00b2? Wait no, but mod17\u00b2 it's supposed to be -1. Let me compute 155^4 mod289.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute 155^2 first:\n\n155 squared: 155*155. Let's compute:\n\n155^2 = (150 +5)^2 =150\u00b2 + 2*150*5 +5\u00b2 =22500 +1500 +25=24025.\n\nNow divide 24025 by 289 to find mod289.\n\nFirst, compute how many times 289 goes into 24025.\n\n289*80=23120. 24025-23120=905.\n\n289*3=867. 905-867=38. So total is 80+3=83, remainder 38.\n\nThus 155\u00b2 \u226138 mod289.\n\nNow compute (155^2)^2 mod289, which is 38\u00b2 mod289.\n\n38\u00b2=1444. Divide 1444 by289:\n\n289*4=1156. 1444-1156=288. 288 mod289 is 288. So 38\u00b2\u2261288 mod289.\n\nTherefore, 155^4 \u2261288 mod289. Thus 155^4 +1 \u2261288+1=289\u22610 mod289. Perfect, so that works.\n\nNow, is there a smaller m?\n\nThe solutions mod289 are congruent to 155 mod289. So the minimal positive integer is 155. But let me check if there is a smaller number between 1 and 155 that satisfies m^4\u2261-1 mod289.\n\nSuppose m is less than 155. Since m\u22612 mod17, the numbers congruent to 2 mod17 less than 155 are 2, 19, 36, 53, 70, 87, 104, 121, 138, 155. So the candidates are these numbers. Let's check m=2:\n\n2^4 +1 =16 +1=17 mod289. Not 0.\n\nm=19: 19 mod17=2. Let's compute 19^4 mod289.\n\n19^2=361 mod289=361-289=72. Then 72\u00b2=5184 mod289. 289*17=4913. 5184-4913=271. So 19^4\u2261271 mod289. 271+1=272\u22600 mod289.\n\nm=36: 36 mod17=36-2*17=2. So 36\u22612 mod17. Compute 36^4 mod289.\n\n36^2=1296 mod289: 289*4=1156, 1296-1156=140. 140\u00b2 mod289: 140\u00b2=19600. Divide by289: 289*67=19363, 19600-19363=237. So 36^4\u2261237 mod289. 237+1=238\u22600.\n\nm=53: 53 mod17=53-3*17=53-51=2. Compute 53^4 mod289.\n\n53^2=2809 mod289. 289*9=2601, 2809-2601=208. 208\u00b2 mod289: 208\u00b2=43264. Let me divide 43264 by289:\n\n289*149=289*(150-1)=289*150 -289=43350 -289=43061. 43264-43061=203. So 53^4\u2261203 mod289. 203+1=204\u22600.\n\nm=70: 70 mod17: 70-4*17=70-68=2. Compute 70^4 mod289.\n\n70\u00b2=4900 mod289. 289*16=4624. 4900-4624=276. 276\u00b2 mod289. 276\u00b2=76176. Let me compute mod289:\n\n289*263=289*(260+3)=289*260 +289*3. 289*260=289*200 +289*60=57800 +17340=75140. 289*3=867. Total 75140+867=76007. 76176-76007=169. So 276\u00b2\u2261169 mod289. Thus 70^4\u2261169 mod289. 169+1=170\u22600.\n\nm=87: 87 mod17=87-5*17=87-85=2. Compute 87^4 mod289.\n\n87\u00b2=7569 mod289. 289*26=7514. 7569-7514=55. 55\u00b2 mod289=3025 mod289. 289*10=2890. 3025-2890=135. So 87^4\u2261135 mod289. 135+1=136\u22600.\n\nm=104: 104 mod17=104-6*17=104-102=2. Compute 104^4 mod289.\n\n104\u00b2=10816 mod289. Let's see 289*37=289*(30+7)=8670 +2023=10693. 10816-10693=123. 123\u00b2 mod289. 123\u00b2=15129. 289*52=15028. 15129-15028=101. So 104^4\u2261101 mod289. 101+1=102\u22600.\n\nm=121: 121 mod17=121-7*17=121-119=2. Compute 121^4 mod289.\n\n121\u00b2=14641 mod289. Let's see 289*50=14450. 14641-14450=191. 191 mod289=191. 191\u00b2 mod289. 191\u00b2=36481. 289*126=36414. 36481-36414=67. So 121^4\u226167 mod289. 67+1=68\u22600.\n\nm=138: 138 mod17=138-8*17=138-136=2. Compute 138^4 mod289.\n\n138\u00b2=19044 mod289. Let me compute 289*65=18785. 19044-18785=259. 259 mod289 is 259. 259\u00b2 mod289. 259\u00b2=67081. 289*232=289*(200+32)=57800 +9248=67048. 67081-67048=33. So 138^4\u226133 mod289. 33+1=34\u22600.\n\nm=155: already checked, gives 0 mod289. So indeed, 155 is the smallest m in this sequence. Therefore, the minimal m is 155.\n\nWait, but let me check m= 2 mod17 but less than 155. Wait, all the numbers we checked less than 155 didn't work, so 155 is indeed the smallest. Therefore, the answer is 155 and the prime is 17. So the problem asks for the least prime p is 17, then the minimal m is 155. Therefore, the final answer is 155.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more if there is any m less than 155 that is not congruent to 2 mod17 but still satisfies m^4 \u2261-1 mod289. Since Hensel's lemma gives a unique solution mod289, so only numbers congruent to 2 mod17 can satisfy the equation mod289? Wait, perhaps not necessarily. Let me think.\n\nSuppose there exists another solution not congruent to 2 mod17. But since mod17, the only solutions to n^4\u2261-1 mod17 are n\u22612 and n\u2261-2 mod17 (since 2^4\u2261-1 mod17, so (-2)^4=16\u2261-1 mod17 as well). Wait, actually, let me check:\n\nWait, (-2)^4 mod17 is (15)^4 mod17. Let me compute 15^4 mod17. Since 15\u2261-2 mod17, so (-2)^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. So indeed, both 2 and 15 mod17 satisfy n^4\u2261-1 mod17.\n\nTherefore, there are two solutions mod17: 2 and 15. So perhaps lifting both of these mod17\u00b2?\n\nTherefore, maybe there's another solution congruent to 15 mod17. Let me check that.\n\nLet me try n\u226115 mod17. Let me see if there is a solution mod17\u00b2. Let me set n=15 +17k. Then compute n^4 +1 mod17\u00b2.\n\nExpand (15 +17k)^4:\n\n15^4 +4*15\u00b3*(17k) +6*15\u00b2*(17k)^2 +4*15*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.\n\nMod17\u00b2, terms with (17k)^2 or higher vanish. So:\n\n\u226115^4 +4*(15)^3*(17k) mod17\u00b2.\n\nCompute 15^4 mod17\u00b2. Since 15\u2261-2 mod17, so 15^4 \u2261(-2)^4=16 mod17. Wait, but mod17\u00b2, let me compute 15^4:\n\n15^2=225. 225 mod289 is 225.\n\n15^4=(15^2)^2=225\u00b2 mod289. 225\u00b2=50625. 289*175=289*(170+5)=289*170 +289*5. 289*170=49130, 289*5=1445. Total 49130+1445=50575. 50625-50575=50. So 15^4\u226150 mod289.\n\nThen, the linear term:4*(15)^3*(17k).\n\nFirst compute 15^3=3375. 3375 mod17\u00b2? Wait, let's compute mod17 first, but maybe better mod289:\n\n15^3=15*15*15=15*225=3375. 3375 mod289:\n\n289*11=3179. 3375-3179=196. So 15^3\u2261196 mod289.\n\nThus, 4*196*17k mod289.\n\nCompute 4*196=784. 784 mod289: 289*2=578, 784-578=206. 206 mod289. Then 206*17k mod289.\n\nSo total expression:\n\n15^4 +4*(15)^3*(17k) \u226150 +206*17k mod289.\n\nSet this equal to -1 mod289:\n\n50 +206*17k \u2261-1 mod289 \u21d2206*17k \u2261-51 mod289 \u21d2\n\nDivide both sides by17:\n\n206k \u2261-3 mod17.\n\nCompute 206 mod17: 17*12=204, so 206\u22612 mod17. So equation is 2k \u2261-3 mod17 \u21d22k\u226114 mod17 \u21d2k\u22617 mod17 (since 2*7=14).\n\nTherefore, k=7 mod17. Thus the solution mod17\u00b2 is n=15 +17k=15 +17*7=15+119=134 mod289.\n\nSo n=134 is another solution. Let me check m=134.\n\nCheck 134^4 +1 mod289.\n\nCompute 134 mod17=134-7*17=134-119=15 mod17, which is correct.\n\nCompute 134^4 mod289:\n\nFirst compute 134 squared mod289. 134^2=17956 mod289. Let me divide 17956 by289:\n\n289*62=289*(60+2)=17340 +578=17918. 17956-17918=38. So 134^2\u226138 mod289.\n\nThen 38^2 mod289 is same as before: 38\u00b2=1444 mod289. 1444-289*4=1444-1156=288 mod289. So 134^4\u2261288 mod289. Thus 288+1=289\u22610 mod289. So that works.\n\nTherefore, m=134 is another solution. Now, 134 is less than 155, so maybe 134 is the minimal m?\n\nWait, 134 is smaller than 155. Let me check if there are smaller m between 1 and 134.\n\nThe solutions mod289 are n\u22612 mod17 and n\u226115 mod17 lifted to mod289, giving n\u2261155 mod289 and n\u2261134 mod289? Wait, actually, the two solutions mod289 are 155 and 134? Wait, no, actually each congruence mod17 lifts to a unique solution mod289. So there are two solutions mod289: one \u22612 mod17 (which is 155 mod289) and one \u226115 mod17 (which is 134 mod289).\n\nTherefore, the minimal m is the smaller of 134 and 155, so 134. Wait, but is 134 the minimal?\n\nWait, let's check m=134. But are there smaller numbers congruent to 15 mod17?\n\nNumbers congruent to 15 mod17 less than 134 are: 15, 32, 49, 66, 83, 100, 117, 134.\n\nCheck these:\n\nStart with m=15:\n\n15^4 mod289. As before, 15^4=50 mod289. 50+1=51\u22600.\n\nm=32: 32 mod17= 32-17=15. Compute 32^4 mod289.\n\n32^2=1024 mod289. 289*3=867. 1024-867=157. 157^2 mod289. 157\u00b2=24649. 289*85=24565. 24649-24565=84. So 32^4\u226184 mod289. 84+1=85\u22600.\n\nm=49: 49 mod17=49-2*17=15. Compute 49^4 mod289.\n\n49^2=2401 mod289. 289*8=2312. 2401-2312=89. 89\u00b2 mod289. 89\u00b2=7921. 289*27=7803. 7921-7803=118. So 49^4\u2261118 mod289. 118+1=119\u22600.\n\nm=66: 66 mod17=66-3*17=15. Compute 66^4 mod289.\n\n66\u00b2=4356 mod289. 289*15=4335. 4356-4335=21. 21\u00b2=441 mod289. 441-289=152. So 66^4\u2261152 mod289. 152+1=153\u22600.\n\nm=83: 83 mod17=83-4*17=15. Compute 83^4 mod289.\n\n83\u00b2=6889 mod289. 289*23=6647. 6889-6647=242 mod289. 242 mod289 is 242. 242\u00b2 mod289. 242\u00b2=58564. 289*202=58378. 58564-58378=186. So 83^4\u2261186 mod289. 186+1=187\u22600.\n\nm=100:100 mod17=100-5*17=100-85=15. Compute 100^4 mod289.\n\n100\u00b2=10000 mod289. 289*34=9826. 10000-9826=174. 174\u00b2 mod289. 174\u00b2=30276. 289*104=289*(100+4)=28900+1156=30056. 30276-30056=220 mod289. 220 mod289 is 220. So 100^4\u2261220 mod289. 220+1=221\u22600.\n\nm=117:117 mod17=117-6*17=117-102=15. Compute 117^4 mod289.\n\n117\u00b2=13689 mod289. 289*47=13583. 13689-13583=106. 106\u00b2 mod289. 106\u00b2=11236. 289*38=10982. 11236-10982=254 mod289. So 117^4\u2261254 mod289. 254+1=255\u22600.\n\nm=134: already checked, gives 0 mod289. So 134 is the minimal m congruent to15 mod17. Therefore, between 134 and 155, the minimal is 134.\n\nWait, so 134 is smaller than 155. But is there any smaller m?\n\nWait, let me check m=134 is indeed the smallest. Since all the numbers less than 134 congruent to 2 or15 mod17 were checked and none worked, then 134 is the smallest.\n\nWait, but let me confirm m=134. Let me compute 134^4 +1 mod289 again:\n\n134 mod17 is 15, so 15^4 mod17 is -1, so mod289, as above, we had 134^4 \u2261288 mod289, so +1 is 289\u22610 mod289. So correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal m is 134. Wait, but why did Hensel's lemma give me 155 when I started with n\u22612 mod17, but the other solution starting from n\u226115 mod17 gives 134, which is smaller. So the minimal m is 134.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake earlier. I thought the first solution was 155, but there is another solution at 134. Therefore, 134 is smaller. So the minimal m is 134.\n\nWait, but let me check if there is any m less than 134. Let me see.\n\nWait, 134 is the first in its congruence class (15 mod17) to satisfy the equation. The numbers before it in that class were 15,32,... up to 134, none worked. Similarly for the other congruence class (2 mod17), the first solution was 155. Therefore, 134 is indeed the smallest.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 134. Wait, but I need to make sure I didn't miss any other congruence classes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other solutions not congruent to 2 or 15 mod17? Let me see.\n\nSuppose there is some m not congruent to 2 or15 mod17, but m^4\u2261-1 mod289. Then mod17, m^4\u2261-1 mod17, which requires m\u22612 or15 mod17. Therefore, all solutions mod289 must be \u22612 or15 mod17. Therefore, the minimal solution is the smaller of the two lifted solutions, which are 134 and155. So 134 is smaller.\n\nThus, the minimal m is 134. Therefore, I need to correct my previous conclusion.\n\nWait, so my mistake was not considering the other solution from 15 mod17. So the minimal m is 134.\n\nWait, but let me check again the calculation for m=134.\n\nCompute m=134:\n\n134 divided by17 is 7*17=119, so 134=7*17 +15. So mod17 is15.\n\nCompute 134^4 mod289:\n\nFirst, 134 mod289 is134. Let me compute 134^2:\n\n134*134: 130\u00b2=16900, 2*130*4=1040, 4\u00b2=16. So total 16900+1040+16=17956. As before, mod289:\n\n289*62=17918. 17956-17918=38. So 134\u00b2\u226138 mod289.\n\nThen 38^2 mod289: 38\u00b2=1444. 289*5=1445, so 1444 mod289 is -1 mod289 (since 1444=1445-1). So 38\u00b2\u2261-1 mod289. Therefore, 134^4\u2261(38)^2\u2261-1 mod289. Therefore, 134^4 +1\u22610 mod289. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, m=134 works, and it's smaller than 155. So 134 is the minimal m.\n\nWait, so why did I get 155 earlier? Because I considered only the solution starting from 2 mod17, but the solution from 15 mod17 gives a smaller number. Therefore, the minimal m is 134.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 134.\n\nBut let me double-check if there is any m less than134.\n\nWait, 134 is the first in its congruence class (15 mod17) that works, so there are none smaller. Let me check m= 15 mod17:\n\nNumbers less than134 congruent to15 mod17: 15,32,49,66,83,100,117,134. All of these when tested didn't work except 134. So yes, 134 is the smallest.\n\nTherefore, the minimal m is 134. So I need to adjust my previous conclusion. So the prime is 17, and minimal m is134.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal solution is 134. Let me see if 134^4 +1 is divisible by289.\n\n134^4 +1 = (134^2)^2 +1 = (38)^2 +1 mod289? Wait, no. Wait, 134^2 mod289 is38, so 38 squared mod289 is -1. So 38\u00b2 is-1 mod289, so 134^4= (134\u00b2)^2\u2261(-1) mod289. Therefore, 134^4 +1\u2261-1+1=0 mod289. Correct.\n\nTherefore, yes, 134 is the minimal m. So the answer should be 134.\n\nWait, but why did I get 155 earlier? Because when I started with n\u22612 mod17, the solution mod289 is 2 +17k where k=9, giving 155. But the other solution from n\u226115 mod17 gives k=7, leading to 15+17*7=134.\n\nSo both solutions exist, and the minimal is 134.\n\nTherefore, the correct minimal m is 134.\n\nHmm, so I need to ensure that I didn't miss anything else. Let me confirm that 134 is indeed the smallest.\n\nWait, let me check m= 134 is indeed the smallest. Since 134 is the first one in its congruence class, and the other congruence class's first solution is 155, so 134 is smaller. Therefore, the answer is 134.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because different steps led to different answers, but upon considering both congruence classes, 134 is the minimal. So the correct answer should be 134.\n\nWait, but let me see if there's any mistake in calculations for m=134.\n\nCompute 134^4 +1:\n\nLet me compute 134^2 first:\n\n134 *134 = 17956. 17956 divided by289:\n\n289*62 = 289*(60+2)=289*60 +289*2 =17340 +578=17918. 17956 -17918 =38. So 134^2 =38 mod289.\n\nThen 38 squared is 38*38=1444. 1444 divided by289: 289*5=1445, so 1444= -1 mod289. Therefore, 38\u00b2 \u2261-1 mod289. Therefore, 134^4 \u2261-1 mod289. So indeed, 134^4 +1 \u22610 mod289.\n\nTherefore, 134 is correct. So my initial mistake was not considering the other solution from the 15 mod17 congruence.\n\nTherefore, the minimal m is 134. So the answer should be 134.\n\nWait, but let me check once more for any possible m smaller than134.\n\nSuppose someone claims m= something smaller like 47 or something. Let me check m= something like 24 mod17?\n\nWait, but any m must be congruent to 2 or15 mod17. So numbers not in those congruence classes can't work. So between the two congruence classes, the smallest solution is 134.\n\nTherefore, I think 134 is the correct minimal m. So I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 155. Therefore, the correct answer is 134.\n\nWait, but I need to check again the question. The problem says \"the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 +1 is divisible by p squared\". We found p=17, and then the minimal m is 134. So the final answer is 134.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm with another method. Let me compute 134^4 +1 divided by289.\n\n134^4 +1 = (134^2)^2 +1 =38^2 +1 mod289? Wait no, 38^2 is 1444, which is -1 mod289. So 38^2 +1 is 0 mod289. So yes.\n\nAlternatively, compute 134^4 +1 = (134^2)^2 +1 = (38)^2 +1 mod289 = (-1) +1=0 mod289.\n\nYes, so it works.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, the minimal m is 134. Therefore, the answer is 134.\n\nWait, but I need to check if 134 is indeed the minimal. Since 134 is the first in its congruence class and the other solution is 155, which is higher, then yes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{134}\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because I initially thought 155, but after considering both congruence classes, it's 134. Let me see if the problem specifies anything else.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the least prime number p for which there exists a positive integer n such that p squared divides n^4 +1\". We found p=17. Then \"Find the least positive integer m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by p squared.\" So m=134 is the minimal such m.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{134}\n\n\nTo find the smallest prime \\( p \\) such that there exists a positive integer \\( n \\) where \\( p^2 \\) divides \\( n^4 + 1 \\), we start by checking small primes:\n\n- For primes \\( p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 \\), we find that none of them satisfy the condition \\( n^4 \\equiv -1 \\mod p^2 \\).\n- For \\( p = 17 \\), we check if \\( n^4 \\equiv -1 \\mod 17 \\).

Using Hensel's lemma, we lift this solution to modulo \\( 17^2 \\).\n\nUsing Hensel's lemma for \\( n \\equiv 2 \\mod 17 \\):\n- We expand \\( (2 + 17k)^4 \\mod 17^2 \\) and find \\( k \\equiv 9 \\mod 17 \\). This gives \\( n = 2 + 17 \\cdot 9 = 155 \\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\( n \\equiv 15 \\mod 17 \\) (since \\( 15 \\equiv -2 \\mod 17 \\)):\n- We expand \\( (15 + 17k)^4 \\mod 17^2 \\) and find \\( k \\equiv 7 \\mod 17 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest prime number p where there exists a positive integer n such that p squared divides n^4 + 1. Then, once I find that prime p, I have to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the smallest prime p where p\u00b2 divides n\u2074 + 1 for some n. Then, once I know that prime, find the minimal m that satisfies the condition.\n\nStarting with the first part: finding the smallest prime p where p\u00b2 divides n\u2074 + 1. Let me recall some number theory here. For a prime p, we want p\u00b2 divides n\u2074 + 1. That means n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2. So, n\u2078 \u2261 1 mod p\u00b2, right? Because if n\u2074 \u2261 -1, then squaring both sides gives n\u2078 \u2261 1 mod p\u00b2. So n has order 8 modulo p\u00b2? Or maybe divides the order? Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of orders.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to first consider primes where n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p has a solution. For that to be possible, -1 must be a quartic residue modulo p. The existence of solutions to n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p would require that the multiplicative group mod p has an element of order 8, since n\u2074 = -1 implies that n^8 = 1. So the multiplicative group mod p must have an element of order 8. The multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1, so 8 must divide p-1. Therefore, primes p \u2261 1 mod 8 would satisfy that. So primes congruent to 1 mod 8 can have solutions to n^4 \u2261 -1 mod p.\n\nTherefore, primes p \u2261 1 mod 8 are candidates. But we need p\u00b2 dividing n\u2074 +1, so the solution modulo p must lift to a solution modulo p\u00b2. Maybe Hensel's lemma can be used here? Wait, Hensel's lemma is about lifting solutions from mod p to mod p\u00b2, but it requires that the derivative is not congruent to 0 mod p. Let me recall Hensel's lemma: if f(a) \u2261 0 mod p and f'(a) not \u2261 0 mod p, then there is a unique lift mod p\u00b2. But here, f(n) = n\u2074 +1. So f'(n) = 4n\u00b3. So if we have a solution n \u2261 k mod p, such that k\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p, then to lift it to mod p\u00b2, we need that 4k\u00b3 not \u2261 0 mod p. Since p is prime and k is not 0 mod p (since k\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p), then 4k\u00b3 mod p is non-zero. Therefore, Hensel's lemma tells us that there exists a unique solution mod p\u00b2. Therefore, if there exists a solution mod p, then there exists a solution mod p\u00b2. Wait, so actually, for primes p where n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p has a solution, then there exists a solution mod p\u00b2? So then, does that mean that for primes p \u2261 1 mod 8, there exists an n such that p\u00b2 divides n\u2074 +1? Wait, but maybe there's an exception here? Let me check with small primes first.\n\nLet me check primes congruent to 1 mod 8. The smallest such primes are 17, 41, 73, 89, etc. Let me see starting with 17. Let's check if 17 squared divides n\u2074 +1 for some n.\n\nFirst, let's see what n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod 17. Let me compute n\u2074 mod 17 for n from 1 to 16.\n\nAlternatively, since 17 is 1 mod 8, there should be solutions. Let me find n such that n^4 \u2261 -1 mod 17. Let's try n= 4: 4^4 = 256 mod 17. 256 divided by 17: 17*15=255, so 256 \u22611 mod17. Not -1. Hmm. Let's try n= 2: 2^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. Wait, 2^4 is 16, which is indeed -1 mod17. So n=2 mod17 gives n^4 \u2261 -1 mod17. So then, according to Hensel's lemma, we can lift this solution to mod 17\u00b2=289. Let's check if there exists an integer m such that m^4 \u2261 -1 mod 289. Let me try m = 2 + 17k. Let me compute (2 +17k)^4 mod 289. Let me expand this:\n\n(2 +17k)^4 = 16 + 4*(2)^3*(17k) + 6*(2)^2*(17k)^2 + 4*(2)*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.\n\nBut mod 289, since 17\u00b2=289, terms with 17^2 or higher can be simplified. Let's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 16 mod 289 is 16.\n\nSecond term: 4*(8)*(17k) = 32*17k = 544k. But mod289, 544 mod289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255. So 544k \u2261255k mod289.\n\nThird term: 6*(4)*(17k)^2 = 24*(289k\u00b2). Since 289 is 0 mod289, so this term is 0 mod289.\n\nFourth term: 4*(2)*(17k)^3 = 8*(4913k\u00b3). But 4913 is 17\u00b3, so mod289, since 17\u00b2 divides into 17\u00b3, so this term is 0 mod289.\n\nFifth term: (17k)^4 is obviously 0 mod289.\n\nTherefore, overall, (2 +17k)^4 \u226116 +255k mod289.\n\nWe want this \u2261 -1 mod289. So:\n\n16 +255k \u2261 -1 mod289\n\n255k \u2261 -17 mod289\n\n255k \u2261 272 mod289 (since -17 mod289 is 272)\n\nLet me compute 255 mod289 is 255, so equation is 255k \u2261272 mod289.\n\nLet me solve for k:\n\n255k \u2261272 mod289\n\nFirst, let's see if 255 and 289 are coprime. 289 is 17\u00b2, and 255 is 15*17, so gcd(255,289)=17. Hmm, so the equation 255k \u2261272 mod289 has solutions only if 17 divides 272. Let's check: 272 divided by 17 is 16, yes. So solutions exist.\n\nSo divide the equation by 17: 15k \u226116 mod(289/17)=17. Wait, 289 divided by 17 is 17. So mod17:\n\n255/17=15, 272/17=16, so equation becomes 15k \u226116 mod17.\n\nSo 15k \u226116 mod17. Let's solve for k mod17.\n\n15 inverse mod17: since 15* 10=150\u2261150-8*17=150-136=14 mod17. Not 1. Let's try 15*13=195 mod17: 17*11=187, 195-187=8. 15*7=105 mod17: 105-6*17=105-102=3. Hmm, maybe 15* x \u22611 mod17. Let me try 15* 16 mod17: 15*16=240, 240 mod17: 17*14=238, so 240-238=2. 15*13=195, 195-11*17=195-187=8. Hmm, maybe I need to compute inverse properly. Let me use the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nFind x such that 15x \u22611 mod17.\n\n17 = 1*15 +2\n\n15 =7*2 +1\n\n2 =2*1 +0\n\nSo backtracking:\n\n1 =15 -7*2\n\nBut 2 =17 -1*15, so substitute:\n\n1 =15 -7*(17 -15) =15 -7*17 +7*15 =8*15 -7*17\n\nTherefore, 8*15 \u22611 mod17. So inverse of 15 mod17 is 8.\n\nTherefore, multiplying both sides of 15k \u226116 mod17 by 8:\n\nk \u226116*8 mod17\n\n16*8=128 mod17. 17*7=119, so 128-119=9 mod17.\n\nTherefore, k\u22619 mod17. So the solution is k=9 +17t for integer t.\n\nTherefore, going back, the minimal solution would be k=9, so m=2+17*9=2+153=155. Let's check m=155 mod289.\n\nWait, but let me check 155^4 +1 mod289. Hmm, but calculating 155^4 is tedious. Alternatively, since we already set up the equation:\n\nEarlier, (2 +17k)^4 \u226116 +255k mod289. So when k=9, 16 +255*9=16 +2295. 2295 divided by289: 289*8=2312, which is more than 2295. 289*7=2023, so 2295-2023=272. So total is 16+272=288\u2261-1 mod289. Yes! So that works. Therefore, m=2+17*9=155 is a solution mod289. So 155^4 +1 is divisible by17\u00b2. So 17 is a candidate for p. But is it the smallest prime?\n\nWait, before jumping to conclusion, let me check primes smaller than17. The primes congruent to 1 mod8 are 17, 41, etc. The primes less than17 are 2,3,5,7,11,13. Let me check each of them to see if p\u00b2 divides n^4 +1 for some n.\n\nStarting with p=2. Let's see, n^4 +1 divisible by4. Let's see for n even or odd. If n is even, n^4 is even, so n^4 +1 is odd. So not divisible by2. If n is odd, n^4 is 1 mod2, so n^4 +1 \u22610 mod2, but mod4? Let's see. Let n be odd, n=2k+1. Then n^4 = (2k+1)^4 = 16k^4 + 32k^3 +24k\u00b2 +8k +1. So mod4, this is 0 +0 +0 +0 +1 mod4. So n^4 \u22611 mod4, so n^4 +1\u22612 mod4. So mod4 it's 2, so not divisible by4. So 2 squared can't divide n^4 +1. So p=2 is out.\n\nNext prime p=3. Let's see. Check if 9 divides n\u2074 +1. Let's compute n\u2074 mod9. The possible residues mod9 for n are 0-8. Let's compute n\u2074 mod9:\n\n0\u2074=0 mod9\n\n1\u2074=1\n\n2\u2074=16\u22617 mod9\n\n3\u2074=0\n\n4\u2074=(16)^2=256 mod9: 256/9=28*9=252, 256-252=4 mod9. Wait, 4\u2074 is (4)^4=256 mod9: 256 mod9 is 256-28*9=256-252=4 mod9.\n\n5\u2074: 5 mod9 is 5, so 5^4= (5\u00b2)^2=25\u00b2=625 mod9. 625 mod9: 625-69*9=625-621=4 mod9.\n\n6\u2074: same as (6 mod9)^4. 6^2=36\u22610 mod9, so 6^4=0 mod9.\n\n7\u2074: 7\u2261-2 mod9, so (-2)^4=16\u22617 mod9.\n\n8\u2074\u2261(-1)^4=1 mod9.\n\nSo n\u2074 mod9 can be 0,1,4,7. Then n\u2074 +1 mod9 would be 1,2,5,8. None of these are 0 mod9. So 9 can't divide n\u2074 +1. So p=3 is out.\n\np=5. Let's check 25 divides n^4 +1. Let's compute n^4 mod25. Maybe check possible residues. Let me see, maybe it's easier to see if n^4 \u2261-1 mod25. Let's see possible n. Let me try n from 1 to 24.\n\nAlternatively, note that 5 divides n^4 +1 implies n^4 \u2261-1 mod5. Let's see, mod5: n^4 mod5. By Fermat's little theorem, n^4 \u22611 mod5 if n not divisible by5. So n^4 \u22611 mod5. So 1\u2261-1 mod5? That would require 2\u22610 mod5, which is impossible. So actually, there is no solution mod5 except if n is divisible by5, but then n^4\u22610 mod5, so n^4 +1\u22611 mod5. So no solution mod5. Wait, so actually, 5 can't divide n^4 +1? Wait, but that contradicts my initial thought. Wait, so if 5 divides n^4 +1, then n^4 \u2261-1 mod5, but n^4 mod5 is always 0 or1. So unless -1 mod5 is 4, so 4\u2261n^4 mod5. But n^4 can only be 0 or1 mod5. So no solution. Therefore, 5 can't divide n^4 +1, so p=5 is out.\n\np=7. Let's see if 7\u00b2 divides n\u2074 +1. First check mod7. Let's see if there exists n with n\u2074\u2261-1 mod7. Let's compute n\u2074 mod7 for n=1 to6.\n\n1^4=1 mod7\n\n2^4=16\u22612 mod7\n\n3^4=81\u22614 mod7\n\n4^4=(16)^2\u22612^2=4 mod7\n\n5^4\u2261(5 mod7)^4= (5^2)^2=25\u00b2\u22614\u00b2=16\u22612 mod7\n\n6^4\u2261(-1)^4=1 mod7\n\nSo n\u2074 mod7 is 1,2,4. So -1 mod7 is 6. Since none of the residues are 6 mod7, so there's no solution mod7. Therefore, 7 can't divide n\u2074 +1, so p=7 is out.\n\np=11. Let's check mod11. First check if n^4 \u2261-1 mod11. Let's compute n\u2074 mod11 for n=1 to10.\n\n1^4=1\n\n2^4=16\u22615 mod11\n\n3^4=81\u22614 mod11\n\n4^4=256\u2261256-23*11=256-253=3 mod11\n\n5^4=625 mod11: 11*56=616, so 625-616=9 mod11.\n\n6^4= (6^2)^2=36\u00b2\u22613\u00b2=9 mod11.\n\nWait, 6^2 is 36\u22613 mod11, so 6^4 is (3)^2=9 mod11.\n\n7^4\u2261(7 mod11)^4. 7^2=49\u22615 mod11, so 7^4\u22615\u00b2=25\u22613 mod11.\n\n8^4\u2261(8 mod11)^4. 8^2=64\u22619 mod11, so 8^4\u22619\u00b2=81\u22614 mod11.\n\n9^4\u2261(9 mod11)^4. 9^2=81\u22614 mod11, so 9^4\u22614\u00b2=16\u22615 mod11.\n\n10^4\u2261(-1)^4=1 mod11.\n\nSo n\u2074 mod11 gives 1,5,4,3,9,9,3,4,5,1. So none of these are equal to -1 mod11 (which is 10). Therefore, no solution mod11, so p=11 can't divide n^4 +1, so p=11 is out.\n\np=13. Let's check mod13. First see if n^4 \u2261-1 mod13. Let's compute n^4 mod13 for n=1 to12.\n\n1^4=1 mod13\n\n2^4=16\u22613 mod13\n\n3^4=81\u226181-6*13=81-78=3 mod13\n\n4^4=256 mod13. 13*19=247, so 256-247=9 mod13.\n\n5^4=625 mod13. 13*48=624, so 625\u22611 mod13.\n\n6^4=(6^2)^2=36\u00b2\u226110\u00b2=100\u22619 mod13.\n\n7^4\u2261(7 mod13)^4. 7\u00b2=49\u226110 mod13, so 7^4\u226110\u00b2=100\u22619 mod13.\n\n8^4\u2261(-5)^4\u22615^4\u2261 same as 5^4=1 mod13.\n\n9^4\u2261(-4)^4\u22614^4=256\u22619 mod13.\n\n10^4\u2261(-3)^4\u22613^4\u22613 mod13.\n\n11^4\u2261(-2)^4\u22612^4\u22613 mod13.\n\n12^4\u2261(-1)^4\u22611 mod13.\n\nSo n\u2074 mod13 can be 1,3,9. -1 mod13 is 12. None of the residues are 12. So no solution mod13. So p=13 is out.\n\nTherefore, the next prime is 17. We saw earlier that n=2 mod17 gives n^4\u2261-1 mod17, and we can lift this to mod17\u00b2 via Hensel's lemma, resulting in m=155 as a solution. Therefore, 17 is the smallest prime where p\u00b2 divides n\u2074+1 for some n. So p=17 is our prime.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the least positive integer m such that m\u2074 +1 is divisible by p\u00b2 (which is 17\u00b2). So we need the minimal m where m\u2074 \u2261-1 mod289. Earlier, we found that m=155 is such a number. But is there a smaller m?\n\nWait, in the lifting process, we found that m=2 +17k, with k=9 gives m=155. But perhaps there is a smaller k?\n\nWait, in the equation 255k \u2261 -17 mod289, which simplifies to 15k \u226116 mod17. The solution was k\u22619 mod17. So the minimal positive k is 9, so the minimal m would be 2+17*9=155. But maybe there's another solution with smaller k? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the equation 255k \u2261272 mod289, the solution k must be congruent to 9 mod17. So the minimal positive k is 9. Therefore, the minimal m is 2+17*9=155. But perhaps there is a smaller m that is congruent to 2 mod17 but with a different solution?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another solution mod17? Wait, the original equation mod17 had solutions n\u22612 mod17 and n\u2261-2 mod17 (since (-2)^4 is also 16\u2261-1 mod17). So maybe the other solution would be n\u2261-2 mod17, which is 15 mod17. Let me try that.\n\nLet me see if starting with n\u226115 mod17 can give a smaller m. Let me try m=15 +17k. Let me compute (15 +17k)^4 mod289.\n\nSimilarly to before, expand (15 +17k)^4 mod289.\n\nFirst term: 15^4. Let me compute 15^4 mod289. 15\u00b2=225, so 15^4=225\u00b2. 225 mod289 is 225. 225\u00b2 mod289: let's compute 225*225. Hmm, this might be tedious. Alternatively, since we know that 15\u2261-2 mod17, so maybe similar to the previous case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the expansion:\n\n(15 +17k)^4 = 15^4 + 4*15^3*(17k) + 6*15\u00b2*(17k)^2 + 4*15*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.\n\nAgain, mod289:\n\n15^4 mod289. Let's compute 15\u00b2=225. 15^4=225\u00b2. 225 mod289 is 225. 225\u00b2 = 50625. Let's divide 50625 by289. 289*175=289*(170+5)=289*170=49130, plus 289*5=1445, total 49130+1445=50575. 50625-50575=50. So 15^4 \u226150 mod289.\n\nThen 4*15^3*(17k). Let's compute 15^3=3375. 3375 mod289: 289*11=3179. 3375-3179=196. So 15^3\u2261196 mod289.\n\nThus 4*196*17k =4*196=784, 784*17k. Let me compute 784 mod289: 289*2=578, 784-578=206. So 784\u2261206 mod289. So 206*17k mod289. 206*17= 3502. 3502 mod289: Let's divide 3502 by289. 289*12=3468. 3502-3468=34. So 206*17\u226134 mod289. Therefore, this term is 34k mod289.\n\nNext term: 6*15\u00b2*(17k)^2. 15\u00b2=225. (17k)^2=289k\u00b2\u22610 mod289. So this term is 0 mod289.\n\nSimilarly, the remaining terms are 0 mod289.\n\nTherefore, overall, (15+17k)^4 \u226150 +34k mod289.\n\nWe want this \u2261-1 mod289, so 50 +34k \u2261-1 mod289 \u21d2 34k \u2261-51 mod289 \u21d2 34k \u2261238 mod289 (since -51 mod289 is 238).\n\nSo 34k \u2261238 mod289. Let's divide both sides by gcd(34,289). Since 289=17\u00b2, gcd(34,289)=17. 238 divided by17: 17*14=238. So yes, 17 divides 238. So divide equation by17: 2k \u226114 mod17 (since 289/17=17). So 2k \u226114 mod17 \u21d2 k\u22617 mod17/ gcd(2,17). Since gcd(2,17)=1, so k\u22617 mod17. Therefore, the minimal k is7. So m=15+17*7=15+119=134. Let me check m=134.\n\nCompute 134 mod289 is 134. Let me check 134^4 mod289. Alternatively, using the expression above, with k=7:\n\n50 +34*7 =50 +238=288\u2261-1 mod289. So yes, that works. So m=134 is another solution. Since 134 is smaller than155, so 134 is smaller. Hmm, so perhaps 134 is the minimal m?\n\nWait, so there are two solutions mod289: one from starting with n\u22612 mod17 (giving m=155) and one from starting with n\u226115 mod17 (giving m=134). Since 134 is smaller than155, so 134 is better.\n\nIs there an even smaller m? Let's see. Let me check if there are smaller k for each case.\n\nFor the first case (starting with n=2 mod17), the minimal k was 9, leading to m=155. The second case (starting with n=15 mod17) gave k=7 leading to m=134. Let me see if there's another solution with smaller k.\n\nWait, but in the second case, the minimal k is 7 mod17. The smallest k is 7, so m=15+17*7=134. But could there be a negative k? For example, if k= -10 mod17, but then k would be negative, but m must be positive. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another solution with a different residue mod17? Wait, but we considered both residues that satisfy n^4\u2261-1 mod17, which are 2 and -2 (i.e.,15 mod17). So those are the only two residues mod17 that work, so lifting each gives one solution mod289. Therefore, the two solutions mod289 are 134 and 155. So between them, 134 is smaller. So the minimal m is 134?\n\nBut wait, let me check m=134. Let me compute 134^4 +1 mod289.\n\nAlternatively, as above, since we already derived that (15 +17k)^4 \u226150 +34k mod289. When k=7, that gives 50+238=288\u2261-1 mod289. So yes, so m=134 works.\n\nBut is there an even smaller m?\n\nWait, perhaps there are solutions not in the form of 2 +17k or 15 +17k? Wait, but Hensel's lemma says that the solution mod p\u00b2 is unique if the derivative is non-zero. Wait, but Hensel's lemma gives a unique solution mod p\u00b2 lifting from mod p. So for each solution mod p, there is a unique lift mod p\u00b2. Since mod p=17, there are two solutions: 2 and15 mod17. Therefore, lifting each gives a unique solution mod289, so those are the only two solutions mod289. So the minimal m between those is 134 and155, so 134 is smaller. But 134 is still bigger than 17, but maybe even smaller?\n\nWait, perhaps m=15? Let me check m=15 mod17. Let's compute 15^4 +1 mod289. Earlier, we saw that 15^4 mod289 was 50. 50+1=51 mod289\u22600. So that doesn't work. So m=15 is not a solution. Similarly, m=2: 2^4 +1=17, which is 17 mod289, so not 0 mod289. So indeed the minimal m is 134? Wait, but maybe there's a smaller m between 1 and134 that I haven't considered?\n\nAlternatively, let's see. Let me check m= 134-289= negative, so no. So 134 is the minimal positive. Wait, but let me check m= 134-17* something?\n\nWait, 134 is the minimal solution from the 15 mod17 side, so perhaps that's the smallest. Let me confirm with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since m must be \u22612 or15 mod17. So the numbers less than17 are 2 and15. But neither work mod289. The next numbers would be 2+17=19, 15+17=32, etc. Let me check m=15+17*1=32. Let's compute 32^4 +1 mod289.\n\n32 mod17 is 32-17=15, so similar to 15 mod17. Let me compute 32^4 mod289.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for (15+17k)^4 mod289 where k=1:\n\n(15 +17*1)^4 \u226150 +34*1=54 mod289. 54\u2261 not -1 mod289. So 54+1=55 mod289\u22600. So m=32 is not a solution. Hmm, so k=1 gives 50 +34=84 mod289, not -1. So only when k=7 do we get to -1.\n\nSimilarly, trying m=15+17*2=49. Let's compute with k=2: 50 +34*2=50+68=118 mod289. Not -1. So k must be 7. So m=134 is indeed the minimal from that side. Similarly, on the other side, starting with n=2 mod17, the first solution is at k=9, giving m=155. So 134 is smaller.\n\nTherefore, the minimal m is 134. Wait, but let me check if there's a smaller m from another solution? Let me see, perhaps m= 2 mod17 but with negative k? Wait, but k must be positive because m is positive. Let me see. Alternatively, maybe there's another solution path?\n\nWait, perhaps there's another prime smaller than17 where p\u00b2 divides n\u2074 +1? But we checked all primes below17 and they didn't work, so p=17 is indeed the smallest prime. Therefore, the minimal m is134?\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check m= 134. Let me compute m^4 +1 mod17\u00b2. Since 17\u00b2 is289, let me compute 134^4 mod289.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 134 mod289 is 134, so 134^2 = (130+4)^2=130\u00b2 + 2*130*4 +4\u00b2. 130\u00b2 mod289: 130 mod289 is130. 130\u00b2 =16900. 16900 divided by289: let's see 289*58=289*(50+8)=289*50=14450 +289*8=2312 \u2192 total 14450+2312=16762. 16900-16762=138. So 130\u00b2\u2261138 mod289.\n\nThen 2*130*4=1040 mod289. 289*3=867, 1040-867=173 mod289.\n\n4\u00b2=16 mod289.\n\nSo total 134\u00b2 \u2261138+173+16= 138+173=311, 311+16=327 mod289. 327-289=38 mod289. So 134\u00b2\u226138 mod289.\n\nThen 134^4=(134\u00b2)^2\u226138\u00b2 mod289. 38\u00b2=1444. 1444 divided by289: 289*5=1445, so 1444\u2261-1 mod289. So 38\u00b2\u2261-1 mod289. Therefore, 134^4\u2261-1 mod289. Therefore, 134^4 +1\u22610 mod289. So yes, that works.\n\nSo m=134 is indeed a solution. Now, is there a smaller m?\n\nLet me check m= 134-17=117. Let's see if 117 works. 117 mod17 is 117-6*17=117-102=15 mod17. So same as the other solution. Let me compute (15 +17*(6-1)) =15+17*5=15+85=100. Wait, m=117 is 15+17*6=15+102=117. Let's compute m=117 mod289.\n\nLet me compute 117^4 mod289. Alternatively, using the formula (15 +17k)^4 \u226150 +34k mod289. Here, k=6, so 50 +34*6=50 +204=254 mod289. 254 +1=255 mod289\u22600. So that's not a solution. So m=117 is not a solution. Similarly, m=134-17=117 is not a solution. So the next one below 134 would be m=134-2*17=100. Let me check m=100:\n\nUsing the formula, k=5: 50 +34*5=50+170=220 mod289. 220 +1=221\u22600. Not a solution.\n\nContinuing down, m=15+17*4= 15+68=83. Let me check k=4: 50+34*4=50+136=186 mod289. Not -1. Similarly, m=15+17*3=66: k=3 gives 50+102=152 mod289. Not -1.\n\nm=15+17*2=49: 50+68=118 mod289. Not.\n\nm=15+17*1=32: 50+34=84 mod289. Not.\n\nSo only at k=7 (134) do we get the solution. So 134 is indeed the smallest from that side.\n\nNow, let's check the other solution path starting from n=2 mod17. The minimal m there was 155. Let me see if there are smaller m in that sequence. The first term is m=2+17*9=155. The previous k would be 9-17= negative, which isn't allowed. The next lower k is 9-17= negative. Wait, k has to be at least 0? Wait, k is an integer such that m is positive, so starting from k=0 gives m=2, which doesn't work. k=1 gives m=19. Let me check m=19:\n\nUsing the formula (2 +17k)^4 mod289 where k=1: 16 +255*1=271 mod289. 271\u2261-18 mod289. Not -1. So not a solution. Similarly, k=2 gives 16+255*2=16+510=526 mod289. 526-289*1=237 mod289. Not -1. k=3: 16+765=781 mod289. 781-2*289=781-578=203 mod289. Not.\n\nContinuing until k=9 gives the first solution. So indeed, the first solution in that sequence is m=155.\n\nTherefore, between 134 and155, the minimal m is134. Therefore, the answer is134?\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem says \"the least positive integer m such that m\u2074 +1 is divisible by p\u00b2\", where p is the smallest prime for which such an m exists. Since we determined p=17, so p\u00b2=289, then the minimal m is134. But let me check if there's a smaller m than134 that I missed.\n\nWait, let me check m= 134-289= negative, so no. Let me check m= 134 divided by17 is about 7.9. Hmm, not sure. Wait, is there a number less than134 which is congruent to either2 or15 mod17, but gives m\u2074 \u2261-1 mod289?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a solution not in the residue classes mod17? But according to Hensel's lemma, all solutions must be lifts from the mod17 solutions. Since mod17 there are only two solutions, the lifts must be in those two residue classes mod17. Therefore, the minimal m must be the minimal in those two sequences, which is134.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be134?\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought of 155, but then found another solution at134. Let me confirm once again with actual computation for m=134:\n\nCompute 134^4 mod289:\n\nFirst, compute 134 mod289 is134.\n\n134 squared is (130 +4)^2 =130\u00b2 + 2*130*4 +4\u00b2. As before, 130\u00b2 mod289 was138, 2*130*4=1040 mod289 was173, and 4\u00b2=16. So total 138+173+16=327 mod289=327-289=38 mod289. So 134\u00b2\u226138 mod289.\n\nThen 134^4=(134\u00b2)^2=38\u00b2 mod289. 38 squared is 1444. Divided by289: 289*5=1445. So 1444=1445-1\u2261-1 mod289. Therefore, 38\u00b2\u2261-1 mod289. Therefore, 134^4\u2261-1 mod289, so 134^4 +1\u22610 mod289. Perfect, that works.\n\nTherefore, m=134 is indeed a solution, and it's the smallest such m. So the answer should be134.\n\nWait, but let me check m= 134 is the minimal. Let me check m= 134-17*7=134-119=15. But 15^4 mod289 is50, so 50+1=51 mod289\u22600. So no. So yes, 134 is indeed the smallest. Therefore, the final answer is134.\n\nBut wait, I just thought of another thing. The problem says \"the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n\u2074 +1 is divisible by p\u00b2\". We found that p=17 is the smallest such prime. Then, \"Find the least positive integer m such that m\u2074 +1 is divisible by p\u00b2\". So yes, so m=134.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm that there isn't a smaller prime that I missed. Wait, primes like 17 is the first prime \u22611 mod8. The next is 41, but since we checked primes below and they don't work, 17 is indeed the smallest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is m=134. Wait, but hold on, let me check once more with another method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal solution is smaller?\n\nWait, let me compute m= 134 divided by17 is 7.882..., so 134=17\u00d77 +15. So it's in the residue 15 mod17. So that's the second solution path. Since 134 is the first lift in that path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m= 17\u00d77 +15= 119+15=134, yes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m= 17\u00d7something plus 2?\n\nWait, for the 2 mod17 path, the first solution is at k=9, so 2+17\u00d79=155. So 155 is larger than134. So 134 is smaller.\n\nTherefore, I think 134 is the correct minimal m. So the final answer is 134. Wait, but let me check online if possible? Wait, maybe I can recall that the minimal solution for p=17 is 5772? Wait no, that's too big. Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation?\n\nWait, let me compute 134^4 +1 divided by289:\n\nWait, 134^4 = (134\u00b2)^2 = (38 mod289)^2 = (-1 mod289) as above. So 134^4 +1 \u2261-1+1=0 mod289. So it works.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 134^4 numerically:\n\n134^2 = 17956\n\n134^4 = (17956)^2. Let me compute 17956 squared mod289.\n\nBut that's tedious. Alternatively, since we already did mod289 steps above and it works, so it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 134. Wait, but I just found a contradiction in my mind. Because in some references, the minimal solution for 17^2 divides m^4 +1 is 5772, but that might be for a different problem. Wait, perhaps I messed up?\n\nWait, maybe my mistake is in the Hensel's lemma part. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, when I used Hensel's lemma for the case starting with n=2 mod17, we had the equation 255k \u2261-17 mod289. Then dividing by17 gives 15k\u2261-1 mod17 (since -17 mod289 divided by17 is -1 mod17). Wait, let me recheck the equations.\n\nOriginal equation after expanding (2+17k)^4 mod289:\n\nWe had 16 +255k \u2261-1 mod289 \u21d2255k \u2261-17 mod289.\n\n255 divided by17 is 15, and -17 mod289 is 272 mod289. So equation: 255k \u2261272 mod289.\n\nThen gcd(255,289)=17, so dividing equation by17:\n\n(255/17)k \u2261272/17 mod(289/17)\n\nWhich is 15k\u226116 mod17.\n\nAh, right. So 15k\u226116 mod17. So that's where that came from. Then the solution was k\u22619 mod17.\n\nSimilarly for the other case starting with 15 mod17, leading to equation 34k \u2261238 mod289. 34 and289 have gcd17, so dividing by17: 2k\u226114 mod17 \u21d2k\u22617 mod17.\n\nTherefore, calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal m is indeed134. So I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{134}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest prime number p where there exists a positive integer n such that p squared divides n^4 + 1. Then, once I find that prime p, I have to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the smallest prime p where p\u00b2 divides n\u2074 + 1 for some n. Then, once I know that prime, find the minimal m that satisfies the condition.\n\nStarting with the first part: finding the smallest prime p where p\u00b2 divides n\u2074 + 1. Let me recall some number theory here. For a prime p, we want p\u00b2 divides n\u2074 + 1. That means n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2. So, n\u2078 \u2261 1 mod p\u00b2, right? Because if n\u2074 \u2261 -1, then squaring both sides gives n\u2078 \u2261 1 mod p\u00b2. So n has order 8 modulo p\u00b2? Or maybe divides the order? Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of orders.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to first consider primes where n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p has a solution. For that to be possible, -1 must be a quartic residue modulo p. The existence of solutions to n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p would require that the multiplicative group mod p has an element of order 8, since n\u2074 = -1 implies that n^8 = 1. So the multiplicative group mod p must have an element of order 8. The multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1, so 8 must divide p-1. Therefore, primes p \u2261 1 mod 8 would satisfy that. So primes congruent to 1 mod 8 can have solutions to n^4 \u2261 -1 mod p.\n\nTherefore, primes p \u2261 1 mod 8 are candidates. But we need p\u00b2 dividing n\u2074 +1, so the solution modulo p must lift to a solution modulo p\u00b2. Maybe Hensel's lemma can be used here? Wait, Hensel's lemma is about lifting solutions from mod p to mod p\u00b2, but it requires that the derivative is not congruent to 0 mod p. Let me recall Hensel's lemma: if f(a) \u2261 0 mod p and f'(a) not \u2261 0 mod p, then there is a unique lift mod p\u00b2. But here, f(n) = n\u2074 +1. So f'(n) = 4n\u00b3. So if we have a solution n \u2261 k mod p, such that k\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p, then to lift it to mod p\u00b2, we need that 4k\u00b3 not \u2261 0 mod p. Since p is prime and k is not 0 mod p (since k\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p), then 4k\u00b3 mod p is non-zero. Therefore, Hensel's lemma tells us that there exists a unique solution mod p\u00b2. Therefore, if there exists a solution mod p, then there exists a solution mod p\u00b2. Wait, so actually, for primes p where n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p has a solution, then there exists a solution mod p\u00b2? So then, does that mean that for primes p \u2261 1 mod 8, there exists an n such that p\u00b2 divides n\u2074 +1? Wait, but maybe there's an exception here? Let me check with small primes first.\n\nLet me check primes congruent to 1 mod 8. The smallest such primes are 17, 41, 73, 89, etc. Let me see starting with 17. Let's check if 17 squared divides n\u2074 +1 for some n.\n\nFirst, let's see what n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod 17. Let me compute n\u2074 mod 17 for n from 1 to 16.\n\nAlternatively, since 17 is 1 mod 8, there should be solutions. Let me find n such that n^4 \u2261 -1 mod 17. Let's try n= 4: 4^4 = 256 mod 17. 256 divided by 17: 17*15=255, so 256 \u22611 mod17. Not -1. Hmm. Let's try n= 2: 2^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. Wait, 2^4 is 16, which is indeed -1 mod17. So n=2 mod17 gives n^4 \u2261 -1 mod17. So then, according to Hensel's lemma, we can lift this solution to mod 17\u00b2=289. Let's check if there exists an integer m such that m^4 \u2261 -1 mod 289. Let me try m = 2 + 17k. Let me compute (2 +17k)^4 mod 289. Let me expand this:\n\n(2 +17k)^4 = 16 + 4*(2)^3*(17k) + 6*(2)^2*(17k)^2 + 4*(2)*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.\n\nBut mod 289, since 17\u00b2=289, terms with 17^2 or higher can be simplified. Let's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 16 mod 289 is 16.\n\nSecond term: 4*(8)*(17k) = 32*17k = 544k. But mod289, 544 mod289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255. So 544k \u2261255k mod289.\n\nThird term: 6*(4)*(17k)^2 = 24*(289k\u00b2). Since 289 is 0 mod289, so this term is 0 mod289.\n\nFourth term: 4*(2)*(17k)^3 = 8*(4913k\u00b3). But 4913 is 17\u00b3, so mod289, since 17\u00b2 divides into 17\u00b3, so this term is 0 mod289.\n\nFifth term: (17k)^4 is obviously 0 mod289.\n\nTherefore, overall, (2 +17k)^4 \u226116 +255k mod289.\n\nWe want this \u2261 -1 mod289. So:\n\n16 +255k \u2261 -1 mod289\n\n255k \u2261 -17 mod289\n\n255k \u2261 272 mod289 (since -17 mod289 is 272)\n\nLet me compute 255 mod289 is 255, so equation is 255k \u2261272 mod289.\n\nLet me solve for k:\n\n255k \u2261272 mod289\n\nFirst, let's see if 255 and 289 are coprime. 289 is 17\u00b2, and 255 is 15*17, so gcd(255,289)=17. Hmm, so the equation 255k \u2261272 mod289 has solutions only if 17 divides 272. Let's check: 272 divided by 17 is 16, yes. So solutions exist.\n\nSo divide the equation by 17: 15k \u226116 mod(289/17)=17. Wait, 289 divided by 17 is 17. So mod17:\n\n255/17=15, 272/17=16, so equation becomes 15k \u226116 mod17.\n\nSo 15k \u226116 mod17. Let's solve for k mod17.\n\n15 inverse mod17: since 15* 10=150\u2261150-8*17=150-136=14 mod17. Not 1. Let's try 15*13=195 mod17: 17*11=187, 195-187=8. 15*7=105 mod17: 105-6*17=105-102=3. Hmm, maybe 15* x \u22611 mod17. Let me try 15* 16 mod17: 15*16=240, 240 mod17: 17*14=238, so 240-238=2. 15*13=195, 195-11*17=195-187=8. Hmm, maybe I need to compute inverse properly. Let me use the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nFind x such that 15x \u22611 mod17.\n\n17 = 1*15 +2\n\n15 =7*2 +1\n\n2 =2*1 +0\n\nSo backtracking:\n\n1 =15 -7*2\n\nBut 2 =17 -1*15, so substitute:\n\n1 =15 -7*(17 -15) =15 -7*17 +7*15 =8*15 -7*17\n\nTherefore, 8*15 \u22611 mod17. So inverse of 15 mod17 is 8.\n\nTherefore, multiplying both sides of 15k \u226116 mod17 by 8:\n\nk \u226116*8 mod17\n\n16*8=128 mod17. 17*7=119, so 128-119=9 mod17.\n\nTherefore, k\u22619 mod17. So the solution is k=9 +17t for integer t.\n\nTherefore, going back, the minimal solution would be k=9, so m=2+17*9=2+153=155. Let's check m=155 mod289.\n\nWait, but let me check 155^4 +1 mod289. Hmm, but calculating 155^4 is tedious. Alternatively, since we already set up the equation:\n\nEarlier, (2 +17k)^4 \u226116 +255k mod289. So when k=9, 16 +255*9=16 +2295. 2295 divided by289: 289*8=2312, which is more than 2295. 289*7=2023, so 2295-2023=272. So total is 16+272=288\u2261-1 mod289. Yes! So that works. Therefore, m=2+17*9=155 is a solution mod289. So 155^4 +1 is divisible by17\u00b2. So 17 is a candidate for p. But is it the smallest prime?\n\nWait, before jumping to conclusion, let me check primes smaller than17. The primes congruent to 1 mod8 are 17, 41, etc. The primes less than17 are 2,3,5,7,11,13. Let me check each of them to see if p\u00b2 divides n^4 +1 for some n.\n\nStarting with p=2. Let's see, n^4 +1 divisible by4. Let's see for n even or odd. If n is even, n^4 is even, so n^4 +1 is odd. So not divisible by2. If n is odd, n^4 is 1 mod2, so n^4 +1 \u22610 mod2, but mod4? Let's see. Let n be odd, n=2k+1. Then n^4 = (2k+1)^4 = 16k^4 + 32k^3 +24k\u00b2 +8k +1. So mod4, this is 0 +0 +0 +0 +1 mod4. So n^4 \u22611 mod4, so n^4 +1\u22612 mod4. So mod4 it's 2, so not divisible by4. So 2 squared can't divide n^4 +1. So p=2 is out.\n\nNext prime p=3. Let's see. Check if 9 divides n\u2074 +1. Let's compute n\u2074 mod9. The possible residues mod9 for n are 0-8. Let's compute n\u2074 mod9:\n\n0\u2074=0 mod9\n\n1\u2074=1\n\n2\u2074=16\u22617 mod9\n\n3\u2074=0\n\n4\u2074=(16)^2=256 mod9: 256/9=28*9=252, 256-252=4 mod9. Wait, 4\u2074 is (4)^4=256 mod9: 256 mod9 is 256-28*9=256-252=4 mod9.\n\n5\u2074: 5 mod9 is 5, so 5^4= (5\u00b2)^2=25\u00b2=625 mod9. 625 mod9: 625-69*9=625-621=4 mod9.\n\n6\u2074: same as (6 mod9)^4. 6^2=36\u22610 mod9, so 6^4=0 mod9.\n\n7\u2074: 7\u2261-2 mod9, so (-2)^4=16\u22617 mod9.\n\n8\u2074\u2261(-1)^4=1 mod9.\n\nSo n\u2074 mod9 can be 0,1,4,7. Then n\u2074 +1 mod9 would be 1,2,5,8. None of these are 0 mod9. So 9 can't divide n\u2074 +1. So p=3 is out.\n\np=5. Let's check 25 divides n^4 +1. Let's compute n^4 mod25. Maybe check possible residues. Let me see, maybe it's easier to see if n^4 \u2261-1 mod25. Let's see possible n. Let me try n from 1 to 24.\n\nAlternatively, note that 5 divides n^4 +1 implies n^4 \u2261-1 mod5. Let's see, mod5: n^4 mod5. By Fermat's little theorem, n^4 \u22611 mod5 if n not divisible by5. So n^4 \u22611 mod5. So 1\u2261-1 mod5? That would require 2\u22610 mod5, which is impossible. So actually, there is no solution mod5 except if n is divisible by5, but then n^4\u22610 mod5, so n^4 +1\u22611 mod5. So no solution mod5. Wait, so actually, 5 can't divide n^4 +1? Wait, but that contradicts my initial thought. Wait, so if 5 divides n^4 +1, then n^4 \u2261-1 mod5, but n^4 mod5 is always 0 or1. So unless -1 mod5 is 4, so 4\u2261n^4 mod5. But n^4 can only be 0 or1 mod5. So no solution. Therefore, 5 can't divide n^4 +1, so p=5 is out.\n\np=7. Let's see if 7\u00b2 divides n\u2074 +1. First check mod7. Let's see if there exists n with n\u2074\u2261-1 mod7. Let's compute n\u2074 mod7 for n=1 to6.\n\n1^4=1 mod7\n\n2^4=16\u22612 mod7\n\n3^4=81\u22614 mod7\n\n4^4=(16)^2\u22612^2=4 mod7\n\n5^4\u2261(5 mod7)^4= (5^2)^2=25\u00b2\u22614\u00b2=16\u22612 mod7\n\n6^4\u2261(-1)^4=1 mod7\n\nSo n\u2074 mod7 is 1,2,4. So -1 mod7 is 6. Since none of the residues are 6 mod7, so there's no solution mod7. Therefore, 7 can't divide n\u2074 +1, so p=7 is out.\n\np=11. Let's check mod11. First check if n^4 \u2261-1 mod11. Let's compute n\u2074 mod11 for n=1 to10.\n\n1^4=1\n\n2^4=16\u22615 mod11\n\n3^4=81\u22614 mod11\n\n4^4=256\u2261256-23*11=256-253=3 mod11\n\n5^4=625 mod11: 11*56=616, so 625-616=9 mod11.\n\n6^4= (6^2)^2=36\u00b2\u22613\u00b2=9 mod11.\n\nWait, 6^2 is 36\u22613 mod11, so 6^4 is (3)^2=9 mod11.\n\n7^4\u2261(7 mod11)^4. 7^2=49\u22615 mod11, so 7^4\u22615\u00b2=25\u22613 mod11.\n\n8^4\u2261(8 mod11)^4. 8^2=64\u22619 mod11, so 8^4\u22619\u00b2=81\u22614 mod11.\n\n9^4\u2261(9 mod11)^4. 9^2=81\u22614 mod11, so 9^4\u22614\u00b2=16\u22615 mod11.\n\n10^4\u2261(-1)^4=1 mod11.\n\nSo n\u2074 mod11 gives 1,5,4,3,9,9,3,4,5,1. So none of these are equal to -1 mod11 (which is 10). Therefore, no solution mod11, so p=11 can't divide n^4 +1, so p=11 is out.\n\np=13. Let's check mod13. First see if n^4 \u2261-1 mod13. Let's compute n^4 mod13 for n=1 to12.\n\n1^4=1 mod13\n\n2^4=16\u22613 mod13\n\n3^4=81\u226181-6*13=81-78=3 mod13\n\n4^4=256 mod13. 13*19=247, so 256-247=9 mod13.\n\n5^4=625 mod13. 13*48=624, so 625\u22611 mod13.\n\n6^4=(6^2)^2=36\u00b2\u226110\u00b2=100\u22619 mod13.\n\n7^4\u2261(7 mod13)^4. 7\u00b2=49\u226110 mod13, so 7^4\u226110\u00b2=100\u22619 mod13.\n\n8^4\u2261(-5)^4\u22615^4\u2261 same as 5^4=1 mod13.\n\n9^4\u2261(-4)^4\u22614^4=256\u22619 mod13.\n\n10^4\u2261(-3)^4\u22613^4\u22613 mod13.\n\n11^4\u2261(-2)^4\u22612^4\u22613 mod13.\n\n12^4\u2261(-1)^4\u22611 mod13.\n\nSo n\u2074 mod13 can be 1,3,9. -1 mod13 is 12. None of the residues are 12. So no solution mod13. So p=13 is out.\n\nTherefore, the next prime is 17. We saw earlier that n=2 mod17 gives n^4\u2261-1 mod17, and we can lift this to mod17\u00b2 via Hensel's lemma, resulting in m=155 as a solution. Therefore, 17 is the smallest prime where p\u00b2 divides n\u2074+1 for some n. So p=17 is our prime.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the least positive integer m such that m\u2074 +1 is divisible by p\u00b2 (which is 17\u00b2). So we need the minimal m where m\u2074 \u2261-1 mod289. Earlier, we found that m=155 is such a number. But is there a smaller m?\n\nWait, in the lifting process, we found that m=2 +17k, with k=9 gives m=155. But perhaps there is a smaller k?\n\nWait, in the equation 255k \u2261 -17 mod289, which simplifies to 15k \u226116 mod17. The solution was k\u22619 mod17. So the minimal positive k is 9, so the minimal m would be 2+17*9=155. But maybe there's another solution with smaller k? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the equation 255k \u2261272 mod289, the solution k must be congruent to 9 mod17. So the minimal positive k is 9. Therefore, the minimal m is 2+17*9=155. But perhaps there is a smaller m that is congruent to 2 mod17 but with a different solution?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another solution mod17? Wait, the original equation mod17 had solutions n\u22612 mod17 and n\u2261-2 mod17 (since (-2)^4 is also 16\u2261-1 mod17). So maybe the other solution would be n\u2261-2 mod17, which is 15 mod17. Let me try that.\n\nLet me see if starting with n\u226115 mod17 can give a smaller m. Let me try m=15 +17k. Let me compute (15 +17k)^4 mod289.\n\nSimilarly to before, expand (15 +17k)^4 mod289.\n\nFirst term: 15^4. Let me compute 15^4 mod289. 15\u00b2=225, so 15^4=225\u00b2. 225 mod289 is 225. 225\u00b2 mod289: let's compute 225*225. Hmm, this might be tedious. Alternatively, since we know that 15\u2261-2 mod17, so maybe similar to the previous case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the expansion:\n\n(15 +17k)^4 = 15^4 + 4*15^3*(17k) + 6*15\u00b2*(17k)^2 + 4*15*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.\n\nAgain, mod289:\n\n15^4 mod289. Let's compute 15\u00b2=225. 15^4=225\u00b2. 225 mod289 is 225. 225\u00b2 = 50625. Let's divide 50625 by289. 289*175=289*(170+5)=289*170=49130, plus 289*5=1445, total 49130+1445=50575. 50625-50575=50. So 15^4 \u226150 mod289.\n\nThen 4*15^3*(17k). Let's compute 15^3=3375. 3375 mod289: 289*11=3179. 3375-3179=196. So 15^3\u2261196 mod289.\n\nThus 4*196*17k =4*196=784, 784*17k. Let me compute 784 mod289: 289*2=578, 784-578=206. So 784\u2261206 mod289. So 206*17k mod289. 206*17= 3502. 3502 mod289: Let's divide 3502 by289. 289*12=3468. 3502-3468=34. So 206*17\u226134 mod289. Therefore, this term is 34k mod289.\n\nNext term: 6*15\u00b2*(17k)^2. 15\u00b2=225. (17k)^2=289k\u00b2\u22610 mod289. So this term is 0 mod289.\n\nSimilarly, the remaining terms are 0 mod289.\n\nTherefore, overall, (15+17k)^4 \u226150 +34k mod289.\n\nWe want this \u2261-1 mod289, so 50 +34k \u2261-1 mod289 \u21d2 34k \u2261-51 mod289 \u21d2 34k \u2261238 mod289 (since -51 mod289 is 238).\n\nSo 34k \u2261238 mod289. Let's divide both sides by gcd(34,289). Since 289=17\u00b2, gcd(34,289)=17. 238 divided by17: 17*14=238. So yes, 17 divides 238. So divide equation by17: 2k \u226114 mod17 (since 289/17=17). So 2k \u226114 mod17 \u21d2 k\u22617 mod17/ gcd(2,17). Since gcd(2,17)=1, so k\u22617 mod17. Therefore, the minimal k is7. So m=15+17*7=15+119=134. Let me check m=134.\n\nCompute 134 mod289 is 134. Let me check 134^4 mod289. Alternatively, using the expression above, with k=7:\n\n50 +34*7 =50 +238=288\u2261-1 mod289. So yes, that works. So m=134 is another solution. Since 134 is smaller than155, so 134 is smaller. Hmm, so perhaps 134 is the minimal m?\n\nWait, so there are two solutions mod289: one from starting with n\u22612 mod17 (giving m=155) and one from starting with n\u226115 mod17 (giving m=134). Since 134 is smaller than155, so 134 is better.\n\nIs there an even smaller m? Let's see. Let me check if there are smaller k for each case.\n\nFor the first case (starting with n=2 mod17), the minimal k was 9, leading to m=155. The second case (starting with n=15 mod17) gave k=7 leading to m=134. Let me see if there's another solution with smaller k.\n\nWait, but in the second case, the minimal k is 7 mod17. The smallest k is 7, so m=15+17*7=134. But could there be a negative k? For example, if k= -10 mod17, but then k would be negative, but m must be positive. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another solution with a different residue mod17? Wait, but we considered both residues that satisfy n^4\u2261-1 mod17, which are 2 and -2 (i.e.,15 mod17). So those are the only two residues mod17 that work, so lifting each gives one solution mod289. Therefore, the two solutions mod289 are 134 and 155. So between them, 134 is smaller. So the minimal m is 134?\n\nBut wait, let me check m=134. Let me compute 134^4 +1 mod289.\n\nAlternatively, as above, since we already derived that (15 +17k)^4 \u226150 +34k mod289. When k=7, that gives 50+238=288\u2261-1 mod289. So yes, so m=134 works.\n\nBut is there an even smaller m?\n\nWait, perhaps there are solutions not in the form of 2 +17k or 15 +17k? Wait, but Hensel's lemma says that the solution mod p\u00b2 is unique if the derivative is non-zero. Wait, but Hensel's lemma gives a unique solution mod p\u00b2 lifting from mod p. So for each solution mod p, there is a unique lift mod p\u00b2. Since mod p=17, there are two solutions: 2 and15 mod17. Therefore, lifting each gives a unique solution mod289, so those are the only two solutions mod289. So the minimal m between those is 134 and155, so 134 is smaller. But 134 is still bigger than 17, but maybe even smaller?\n\nWait, perhaps m=15? Let me check m=15 mod17. Let's compute 15^4 +1 mod289. Earlier, we saw that 15^4 mod289 was 50. 50+1=51 mod289\u22600. So that doesn't work. So m=15 is not a solution. Similarly, m=2: 2^4 +1=17, which is 17 mod289, so not 0 mod289. So indeed the minimal m is 134? Wait, but maybe there's a smaller m between 1 and134 that I haven't considered?\n\nAlternatively, let's see. Let me check m= 134-289= negative, so no. So 134 is the minimal positive. Wait, but let me check m= 134-17* something?\n\nWait, 134 is the minimal solution from the 15 mod17 side, so perhaps that's the smallest. Let me confirm with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since m must be \u22612 or15 mod17. So the numbers less than17 are 2 and15. But neither work mod289. The next numbers would be 2+17=19, 15+17=32, etc. Let me check m=15+17*1=32. Let's compute 32^4 +1 mod289.\n\n32 mod17 is 32-17=15, so similar to 15 mod17. Let me compute 32^4 mod289.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for (15+17k)^4 mod289 where k=1:\n\n(15 +17*1)^4 \u226150 +34*1=54 mod289. 54\u2261 not -1 mod289. So 54+1=55 mod289\u22600. So m=32 is not a solution. Hmm, so k=1 gives 50 +34=84 mod289, not -1. So only when k=7 do we get to -1.\n\nSimilarly, trying m=15+17*2=49. Let's compute with k=2: 50 +34*2=50+68=118 mod289. Not -1. So k must be 7. So m=134 is indeed the minimal from that side. Similarly, on the other side, starting with n=2 mod17, the first solution is at k=9, giving m=155. So 134 is smaller.\n\nTherefore, the minimal m is 134. Wait, but let me check if there's a smaller m from another solution? Let me see, perhaps m= 2 mod17 but with negative k? Wait, but k must be positive because m is positive. Let me see. Alternatively, maybe there's another solution path?\n\nWait, perhaps there's another prime smaller than17 where p\u00b2 divides n\u2074 +1? But we checked all primes below17 and they didn't work, so p=17 is indeed the smallest prime. Therefore, the minimal m is134?\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check m= 134. Let me compute m^4 +1 mod17\u00b2. Since 17\u00b2 is289, let me compute 134^4 mod289.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 134 mod289 is 134, so 134^2 = (130+4)^2=130\u00b2 + 2*130*4 +4\u00b2. 130\u00b2 mod289: 130 mod289 is130. 130\u00b2 =16900. 16900 divided by289: let's see 289*58=289*(50+8)=289*50=14450 +289*8=2312 \u2192 total 14450+2312=16762. 16900-16762=138. So 130\u00b2\u2261138 mod289.\n\nThen 2*130*4=1040 mod289. 289*3=867, 1040-867=173 mod289.\n\n4\u00b2=16 mod289.\n\nSo total 134\u00b2 \u2261138+173+16= 138+173=311, 311+16=327 mod289. 327-289=38 mod289. So 134\u00b2\u226138 mod289.\n\nThen 134^4=(134\u00b2)^2\u226138\u00b2 mod289. 38\u00b2=1444. 1444 divided by289: 289*5=1445, so 1444\u2261-1 mod289. So 38\u00b2\u2261-1 mod289. Therefore, 134^4\u2261-1 mod289. Therefore, 134^4 +1\u22610 mod289. So yes, that works.\n\nSo m=134 is indeed a solution. Now, is there a smaller m?\n\nLet me check m= 134-17=117. Let's see if 117 works. 117 mod17 is 117-6*17=117-102=15 mod17. So same as the other solution. Let me compute (15 +17*(6-1)) =15+17*5=15+85=100. Wait, m=117 is 15+17*6=15+102=117. Let's compute m=117 mod289.\n\nLet me compute 117^4 mod289. Alternatively, using the formula (15 +17k)^4 \u226150 +34k mod289. Here, k=6, so 50 +34*6=50 +204=254 mod289. 254 +1=255 mod289\u22600. So that's not a solution. So m=117 is not a solution. Similarly, m=134-17=117 is not a solution. So the next one below 134 would be m=134-2*17=100. Let me check m=100:\n\nUsing the formula, k=5: 50 +34*5=50+170=220 mod289. 220 +1=221\u22600. Not a solution.\n\nContinuing down, m=15+17*4= 15+68=83. Let me check k=4: 50+34*4=50+136=186 mod289. Not -1. Similarly, m=15+17*3=66: k=3 gives 50+102=152 mod289. Not -1.\n\nm=15+17*2=49: 50+68=118 mod289. Not.\n\nm=15+17*1=32: 50+34=84 mod289. Not.\n\nSo only at k=7 (134) do we get the solution. So 134 is indeed the smallest from that side.\n\nNow, let's check the other solution path starting from n=2 mod17. The minimal m there was 155. Let me see if there are smaller m in that sequence. The first term is m=2+17*9=155. The previous k would be 9-17= negative, which isn't allowed. The next lower k is 9-17= negative. Wait, k has to be at least 0? Wait, k is an integer such that m is positive, so starting from k=0 gives m=2, which doesn't work. k=1 gives m=19. Let me check m=19:\n\nUsing the formula (2 +17k)^4 mod289 where k=1: 16 +255*1=271 mod289. 271\u2261-18 mod289. Not -1. So not a solution. Similarly, k=2 gives 16+255*2=16+510=526 mod289. 526-289*1=237 mod289. Not -1. k=3: 16+765=781 mod289. 781-2*289=781-578=203 mod289. Not.\n\nContinuing until k=9 gives the first solution. So indeed, the first solution in that sequence is m=155.\n\nTherefore, between 134 and155, the minimal m is134. Therefore, the answer is134?\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem says \"the least positive integer m such that m\u2074 +1 is divisible by p\u00b2\", where p is the smallest prime for which such an m exists. Since we determined p=17, so p\u00b2=289, then the minimal m is134. But let me check if there's a smaller m than134 that I missed.\n\nWait, let me check m= 134-289= negative, so no. Let me check m= 134 divided by17 is about 7.9. Hmm, not sure. Wait, is there a number less than134 which is congruent to either2 or15 mod17, but gives m\u2074 \u2261-1 mod289?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a solution not in the residue classes mod17? But according to Hensel's lemma, all solutions must be lifts from the mod17 solutions. Since mod17 there are only two solutions, the lifts must be in those two residue classes mod17. Therefore, the minimal m must be the minimal in those two sequences, which is134.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be134?\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought of 155, but then found another solution at134. Let me confirm once again with actual computation for m=134:\n\nCompute 134^4 mod289:\n\nFirst, compute 134 mod289 is134.\n\n134 squared is (130 +4)^2 =130\u00b2 + 2*130*4 +4\u00b2. As before, 130\u00b2 mod289 was138, 2*130*4=1040 mod289 was173, and 4\u00b2=16. So total 138+173+16=327 mod289=327-289=38 mod289. So 134\u00b2\u226138 mod289.\n\nThen 134^4=(134\u00b2)^2=38\u00b2 mod289. 38 squared is 1444. Divided by289: 289*5=1445. So 1444=1445-1\u2261-1 mod289. Therefore, 38\u00b2\u2261-1 mod289. Therefore, 134^4\u2261-1 mod289, so 134^4 +1\u22610 mod289. Perfect, that works.\n\nTherefore, m=134 is indeed a solution, and it's the smallest such m. So the answer should be134.\n\nWait, but let me check m= 134 is the minimal. Let me check m= 134-17*7=134-119=15. But 15^4 mod289 is50, so 50+1=51 mod289\u22600. So no. So yes, 134 is indeed the smallest. Therefore, the final answer is134.\n\nBut wait, I just thought of another thing. The problem says \"the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n\u2074 +1 is divisible by p\u00b2\". We found that p=17 is the smallest such prime. Then, \"Find the least positive integer m such that m\u2074 +1 is divisible by p\u00b2\". So yes, so m=134.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm that there isn't a smaller prime that I missed. Wait, primes like 17 is the first prime \u22611 mod8. The next is 41, but since we checked primes below and they don't work, 17 is indeed the smallest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is m=134. Wait, but hold on, let me check once more with another method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal solution is smaller?\n\nWait, let me compute m= 134 divided by17 is 7.882..., so 134=17\u00d77 +15. So it's in the residue 15 mod17. So that's the second solution path. Since 134 is the first lift in that path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m= 17\u00d77 +15= 119+15=134, yes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m= 17\u00d7something plus 2?\n\nWait, for the 2 mod17 path, the first solution is at k=9, so 2+17\u00d79=155. So 155 is larger than134. So 134 is smaller.\n\nTherefore, I think 134 is the correct minimal m. So the final answer is 134. Wait, but let me check online if possible? Wait, maybe I can recall that the minimal solution for p=17 is 5772? Wait no, that's too big. Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation?\n\nWait, let me compute 134^4 +1 divided by289:\n\nWait, 134^4 = (134\u00b2)^2 = (38 mod289)^2 = (-1 mod289) as above. So 134^4 +1 \u2261-1+1=0 mod289. So it works.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 134^4 numerically:\n\n134^2 = 17956\n\n134^4 = (17956)^2. Let me compute 17956 squared mod289.\n\nBut that's tedious. Alternatively, since we already did mod289 steps above and it works, so it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 134. Wait, but I just found a contradiction in my mind. Because in some references, the minimal solution for 17^2 divides m^4 +1 is 5772, but that might be for a different problem. Wait, perhaps I messed up?\n\nWait, maybe my mistake is in the Hensel's lemma part. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, when I used Hensel's lemma for the case starting with n=2 mod17, we had the equation 255k \u2261-17 mod289. Then dividing by17 gives 15k\u2261-1 mod17 (since -17 mod289 divided by17 is -1 mod17). Wait, let me recheck the equations.\n\nOriginal equation after expanding (2+17k)^4 mod289:\n\nWe had 16 +255k \u2261-1 mod289 \u21d2255k \u2261-17 mod289.\n\n255 divided by17 is 15, and -17 mod289 is 272 mod289. So equation: 255k \u2261272 mod289.\n\nThen gcd(255,289)=17, so dividing equation by17:\n\n(255/17)k \u2261272/17 mod(289/17)\n\nWhich is 15k\u226116 mod17.\n\nAh, right. So 15k\u226116 mod17. So that's where that came from. Then the solution was k\u22619 mod17.\n\nSimilarly for the other case starting with 15 mod17, leading to equation 34k \u2261238 mod289. 34 and289 have gcd17, so dividing by17: 2k\u226114 mod17 \u21d2k\u22617 mod17.\n\nTherefore, calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal m is indeed134. So I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{134}\n\n\nTo find the smallest prime \\( p \\) such that there exists a positive integer \\( n \\) where \\( p^2 \\) divides \\( n^4 + 1 \\), we start by noting that \\( n^4 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} \\).
