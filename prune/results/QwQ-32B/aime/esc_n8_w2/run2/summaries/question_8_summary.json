      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b equals 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but maybe I can break it down.\n\nFirst, let me write down the given equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 300\n2. a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000\n\nHmm, the second equation looks symmetrical in a, b, c. Maybe I can factor it somehow? Let me see. Let's try to factor the left-hand side of the second equation.\n\nLooking at the terms: each term is of the form (variable squared times another variable). Let me see if I can factor this expression. Maybe group terms?\n\nLet's see:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c = a\u00b2(b + c)\nSimilarly, b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c = b\u00b2(a + c)\nAnd c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nHmm, that seems better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, maybe we can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), and similarly for the others.\n\nLet me try that substitution:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000\n\nHmm, that might be helpful. Let me write that equation down again:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000\n\nBut since a + b + c = 300, maybe there's a way to relate this to another expression. Alternatively, perhaps expanding the original expression might help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the original expression can be written in terms of (a + b + c)^3 or something. Let me think about some algebraic identities.\n\nWait, let me recall that:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(a + c)(b + c)\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly. Let me recall the correct expansion.\n\nActually, (a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(a + c) + 3(b + c)(a + b) + ... Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b can be related to (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc. Let me check:\n\nLet me compute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca)\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n= a\u00b2b + abc + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + abc + abc + bc\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\n\nWait, let's count terms:\n\nFirst term: a(ab) = a\u00b2b\n\nSecond term: a(bc) = abc\n\nThird term: a(ca) = a\u00b2c\n\nFourth term: b(ab) = ab\u00b2\n\nFifth term: b(bc) = b\u00b2c\n\nSixth term: b(ca) = abc\n\nSeventh term: c(ab) = abc\n\nEighth term: c(bc) = bc\u00b2\n\nNinth term: c(ca) = c\u00b2a\n\nSo combining like terms:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + bc\u00b2 + c\u00b2a + 3abc\n\nTherefore,\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = (a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) + 3abc\n\nTherefore, the expression we have in the problem, which is a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b, is equal to (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nSo substituting that in:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nWe know that a + b + c = 300, so substitute that in:\n\n300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nHmm, okay, so now we have an equation involving ab + bc + ca and abc. Let's write that equation as:\n\n300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nLet me divide both sides by 3 to simplify:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\n\nHmm, so 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000. Not sure yet, but maybe I can find another relation here. Let me think.\n\nSince we have a + b + c = 300, perhaps we can denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ca. Then, the equation becomes 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nBut also, in symmetric polynomials, we know that for three variables, the relation between S, Q, and P is given by the equation:\n\na^3 + b^3 + c^3 = S^3 - 3S Q + 3P\n\nBut not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express Q in terms of variables?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume some variables are equal? Since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, maybe there's some symmetry in the solution.\n\nSuppose two variables are equal. Let me try that. Let's suppose a = b. Then, since a + b + c = 300, we have 2a + c = 300, so c = 300 - 2a.\n\nThen, let's substitute into the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000\n\nSince a = b, this becomes:\n\na\u00b2a + a\u00b2c + a\u00b2a + a\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2a\n\nWait, let me compute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = a^3,\n\na\u00b2c = a\u00b2c,\n\nb\u00b2a = a^3,\n\nb\u00b2c = a\u00b2c,\n\nc\u00b2a = a c\u00b2,\n\nc\u00b2b = a c\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, summing all terms:\n\na^3 + a\u00b2c + a^3 + a\u00b2c + a c\u00b2 + a c\u00b2\n\n= 2a^3 + 2a\u00b2c + 2a c\u00b2\n\nFactor out 2a:\n\n2a(a\u00b2 + a c + c\u00b2)\n\nHmm, but c = 300 - 2a. Let's substitute that in:\n\nFirst, compute a\u00b2 + a c + c\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2 + a*(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\na\u00b2 + (300a - 2a\u00b2) + (90000 - 1200a + 4a\u00b2)\n\nCombine terms:\n\na\u00b2 - 2a\u00b2 + 4a\u00b2 = 3a\u00b2,\n\n300a - 1200a = -900a,\n\nAnd the constant term 90000.\n\nSo total is 3a\u00b2 - 900a + 90000.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 2a*(3a\u00b2 - 900a + 90000) = 6a^3 - 1800a^2 + 180000a.\n\nSet equal to 6,000,000:\n\n6a^3 - 1800a^2 + 180000a = 6,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\na^3 - 300a^2 + 30000a = 1,000,000\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\na^3 - 300a^2 + 30000a - 1,000,000 = 0\n\nHmm, need to solve this cubic equation for integer a. Since a must be a nonnegative integer and c = 300 - 2a must also be nonnegative, so 300 - 2a \u2265 0 \u2192 a \u2264 150.\n\nLet me try to find integer roots between 0 and 150. Let me try possible a's.\n\nMaybe factor the cubic equation?\n\nLet me see if a = 100 is a root:\n\n100^3 - 300*(100)^2 + 30000*100 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0\n\nYes! So a = 100 is a root. Therefore, (a - 100) is a factor.\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or factorization.\n\nDivide the cubic by (a - 100):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30000 | -1,000,000\n\nRoot: 100\n\nBring down 1\n\nMultiply by 100: 1*100 = 100. Add to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200\n\nMultiply -200 by 100 = -20,000. Add to next coefficient: 30,000 + (-20,000) = 10,000\n\nMultiply 10,000 by 100 = 1,000,000. Add to last term: -1,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nSo the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000)\n\nThen, set the quadratic factor to zero:\n\na\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0\n\nSolutions:\n\na = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(200\u00b2 - 4*1*10000)] / 2\n\nCompute discriminant: 40,000 - 40,000 = 0. So a = 200/2 = 100. So the quadratic has a double root at 100.\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as (a - 100)^3 = 0. Wait, so the equation is (a - 100)^3 = 0, so the only real root is a = 100. But since we already factored out (a - 100) once, but actually the quadratic was (a - 100)^2. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation was a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0. Let me compute discriminant again:\n\nDiscriminant D = (200)^2 - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0. So yes, a = [200]/2 = 100. So indeed, the quadratic is (a - 100)^2. Therefore, the cubic factors as (a - 100)^3 = 0, so the only solution is a = 100.\n\nTherefore, when assuming a = b, the only solution is a = b = 100, so then c = 300 - 2*100 = 100. So that would mean a = b = c = 100. Let me check if that works in the original equation.\n\nCheck a = b = c = 100:\n\nFirst equation: 100 + 100 + 100 = 300, which is good.\n\nSecond equation: a\u00b2b + ... etc. Since all variables are equal, each term is 100\u00b2*100 = 1,000,000. There are 6 terms (each pair of variables), so total is 6*1,000,000 = 6,000,000. Perfect, that works.\n\nSo that is one solution where all variables are equal. But since the problem is symmetric, this is just one triple (100,100,100). But maybe there are other solutions where variables aren't equal?\n\nHmm, so perhaps assuming two variables equal gives only that solution, but maybe there are solutions where all variables are different? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are solutions where one variable is 0? Let me try that.\n\nSuppose c = 0. Then the equations become:\n\na + b = 300,\n\nand the second equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2*0 + 0\u00b2a + 0\u00b2b = a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 = ab(a + b) = ab*300 = 6,000,000\n\nThus, ab*300 = 6,000,000 \u2192 ab = 20,000.\n\nSo, with a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000. So we can set up quadratic equation:\n\nLet a and b be roots of x\u00b2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0\n\nCompute discriminant: 300\u00b2 - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000\n\nThus, roots are [300 \u00b1 100]/2 \u2192 (400)/2 = 200 and (200)/2 = 100. So a and b are 200 and 100. So the triples would be (200,100,0), (100,200,0), and (0,200,100), etc. Since c can be any of the three variables, so there are 3 permutations here.\n\nWait, but we set c = 0. So the triples are (200, 100, 0), (100, 200, 0), (200, 0, 100), (100, 0, 200), (0, 200, 100), (0, 100, 200). Wait, actually, since c is the one set to 0, but actually, the variables are interchangeable, so all permutations where one variable is 0, another is 200, and the third is 100. So how many such triples are there?\n\nThere are 3 choices for which variable is 0, and once that is fixed, the other two are determined as 200 and 100. Since 200 and 100 are distinct, each choice of the zero variable gives two permutations? Wait no, actually, once you fix which variable is 0, say c is 0, then (a,b) can be (200,100) or (100,200). So for each of the three variables being zero, there are two triples. So total is 3 * 2 = 6 triples where one variable is 0, another is 200, and the third is 100. So that's another 6 solutions.\n\nSo so far, we have 1 (all 100s) + 6 (with 0, 100, 200) = 7 solutions. But maybe there are more?\n\nWait, let me check another case where two variables are equal but not all three. Wait, earlier when we assumed a = b, we got the solution where all three are 100. So perhaps if we set two variables equal but not to 100? Let me see. Suppose a = b but not equal to 100. Wait but in that case, when we set a = b, the equation led only to a = 100. So maybe no other solutions when two variables are equal?\n\nAlternatively, suppose another case where one variable is different, but not zero. Let me think. Let me try to see if there are solutions where all three variables are different and non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are solutions where two variables are equal but not 100, but when I tried that, the equation only had a=100 as a solution, so that might not be possible.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the case where two variables are equal but not necessarily 100. Wait, but in that case, the equation led to a cubic which only had a=100 as a solution, so maybe that's the only one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps variables can be arranged in some other way. Let me try to think of another approach.\n\nWe have the equations:\n\na + b + c = 300,\n\nand 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = 300,\n\nQ = ab + bc + ca,\n\nP = abc.\n\nSo the equation is 100Q - P = 2,000,000,\n\nand we also know that for three variables,\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca),\n\nso 300\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2Q,\n\nso a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 90000 - 2Q.\n\nHmm, but not sure if that helps yet. Alternatively, maybe express P in terms of Q?\n\nFrom the equation, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nSo, if I can find another relation involving Q and P, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the equation for (a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2. Let me see.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe if I let variables be x, y, z such that they are deviations from 100? Since 300 divided by 3 is 100, so perhaps symmetric around 100.\n\nLet me let a = 100 + p,\n\nb = 100 + q,\n\nc = 100 + r,\n\nso that p + q + r = 0.\n\nThen, substituting into the equations, maybe?\n\nLet me try that substitution.\n\nLet me set a = 100 + p, b = 100 + q, c = 100 + r,\n\nwith p + q + r = 0.\n\nThen, let's compute Q = ab + bc + ca,\n\nand P = abc.\n\nFirst, compute Q:\n\nab = (100 + p)(100 + q) = 100\u00b2 + 100(q + p) + pq,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nbc = (100 + q)(100 + r) = 100\u00b2 + 100(q + r) + qr,\n\nca = (100 + r)(100 + p) = 100\u00b2 + 100(r + p) + rp,\n\nAdding these up:\n\nQ = 3*100\u00b2 + 100[ (q + p) + (q + r) + (r + p) ] + (pq + qr + rp)\n\nSimplify the terms inside:\n\nThe coefficients of 100: (q + p + q + r + r + p) = 2(p + q + r) = 2*0 = 0,\n\nsince p + q + r =0.\n\nSo the middle term is 0.\n\nThe cross terms: pq + qr + rp.\n\nTherefore,\n\nQ = 3*10,000 + (pq + qr + rp) = 30,000 + (pq + qr + rp)\n\nSimilarly, compute P = abc = (100 + p)(100 + q)(100 + r)\n\nLet me expand that:\n\nFirst, multiply (100 + p)(100 + q) = 100\u00b2 + 100(q + p) + pq,\n\nthen multiply by (100 + r):\n\n= [100\u00b2 + 100(p + q) + pq] * (100 + r)\n\n= 100\u00b2*100 + 100\u00b2 r + 100(p + q)*100 + 100(p + q) r + pq*100 + pq*r\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: 100^3,\n\nSecond term: 100\u00b2 r,\n\nThird term: 100^2 (p + q),\n\nFourth term: 100 r (p + q),\n\nFifth term: 100 pq,\n\nSixth term: pq r\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= 100^3 + 100\u00b2 (r + p + q) + 100 [ r(p + q) + pq ] + pq r\n\nBut since p + q + r =0, so r + p + q = 0,\n\nso the second term is 0.\n\nAlso, note that r(p + q) = r(-r) because p + q = -r,\n\nSimilarly, pq = ?\n\nWait, let me see step by step:\n\nFirst term: 100^3.\n\nSecond term: 0.\n\nThird term: 100 [ r(p + q) + pq ]\n\nBut since p + q = -r,\n\nso r(p + q) = r*(-r) = -r\u00b2,\n\nTherefore,\n\nThird term becomes 100 [ -r\u00b2 + pq ]\n\nFourth term: pq r.\n\nTherefore, total expression:\n\n100^3 + 100(-r\u00b2 + pq) + pq r\n\nHmm, so:\n\nP = 1,000,000 - 100 r\u00b2 + 100 pq + pq r\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated, but maybe substituting into the equation.\n\nWe have from the equation:\n\n100 Q - P = 2,000,000,\n\nSubstituting Q and P:\n\n100*(30,000 + (pq + qr + rp)) - [1,000,000 - 100 r\u00b2 + 100 pq + pq r] = 2,000,000\n\nLet me compute term by term.\n\nFirst term: 100*(30,000) = 3,000,000,\n\nSecond term: 100*(pq + qr + rp),\n\nThird term: subtract [1,000,000 - 100 r\u00b2 + 100 pq + pq r]\n\nSo expanding the subtraction:\n\n-1,000,000 + 100 r\u00b2 - 100 pq - pq r\n\nTherefore, total equation:\n\n3,000,000 + 100(pq + qr + rp) -1,000,000 + 100 r\u00b2 - 100 pq - pq r = 2,000,000\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000,\n\nThen, terms with pq:\n\n100(pq + qr + rp) -100 pq = 100 (qr + rp),\n\nTerms with r\u00b2:\n\n+100 r\u00b2,\n\nTerms with pq r: - pq r,\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n2,000,000 + 100 (qr + rp) + 100 r\u00b2 - pq r = 2,000,000\n\nSubtract 2,000,000 from both sides:\n\n100 (qr + rp) + 100 r\u00b2 - pq r = 0\n\nFactor terms:\n\nLet me see, perhaps factor out r?\n\nr [100(q + p) + 100 r - pq ] = 0\n\nHmm, let's see:\n\nWait, 100(qr + rp) = 100 r (q + p),\n\nand 100 r\u00b2 is 100 r\u00b2,\n\nand -pq r is -pq r,\n\nSo altogether:\n\n100 r (q + p) + 100 r\u00b2 - pq r = 0\n\nFactor out r:\n\nr [100 (q + p) + 100 r - pq ] = 0\n\nTherefore, either r = 0, or the term in brackets is zero.\n\nCase 1: r = 0.\n\nIf r = 0, then since p + q + r =0, p + q =0 \u2192 q = -p.\n\nTherefore, variables:\n\na = 100 + p,\n\nb = 100 + q = 100 - p,\n\nc = 100 + r = 100.\n\nSo c is fixed at 100, and a and b are 100 + p and 100 - p.\n\nThus, a + b + c = (100 + p) + (100 - p) + 100 = 300, which is okay.\n\nNow, we can substitute into the original equation to see if this works.\n\nBut wait, since we are in the case where r=0, so let me see what the equation gives us.\n\nWait, in this case, since r=0, the equation is satisfied, so the condition reduces to r=0 or the other term. So perhaps in this case, the equation holds?\n\nWait, actually, since we derived this under the substitution, so this case is allowed. So in this case, the variables are (100 + p, 100 - p, 100). Let's check if they satisfy the original equation.\n\nLet me compute the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nLet me denote a = 100 + p, b = 100 - p, c = 100.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = (100 + p)^2 (100 - p),\n\na\u00b2c = (100 + p)^2 * 100,\n\nb\u00b2a = (100 - p)^2 (100 + p),\n\nb\u00b2c = (100 - p)^2 * 100,\n\nc\u00b2a = 100\u00b2 (100 + p),\n\nc\u00b2b = 100\u00b2 (100 - p).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (100 + p)^2 (100 - p)\n\nSecond term: (100 + p)^2 * 100\n\nThird term: (100 - p)^2 (100 + p)\n\nFourth term: (100 - p)^2 * 100\n\nFifth term: 100\u00b2 (100 + p)\n\nSixth term: 100\u00b2 (100 - p)\n\nLet me compute all terms:\n\nFirst term: Let me expand (100 + p)^2 (100 - p):\n\nFirst compute (100 + p)^2 = 10,000 + 200p + p\u00b2,\n\nMultiply by (100 - p):\n\n= (10,000)(100) + (10,000)(-p) + 200p*100 + 200p*(-p) + p\u00b2*100 + p\u00b2*(-p)\n\n= 1,000,000 - 10,000p + 20,000p - 200p\u00b2 + 100p\u00b2 - p\u00b3\n\nSimplify:\n\n1,000,000 + 10,000p - 100p\u00b2 - p\u00b3\n\nSecond term: (100 + p)^2 *100 = (10,000 + 200p + p\u00b2)*100 = 1,000,000 + 20,000p + 100p\u00b2\n\nThird term: (100 - p)^2 (100 + p).

There are 6 terms, so 6,000,000.\n\nNow, p terms:\n\nTerm1: +10,000p\n\nTerm2: +20,000p\n\nTerm3: -10,000p\n\nTerm4: -20,000p\n\nTerm5: +10,000p\n\nTerm6: -10,000p\n\nAdding these:\n\n10,000 +20,000 -10,000 -20,000 +10,000 -10,000 = (10k +20k) =30k, then subtract 10k gives 20k, subtract 20k gives 0, then add 10k gives 10k, subtract 10k gives 0. So total p terms cancel out.\n\np\u00b2 terms:\n\nTerm1: -100p\u00b2\n\nTerm2: +100p\u00b2\n\nTerm3: -100p\u00b2\n\nTerm4: +100p\u00b2\n\nOthers: 0.\n\nAdding these:\n\n-100 +100 -100 +100 = 0. So p\u00b2 terms cancel.\n\np\u00b3 terms:\n\nTerm1: -p\u00b3\n\nTerm3: +p\u00b3\n\nTotal: -p\u00b3 + p\u00b3 = 0.\n\nTherefore, all terms except the constants cancel out, so total sum is 6,000,000.\n\nTherefore, for any p, as long as variables are integers and non-negative, this holds.\n\nWait a second! So that means that for any p where a = 100 + p, b = 100 - p, and c = 100, as long as a, b, c are non-negative integers, the equation holds?\n\nWow, that's interesting. So this gives infinitely many solutions? But wait, no, because p has to be an integer such that a, b, c are non-negative integers.\n\nSince a =100 + p, b =100 - p, c =100. So to have a and b non-negative:\n\na \u22650 \u2192 100 + p \u22650 \u2192 p \u2265 -100,\n\nb \u22650 \u2192 100 - p \u22650 \u2192 p \u2264 100,\n\nAlso, c is always 100, which is okay.\n\nTherefore p can range from -100 to 100. But since p must be an integer, the possible values are p = -100, -99,..., 0,...,99,100. Wait, but p must be such that both a and b are non-negative integers.\n\nWait, but actually, since a, b, c are non-negative integers, p can be from -100 to 100, but since p is an integer, the number of possible p is 201 (from -100 to 100 inclusive). However, we have to make sure that a and b are non-negative.\n\nWait, but when p = -100, then a = 0, b = 200. Which is okay, but then c is 100. So that's allowed. Similarly, p = 100 gives a = 200, b = 0, which is also allowed. So all those p from -100 to 100 are valid. However, note that the variables are ordered triples (a,b,c). But in this case, since c is fixed at 100, the triples would be (100 + p, 100 - p, 100). However, since the problem counts triples (a, b, c) where the order matters, but in this case, when we fix c to 100, the other variables are a and b. So each p gives a unique triple where the third element is 100, and first two are 100 \u00b1 p. But since p can be from -100 to 100, but also, when p is positive, it's different from p negative? Wait, for example, p = 1 gives (101, 99, 100), p = -1 gives (99, 101, 100). These are different triples unless p =0. So total number of such triples would be 201? But wait, let's count:\n\nWait, the values of p are from -100 to 100, inclusive. That's 201 values. Each p corresponds to a unique triple where c =100, a =100 +p, b=100 -p. So each p gives a distinct ordered triple. However, note that when p is positive, the triple is (100+p, 100-p, 100). When p is negative, say p = -k where k>0, then it becomes (100 -k, 100 +k, 100). These are different triples unless k=0. So indeed, all 201 values of p give distinct triples.\n\nBut wait, hold on. But in our earlier case where c was set to zero, we found triples like (200,100,0) etc. But in this scenario, when p=100, then a=200, b=0, c=100. So that's (200,0,100), which is different from (200,100,0). So these are different triples. So actually, the case where c is fixed at 100 gives different triples than when another variable is set to zero.\n\nTherefore, this case gives 201 triples where one variable is fixed at 100, and the other two variables sum to 200. Wait, but in this case, the two variables a and b must sum to 200? Wait, a + b = (100 + p) + (100 - p) = 200, yes, and c=100, so total 300.\n\nHowever, in the problem statement, the triples are ordered, so all permutations are considered different. Wait, but in this case, when we fix c as 100, we are only considering triples where the third element is 100. However, the problem allows any permutation. So actually, the above analysis gives triples where c is 100, but the 100 could be in any position. So actually, to get all such triples where one of the variables is 100 and the other two add to 200, we have to consider all three positions for the 100.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let me see:\n\nSuppose instead of fixing c = 100, we allow any of the variables to be 100. Then, for each variable (a, b, or c), we can set it to 100 and let the other two variables vary such that their sum is 200. Each such choice would give a set of triples.\n\nFor example:\n\nCase 1: a =100, then b + c =200. The number of nonnegative integer solutions is 201 (since b can be from 0 to 200, and c=200 -b). But in our previous substitution, when we fixed c=100, the other two variables were a and b, but here, if a=100, then b and c can be anything as long as they add to 200. However, in the previous analysis with substitution, we considered a and b as (100 + p, 100 - p). But actually, in that substitution, the two variables had to be symmetric around 100, but in reality, when a is fixed at 100, the other two variables can be any pair adding to 200. Wait, but in the equation, when we set a variable to 100, then the expression still holds for any b and c such that b + c =200? Wait, no, because in the previous substitution where c was fixed at 100, the expression automatically held for any p. But if we fix a different variable at 100, does the same happen?\n\nWait, let me check. Suppose we set a =100, then the variables are (100, b, c) with b + c = 200. Then, the original equation must hold. Let's see if it does.\n\nCompute the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nSubstitute a =100, and b + c = 200:\n\n= 100\u00b2 b + 100\u00b2 c + b\u00b2*100 + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2*100 + c\u00b2 b\n\n= 100\u00b2 (b + c) + 100 (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + bc(b + c)\n\nSince b + c =200,\n\n= 100\u00b2 *200 + 100(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + bc*200\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 10,000 *200 = 2,000,000,\n\nSecond term: 100*(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2),\n\nThird term: 200bc.\n\nThus total expression:\n\n2,000,000 + 100(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 200 bc\n\nHmm, but we need this to equal 6,000,000.\n\nWait, but earlier when we fixed c =100 and let a and b vary as 100 \u00b1 p, that worked, but here, if we set a =100, and let b and c be any numbers adding to 200, does that expression equal 6,000,000?\n\nWait, in the previous substitution where c was fixed at 100, and a and b were 100 + p and 100 -p, then when substituting into the expression, it always gave 6,000,000. But here, if we set a=100, but let b and c be anything adding to 200, then the expression may not always equal 6,000,000. Wait, so there's a discrepancy here. What's the problem?\n\nAh, because in the substitution where c was fixed at 100, we had the variables a and b set to 100 + p and 100 - p, so they were symmetric around 100, but if we just set a =100 and let b and c be arbitrary adding to 200, then that's a different scenario. Wait, but in the substitution, we had the condition that p + q + r =0, so if we set c=100 (r=0), then p + q =0, so q = -p, so that's why a and b are symmetric. But if we instead set a=100 (so p=0?), then variables would be different?\n\nWait, perhaps my substitution was specific to having one variable fixed at 100 and the other two symmetric around 100. Wait, maybe I made an error in assuming that all triples where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 would satisfy the equation, but actually only those where the other two are symmetric around 100 do?\n\nWait, let me test with an example. Suppose a =100, b = 200, c =0. Then compute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 100\u00b2*200 + 100\u00b2*0 + 200\u00b2*100 + 200\u00b2*0 + 0\u00b2*100 + 0\u00b2*200\n\n= 2,000,000 + 0 + 4,000,000 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6,000,000. Oh, that works!\n\nWait another example: a =100, b = 0, c =200. Then the expression is same as above, 6,000,000.\n\nWait another example: a=100, b=100, c=100. Then it's 6*100^3 = 6,000,000. That works.\n\nWait another example: a=100, b=50, c=150.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\n100\u00b2*50 +100\u00b2*150 +50\u00b2*100 +50\u00b2*150 +150\u00b2*100 +150\u00b2*50\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n100\u00b2*50 = 10,000 *50 = 500,000,\n\n100\u00b2*150 = 10,000 *150 = 1,500,000,\n\n50\u00b2*100 = 2,500 *100 = 250,000,\n\n50\u00b2*150 = 2,500 *150 = 375,000,\n\n150\u00b2*100 = 22,500 *100 = 2,250,000,\n\n150\u00b2*50 =22,500 *50 =1,125,000.\n\nAdding all together:\n\n500,000 + 1,500,000 = 2,000,000,\n\n+250,000 = 2,250,000,\n\n+375,000 = 2,625,000,\n\n+2,250,000 = 4,875,000,\n\n+1,125,000 = 6,000,000.\n\nOh! It still adds up. Wait, so even when variables aren't symmetric around 100, as long as one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200, the expression equals 6,000,000?\n\nWait, so this suggests that if one variable is 100, and the other two add to 200, then the expression equals 6,000,000 regardless of their values?\n\nBut let's try another example where one variable is 100, and others add to 200 but are not symmetric. Let's say a=100, b=1, c=199.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\n100\u00b2*1 + 100\u00b2*199 + 1\u00b2*100 +1\u00b2*199 +199\u00b2*100 +199\u00b2*1\n\nFirst terms:\n\n100\u00b2*1 = 10,000,\n\n100\u00b2*199 = 10,000*199 = 1,990,000,\n\n1\u00b2*100 = 100,\n\n1\u00b2*199 =199,\n\n199\u00b2*100 = (39,601)*100 = 3,960,100,\n\n199\u00b2*1 = 39,601*1 =39,601.\n\nAdding all together:\n\n10,000 + 1,990,000 = 2,000,000,\n\n+100 = 2,000,100,\n\n+199 = 2,000,300,\n\n+3,960,100 = 5,960,400,\n\n+39,601 = 6,000,001.\n\nWait, that's 6,000,001, which is one more than needed. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, did I compute that correctly?\n\nWait let me recalculate:\n\n199 squared is (200 -1)^2 = 40,000 -400 +1= 39,601. That's correct.\n\n199\u00b2 *100 = 39,601 *100 =3,960,100,\n\n199\u00b2 *1 =39,601*1=39,601,\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\n10,000 (first term)\n\n+1,990,000 (second term) = total 2,000,000\n\n+100 (third term) \u2192 2,000,100\n\n+199 (fourth term) \u2192 2,000,300-?\n\nWait, 2,000,100 +199 = 2,000,299?\n\nWait, perhaps my arithmetic is off:\n\nWait first four terms:\n\n10,000 +1,990,000 = 2,000,000,\n\nthen +100 gives 2,000,100,\n\nthen +199 gives 2,000,299,\n\nthen adding 3,960,100: 2,000,299 +3,960,100 = 5,960,399,\n\nthen +39,601 gives 5,960,399 +39,601 = 6,000,000.\n\nAh! I must have added wrong before. So it does work. Hmm, so that example actually does work. Let me check again:\n\nWait:\n\nFirst four terms: 10,000 + 1,990,000 + 100 + 199 = 10,000+1,990,000 is 2,000,000, plus 100+199 is 299 \u2192 total 2,000,299.\n\nAdding 3,960,100 gives 2,000,299 + 3,960,100 = 5,960,399.\n\nThen adding 39,601 gives 5,960,399 +39,601 = 6,000,000. Perfect, so that works.\n\nWait another test case: a=100, b=2, c=198.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\n100\u00b2*2 +100\u00b2*198 +2\u00b2*100 +2\u00b2*198 +198\u00b2*100 +198\u00b2*2\n\nFirst terms:\n\n100\u00b2*2 = 20,000,\n\n100\u00b2*198 = 19,800,000,\n\n2\u00b2*100 =4*100=400,\n\n2\u00b2*198=4*198=792,\n\n198\u00b2*100 = (39,204)*100=3,920,400,\n\n198\u00b2*2 =39,204*2=78,408.\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n20,000 +19,800,000 =19,820,000,\n\n+400 \u2192 19,820,400,\n\n+792 \u219219,821,192,\n\n+3,920,400 \u219223,741,592,\n\n+78,408 \u219223,820,000.\n\nWait, 23,820,000? But that's way over 6,000,000. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, hold on, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, 100 squared is 10,000. So 10,000*2 is 20,000,\n\n10,000*198 =1,980,000,\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the second term. 100\u00b2*198 is 10,000 *198 =1,980,000, not 19.8 million. My mistake!\n\nSo correct terms:\n\nFirst term: 20,000,\n\nSecond term:1,980,000,\n\nThird term:400,\n\nFourth term:792,\n\nFifth term:198\u00b2*100,\n\n198 squared is (200 -2)^2 = 40,000 -800 +4 = 39,204,\n\nso 39,204 *100 =3,920,400,\n\nSixth term:39,204 *2 =78,408.\n\nNow adding all terms:\n\n20,000 +1,980,000 =2,000,000,\n\n+400 \u21922,000,400,\n\n+792 \u21922,001,192,\n\n+3,920,400 \u21925,921,592,\n\n+78,408 \u21925,921,592 +78,408 =6,000,000.\n\nAh! There we go. So it does work. Therefore, my initial mistake was miscalculating 100\u00b2*198 as 19.8 million instead of 1.98 million. So it does work. Therefore, indeed, whenever one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200, the equation holds.\n\nTherefore, this gives a lot of solutions. Specifically, for each variable (a, b, c), setting that variable to 100 and the other two variables to any pair adding to 200 gives valid triples. Since the variables are ordered, each such choice is unique.\n\nSo for each of the three variables (a, b, or c), we can set that variable to 100, and the other two variables can be any non-negative integers adding to 200. The number of solutions for each variable is 201 (since if we set variable X to 100, the other two variables Y and Z can be from 0 to 200, with Y + Z =200, so 201 solutions). However, we have to be careful not to double-count cases where two variables are 100. For instance, the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times (once in each variable's count). Similarly, triples where two variables are 100 and the third is 100 are the same as the all-100 case.\n\nTherefore, let's compute the total number:\n\nFor each of the three variables, the number of triples where that variable is fixed at 100 is 201. However, when two variables are fixed at 100, those cases are counted in two of the counts, and the case where all three are 100 is counted three times.\n\nFirst, compute total without considering overlaps: 3 * 201 = 603.\n\nNow subtract overlaps:\n\nThe number of triples where two variables are 100. For example, a=100 and b=100, then c=100. Similarly for other pairs. Each pair (there are C(3,2)=3 pairs) gives exactly one triple where the third variable is also 100. So there are 3 triples where two variables are 100 (but actually, all three are 100, so it's just the one triple (100,100,100)). Wait, actually, if two variables are set to 100, then the third must also be 100 since their sum must be 300. Because if a=100, b=100, then c=100. So actually, there's only one triple where all three are 100. So the overlap when considering two variables fixed at 100 is actually the same as the triple (100,100,100). So the overlaps are as follows:\n\nEach pair of variables being set to 100 only allows the triple where all three are 100. So how many times is the triple (100,100,100) counted in the initial 3*201? It is counted three times (once in each variable's count). So to compute the correct total:\n\nTotal = (3 * 201) - (3 * 1) + 1. Wait, inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nThe formula for three sets is |A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nHere, each set A is the set of triples with a=100, B with b=100, C with c=100.\n\nWe want |A \u222a B \u222a C|.\n\nSo:\n\n|A| = |B| = |C| =201,\n\n|A\u2229B| = triples with a=100 and b=100 \u2192 then c=100, so only 1 triple,\n\nSimilarly |A\u2229C|=1, |B\u2229C|=1,\n\n|A\u2229B\u2229C|=1.\n\nTherefore,\n\nTotal triples = 3*201 - 3*1 + 1 = 603 -3 +1 = 601.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n3*201 = 603,\n\nSubtract 3 (for the overlaps between pairs),\n\nAdd back 1 (for the triple overlap).\n\nSo total is 603 -3 +1 = 601.\n\nBut let me verify this with another approach. The total number of triples where at least one variable is 100 is:\n\nFor each variable, the number of triples with that variable as 100 is 201, but subtract overlaps. Alternatively:\n\nNumber of triples with a=100:201,\n\nplus triples with b=100 but a\u2260100:201 -1 (excluding the case where a=100),\n\nplus triples with c=100 but a\u2260100 and b\u2260100:201 -1 -1 (excluding cases where a or b are 100),\n\nWait that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the inclusion-exclusion gives 601 as above.\n\nHowever, the all-100 triple is included in all three counts, so the inclusion-exclusion accounts for that.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples where at least one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 is 601.\n\nHowever, but earlier we also found solutions where one variable is 0 and the other two are 200 and 100. Wait, but those are included in this count?\n\nWait, for example, the triple (200,100,0):\n\nHere, c=0, so it is not included in the count where one variable is 100. Wait a second. Wait, in the count above, we considered triples where one variable is exactly 100, so if a variable is 0, it's not part of those counts. Therefore, the triples with a zero are separate?\n\nWait, so actually, the triples where one variable is 0 and the other two are 200 and 100 are different from the triples where one variable is 100 and the others sum to 200. So we need to consider them separately.\n\nWait, but in the case where one variable is 0, like (200, 100, 0), does that satisfy the equation?\n\nYes, as we saw earlier, when we set c=0, then a and b must be 200 and 100, so that gives 6 triples (permuting the zero).\n\nSo these are separate from the triples where one variable is 100. Therefore, the total solutions are the 601 (from the triples with a 100) plus the 6 (with a zero), plus the case where all are 100 (already counted in both? Wait no, all 100 is included in the 601 count, so adding the 6 gives total 607?\n\nWait, need to check:\n\nWait, the triples with a zero: (0,200,100), etc., have none of the variables equal to 100 except possibly one (if one variable is 100 and another is 200 and third is 0). Wait, for example, in (200,100,0), the variable 100 is present, so actually, this triple is already counted in the 601 count?\n\nWait, hold on! Let me check the triple (200,100,0):\n\nHere, the variable b is 100 (if we consider the second element as b). So in this case, the second variable is 100, and the other two variables (a=200 and c=0) add to 200. So this triple is included in the count where b=100. Therefore, actually, the triples with a zero are already included in the 601 count. Wait, but when we considered triples where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200, that includes cases where one of those two variables is zero. For example, in the case where a=100, b=200, c=0 is allowed because b + c =200. So that triple is included in the a=100 count. Similarly, (200,100,0) is included in the b=100 count, etc. Therefore, the 6 triples with a zero are already part of the 601 count. Therefore, we don't need to add them separately. So the total number of triples where at least one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 is 601, which includes all the cases where variables are 0, 100, 200 etc.\n\nWait but let me check if there are any other solutions outside of this?\n\nEarlier, when I considered two variables equal, we only found the all 100s solution, but actually, in the case where variables are set to 100 and others vary, there are more solutions. So perhaps all solutions are included in this 601?\n\nWait, but let me think of another case where none of the variables is 100 or 0. For example, suppose a=150, b=150, c=0. But c=0 here, so that's included in the previous counts. Wait, but if all variables are non-zero and non-100, can there be a solution?\n\nSuppose a=150, b=150, c=0. Then it's already considered. Let me try another example, like a=130, b=170, c=0. Then, this would be part of the case where one variable is 0 and the other two sum to 300, but wait no, in this case, a + b = 300? No, a + b + c =300, so if c=0, then a + b=300. Wait, but in our previous case with zero, we had a + b =200? Wait, no, when we set c=0, then a + b = 300. Wait, but in the previous analysis when we set c=0, the equation led us to ab =20,000. Wait, hold on, let me re-examine that.\n\nWait earlier, when we set c=0, then the equations became a + b = 300,\n\nand the second equation became ab*300 =6,000,000 \u2192 ab=20,000.\n\nSo in that case, a and b must multiply to 20,000 and add to 300.\n\nWait, but 200 and 100 multiply to 20,000 and add to 300. So that's the only solution? Wait, let's see:\n\nThe quadratic equation for a and b is x^2 -300x +20,000=0,\n\nWait discriminant is 300\u00b2 -80,000 =90,000 -80,000=10,000,\n\nsqrt(10,000)=100,\n\nso roots are [300 \u00b1100]/2 \u2192 200 and 100. Therefore, the only solutions when c=0 are (200,100,0) and permutations. So those are the only triples where one variable is zero. Thus, those are already included in the 601 count because in those triples, one of the other variables is 100.\n\nWait, in the triple (200, 100, 0), the 100 is present, so it is counted in the set where the middle variable is 100 (if ordered as (200,100,0)), so it is included in the count where one variable is 100.\n\nTherefore, all solutions are captured in the 601 count. Additionally, are there any other solutions outside of this?\n\nSuppose we have a triple where none of the variables is 100 or 0. Let me try to see if that's possible.\n\nSuppose a=150, b=150, c=0. But c=0, so that's already considered.\n\nAnother example: a=130, b=120, c=50. Let me check if this satisfies the equations.\n\nFirst, a + b + c =130 +120 +50 = 300. Good.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n130\u00b2*120 = (16,900)*120 = 2,028,000,\n\n130\u00b2*50 =16,900*50 =845,000,\n\n120\u00b2*130 =14,400*130= 1,872,000,\n\n120\u00b2*50 =14,400*50=720,000,\n\n50\u00b2*130=2,500*130=325,000,\n\n50\u00b2*120=2,500*120=300,000.\n\nAdding them all up:\n\n2,028,000 +845,000 =2,873,000,\n\n+1,872,000 \u21924,745,000,\n\n+720,000 \u21925,465,000,\n\n+325,000 \u21925,790,000,\n\n+300,000 \u21926,090,000.\n\nThat's 6,090,000 which is more than 6,000,000. So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother test: a=150, b=150, c=0. As before:\n\na\u00b2b + ... etc.\n\nBut let's compute:\n\n150\u00b2*150 +150\u00b2*0 +150\u00b2*150 +150\u00b2*0 +0\u00b2*150 +0\u00b2*150\n\n=2*(150^3) +0 + ... = 2*(3,375,000) =6,750,000 which is way over.\n\nHmm. Another test case where variables are not 100 or 0 but maybe symmetric?\n\nSuppose a=120, b=120, c=60. Sum is 300.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\n120\u00b2*120 +120\u00b2*60 +120\u00b2*120 +120\u00b2*60 +60\u00b2*120 +60\u00b2*120.\n\nWait, this is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should consider that all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100 or one variable equal to 0?\n\nWait, but when we set one variable to 100, the other two can be anything adding to 200, so that gives all the solutions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no solutions outside of the triples where at least one variable is 100 or 0?\n\nWait, but in the substitution earlier, when we set a variable to 100, we found that any pair adding to 200 works, so that's a huge number of solutions. But the problem asks for the number of triples of nonnegative integers. So according to this, the total is 601. But in the earlier analysis when we considered two variables equal, we only found the all-100 case, and when we considered a zero, we found 6 triples which are included in the 601.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for all triples (a,b,c) where a + b + c =300 and the expression equals 6,000,000. According to our analysis, all such triples are those where at least one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200, which gives 601 solutions. However, let me confirm with another approach.\n\nLet me consider that the equation reduces to 100Q - P =2,000,000,\n\nand since a + b + c =300,\n\nWe can think of Q and P in terms of variables.\n\nBut if we have one variable fixed at 100, then as we saw, the equation holds regardless of the other two variables (as long as they add to 200). So that's a valid condition.\n\nTherefore, the only solutions are those triples where one of the variables is 100, and the other two add to 200. Thus, the total number is 601 as per inclusion-exclusion.\n\nWait but let me check with the case where two variables are 100. For example, a=100, b=100, c=100. This is counted three times in the initial count (once for each variable being 100). In inclusion-exclusion, we subtract the overlaps where two variables are 100, but since setting two variables to 100 forces the third to also be 100, the overlaps are exactly the single triple where all are 100. Therefore, the inclusion-exclusion formula correctly accounts for it.\n\nTherefore, the total number is 601.\n\nWait but hold on! Wait in my substitution approach earlier, when we set variables as a =100 + p, etc., we found that when r =0 (i.e., c=100), then any p gives a solution. But when we considered the case where two variables are equal (a = b), we only found the solution where all are 100. But in reality, when two variables are equal but not 100, like a = b = 150, then c =0, which is part of the other solutions. So those are included in the count where c=0 (but c=0 is allowed as long as one of the other variables is 100? Wait no, in this case, a and b are 150 each, so neither is 100, but c=0. Wait, but in this case, a + b = 300, but the equation requires ab*300 =6,000,000 \u2192 ab =20,000. If a = b =150, then ab=22,500 which is not 20,000. Hence, this is not a solution. The only solutions when one variable is 0 are those where the other two are 200 and 100, which do include a 100. So, in that case, yes, all solutions where one variable is 0 have another variable at 100.\n\nTherefore, all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100, so the count of 601 is correct?\n\nWait, but let me see the case when two variables are 100 and the third is 100. That's the all-100 case, which is included. The case when one variable is 100, another is 200, and third is 0 is included. The case when one variable is 100 and the other two are 50 and 150 is included. So all possibilities where one variable is 100 are valid, and there are no other solutions. Hence, the total number is indeed 601.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me verify with another method.\n\nLet me consider variables where one variable is 100. Let's say a=100, so then b + c =200. The number of non-negative integer solutions to b + c =200 is 201 (from b=0 to 200). Similarly for b=100 and c=100. So 3*201. But when a=100 and b=100, c must be 100, so this case is counted three times in the 3*201. Therefore, to get the correct total, subtract the duplicates.\n\nTotal triples with at least one 100 = (3*201) - (3*1) +1 = 603 -3 +1=601. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601? But wait, the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so that includes zero. But let me check if there are any constraints I missed.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the triples are ordered. So all permutations are considered distinct. For example, (100, 200, 0) and (200, 100, 0) are different triples and both are counted.\n\nTherefore, the count of 601 is correct?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's see:\n\nEach of the three variables can be the one fixed at 100. For each such variable, the other two variables can be any pair (x, 200 -x) where x ranges from 0 to 200. Each such pair gives a distinct ordered triple only if we consider the positions. Wait, actually, for each variable set to 100, the other two variables can be arranged in any order. For example, if we fix a=100, then (b,c) can be (0,200), (1,199), ..., (200,0), which are 201 ordered pairs. Therefore, for each variable fixed at 100, there are 201 ordered triples. Since there are three variables, that's 3*201=603. However, the case where all three are 100 is counted three times (once for each variable being fixed at 100). So we need to subtract the duplicates. The all-100 triple is counted three times, so we subtract 2 to get it down to one. The other overlaps are when two variables are fixed at 100, which forces the third to also be 100, so those overlaps are already accounted for in the all-100 case. So total is 603 - 2*1 (since we subtract the overcounts for the all-100 case). Wait, maybe my inclusion-exclusion was wrong earlier?\n\nWait, inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - AB - AC - BC + ABC,\n\nwhere A, B, C are the sets where a=100, b=100, c=100 respectively.\n\nEach of A, B, C has 201 elements.\n\nThe intersections AB, AC, BC each consist of the single triple where all three are 100.\n\nTherefore,\n\nTotal = 201 + 201 + 201 -1 -1 -1 +1 = 603 -3 +1 =601.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is 601.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered the case where a variable is set to zero, I found 6 triples, but they are already included in the 601 count. For example, (200,100,0) is part of the set where b=100 (if the middle variable is considered as b), so it's counted in the 201 for b=100.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 601?\n\nWait, but let me check for another possible case. Suppose all three variables are different and none is 100. For example, a=150, b=50, c=100. Wait, but in this case, c=100, so it's included in the count. So if all variables are different but one is 100, it's still counted. So there are no solutions outside the 601.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601. But let me cross-verify with small cases.\n\nWait, for example, let me take a smaller version of the problem where a + b + c = 6, and the expression equals some value. Maybe that can help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the inclusion-exclusion?\n\nWait, another way to compute it is:\n\nThe number of triples where a=100 is 201 (since b + c =200 has 201 solutions).\n\nSimilarly for b=100 and c=100.\n\nBut when you add them up, you get 3*201 =603.\n\nHowever, the cases where two variables are 100 are counted twice each. For example, the triple (100,100,100) is in all three sets, so it's counted three times. The triples where two variables are 100 and the third is not (but actually, in this problem, if two variables are 100, the third must be 100 as well because 100+100 +c=300 \u2192 c=100). Therefore, the only overlap is the triple (100,100,100), which is counted three times. So to correct the count:\n\nTotal = 3*201 - 2*(overcounts). Since the overcounts for the all-100 case is 2 (since we want to count it once, but it's counted three times, so subtract 2).\n\nThus, 603 - 2 = 601. Same as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601.\n\nWait but the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so zero is allowed, and all cases are considered.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When we fix a variable to 100, say a=100, then b and c can be any pair adding to 200, including cases where b or c is 100. For example, if a=100 and b=100, then c=100. So in the count for a=100, the triple (100,100,100) is included, similarly for the counts for b=100 and c=100. So the overlaps between the sets are only the all-100 triple. There are no triples where two variables are 100 and the third isn't, since that would require the third to also be 100. Therefore, inclusion-exclusion holds as above.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is 601.\n\nHowever, the problem might have a different answer, so I need to ensure I didn't make a miscalculation.\n\nWait, but let me think again of the initial substitution where we set a =100 +p, b =100 -p, c =100. That gives 201 solutions where c is fixed at 100. But in reality, for each variable being the one fixed at 100, you have 201 solutions. So total is 3*201 =603, but subtract duplicates.\n\nBut in this case, the duplicate is only the all-100 case counted thrice. So total is 603 - 2*(1) =601.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 601.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the equation is a\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b =6,000,000. When all variables are 100, this gives 6*(100)^3 =6,000,000. Correct.\n\nWhen one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200, say a=100, b=x, c=200 -x, then the expression evaluates to 6,000,000 as shown in previous examples. So all those cases work. Therefore, all 601 cases are valid. Hence, the answer is 601.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first considered the case with a zero, I thought there were 6 solutions, but they are included in the 601.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 601.\n\nBut wait, let me check the case where two variables are 100 and the third is 100. It is counted once, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"triples of nonnegative integers\". So, for example, the triple (100, 0, 200) is allowed and is counted in the 601.\n\nYes, so I think the answer is 601. But let me see if that's an integer, which it is. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me see: When we fix a variable to 100, there are 201 ordered triples for each variable. So for a=100, the triples are (100, b, c) where b + c =200, and b and c can be anything, so ordered pairs (b, c) from (0,200) to (200,0), which is 201. Similarly for b=100 and c=100. So total 3\u00d7201=603. Subtract the duplicates. The only duplicate is the triple (100,100,100), which is counted three times. So subtract 2 duplicates, giving 601.\n\nYes, so the final answer is 601. Therefore, I think that is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{601}\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nGiven the problem of finding the number of triples of nonnegative integers \\((a, b, c)\\) satisfying \\(a + b + c = 300\\) and \\(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\\), we start by analyzing the given equations.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the second equation using symmetric properties:\n\\[\na^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(a + b + c = 300\\), we get:\n\\[\n300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\\]\nDividing by 3, we simplify to:\n\\[\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the case where one of the variables is fixed at 100.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b equals 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but maybe I can break it down.\n\nFirst, let me write down the given equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 300\n2. a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000\n\nHmm, the second equation looks symmetrical in a, b, c. Maybe I can factor it somehow? Let me see. Let's try to factor the left-hand side of the second equation.\n\nLooking at the terms: each term is of the form (variable squared times another variable). Let me see if I can factor this expression. Maybe group terms?\n\nLet's see:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c = a\u00b2(b + c)\nSimilarly, b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c = b\u00b2(a + c)\nAnd c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nHmm, that seems better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, maybe we can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), and similarly for the others.\n\nLet me try that substitution:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000\n\nHmm, that might be helpful. Let me write that equation down again:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000\n\nBut since a + b + c = 300, maybe there's a way to relate this to another expression. Alternatively, perhaps expanding the original expression might help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the original expression can be written in terms of (a + b + c)^3 or something. Let me think about some algebraic identities.\n\nWait, let me recall that:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(a + c)(b + c)\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly. Let me recall the correct expansion.\n\nActually, (a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(a + c) + 3(b + c)(a + b) + ... Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b can be related to (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc. Let me check:\n\nLet me compute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca)\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n= a\u00b2b + abc + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + abc + abc + bc\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\n\nWait, let's count terms:\n\nFirst term: a(ab) = a\u00b2b\n\nSecond term: a(bc) = abc\n\nThird term: a(ca) = a\u00b2c\n\nFourth term: b(ab) = ab\u00b2\n\nFifth term: b(bc) = b\u00b2c\n\nSixth term: b(ca) = abc\n\nSeventh term: c(ab) = abc\n\nEighth term: c(bc) = bc\u00b2\n\nNinth term: c(ca) = c\u00b2a\n\nSo combining like terms:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + bc\u00b2 + c\u00b2a + 3abc\n\nTherefore,\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = (a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) + 3abc\n\nTherefore, the expression we have in the problem, which is a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b, is equal to (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nSo substituting that in:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nWe know that a + b + c = 300, so substitute that in:\n\n300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nHmm, okay, so now we have an equation involving ab + bc + ca and abc. Let's write that equation as:\n\n300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nLet me divide both sides by 3 to simplify:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\n\nHmm, so 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000. Not sure yet, but maybe I can find another relation here. Let me think.\n\nSince we have a + b + c = 300, perhaps we can denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ca. Then, the equation becomes 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nBut also, in symmetric polynomials, we know that for three variables, the relation between S, Q, and P is given by the equation:\n\na^3 + b^3 + c^3 = S^3 - 3S Q + 3P\n\nBut not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express Q in terms of variables?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume some variables are equal? Since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, maybe there's some symmetry in the solution.\n\nSuppose two variables are equal. Let me try that. Let's suppose a = b. Then, since a + b + c = 300, we have 2a + c = 300, so c = 300 - 2a.\n\nThen, let's substitute into the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000\n\nSince a = b, this becomes:\n\na\u00b2a + a\u00b2c + a\u00b2a + a\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2a\n\nWait, let me compute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = a^3,\n\na\u00b2c = a\u00b2c,\n\nb\u00b2a = a^3,\n\nb\u00b2c = a\u00b2c,\n\nc\u00b2a = a c\u00b2,\n\nc\u00b2b = a c\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, summing all terms:\n\na^3 + a\u00b2c + a^3 + a\u00b2c + a c\u00b2 + a c\u00b2\n\n= 2a^3 + 2a\u00b2c + 2a c\u00b2\n\nFactor out 2a:\n\n2a(a\u00b2 + a c + c\u00b2)\n\nHmm, but c = 300 - 2a. Let's substitute that in:\n\nFirst, compute a\u00b2 + a c + c\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2 + a*(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\na\u00b2 + (300a - 2a\u00b2) + (90000 - 1200a + 4a\u00b2)\n\nCombine terms:\n\na\u00b2 - 2a\u00b2 + 4a\u00b2 = 3a\u00b2,\n\n300a - 1200a = -900a,\n\nAnd the constant term 90000.\n\nSo total is 3a\u00b2 - 900a + 90000.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 2a*(3a\u00b2 - 900a + 90000) = 6a^3 - 1800a^2 + 180000a.\n\nSet equal to 6,000,000:\n\n6a^3 - 1800a^2 + 180000a = 6,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\na^3 - 300a^2 + 30000a = 1,000,000\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\na^3 - 300a^2 + 30000a - 1,000,000 = 0\n\nHmm, need to solve this cubic equation for integer a. Since a must be a nonnegative integer and c = 300 - 2a must also be nonnegative, so 300 - 2a \u2265 0 \u2192 a \u2264 150.\n\nLet me try to find integer roots between 0 and 150. Let me try possible a's.\n\nMaybe factor the cubic equation?\n\nLet me see if a = 100 is a root:\n\n100^3 - 300*(100)^2 + 30000*100 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0\n\nYes! So a = 100 is a root. Therefore, (a - 100) is a factor.\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or factorization.\n\nDivide the cubic by (a - 100):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30000 | -1,000,000\n\nRoot: 100\n\nBring down 1\n\nMultiply by 100: 1*100 = 100. Add to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200\n\nMultiply -200 by 100 = -20,000. Add to next coefficient: 30,000 + (-20,000) = 10,000\n\nMultiply 10,000 by 100 = 1,000,000. Add to last term: -1,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nSo the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000)\n\nThen, set the quadratic factor to zero:\n\na\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0\n\nSolutions:\n\na = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(200\u00b2 - 4*1*10000)] / 2\n\nCompute discriminant: 40,000 - 40,000 = 0. So a = 200/2 = 100. So the quadratic has a double root at 100.\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as (a - 100)^3 = 0. Wait, so the equation is (a - 100)^3 = 0, so the only real root is a = 100. But since we already factored out (a - 100) once, but actually the quadratic was (a - 100)^2. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation was a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0. Let me compute discriminant again:\n\nDiscriminant D = (200)^2 - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0. So yes, a = [200]/2 = 100. So indeed, the quadratic is (a - 100)^2. Therefore, the cubic factors as (a - 100)^3 = 0, so the only solution is a = 100.\n\nTherefore, when assuming a = b, the only solution is a = b = 100, so then c = 300 - 2*100 = 100. So that would mean a = b = c = 100. Let me check if that works in the original equation.\n\nCheck a = b = c = 100:\n\nFirst equation: 100 + 100 + 100 = 300, which is good.\n\nSecond equation: a\u00b2b + ... etc. Since all variables are equal, each term is 100\u00b2*100 = 1,000,000. There are 6 terms (each pair of variables), so total is 6*1,000,000 = 6,000,000. Perfect, that works.\n\nSo that is one solution where all variables are equal. But since the problem is symmetric, this is just one triple (100,100,100). But maybe there are other solutions where variables aren't equal?\n\nHmm, so perhaps assuming two variables equal gives only that solution, but maybe there are solutions where all variables are different? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are solutions where one variable is 0? Let me try that.\n\nSuppose c = 0. Then the equations become:\n\na + b = 300,\n\nand the second equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2*0 + 0\u00b2a + 0\u00b2b = a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 = ab(a + b) = ab*300 = 6,000,000\n\nThus, ab*300 = 6,000,000 \u2192 ab = 20,000.\n\nSo, with a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000. So we can set up quadratic equation:\n\nLet a and b be roots of x\u00b2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0\n\nCompute discriminant: 300\u00b2 - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000\n\nThus, roots are [300 \u00b1 100]/2 \u2192 (400)/2 = 200 and (200)/2 = 100. So a and b are 200 and 100. So the triples would be (200,100,0), (100,200,0), and (0,200,100), etc. Since c can be any of the three variables, so there are 3 permutations here.\n\nWait, but we set c = 0. So the triples are (200, 100, 0), (100, 200, 0), (200, 0, 100), (100, 0, 200), (0, 200, 100), (0, 100, 200). Wait, actually, since c is the one set to 0, but actually, the variables are interchangeable, so all permutations where one variable is 0, another is 200, and the third is 100. So how many such triples are there?\n\nThere are 3 choices for which variable is 0, and once that is fixed, the other two are determined as 200 and 100. Since 200 and 100 are distinct, each choice of the zero variable gives two permutations? Wait no, actually, once you fix which variable is 0, say c is 0, then (a,b) can be (200,100) or (100,200). So for each of the three variables being zero, there are two triples. So total is 3 * 2 = 6 triples where one variable is 0, another is 200, and the third is 100. So that's another 6 solutions.\n\nSo so far, we have 1 (all 100s) + 6 (with 0, 100, 200) = 7 solutions. But maybe there are more?\n\nWait, let me check another case where two variables are equal but not all three. Wait, earlier when we assumed a = b, we got the solution where all three are 100. So perhaps if we set two variables equal but not to 100? Let me see. Suppose a = b but not equal to 100. Wait but in that case, when we set a = b, the equation led only to a = 100. So maybe no other solutions when two variables are equal?\n\nAlternatively, suppose another case where one variable is different, but not zero. Let me think. Let me try to see if there are solutions where all three variables are different and non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are solutions where two variables are equal but not 100, but when I tried that, the equation only had a=100 as a solution, so that might not be possible.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the case where two variables are equal but not necessarily 100. Wait, but in that case, the equation led to a cubic which only had a=100 as a solution, so maybe that's the only one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps variables can be arranged in some other way. Let me try to think of another approach.\n\nWe have the equations:\n\na + b + c = 300,\n\nand 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = 300,\n\nQ = ab + bc + ca,\n\nP = abc.\n\nSo the equation is 100Q - P = 2,000,000,\n\nand we also know that for three variables,\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca),\n\nso 300\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2Q,\n\nso a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 90000 - 2Q.\n\nHmm, but not sure if that helps yet. Alternatively, maybe express P in terms of Q?\n\nFrom the equation, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nSo, if I can find another relation involving Q and P, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the equation for (a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2. Let me see.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe if I let variables be x, y, z such that they are deviations from 100? Since 300 divided by 3 is 100, so perhaps symmetric around 100.\n\nLet me let a = 100 + p,\n\nb = 100 + q,\n\nc = 100 + r,\n\nso that p + q + r = 0.\n\nThen, substituting into the equations, maybe?\n\nLet me try that substitution.\n\nLet me set a = 100 + p, b = 100 + q, c = 100 + r,\n\nwith p + q + r = 0.\n\nThen, let's compute Q = ab + bc + ca,\n\nand P = abc.\n\nFirst, compute Q:\n\nab = (100 + p)(100 + q) = 100\u00b2 + 100(q + p) + pq,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nbc = (100 + q)(100 + r) = 100\u00b2 + 100(q + r) + qr,\n\nca = (100 + r)(100 + p) = 100\u00b2 + 100(r + p) + rp,\n\nAdding these up:\n\nQ = 3*100\u00b2 + 100[ (q + p) + (q + r) + (r + p) ] + (pq + qr + rp)\n\nSimplify the terms inside:\n\nThe coefficients of 100: (q + p + q + r + r + p) = 2(p + q + r) = 2*0 = 0,\n\nsince p + q + r =0.\n\nSo the middle term is 0.\n\nThe cross terms: pq + qr + rp.\n\nTherefore,\n\nQ = 3*10,000 + (pq + qr + rp) = 30,000 + (pq + qr + rp)\n\nSimilarly, compute P = abc = (100 + p)(100 + q)(100 + r)\n\nLet me expand that:\n\nFirst, multiply (100 + p)(100 + q) = 100\u00b2 + 100(q + p) + pq,\n\nthen multiply by (100 + r):\n\n= [100\u00b2 + 100(p + q) + pq] * (100 + r)\n\n= 100\u00b2*100 + 100\u00b2 r + 100(p + q)*100 + 100(p + q) r + pq*100 + pq*r\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: 100^3,\n\nSecond term: 100\u00b2 r,\n\nThird term: 100^2 (p + q),\n\nFourth term: 100 r (p + q),\n\nFifth term: 100 pq,\n\nSixth term: pq r\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= 100^3 + 100\u00b2 (r + p + q) + 100 [ r(p + q) + pq ] + pq r\n\nBut since p + q + r =0, so r + p + q = 0,\n\nso the second term is 0.\n\nAlso, note that r(p + q) = r(-r) because p + q = -r,\n\nSimilarly, pq = ?\n\nWait, let me see step by step:\n\nFirst term: 100^3.\n\nSecond term: 0.\n\nThird term: 100 [ r(p + q) + pq ]\n\nBut since p + q = -r,\n\nso r(p + q) = r*(-r) = -r\u00b2,\n\nTherefore,\n\nThird term becomes 100 [ -r\u00b2 + pq ]\n\nFourth term: pq r.\n\nTherefore, total expression:\n\n100^3 + 100(-r\u00b2 + pq) + pq r\n\nHmm, so:\n\nP = 1,000,000 - 100 r\u00b2 + 100 pq + pq r\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated, but maybe substituting into the equation.\n\nWe have from the equation:\n\n100 Q - P = 2,000,000,\n\nSubstituting Q and P:\n\n100*(30,000 + (pq + qr + rp)) - [1,000,000 - 100 r\u00b2 + 100 pq + pq r] = 2,000,000\n\nLet me compute term by term.\n\nFirst term: 100*(30,000) = 3,000,000,\n\nSecond term: 100*(pq + qr + rp),\n\nThird term: subtract [1,000,000 - 100 r\u00b2 + 100 pq + pq r]\n\nSo expanding the subtraction:\n\n-1,000,000 + 100 r\u00b2 - 100 pq - pq r\n\nTherefore, total equation:\n\n3,000,000 + 100(pq + qr + rp) -1,000,000 + 100 r\u00b2 - 100 pq - pq r = 2,000,000\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000,\n\nThen, terms with pq:\n\n100(pq + qr + rp) -100 pq = 100 (qr + rp),\n\nTerms with r\u00b2:\n\n+100 r\u00b2,\n\nTerms with pq r: - pq r,\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n2,000,000 + 100 (qr + rp) + 100 r\u00b2 - pq r = 2,000,000\n\nSubtract 2,000,000 from both sides:\n\n100 (qr + rp) + 100 r\u00b2 - pq r = 0\n\nFactor terms:\n\nLet me see, perhaps factor out r?\n\nr [100(q + p) + 100 r - pq ] = 0\n\nHmm, let's see:\n\nWait, 100(qr + rp) = 100 r (q + p),\n\nand 100 r\u00b2 is 100 r\u00b2,\n\nand -pq r is -pq r,\n\nSo altogether:\n\n100 r (q + p) + 100 r\u00b2 - pq r = 0\n\nFactor out r:\n\nr [100 (q + p) + 100 r - pq ] = 0\n\nTherefore, either r = 0, or the term in brackets is zero.\n\nCase 1: r = 0.\n\nIf r = 0, then since p + q + r =0, p + q =0 \u2192 q = -p.\n\nTherefore, variables:\n\na = 100 + p,\n\nb = 100 + q = 100 - p,\n\nc = 100 + r = 100.\n\nSo c is fixed at 100, and a and b are 100 + p and 100 - p.\n\nThus, a + b + c = (100 + p) + (100 - p) + 100 = 300, which is okay.\n\nNow, we can substitute into the original equation to see if this works.\n\nBut wait, since we are in the case where r=0, so let me see what the equation gives us.\n\nWait, in this case, since r=0, the equation is satisfied, so the condition reduces to r=0 or the other term. So perhaps in this case, the equation holds?\n\nWait, actually, since we derived this under the substitution, so this case is allowed. So in this case, the variables are (100 + p, 100 - p, 100). Let's check if they satisfy the original equation.\n\nLet me compute the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nLet me denote a = 100 + p, b = 100 - p, c = 100.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = (100 + p)^2 (100 - p),\n\na\u00b2c = (100 + p)^2 * 100,\n\nb\u00b2a = (100 - p)^2 (100 + p),\n\nb\u00b2c = (100 - p)^2 * 100,\n\nc\u00b2a = 100\u00b2 (100 + p),\n\nc\u00b2b = 100\u00b2 (100 - p).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (100 + p)^2 (100 - p)\n\nSecond term: (100 + p)^2 * 100\n\nThird term: (100 - p)^2 (100 + p)\n\nFourth term: (100 - p)^2 * 100\n\nFifth term: 100\u00b2 (100 + p)\n\nSixth term: 100\u00b2 (100 - p)\n\nLet me compute all terms:\n\nFirst term: Let me expand (100 + p)^2 (100 - p):\n\nFirst compute (100 + p)^2 = 10,000 + 200p + p\u00b2,\n\nMultiply by (100 - p):\n\n= (10,000)(100) + (10,000)(-p) + 200p*100 + 200p*(-p) + p\u00b2*100 + p\u00b2*(-p)\n\n= 1,000,000 - 10,000p + 20,000p - 200p\u00b2 + 100p\u00b2 - p\u00b3\n\nSimplify:\n\n1,000,000 + 10,000p - 100p\u00b2 - p\u00b3\n\nSecond term: (100 + p)^2 *100 = (10,000 + 200p + p\u00b2)*100 = 1,000,000 + 20,000p + 100p\u00b2\n\nThird term: (100 - p)^2 (100 + p).

There are 6 terms, so 6,000,000.\n\nNow, p terms:\n\nTerm1: +10,000p\n\nTerm2: +20,000p\n\nTerm3: -10,000p\n\nTerm4: -20,000p\n\nTerm5: +10,000p\n\nTerm6: -10,000p\n\nAdding these:\n\n10,000 +20,000 -10,000 -20,000 +10,000 -10,000 = (10k +20k) =30k, then subtract 10k gives 20k, subtract 20k gives 0, then add 10k gives 10k, subtract 10k gives 0. So total p terms cancel out.\n\np\u00b2 terms:\n\nTerm1: -100p\u00b2\n\nTerm2: +100p\u00b2\n\nTerm3: -100p\u00b2\n\nTerm4: +100p\u00b2\n\nOthers: 0.\n\nAdding these:\n\n-100 +100 -100 +100 = 0. So p\u00b2 terms cancel.\n\np\u00b3 terms:\n\nTerm1: -p\u00b3\n\nTerm3: +p\u00b3\n\nTotal: -p\u00b3 + p\u00b3 = 0.\n\nTherefore, all terms except the constants cancel out, so total sum is 6,000,000.\n\nTherefore, for any p, as long as variables are integers and non-negative, this holds.\n\nWait a second! So that means that for any p where a = 100 + p, b = 100 - p, and c = 100, as long as a, b, c are non-negative integers, the equation holds?\n\nWow, that's interesting. So this gives infinitely many solutions? But wait, no, because p has to be an integer such that a, b, c are non-negative integers.\n\nSince a =100 + p, b =100 - p, c =100. So to have a and b non-negative:\n\na \u22650 \u2192 100 + p \u22650 \u2192 p \u2265 -100,\n\nb \u22650 \u2192 100 - p \u22650 \u2192 p \u2264 100,\n\nAlso, c is always 100, which is okay.\n\nTherefore p can range from -100 to 100. But since p must be an integer, the possible values are p = -100, -99,..., 0,...,99,100. Wait, but p must be such that both a and b are non-negative integers.\n\nWait, but actually, since a, b, c are non-negative integers, p can be from -100 to 100, but since p is an integer, the number of possible p is 201 (from -100 to 100 inclusive). However, we have to make sure that a and b are non-negative.\n\nWait, but when p = -100, then a = 0, b = 200. Which is okay, but then c is 100. So that's allowed. Similarly, p = 100 gives a = 200, b = 0, which is also allowed. So all those p from -100 to 100 are valid. However, note that the variables are ordered triples (a,b,c). But in this case, since c is fixed at 100, the triples would be (100 + p, 100 - p, 100). However, since the problem counts triples (a, b, c) where the order matters, but in this case, when we fix c to 100, the other variables are a and b. So each p gives a unique triple where the third element is 100, and first two are 100 \u00b1 p. But since p can be from -100 to 100, but also, when p is positive, it's different from p negative? Wait, for example, p = 1 gives (101, 99, 100), p = -1 gives (99, 101, 100). These are different triples unless p =0. So total number of such triples would be 201? But wait, let's count:\n\nWait, the values of p are from -100 to 100, inclusive. That's 201 values. Each p corresponds to a unique triple where c =100, a =100 +p, b=100 -p. So each p gives a distinct ordered triple. However, note that when p is positive, the triple is (100+p, 100-p, 100). When p is negative, say p = -k where k>0, then it becomes (100 -k, 100 +k, 100). These are different triples unless k=0. So indeed, all 201 values of p give distinct triples.\n\nBut wait, hold on. But in our earlier case where c was set to zero, we found triples like (200,100,0) etc. But in this scenario, when p=100, then a=200, b=0, c=100. So that's (200,0,100), which is different from (200,100,0). So these are different triples. So actually, the case where c is fixed at 100 gives different triples than when another variable is set to zero.\n\nTherefore, this case gives 201 triples where one variable is fixed at 100, and the other two variables sum to 200. Wait, but in this case, the two variables a and b must sum to 200? Wait, a + b = (100 + p) + (100 - p) = 200, yes, and c=100, so total 300.\n\nHowever, in the problem statement, the triples are ordered, so all permutations are considered different. Wait, but in this case, when we fix c as 100, we are only considering triples where the third element is 100. However, the problem allows any permutation. So actually, the above analysis gives triples where c is 100, but the 100 could be in any position. So actually, to get all such triples where one of the variables is 100 and the other two add to 200, we have to consider all three positions for the 100.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let me see:\n\nSuppose instead of fixing c = 100, we allow any of the variables to be 100. Then, for each variable (a, b, or c), we can set it to 100 and let the other two variables vary such that their sum is 200. Each such choice would give a set of triples.\n\nFor example:\n\nCase 1: a =100, then b + c =200. The number of nonnegative integer solutions is 201 (since b can be from 0 to 200, and c=200 -b). But in our previous substitution, when we fixed c=100, the other two variables were a and b, but here, if a=100, then b and c can be anything as long as they add to 200. However, in the previous analysis with substitution, we considered a and b as (100 + p, 100 - p). But actually, in that substitution, the two variables had to be symmetric around 100, but in reality, when a is fixed at 100, the other two variables can be any pair adding to 200. Wait, but in the equation, when we set a variable to 100, then the expression still holds for any b and c such that b + c =200? Wait, no, because in the previous substitution where c was fixed at 100, the expression automatically held for any p. But if we fix a different variable at 100, does the same happen?\n\nWait, let me check. Suppose we set a =100, then the variables are (100, b, c) with b + c = 200. Then, the original equation must hold. Let's see if it does.\n\nCompute the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nSubstitute a =100, and b + c = 200:\n\n= 100\u00b2 b + 100\u00b2 c + b\u00b2*100 + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2*100 + c\u00b2 b\n\n= 100\u00b2 (b + c) + 100 (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + bc(b + c)\n\nSince b + c =200,\n\n= 100\u00b2 *200 + 100(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + bc*200\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 10,000 *200 = 2,000,000,\n\nSecond term: 100*(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2),\n\nThird term: 200bc.\n\nThus total expression:\n\n2,000,000 + 100(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 200 bc\n\nHmm, but we need this to equal 6,000,000.\n\nWait, but earlier when we fixed c =100 and let a and b vary as 100 \u00b1 p, that worked, but here, if we set a =100, and let b and c be any numbers adding to 200, does that expression equal 6,000,000?\n\nWait, in the previous substitution where c was fixed at 100, and a and b were 100 + p and 100 -p, then when substituting into the expression, it always gave 6,000,000. But here, if we set a=100, but let b and c be anything adding to 200, then the expression may not always equal 6,000,000. Wait, so there's a discrepancy here. What's the problem?\n\nAh, because in the substitution where c was fixed at 100, we had the variables a and b set to 100 + p and 100 - p, so they were symmetric around 100, but if we just set a =100 and let b and c be arbitrary adding to 200, then that's a different scenario. Wait, but in the substitution, we had the condition that p + q + r =0, so if we set c=100 (r=0), then p + q =0, so q = -p, so that's why a and b are symmetric. But if we instead set a=100 (so p=0?), then variables would be different?\n\nWait, perhaps my substitution was specific to having one variable fixed at 100 and the other two symmetric around 100. Wait, maybe I made an error in assuming that all triples where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 would satisfy the equation, but actually only those where the other two are symmetric around 100 do?\n\nWait, let me test with an example. Suppose a =100, b = 200, c =0. Then compute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 100\u00b2*200 + 100\u00b2*0 + 200\u00b2*100 + 200\u00b2*0 + 0\u00b2*100 + 0\u00b2*200\n\n= 2,000,000 + 0 + 4,000,000 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6,000,000. Oh, that works!\n\nWait another example: a =100, b = 0, c =200. Then the expression is same as above, 6,000,000.\n\nWait another example: a=100, b=100, c=100. Then it's 6*100^3 = 6,000,000. That works.\n\nWait another example: a=100, b=50, c=150.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\n100\u00b2*50 +100\u00b2*150 +50\u00b2*100 +50\u00b2*150 +150\u00b2*100 +150\u00b2*50\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n100\u00b2*50 = 10,000 *50 = 500,000,\n\n100\u00b2*150 = 10,000 *150 = 1,500,000,\n\n50\u00b2*100 = 2,500 *100 = 250,000,\n\n50\u00b2*150 = 2,500 *150 = 375,000,\n\n150\u00b2*100 = 22,500 *100 = 2,250,000,\n\n150\u00b2*50 =22,500 *50 =1,125,000.\n\nAdding all together:\n\n500,000 + 1,500,000 = 2,000,000,\n\n+250,000 = 2,250,000,\n\n+375,000 = 2,625,000,\n\n+2,250,000 = 4,875,000,\n\n+1,125,000 = 6,000,000.\n\nOh! It still adds up. Wait, so even when variables aren't symmetric around 100, as long as one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200, the expression equals 6,000,000?\n\nWait, so this suggests that if one variable is 100, and the other two add to 200, then the expression equals 6,000,000 regardless of their values?\n\nBut let's try another example where one variable is 100, and others add to 200 but are not symmetric. Let's say a=100, b=1, c=199.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\n100\u00b2*1 + 100\u00b2*199 + 1\u00b2*100 +1\u00b2*199 +199\u00b2*100 +199\u00b2*1\n\nFirst terms:\n\n100\u00b2*1 = 10,000,\n\n100\u00b2*199 = 10,000*199 = 1,990,000,\n\n1\u00b2*100 = 100,\n\n1\u00b2*199 =199,\n\n199\u00b2*100 = (39,601)*100 = 3,960,100,\n\n199\u00b2*1 = 39,601*1 =39,601.\n\nAdding all together:\n\n10,000 + 1,990,000 = 2,000,000,\n\n+100 = 2,000,100,\n\n+199 = 2,000,300,\n\n+3,960,100 = 5,960,400,\n\n+39,601 = 6,000,001.\n\nWait, that's 6,000,001, which is one more than needed. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, did I compute that correctly?\n\nWait let me recalculate:\n\n199 squared is (200 -1)^2 = 40,000 -400 +1= 39,601. That's correct.\n\n199\u00b2 *100 = 39,601 *100 =3,960,100,\n\n199\u00b2 *1 =39,601*1=39,601,\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\n10,000 (first term)\n\n+1,990,000 (second term) = total 2,000,000\n\n+100 (third term) \u2192 2,000,100\n\n+199 (fourth term) \u2192 2,000,300-?\n\nWait, 2,000,100 +199 = 2,000,299?\n\nWait, perhaps my arithmetic is off:\n\nWait first four terms:\n\n10,000 +1,990,000 = 2,000,000,\n\nthen +100 gives 2,000,100,\n\nthen +199 gives 2,000,299,\n\nthen adding 3,960,100: 2,000,299 +3,960,100 = 5,960,399,\n\nthen +39,601 gives 5,960,399 +39,601 = 6,000,000.\n\nAh! I must have added wrong before. So it does work. Hmm, so that example actually does work. Let me check again:\n\nWait:\n\nFirst four terms: 10,000 + 1,990,000 + 100 + 199 = 10,000+1,990,000 is 2,000,000, plus 100+199 is 299 \u2192 total 2,000,299.\n\nAdding 3,960,100 gives 2,000,299 + 3,960,100 = 5,960,399.\n\nThen adding 39,601 gives 5,960,399 +39,601 = 6,000,000. Perfect, so that works.\n\nWait another test case: a=100, b=2, c=198.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\n100\u00b2*2 +100\u00b2*198 +2\u00b2*100 +2\u00b2*198 +198\u00b2*100 +198\u00b2*2\n\nFirst terms:\n\n100\u00b2*2 = 20,000,\n\n100\u00b2*198 = 19,800,000,\n\n2\u00b2*100 =4*100=400,\n\n2\u00b2*198=4*198=792,\n\n198\u00b2*100 = (39,204)*100=3,920,400,\n\n198\u00b2*2 =39,204*2=78,408.\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n20,000 +19,800,000 =19,820,000,\n\n+400 \u2192 19,820,400,\n\n+792 \u219219,821,192,\n\n+3,920,400 \u219223,741,592,\n\n+78,408 \u219223,820,000.\n\nWait, 23,820,000? But that's way over 6,000,000. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, hold on, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, 100 squared is 10,000. So 10,000*2 is 20,000,\n\n10,000*198 =1,980,000,\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the second term. 100\u00b2*198 is 10,000 *198 =1,980,000, not 19.8 million. My mistake!\n\nSo correct terms:\n\nFirst term: 20,000,\n\nSecond term:1,980,000,\n\nThird term:400,\n\nFourth term:792,\n\nFifth term:198\u00b2*100,\n\n198 squared is (200 -2)^2 = 40,000 -800 +4 = 39,204,\n\nso 39,204 *100 =3,920,400,\n\nSixth term:39,204 *2 =78,408.\n\nNow adding all terms:\n\n20,000 +1,980,000 =2,000,000,\n\n+400 \u21922,000,400,\n\n+792 \u21922,001,192,\n\n+3,920,400 \u21925,921,592,\n\n+78,408 \u21925,921,592 +78,408 =6,000,000.\n\nAh! There we go. So it does work. Therefore, my initial mistake was miscalculating 100\u00b2*198 as 19.8 million instead of 1.98 million. So it does work. Therefore, indeed, whenever one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200, the equation holds.\n\nTherefore, this gives a lot of solutions. Specifically, for each variable (a, b, c), setting that variable to 100 and the other two variables to any pair adding to 200 gives valid triples. Since the variables are ordered, each such choice is unique.\n\nSo for each of the three variables (a, b, or c), we can set that variable to 100, and the other two variables can be any non-negative integers adding to 200. The number of solutions for each variable is 201 (since if we set variable X to 100, the other two variables Y and Z can be from 0 to 200, with Y + Z =200, so 201 solutions). However, we have to be careful not to double-count cases where two variables are 100. For instance, the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times (once in each variable's count). Similarly, triples where two variables are 100 and the third is 100 are the same as the all-100 case.\n\nTherefore, let's compute the total number:\n\nFor each of the three variables, the number of triples where that variable is fixed at 100 is 201. However, when two variables are fixed at 100, those cases are counted in two of the counts, and the case where all three are 100 is counted three times.\n\nFirst, compute total without considering overlaps: 3 * 201 = 603.\n\nNow subtract overlaps:\n\nThe number of triples where two variables are 100. For example, a=100 and b=100, then c=100. Similarly for other pairs. Each pair (there are C(3,2)=3 pairs) gives exactly one triple where the third variable is also 100. So there are 3 triples where two variables are 100 (but actually, all three are 100, so it's just the one triple (100,100,100)). Wait, actually, if two variables are set to 100, then the third must also be 100 since their sum must be 300. Because if a=100, b=100, then c=100. So actually, there's only one triple where all three are 100. So the overlap when considering two variables fixed at 100 is actually the same as the triple (100,100,100). So the overlaps are as follows:\n\nEach pair of variables being set to 100 only allows the triple where all three are 100. So how many times is the triple (100,100,100) counted in the initial 3*201? It is counted three times (once in each variable's count). So to compute the correct total:\n\nTotal = (3 * 201) - (3 * 1) + 1. Wait, inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nThe formula for three sets is |A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nHere, each set A is the set of triples with a=100, B with b=100, C with c=100.\n\nWe want |A \u222a B \u222a C|.\n\nSo:\n\n|A| = |B| = |C| =201,\n\n|A\u2229B| = triples with a=100 and b=100 \u2192 then c=100, so only 1 triple,\n\nSimilarly |A\u2229C|=1, |B\u2229C|=1,\n\n|A\u2229B\u2229C|=1.\n\nTherefore,\n\nTotal triples = 3*201 - 3*1 + 1 = 603 -3 +1 = 601.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n3*201 = 603,\n\nSubtract 3 (for the overlaps between pairs),\n\nAdd back 1 (for the triple overlap).\n\nSo total is 603 -3 +1 = 601.\n\nBut let me verify this with another approach. The total number of triples where at least one variable is 100 is:\n\nFor each variable, the number of triples with that variable as 100 is 201, but subtract overlaps. Alternatively:\n\nNumber of triples with a=100:201,\n\nplus triples with b=100 but a\u2260100:201 -1 (excluding the case where a=100),\n\nplus triples with c=100 but a\u2260100 and b\u2260100:201 -1 -1 (excluding cases where a or b are 100),\n\nWait that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the inclusion-exclusion gives 601 as above.\n\nHowever, the all-100 triple is included in all three counts, so the inclusion-exclusion accounts for that.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples where at least one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 is 601.\n\nHowever, but earlier we also found solutions where one variable is 0 and the other two are 200 and 100. Wait, but those are included in this count?\n\nWait, for example, the triple (200,100,0):\n\nHere, c=0, so it is not included in the count where one variable is 100. Wait a second. Wait, in the count above, we considered triples where one variable is exactly 100, so if a variable is 0, it's not part of those counts. Therefore, the triples with a zero are separate?\n\nWait, so actually, the triples where one variable is 0 and the other two are 200 and 100 are different from the triples where one variable is 100 and the others sum to 200. So we need to consider them separately.\n\nWait, but in the case where one variable is 0, like (200, 100, 0), does that satisfy the equation?\n\nYes, as we saw earlier, when we set c=0, then a and b must be 200 and 100, so that gives 6 triples (permuting the zero).\n\nSo these are separate from the triples where one variable is 100. Therefore, the total solutions are the 601 (from the triples with a 100) plus the 6 (with a zero), plus the case where all are 100 (already counted in both? Wait no, all 100 is included in the 601 count, so adding the 6 gives total 607?\n\nWait, need to check:\n\nWait, the triples with a zero: (0,200,100), etc., have none of the variables equal to 100 except possibly one (if one variable is 100 and another is 200 and third is 0). Wait, for example, in (200,100,0), the variable 100 is present, so actually, this triple is already counted in the 601 count?\n\nWait, hold on! Let me check the triple (200,100,0):\n\nHere, the variable b is 100 (if we consider the second element as b). So in this case, the second variable is 100, and the other two variables (a=200 and c=0) add to 200. So this triple is included in the count where b=100. Therefore, actually, the triples with a zero are already included in the 601 count. Wait, but when we considered triples where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200, that includes cases where one of those two variables is zero. For example, in the case where a=100, b=200, c=0 is allowed because b + c =200. So that triple is included in the a=100 count. Similarly, (200,100,0) is included in the b=100 count, etc. Therefore, the 6 triples with a zero are already part of the 601 count. Therefore, we don't need to add them separately. So the total number of triples where at least one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 is 601, which includes all the cases where variables are 0, 100, 200 etc.\n\nWait but let me check if there are any other solutions outside of this?\n\nEarlier, when I considered two variables equal, we only found the all 100s solution, but actually, in the case where variables are set to 100 and others vary, there are more solutions. So perhaps all solutions are included in this 601?\n\nWait, but let me think of another case where none of the variables is 100 or 0. For example, suppose a=150, b=150, c=0. But c=0 here, so that's included in the previous counts. Wait, but if all variables are non-zero and non-100, can there be a solution?\n\nSuppose a=150, b=150, c=0. Then it's already considered. Let me try another example, like a=130, b=170, c=0. Then, this would be part of the case where one variable is 0 and the other two sum to 300, but wait no, in this case, a + b = 300? No, a + b + c =300, so if c=0, then a + b=300. Wait, but in our previous case with zero, we had a + b =200? Wait, no, when we set c=0, then a + b = 300. Wait, but in the previous analysis when we set c=0, the equation led us to ab =20,000. Wait, hold on, let me re-examine that.\n\nWait earlier, when we set c=0, then the equations became a + b = 300,\n\nand the second equation became ab*300 =6,000,000 \u2192 ab=20,000.\n\nSo in that case, a and b must multiply to 20,000 and add to 300.\n\nWait, but 200 and 100 multiply to 20,000 and add to 300. So that's the only solution? Wait, let's see:\n\nThe quadratic equation for a and b is x^2 -300x +20,000=0,\n\nWait discriminant is 300\u00b2 -80,000 =90,000 -80,000=10,000,\n\nsqrt(10,000)=100,\n\nso roots are [300 \u00b1100]/2 \u2192 200 and 100. Therefore, the only solutions when c=0 are (200,100,0) and permutations. So those are the only triples where one variable is zero. Thus, those are already included in the 601 count because in those triples, one of the other variables is 100.\n\nWait, in the triple (200, 100, 0), the 100 is present, so it is counted in the set where the middle variable is 100 (if ordered as (200,100,0)), so it is included in the count where one variable is 100.\n\nTherefore, all solutions are captured in the 601 count. Additionally, are there any other solutions outside of this?\n\nSuppose we have a triple where none of the variables is 100 or 0. Let me try to see if that's possible.\n\nSuppose a=150, b=150, c=0. But c=0, so that's already considered.\n\nAnother example: a=130, b=120, c=50. Let me check if this satisfies the equations.\n\nFirst, a + b + c =130 +120 +50 = 300. Good.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n130\u00b2*120 = (16,900)*120 = 2,028,000,\n\n130\u00b2*50 =16,900*50 =845,000,\n\n120\u00b2*130 =14,400*130= 1,872,000,\n\n120\u00b2*50 =14,400*50=720,000,\n\n50\u00b2*130=2,500*130=325,000,\n\n50\u00b2*120=2,500*120=300,000.\n\nAdding them all up:\n\n2,028,000 +845,000 =2,873,000,\n\n+1,872,000 \u21924,745,000,\n\n+720,000 \u21925,465,000,\n\n+325,000 \u21925,790,000,\n\n+300,000 \u21926,090,000.\n\nThat's 6,090,000 which is more than 6,000,000. So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother test: a=150, b=150, c=0. As before:\n\na\u00b2b + ... etc.\n\nBut let's compute:\n\n150\u00b2*150 +150\u00b2*0 +150\u00b2*150 +150\u00b2*0 +0\u00b2*150 +0\u00b2*150\n\n=2*(150^3) +0 + ... = 2*(3,375,000) =6,750,000 which is way over.\n\nHmm. Another test case where variables are not 100 or 0 but maybe symmetric?\n\nSuppose a=120, b=120, c=60. Sum is 300.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\n120\u00b2*120 +120\u00b2*60 +120\u00b2*120 +120\u00b2*60 +60\u00b2*120 +60\u00b2*120.\n\nWait, this is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should consider that all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100 or one variable equal to 0?\n\nWait, but when we set one variable to 100, the other two can be anything adding to 200, so that gives all the solutions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no solutions outside of the triples where at least one variable is 100 or 0?\n\nWait, but in the substitution earlier, when we set a variable to 100, we found that any pair adding to 200 works, so that's a huge number of solutions. But the problem asks for the number of triples of nonnegative integers. So according to this, the total is 601. But in the earlier analysis when we considered two variables equal, we only found the all-100 case, and when we considered a zero, we found 6 triples which are included in the 601.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for all triples (a,b,c) where a + b + c =300 and the expression equals 6,000,000. According to our analysis, all such triples are those where at least one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200, which gives 601 solutions. However, let me confirm with another approach.\n\nLet me consider that the equation reduces to 100Q - P =2,000,000,\n\nand since a + b + c =300,\n\nWe can think of Q and P in terms of variables.\n\nBut if we have one variable fixed at 100, then as we saw, the equation holds regardless of the other two variables (as long as they add to 200). So that's a valid condition.\n\nTherefore, the only solutions are those triples where one of the variables is 100, and the other two add to 200. Thus, the total number is 601 as per inclusion-exclusion.\n\nWait but let me check with the case where two variables are 100. For example, a=100, b=100, c=100. This is counted three times in the initial count (once for each variable being 100). In inclusion-exclusion, we subtract the overlaps where two variables are 100, but since setting two variables to 100 forces the third to also be 100, the overlaps are exactly the single triple where all are 100. Therefore, the inclusion-exclusion formula correctly accounts for it.\n\nTherefore, the total number is 601.\n\nWait but hold on! Wait in my substitution approach earlier, when we set variables as a =100 + p, etc., we found that when r =0 (i.e., c=100), then any p gives a solution. But when we considered the case where two variables are equal (a = b), we only found the solution where all are 100. But in reality, when two variables are equal but not 100, like a = b = 150, then c =0, which is part of the other solutions. So those are included in the count where c=0 (but c=0 is allowed as long as one of the other variables is 100? Wait no, in this case, a and b are 150 each, so neither is 100, but c=0. Wait, but in this case, a + b = 300, but the equation requires ab*300 =6,000,000 \u2192 ab =20,000. If a = b =150, then ab=22,500 which is not 20,000. Hence, this is not a solution. The only solutions when one variable is 0 are those where the other two are 200 and 100, which do include a 100. So, in that case, yes, all solutions where one variable is 0 have another variable at 100.\n\nTherefore, all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100, so the count of 601 is correct?\n\nWait, but let me see the case when two variables are 100 and the third is 100. That's the all-100 case, which is included. The case when one variable is 100, another is 200, and third is 0 is included. The case when one variable is 100 and the other two are 50 and 150 is included. So all possibilities where one variable is 100 are valid, and there are no other solutions. Hence, the total number is indeed 601.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me verify with another method.\n\nLet me consider variables where one variable is 100. Let's say a=100, so then b + c =200. The number of non-negative integer solutions to b + c =200 is 201 (from b=0 to 200). Similarly for b=100 and c=100. So 3*201. But when a=100 and b=100, c must be 100, so this case is counted three times in the 3*201. Therefore, to get the correct total, subtract the duplicates.\n\nTotal triples with at least one 100 = (3*201) - (3*1) +1 = 603 -3 +1=601. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601? But wait, the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so that includes zero. But let me check if there are any constraints I missed.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the triples are ordered. So all permutations are considered distinct. For example, (100, 200, 0) and (200, 100, 0) are different triples and both are counted.\n\nTherefore, the count of 601 is correct?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's see:\n\nEach of the three variables can be the one fixed at 100. For each such variable, the other two variables can be any pair (x, 200 -x) where x ranges from 0 to 200. Each such pair gives a distinct ordered triple only if we consider the positions. Wait, actually, for each variable set to 100, the other two variables can be arranged in any order. For example, if we fix a=100, then (b,c) can be (0,200), (1,199), ..., (200,0), which are 201 ordered pairs. Therefore, for each variable fixed at 100, there are 201 ordered triples. Since there are three variables, that's 3*201=603. However, the case where all three are 100 is counted three times (once for each variable being fixed at 100). So we need to subtract the duplicates. The all-100 triple is counted three times, so we subtract 2 to get it down to one. The other overlaps are when two variables are fixed at 100, which forces the third to also be 100, so those overlaps are already accounted for in the all-100 case. So total is 603 - 2*1 (since we subtract the overcounts for the all-100 case). Wait, maybe my inclusion-exclusion was wrong earlier?\n\nWait, inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - AB - AC - BC + ABC,\n\nwhere A, B, C are the sets where a=100, b=100, c=100 respectively.\n\nEach of A, B, C has 201 elements.\n\nThe intersections AB, AC, BC each consist of the single triple where all three are 100.\n\nTherefore,\n\nTotal = 201 + 201 + 201 -1 -1 -1 +1 = 603 -3 +1 =601.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is 601.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered the case where a variable is set to zero, I found 6 triples, but they are already included in the 601 count. For example, (200,100,0) is part of the set where b=100 (if the middle variable is considered as b), so it's counted in the 201 for b=100.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 601?\n\nWait, but let me check for another possible case. Suppose all three variables are different and none is 100. For example, a=150, b=50, c=100. Wait, but in this case, c=100, so it's included in the count. So if all variables are different but one is 100, it's still counted. So there are no solutions outside the 601.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601. But let me cross-verify with small cases.\n\nWait, for example, let me take a smaller version of the problem where a + b + c = 6, and the expression equals some value. Maybe that can help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the inclusion-exclusion?\n\nWait, another way to compute it is:\n\nThe number of triples where a=100 is 201 (since b + c =200 has 201 solutions).\n\nSimilarly for b=100 and c=100.\n\nBut when you add them up, you get 3*201 =603.\n\nHowever, the cases where two variables are 100 are counted twice each. For example, the triple (100,100,100) is in all three sets, so it's counted three times. The triples where two variables are 100 and the third is not (but actually, in this problem, if two variables are 100, the third must be 100 as well because 100+100 +c=300 \u2192 c=100). Therefore, the only overlap is the triple (100,100,100), which is counted three times. So to correct the count:\n\nTotal = 3*201 - 2*(overcounts). Since the overcounts for the all-100 case is 2 (since we want to count it once, but it's counted three times, so subtract 2).\n\nThus, 603 - 2 = 601. Same as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601.\n\nWait but the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so zero is allowed, and all cases are considered.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When we fix a variable to 100, say a=100, then b and c can be any pair adding to 200, including cases where b or c is 100. For example, if a=100 and b=100, then c=100. So in the count for a=100, the triple (100,100,100) is included, similarly for the counts for b=100 and c=100. So the overlaps between the sets are only the all-100 triple. There are no triples where two variables are 100 and the third isn't, since that would require the third to also be 100. Therefore, inclusion-exclusion holds as above.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is 601.\n\nHowever, the problem might have a different answer, so I need to ensure I didn't make a miscalculation.\n\nWait, but let me think again of the initial substitution where we set a =100 +p, b =100 -p, c =100. That gives 201 solutions where c is fixed at 100. But in reality, for each variable being the one fixed at 100, you have 201 solutions. So total is 3*201 =603, but subtract duplicates.\n\nBut in this case, the duplicate is only the all-100 case counted thrice. So total is 603 - 2*(1) =601.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 601.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the equation is a\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b =6,000,000. When all variables are 100, this gives 6*(100)^3 =6,000,000. Correct.\n\nWhen one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200, say a=100, b=x, c=200 -x, then the expression evaluates to 6,000,000 as shown in previous examples. So all those cases work. Therefore, all 601 cases are valid. Hence, the answer is 601.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first considered the case with a zero, I thought there were 6 solutions, but they are included in the 601.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 601.\n\nBut wait, let me check the case where two variables are 100 and the third is 100. It is counted once, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"triples of nonnegative integers\". So, for example, the triple (100, 0, 200) is allowed and is counted in the 601.\n\nYes, so I think the answer is 601. But let me see if that's an integer, which it is. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me see: When we fix a variable to 100, there are 201 ordered triples for each variable. So for a=100, the triples are (100, b, c) where b + c =200, and b and c can be anything, so ordered pairs (b, c) from (0,200) to (200,0), which is 201. Similarly for b=100 and c=100. So total 3\u00d7201=603. Subtract the duplicates. The only duplicate is the triple (100,100,100), which is counted three times. So subtract 2 duplicates, giving 601.\n\nYes, so the final answer is 601. Therefore, I think that is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{601}\n\n\nGiven the problem of finding the number of triples of nonnegative integers \\((a, b, c)\\) satisfying \\(a + b + c = 300\\) and \\(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\\), we start by analyzing the given equations.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the second equation using symmetric properties:\n\\[\na^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(a + b + c = 300\\), we get:\n\\[\n300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\\]\nDividing by 3, we simplify to:\n\\[\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the case where one of the variables is fixed at 100. Suppose \\(a = 100\\), then \\(b + c = 200\\). The equation holds for any nonnegative integers \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) such that \\(b + c = 200\\). This gives 201 solutions (from \\(b = 0\\) to \\(b = 200\\)). Similarly, fixing \\(b = 100\\) or \\(c = 100\\) each gives 201 solutions. \n\nHowever, we must account for overcounting. The triple \\((100, 100, 100)\\) is counted three times (once for each variable being 100). Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n- Total solutions: \\(3 \\times 201 = 603\\)\n- Subtract overcounts for the triple \\((100, 100, 100)\\) counted three times: \\(603 - 2 = 601\\)\n\nThus, the number of valid triples is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{601}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance. Let me see how I can approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with equations involving sums and products of variables, sometimes it's helpful to use symmetric properties or substitutions. Since the problem involves three variables a, b, and c, and both equations are symmetric in them, maybe there's a way to simplify the problem by considering some symmetry.\n\nThe first equation is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. The second equation is the sum of terms like a\u00b2b, a\u00b2c, etc. Let me write that down again to see if I can factor it or find a pattern:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nHmm, each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me try to group terms:\n\nLooking at the terms, each pair like a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c can be factored as a\u00b2(b + c). Similarly, the other terms would be b\u00b2(a + c) and c\u00b2(a + b). So the entire expression becomes:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b).\n\nThat's a bit simpler. Let me write that as:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b).\n\nNow, since we know that a + b + c = 300, maybe we can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), and similarly for the other terms. Let's try that substitution.\n\nSo substituting:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c).\n\nTherefore, the second equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, and maybe consider each term individually. Let me see if I can find a relationship here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to express the original second equation. Let me recall that sometimes expressions like a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ... can be related to (a + b + c)^3 or similar expansions. Let me think about expanding (a + b + c)^3 and see if that can help.\n\nThe expansion of (a + b + c)^3 is a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3(a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) + 6abc. \n\nSo, if I rearrange this, the term 3(a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) is part of the expansion. Let me write that:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3(a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) + 6abc.\n\nGiven that a + b + c = 300, so (300)^3 = 27,000,000. Let me denote the second equation as:\n\nLet me call the second equation's left-hand side as T = a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000.\n\nSo from the expansion above, we have:\n\n300^3 = a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3*T + 6abc.\n\nPlugging in T = 6,000,000:\n\n27,000,000 = (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) + 3*(6,000,000) + 6abc.\n\nCalculating 3*6,000,000 = 18,000,000.\n\nTherefore,\n\n27,000,000 = (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) + 18,000,000 + 6abc.\n\nSubtracting 18,000,000 from both sides:\n\n9,000,000 = a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 6abc.\n\nHmm, so now we have another equation: a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 6abc = 9,000,000.\n\nI wonder if this can be simplified further. Let me recall some algebraic identities. There's an identity that relates a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - ab - bc - ca). But here, we have a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 6abc. Hmm, that might not directly apply. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 in terms of (a + b + c)^3 and other terms. Let me see:\n\nWe know that a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b)(a + c)(b + c) ?\n\nWait, actually, let me recall the standard expansion:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - ab - bc - ca). \n\nSo rearranged, that gives:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 3abc + (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - ab - bc - ca).\n\nHmm, maybe this can be helpful. Let me plug this into the equation we had earlier:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 6abc = 9,000,000\n\nSubstituting the identity:\n\n[3abc + (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - ab - bc - ca)] + 6abc = 9,000,000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3abc + 6abc = 9abc, so:\n\n9abc + (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - ab - bc - ca) = 9,000,000\n\nHmm, this might not be the most straightforward path. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider variables in terms of two variables since a + b + c = 300. Let me set variables such that, say, c = 300 - a - b, then express everything in terms of a and b. But that might get messy because of the second equation. Let me see if that's feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to assume symmetry here. Since the equations are symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps the solutions are symmetric as well. Maybe two variables are equal, or all three are equal? Let me check that.\n\nSuppose all three variables are equal. Then a = b = c. Since a + b + c = 300, each would be 100. Let's see if that satisfies the second equation.\n\nPlugging into T = a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nIf a = b = c = 100, then each term is (100)^2 * 100 = 100^3. There are six terms, so total is 6*100^3 = 6,000,000. Hey, that's exactly the value given in the problem! So (100, 100, 100) is a solution. So that's one solution.\n\nBut the problem asks for the number of triples, so there might be more solutions where variables are not all equal. Maybe two variables are equal and the third is different? Let's check that case.\n\nSuppose two variables are equal, say a = b, and c is different. Let me denote a = b = x, and c = 300 - 2x.\n\nThen, we can plug into the second equation T = 6,000,000.\n\nFirst, compute T:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nSince a = b = x and c = 300 - 2x:\n\nEach of the terms a\u00b2b and b\u00b2a would be x\u00b2*x = x\u00b3. There are two such terms: a\u00b2b and b\u00b2a, so total 2x\u00b3.\n\nThen, the terms a\u00b2c and b\u00b2c are each x\u00b2*(300 - 2x). There are two terms, so 2x\u00b2*(300 - 2x).\n\nSimilarly, the terms c\u00b2a and c\u00b2b are each (300 - 2x)^2 *x. Again two terms, so 2x*(300 - 2x)^2.\n\nTherefore, total T is:\n\n2x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2(300 - 2x) + 2x(300 - 2x)^2.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, expand each part:\n\nFirst term: 2x\u00b3.\n\nSecond term: 2x\u00b2*(300 - 2x) = 2x\u00b2*300 - 4x\u00b3 = 600x\u00b2 - 4x\u00b3.\n\nThird term: 2x*(300 - 2x)^2. Let me expand (300 - 2x)^2 first:\n\n(300 - 2x)^2 = 300\u00b2 - 2*300*2x + (2x)^2 = 90,000 - 1200x + 4x\u00b2.\n\nMultiply by 2x:\n\n2x*(90,000 - 1200x + 4x\u00b2) = 180,000x - 2400x\u00b2 + 8x\u00b3.\n\nNow, adding all three terms together:\n\nFirst term: 2x\u00b3.\n\nSecond term: 600x\u00b2 - 4x\u00b3.\n\nThird term: 180,000x - 2400x\u00b2 + 8x\u00b3.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nFor x\u00b3: 2x\u00b3 -4x\u00b3 +8x\u00b3 = 6x\u00b3.\n\nFor x\u00b2: 600x\u00b2 -2400x\u00b2 = -1800x\u00b2.\n\nFor x terms: 180,000x.\n\nSo overall, T = 6x\u00b3 -1800x\u00b2 + 180,000x.\n\nSet this equal to 6,000,000:\n\n6x\u00b3 -1800x\u00b2 + 180,000x = 6,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + 30,000x = 1,000,000.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + 30,000x - 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Maybe we can factor it or find integer roots.\n\nPossible rational roots would be factors of 1,000,000 divided by 1, so possible integer roots could be divisors of 1,000,000. Let's try x=100 first, since we already know (100,100,100) is a solution. Let's plug in x=100:\n\n100\u00b3 - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*(100) -1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 -1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 -1,000,000 = 0. Yes, so x=100 is a root. Therefore, (x - 100) is a factor.\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or factor it out. Let me write the cubic as:\n\n(x - 100)(x\u00b2 + bx + c) = x\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + 30,000x -1,000,000.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nx\u00b3 + (b -100)x\u00b2 + (c -100b)x -100c.\n\nSet coefficients equal:\n\nCoefficient of x\u00b3: 1, which matches.\n\nCoefficient of x\u00b2: (b -100) must equal -300 \u21d2 b -100 = -300 \u21d2 b = -200.\n\nCoefficient of x: (c -100b) must equal 30,000.\n\nPlugging b = -200:\n\nc -100*(-200) = c + 20,000 = 30,000 \u21d2 c = 10,000.\n\nConstant term: -100c must equal -1,000,000 \u21d2 -100c = -1,000,000 \u21d2 c =10,000. Which matches.\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as:\n\n(x - 100)(x\u00b2 - 200x + 10,000) = 0.\n\nNow, set the quadratic factor to zero:\n\nx\u00b2 -200x +10,000 =0.\n\nLet me solve this quadratic equation. The discriminant is (200)^2 -4*1*10,000 = 40,000 -40,000 =0. So discriminant is zero, so there's a double root at x = [200]/2 = 100. Wait, so actually, the quadratic factors as (x -100)^2. Therefore, the cubic is (x -100)^3 =0. Wait, hold on:\n\nWait, if the quadratic is x\u00b2 -200x +10,000, then discriminant is 200\u00b2 - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 -40,000=0. So the root is x=(200)/2=100. So quadratic is (x -100)^2. Therefore, the cubic is (x -100)^3=0. Wait, but let's check:\n\n(x -100)^3 = x\u00b3 -300x\u00b2 +30,000x -1,000,000. Yes, exactly matches. So the equation has a triple root at x=100. So the only solution here is x=100, so c = 300 -2x = 300 -200=100. So that brings us back to the case where all three variables are 100. So in this case, when we assumed two variables are equal, the only solution is when all three are equal. So that gives us only one solution here.\n\nHmm, so maybe the only solution where two variables are equal is the same as the all-equal case. So perhaps there are solutions where variables are not equal? Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are solutions where one variable is zero? Let me try that.\n\nSuppose c=0. Then the equations become a + b = 300, and the second equation becomes a\u00b2b + a\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2*0 + 0\u00b2a +0\u00b2b = a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 = ab(a + b).\n\nSince a + b = 300, so substituting, the second equation becomes ab*300 = 6,000,000 \u21d2 ab = 6,000,000 / 300 = 20,000.\n\nSo we need to find nonnegative integers a and b such that a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.\n\nLet me see if such a and b exist.\n\nLet me set a and b as roots of the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -300x +20,000 =0.\n\nCompute discriminant: 300\u00b2 -4*1*20,000 =90,000 -80,000 =10,000.\n\nSquare root of discriminant is 100. Therefore, roots are [300 \u00b1100]/2 = (400)/2=200 or (200)/2=100.\n\nSo a and b would be 200 and 100. So (a,b,c) could be (200,100,0), (100,200,0), (200,0,100), (100,0,200), (0,200,100), (0,100,200). Wait, but since c was set to zero, so actually, the solutions when c=0 are (200,100,0), (100,200,0). Similarly, if we set a=0 or b=0, we can have other permutations.\n\nWait, let me confirm. If c=0, then the solutions for a and b are 200 and 100. So the triples would be permutations where two variables are 200 and 100, and the third is 0. But actually, since c is fixed at 0, the triples would be (200,100,0), (100,200,0). Similarly, if a=0, then we have (0, 200,100) and (0,100,200). Similarly for b=0: (200,0,100) and (100,0,200). So total of 6 triples where one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100.\n\nWait, but hold on, when we set c=0, we get two solutions (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). Similarly, setting a=0 would give (0, 200,100) and (0,100,200). Setting b=0 would give (200,0,100) and (100,0,200). So total of 6 triples. Each of these would be distinct.\n\nSo that's 6 solutions where one variable is zero, and the other two are 200 and 100.\n\nTherefore, so far, we have the all-equal triple (100,100,100), and these 6 triples where one variable is 0 and the other two are 200 and 100. So total so far is 1 +6=7 solutions. But maybe there are more?\n\nWait, let me check if there are solutions where two variables are zero. Suppose two variables are zero. Let's say a=0, b=0, then c=300. Then plug into the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 0 + 0 +0 +0 +0 +0=0 \u22606,000,000. So that doesn't work. Similarly, any two variables zero would give T=0, so those are invalid. So only triples with at most one zero variable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are solutions where variables are different from 100, 200, and 0? Let's see.\n\nSuppose we have a triple where all three variables are different. Let's see if such a triple can satisfy the equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other triples where two variables are equal but not 100? Wait, earlier when we assumed two variables equal, the only solution was when all three are equal. So that suggests that there are no solutions where two variables are equal but not all three.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps variables can be arranged in another way. Let me see if there are other solutions besides the ones we found.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another case where two variables are equal but with different values. Wait, but when we considered two variables equal, the equation led us only to x=100, so perhaps that's the only case where two variables are equal. So maybe the only solutions are the all-equal case and the ones with a zero and two numbers 200 and 100. Let me check another case.\n\nSuppose, for example, that one variable is 150, another is 150, and the third is 0. Let's test that. So (150,150,0). Then, compute T:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b\n\n= (150)^2*150 + (150)^2*0 + (150)^2*150 + (150)^2*0 +0^2*150 +0^2*150\n\n= 150^3 + 150^3 = 2*(150)^3.\n\n150^3 is 3,375,000. Multiply by 2 gives 6,750,000 which is more than 6,000,000. So that's too big. Not a solution.\n\nAlternatively, let me try (150, 100, 50). Sum is 300. Let's compute T:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b =150\u00b2*100 =22,500*100=2,250,000\n\na\u00b2c=150\u00b2*50=22,500*50=1,125,000\n\nb\u00b2a=100\u00b2*150=10,000*150=1,500,000\n\nb\u00b2c=100\u00b2*50=10,000*50=500,000\n\nc\u00b2a=50\u00b2*150=2,500*150=375,000\n\nc\u00b2b=50\u00b2*100=2,500*100=250,000\n\nAdding all these:\n\n2,250,000 +1,125,000 =3,375,000\n\n+1,500,000 =4,875,000\n\n+500,000 =5,375,000\n\n+375,000 =5,750,000\n\n+250,000 =6,000,000.\n\nOh! Wait a second, that actually adds up to 6,000,000. So (150,100,50) is another solution!\n\nHmm, so that's a solution where all three variables are different. So that suggests that there are more solutions beyond the ones we considered earlier. So my previous assumption that only the symmetric case and the ones with a zero are solutions is incorrect. Hmm, so I need to think again.\n\nWait, so (150,100,50) is a solution. Let me check if permutations of this are also solutions. Since the problem counts triples (a,b,c) as distinct if the order is different, then permutations would also be solutions.\n\nSo (150,100,50), (150,50,100), (100,150,50), (100,50,150), (50,150,100), (50,100,150). That's 6 permutations. So that gives 6 more solutions.\n\nWait, so now total solutions would be 1 (all 100s) + 6 (with a zero) +6 (the 150,100,50 permutations). So total 13? Hmm, but maybe there are even more?\n\nWait, let's see another example. Let me try (200, 50, 50). Let me check that.\n\na + b +c =200+50+50=300. Good.\n\nCompute T:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b\n\n=200\u00b2*50 +200\u00b2*50 +50\u00b2*200 +50\u00b2*50 +50\u00b2*200 +50\u00b2*50.\n\nWait, let's compute term by term:\n\na\u00b2b =200\u00b2*50 =40,000*50=2,000,000\n\na\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2b because b and c are both 50, so another 2,000,000\n\nb\u00b2a =50\u00b2*200 =2,500*200=500,000\n\nb\u00b2c =50\u00b2*50=2,500*50=125,000\n\nc\u00b2a = same as b\u00b2a since c and b are same, so another 500,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as b\u00b2c, another 125,000\n\nAdding all up:\n\n2,000,000 +2,000,000 =4,000,000\n\n+500,000 =4,500,000\n\n+125,000 =4,625,000\n\n+500,000 =5,125,000\n\n+125,000 =5,250,000.\n\nThat's only 5,250,000, which is less than 6,000,000. So that's not a solution.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's see another combination. How about (120, 120, 60). Let's check:\n\nSum is 120+120+60=300.\n\nCompute T:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\na and b are 120, c is 60.\n\na\u00b2b =120\u00b2*120 =14,400*120 =1,728,000\n\na\u00b2c =120\u00b2*60=14,400*60=864,000\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2a = same as a\u00b2b:1,728,000\n\nb\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2c:864,000\n\nc\u00b2a =60\u00b2*120=3,600*120=432,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as c\u00b2a:432,000\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1,728,000 +864,000 =2,592,000\n\n+1,728,000 =4,320,000\n\n+864,000 =5,184,000\n\n+432,000 =5,616,000\n\n+432,000 =6,048,000.\n\nHmm, that's 6,048,000 which is more than 6,000,000. Close but not exact.\n\nHmm. Maybe (160, 100, 40). Let me check.\n\nSum is 160+100+40=300.\n\nCompute T:\n\na\u00b2b =160\u00b2*100 =25,600*100=2,560,000\n\na\u00b2c=160\u00b2*40=25,600*40=1,024,000\n\nb\u00b2a=100\u00b2*160=10,000*160=1,600,000\n\nb\u00b2c=100\u00b2*40=10,000*40=400,000\n\nc\u00b2a=40\u00b2*160=1,600*160=256,000\n\nc\u00b2b=40\u00b2*100=1,600*100=160,000\n\nAdding them all:\n\n2,560,000 +1,024,000=3,584,000\n\n+1,600,000=5,184,000\n\n+400,000=5,584,000\n\n+256,000=5,840,000\n\n+160,000=6,000,000.\n\nOh! That works too. So (160,100,40) is another solution. So permutations of this would also be valid. So (160,100,40), (160,40,100), (100,160,40), (100,40,160), (40,160,100), (40,100,160). That's 6 more solutions.\n\nHmm, so this is getting more complicated. It seems there are multiple solutions beyond the ones I initially considered. So maybe I need a more systematic approach here.\n\nLet me think again. Let's see, in the case where one variable is zero, we found solutions where the other two variables are 200 and 100. When all variables are equal, we have 100 each. And when variables are 150,100,50 and 160,100,40, etc. So perhaps there are multiple triples where the variables are in arithmetic progression? Let me see.\n\nWait, 150,100,50: differences are 50 each. 160,100,40: differences are 60 and 60? Wait, no. 160-100=60, 100-40=60. So that is an arithmetic progression with difference -60. Similarly, 150-100=50, 100-50=50. So arithmetic progression with difference -50. So maybe these are arithmetic sequences. Let me check another.\n\nSuppose variables are in arithmetic progression. Let me suppose that the three variables are x -d, x, x +d. Since they have to sum to 300, so (x -d) + x + (x +d) = 3x =300 \u21d2 x=100. So the variables would be 100 -d, 100, 100 +d. Then, let's compute T for these variables.\n\nCompute T = a\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nLet me denote a =100 -d, b=100, c=100 +d.\n\nThen,\n\na\u00b2b = (100 -d)^2 *100,\n\na\u00b2c = (100 -d)^2*(100 +d),\n\nb\u00b2a =100\u00b2*(100 -d),\n\nb\u00b2c =100\u00b2*(100 +d),\n\nc\u00b2a = (100 +d)^2*(100 -d),\n\nc\u00b2b = (100 +d)^2*100.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (100 -d)^2 *100.\n\nSecond term: (100 -d)^2*(100 +d).\n\nThird term: 100\u00b2*(100 -d).\n\nFourth term: 100\u00b2*(100 +d).\n\nFifth term: (100 +d)^2*(100 -d).\n\nSixth term: (100 +d)^2*100.\n\nHmm, this might be a bit tedious, but let me see if there's a pattern or simplification.\n\nAlternatively, notice that terms can be grouped:\n\nTerms 1 and 6: a\u00b2b + c\u00b2b = b(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, terms 2 and 5: a\u00b2c + c\u00b2a =ac(a + c).\n\nTerms 3 and 4: b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c =b\u00b2(a + c).\n\nSo total T = b(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + ac(a + c) + b\u00b2(a + c).\n\nHmm, let me see if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute T for arithmetic progression variables.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (100 -d)^2 *100 = (10000 -200d +d\u00b2)*100 =1,000,000 -20,000d +100d\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: (100 -d)^2*(100 +d) = (10000 -200d +d\u00b2)(100 +d).\n\nLet me expand that:\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n10000*100 =1,000,000\n\n10000*d =10,000d\n\n-200d*100 =-20,000d\n\n-200d*d =-200d\u00b2\n\nd\u00b2*100 =100d\u00b2\n\nd\u00b2*d =d\u00b3\n\nSo adding all together:\n\n1,000,000 +10,000d -20,000d -200d\u00b2 +100d\u00b2 +d\u00b3\n\nSimplify:\n\n1,000,000 -10,000d -100d\u00b2 +d\u00b3.\n\nThird term: 100\u00b2*(100 -d) =10,000*(100 -d)=1,000,000 -10,000d.\n\nFourth term:100\u00b2*(100 +d)=10,000*(100 +d)=1,000,000 +10,000d.\n\nFifth term: (100 +d)^2*(100 -d).\n\nSimilarly, expand (100 +d)^2*(100 -d):\n\nFirst compute (100 +d)^2 =10,000 +200d +d\u00b2.\n\nMultiply by (100 -d):\n\n(10,000 +200d +d\u00b2)(100 -d)\n\n=10,000*100 +10,000*(-d) +200d*100 +200d*(-d) +d\u00b2*100 +d\u00b2*(-d)\n\n=1,000,000 -10,000d +20,000d -200d\u00b2 +100d\u00b2 -d\u00b3\n\nSimplify:\n\n1,000,000 +10,000d -100d\u00b2 -d\u00b3.\n\nSixth term: (100 +d)^2*100 = (10,000 +200d +d\u00b2)*100 =1,000,000 +20,000d +100d\u00b2.\n\nNow, let me sum all six terms:\n\nFirst term: 1,000,000 -20,000d +100d\u00b2\n\nSecond term:1,000,000 -10,000d -100d\u00b2 +d\u00b3\n\nThird term:1,000,000 -10,000d\n\nFourth term:1,000,000 +10,000d\n\nFifth term:1,000,000 +10,000d -100d\u00b2 -d\u00b3\n\nSixth term:1,000,000 +20,000d +100d\u00b2.\n\nLet me write all terms:\n\n1. 1,000,000 -20,000d +100d\u00b2\n\n2. 1,000,000 -10,000d -100d\u00b2 +d\u00b3\n\n3. 1,000,000 -10,000d\n\n4. 1,000,000 +10,000d\n\n5. 1,000,000 +10,000d -100d\u00b2 -d\u00b3\n\n6. 1,000,000 +20,000d +100d\u00b2\n\nNow, let's add them term by term.\n\nFirst, the constants:\n\nEach term has 1,000,000. There are six terms, so 6,000,000.\n\nNext, terms with d:\n\nLooking at each term's d components:\n\nTerm1: -20,000d\n\nTerm2: -10,000d\n\nTerm3: -10,000d\n\nTerm4: +10,000d\n\nTerm5: +10,000d\n\nTerm6: +20,000d\n\nAdding these together:\n\n-20,000d -10,000d -10,000d +10,000d +10,000d +20,000d\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with -20,000d -10,000d = -30,000d\n\n-30,000d -10,000d = -40,000d\n\n-40,000d +10,000d = -30,000d\n\n-30,000d +10,000d = -20,000d\n\n-20,000d +20,000d = 0.\n\nSo the d terms cancel out.\n\nNow terms with d\u00b2:\n\nTerm1: +100d\u00b2\n\nTerm2: -100d\u00b2\n\nTerm3: 0\n\nTerm4:0\n\nTerm5: -100d\u00b2\n\nTerm6:+100d\u00b2\n\nAdding these:\n\n100d\u00b2 -100d\u00b2 -100d\u00b2 +100d\u00b2 = (100d\u00b2 -100d\u00b2) + (-100d\u00b2 +100d\u00b2) = 0 +0 =0.\n\nTerms with d\u00b3:\n\nTerm2: +d\u00b3\n\nTerm5: -d\u00b3\n\nSo d\u00b3 -d\u00b3 =0.\n\nThus, all terms except constants cancel out. So the total T =6,000,000 regardless of d? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, but according to this calculation, T is always 6,000,000 for any d when the variables are in arithmetic progression around 100. But when I tried with d=50 (so 150,100,50) it worked, and with d=60 (160,100,40) it also worked, but with d=0 (all 100s) it also worked. So in fact, any arithmetic progression centered at 100 with any difference d will satisfy the second equation?\n\nWait, that's surprising. Let me verify with d=0: that gives all 100s, which works. For d=50, we have 150,100,50, which worked. For d=60, 160,100,40, which worked. For d=10: 90,100,110. Let me check that.\n\nLet me test d=10. Variables would be 90,100,110. Sum is 300. Compute T:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na=90, b=100, c=110.\n\na\u00b2b = 8100*100 =810,000\n\na\u00b2c =8100*110= 891,000\n\nb\u00b2a =10,000*90=900,000\n\nb\u00b2c =10,000*110=1,100,000\n\nc\u00b2a=12,100*90=1,089,000\n\nc\u00b2b=12,100*100=1,210,000\n\nAdding all together:\n\n810,000 +891,000 =1,701,000\n\n+900,000 =2,601,000\n\n+1,100,000 =3,701,000\n\n+1,089,000 =4,790,000\n\n+1,210,000 =6,000,000. Exactly. So yes, works.\n\nTherefore, indeed, any arithmetic progression centered at 100 with difference d (so variables 100 -d, 100, 100 +d) will satisfy T =6,000,000. Therefore, this gives us infinitely many solutions in real numbers, but since we need nonnegative integers, d must be such that all variables are nonnegative integers.\n\nTherefore, the constraints are:\n\n100 -d \u22650 \u21d2 d \u2264100,\n\n100 +d \u22650 \u21d2 always true since d is nonnegative.\n\nThus, d can be any integer from 0 up to 100. However, since the variables must be nonnegative integers, d must be an integer between 0 and 100 inclusive.\n\nBut wait, actually, variables a, b, c must be nonnegative integers. Since a =100 -d, so d can be 0,1,...,100. For each integer d from 0 to 100, we have a distinct triple (100 -d,100,100 +d). However, note that when d=0, we get (100,100,100). For d from 1 to 100, each gives a unique triple, but these triples can be permuted.\n\nWait, but in the arithmetic progression case, the triple is ordered as (100 -d,100,100 +d). However, the problem counts triples (a,b,c) as different if the order is different. For example, when d=50, the triple is (50,100,150). But this can be permuted in different ways. Wait, but in the arithmetic progression setup, we have a specific ordering, but in reality, the variables can be in any order. Therefore, for each d from 1 to 100, the triple (100 -d,100,100 +d) is one specific permutation, but the actual solutions include all permutations of these three numbers.\n\nTherefore, for each d from 1 to 99, the triple (100 -d, 100, 100 +d) can be permuted in 6 ways (since all three numbers are distinct when d\u22600). However, when d=0, it's the same number in all three positions, so only 1 permutation. When d=100, the triple becomes (0,100,200). Here, two numbers are distinct (0,100,200), so permutations would be 3! /1! =6 (since all three are distinct). Wait, but 0,100,200 are all distinct. So actually, even when d=100, the numbers are distinct. Wait, when d=100, then the variables are (0,100,200). So yes, distinct. So for d=100, it's also 6 permutations.\n\nTherefore, for each d from 0 to 100:\n\n- d=0: gives (100,100,100), count as 1.\n\n- For d from 1 to 99: each gives 6 permutations.\n\n- d=100: gives (0,100,200), which also gives 6 permutations.\n\nWait, but hold on. When d=100, the triple is (0,100,200), which is the same as the case when one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100, which we had considered earlier. So actually, the arithmetic progression approach includes all those solutions where one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100. So the arithmetic progression approach actually covers all the solutions we found before, including those with a zero. So in this case, the total number of triples from arithmetic progression would be:\n\nFor d from 0 to 100 inclusive:\n\n- d=0: 1 triple.\n\n- d=1 to d=100: each gives 6 triples, so 100*6=600.\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, when d=1 and d=99, are they the same?\n\nWait, for example, d=1 gives (99,100,101), and d=99 gives (1,100,199). These are different triples. Similarly, d=2 and d=98 give different triples. So each d from 1 to 100 gives distinct triples when considering all permutations. But actually, the triples for d and 100 -d might be related? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, if you take d and 100 -d, for example, d=1 and d=99:\n\nd=1: (99,100,101)\n\nd=99: (1,100,199)\n\nThese are different triples, so they are distinct. So indeed, each d from 1 to 100 gives a unique set of numbers, and their permutations are all distinct.\n\nTherefore, total number of triples from arithmetic progression is 1 (for d=0) + 100*6 (for d=1 to d=100) =1 +600=601? Wait, but hold on, that can't be right. Wait, but actually, when d ranges from 1 to 100, each d gives a distinct unordered triple, but when considering permutations, each unordered triple corresponds to 6 ordered triples unless there are duplicates. But in our case, for d\u22600 and d\u2260100, the three numbers are distinct, so each gives 6 permutations. For d=100, the numbers are 0,100,200 which are distinct, so also 6 permutations. For d=0, all three numbers are same, so only 1 permutation.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples from the arithmetic progression approach is 1 + 100*6. Wait but d=1 to d=100 is 100 terms, each contributing 6 triples, so 100*6=600, plus the 1 gives 601. But this contradicts our earlier examples where we found (160,100,40), which would correspond to d=60, so that is included here. However, in the earlier case when I considered c=0, which gives the triple (200,100,0), which is d=100, so included here. So according to this, there are 601 solutions from the arithmetic progression approach.\n\nBut wait a second, this can't be correct because the problem is asking for nonnegative integers, and the arithmetic progression approach gives all triples where the numbers are in an arithmetic progression around 100. However, are there other triples not in arithmetic progression that satisfy the equations?\n\nEarlier, we found (150,100,50), which is in AP, yes. The (160,100,40) is also AP. The (200,100,0) is AP. The all 100s is AP. But what about the (120, 120, 60) which we tried earlier? That was not in AP, but didn't satisfy the equation. So maybe all solutions must be in AP?\n\nWait, let's suppose that any solution must be in an arithmetic progression. If that is the case, then the total number of triples would be 601. But let me check another triple not in AP.\n\nSuppose (180, 90, 30). Sum is 180+90+30=300.\n\nCompute T:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\na=180, b=90, c=30.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = 180\u00b2*90 = 32,400*90 = 2,916,000\n\na\u00b2c =180\u00b2*30 =32,400*30=972,000\n\nb\u00b2a =90\u00b2*180=8,100*180=1,458,000\n\nb\u00b2c =90\u00b2*30=8,100*30=243,000\n\nc\u00b2a =30\u00b2*180=900*180=162,000\n\nc\u00b2b =30\u00b2*90=900*90=81,000\n\nAdding all together:\n\n2,916,000 +972,000 =3,888,000\n\n+1,458,000 =5,346,000\n\n+243,000 =5,589,000\n\n+162,000 =5,751,000\n\n+81,000 =5,832,000 \u22606,000,000. So that doesn't work. So this triple isn't a solution.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there exists a solution not in AP.\n\nSuppose we take variables 140, 110, 50. Sum is 140+110+50=300.\n\nCompute T:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\n140\u00b2*110 +140\u00b2*50 +110\u00b2*140 +110\u00b2*50 +50\u00b2*140 +50\u00b2*110.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n140\u00b2 =19,600\n\n140\u00b2*110 =19,600*110=2,156,000\n\n140\u00b2*50=19,600*50=980,000\n\n110\u00b2=12,100\n\n110\u00b2*140=12,100*140=1,694,000\n\n110\u00b2*50=12,100*50=605,000\n\n50\u00b2=2,500\n\n50\u00b2*140=2,500*140=350,000\n\n50\u00b2*110=2,500*110=275,000\n\nAdding all together:\n\n2,156,000 +980,000 =3,136,000\n\n+1,694,000 =4,830,000\n\n+605,000 =5,435,000\n\n+350,000 =5,785,000\n\n+275,000 =6,060,000.\n\nThat's over by 60,000. Not a solution.\n\nHmm, so maybe all solutions are indeed in arithmetic progression. Let me think why that might be the case.\n\nEarlier, when I considered the second equation and the arithmetic progression, the T value turned out to be constant regardless of d. So that suggests that any arithmetic progression centered at 100 with difference d will satisfy T=6,000,000. Therefore, all such triples are solutions. Moreover, since the problem is symmetric, any permutation of such a triple is also a solution. Therefore, all solutions are the permutations of triples in arithmetic progression (100 -d, 100, 100 +d) for some d between 0 and 100.\n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions would be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each d from 0 to 100 inclusive:\n\n- When d=0: the triple is (100,100,100). Only 1 distinct permutation.\n\n- For d from 1 to 99: Each d gives three distinct numbers (since 100 -d, 100, 100 +d are all different). The number of permutations is 3! =6.\n\n- When d=100: The triple is (0,100,200). Again, three distinct numbers, so 6 permutations.\n\nTherefore, total number of triples is:\n\n1 (for d=0) + 99*6 (for d=1 to 99) +6 (for d=100).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1 + (99*6) +6 =1 + 594 +6 =601.\n\nWait, so 601 solutions?\n\nBut earlier, when I considered the case where one variable is zero, that was included in this count (as d=100 gives 6 permutations). The all-equal case is d=0, giving 1. The cases like (150,100,50) are included when d=50, etc.\n\nHowever, the problem states \"nonnegative integers\", so zero is allowed. Therefore, this count of 601 seems to be correct. But let me verify with another example.\n\nTake d=50: the triple is (50,100,150), which has 6 permutations. Similarly for d=60, (40,100,160) which also has 6 permutations. So each d from 1 to 100 gives 6 triples, except d=0 gives 1.\n\nWait, but 1 to 100 inclusive is 100 values. So 100*6=600, plus 1 gives 601. So that's correct.\n\nHowever, wait a second, but in the arithmetic progression approach, when we set variables as (100 -d, 100, 100 +d), these are ordered triples, but when we count permutations, we have to ensure that we are not overcounting. For example, if we have d=1 and d=99, are their permutations overlapping?\n\nWait, no. Because for d=1, the numbers are 99,100,101. For d=99, they are 1,100,199. These are different sets of numbers, so their permutations are entirely distinct. Similarly, each d gives a unique set of numbers except when d and (100 -d) might produce the same numbers? Wait, no, since the numbers are 100-d, 100, 100+d, so for different d's, the numbers are different.\n\nTherefore, indeed, each d from 0 to 100 gives unique triples when considering all permutations, so total number is 601.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c). So, if two different d's produce the same set of numbers but in different order, they would have been counted as different permutations, but since we are considering ordered triples, each permutation is counted separately. Therefore, the total is indeed 601.\n\nHowever, the problem might have constraints that I missed? Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says \"the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c)\" so ordered triples. So each permutation is a different triple. Therefore, the arithmetic progression approach gives all solutions, and the total is 601.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered the case where variables are 200,100,0, which is part of d=100, which is included in the 6 permutations. Similarly, the all-100 case is included. Therefore, this seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check when d=50, the triple is (50,100,150). The permutations of this are 6, which are all distinct triples.\n\nHowever, in my first analysis, I thought that the only solutions were the all-equal case, the ones with a zero, and the ones like 150,100,50. But according to this arithmetic progression approach, there are actually 601 solutions, which includes all of those and more.\n\nBut why didn't I get 601 when I considered specific examples? Because I only tried a few examples, but clearly there are many more.\n\nTherefore, is this the correct answer? 601?\n\nWait, but let me think again: when d ranges from 0 to 100, each d gives a unique triple up to permutation, and each of these corresponds to 6 ordered triples except when all three are equal (d=0) which gives 1, and when two variables are equal? Wait, no. Wait, in the arithmetic progression case, except when d=0, all triples have distinct elements, so their permutations are 6 each. When d=0, all three are same, so only 1. When d=100, the elements are 0,100,200 which are distinct, so 6 permutations. So total is indeed 1 + 100*6. Wait, 1 + (100)*6? Wait, no. Wait, d from 1 to 100 is 100 terms, each giving 6 permutations, so 100*6=600. Plus the 1 for d=0, total is 601.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 601?\n\nBut wait, I need to be careful here. Let me confirm with another angle.\n\nAlternatively, the equation reduces to requiring that the variables are in arithmetic progression. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that the three variables a, b, c are in arithmetic progression. Then, as we saw, the value of T is always 6,000,000. So all such triples satisfy the equation. Are there any other triples that satisfy the equation?\n\nSuppose there is a triple not in arithmetic progression that satisfies the equations. Let's assume such a triple exists. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLet me suppose variables a, b, c with a + b + c =300 and T=6,000,000, but not in AP.\n\nSuppose, for example, take a=140, b=100, c=60. Sum is 300.\n\nCompute T:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\na=140, b=100, c=60.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n140\u00b2*100 =19600*100=1,960,000\n\n140\u00b2*60=19600*60=1,176,000\n\n100\u00b2*140=10,000*140=1,400,000\n\n100\u00b2*60=10,000*60=600,000\n\n60\u00b2*140=3,600*140=504,000\n\n60\u00b2*100=3,600*100=360,000\n\nAdding all:\n\n1,960,000 +1,176,000 =3,136,000\n\n+1,400,000 =4,536,000\n\n+600,000 =5,136,000\n\n+504,000 =5,640,000\n\n+360,000 =6,000,000.\n\nWait a second! This also sums to 6,000,000. But the triple (140,100,60) is not in arithmetic progression. Let me check:\n\nThe numbers 140,100,60. Let's see if they form an AP.\n\nThe differences are 140-100=40 and 100-60=40. Wait a minute! 140, 100, 60 is an arithmetic progression with common difference -40. So it is an arithmetic progression. But arranged in order, it would be 60,100,140. So indeed, it is an arithmetic progression with d=40. Therefore, this is included in the previous count. So even though I thought it wasn't, it actually is an arithmetic progression. So my mistake was in the ordering.\n\nTherefore, any triple that satisfies the equations must be in arithmetic progression, and hence the count of 601 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ordered triples is 601. But let me confirm once more with another example.\n\nTake a=130, b=100, c=70. Sum 300.\n\nCompute T:\n\n130\u00b2*100 +130\u00b2*70 +100\u00b2*130 +100\u00b2*70 +70\u00b2*130 +70\u00b2*100.\n\n130\u00b2=16,900.\n\n16,900*100=1,690,000\n\n16,900*70=1,183,000\n\n100\u00b2=10,000.\n\n10,000*130=1,300,000\n\n10,000*70=700,000\n\n70\u00b2=4,900.\n\n4,900*130=637,000\n\n4,900*100=490,000\n\nAdding up:\n\n1,690,000 +1,183,000 =2,873,000\n\n+1,300,000 =4,173,000\n\n+700,000 =4,873,000\n\n+637,000 =5,510,000\n\n+490,000 =6,000,000. Exactly.\n\nThis triple (130,100,70) is an arithmetic progression with d=30: 100-30=70, 100, 100+30=130. So yes, included in the count.\n\nTherefore, it seems that indeed all solutions must be in arithmetic progression, so the total number of ordered triples is 601.\n\nWait, but hang on. Let me check a case where the variables are not in any order but still in AP. For example, (100, 150, 50). That's the same as (50,100,150), just reordered. So permutations are counted separately. So each unique set of three numbers in AP (with sum 300) corresponds to 6 ordered triples, except when all numbers are same (only 1 ordered triple).\n\nTherefore, the count is indeed 1 + 100*6 =601.\n\nHowever, let me check when d=100: variables (0,100,200). This is an AP with difference 100. The permutations of this are 6, which are all the triples where one is 0, one is 100, and one is 200. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, when d=50, the triple (50,100,150) has permutations like (150,50,100), etc., all of which are counted.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is 601. But the problem states \"nonnegative integers\", so zeros are allowed, so yes.\n\nWait, but let me check with d=100. The triple (0,100,200) is allowed, and that's counted as 6 permutations.\n\nHowever, when d=100, the third term is 100 +100 =200, so that's okay.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 601. But I need to make sure that there are no other solutions outside of arithmetic progression.\n\nSuppose there exists a triple (a,b,c) not in arithmetic progression that satisfies the equations. Let me try to find such a triple.\n\nSuppose a=120, b=110, c=70. Sum is 300. Let's compute T.\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n120\u00b2*110 =14,400*110=1,584,000\n\n120\u00b2*70 =14,400*70=1,008,000\n\n110\u00b2*120=12,100*120=1,452,000\n\n110\u00b2*70=12,100*70=847,000\n\n70\u00b2*120=4,900*120=588,000\n\n70\u00b2*110=4,900*110=539,000\n\nAdding all:\n\n1,584,000 +1,008,000 =2,592,000\n\n+1,452,000 =4,044,000\n\n+847,000 =4,891,000\n\n+588,000 =5,479,000\n\n+539,000 =6,018,000. That's over by 18,000. Not a solution.\n\nAnother try: (130, 120, 50). Sum is 300.\n\nCompute T:\n\n130\u00b2*120 +130\u00b2*50 +120\u00b2*130 +120\u00b2*50 +50\u00b2*130 +50\u00b2*120.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n130\u00b2=16,900\n\n16,900*120=2,028,000\n\n16,900*50=845,000\n\n120\u00b2=14,400\n\n14,400*130=1,872,000\n\n14,400*50=720,000\n\n50\u00b2=2,500\n\n2,500*130=325,000\n\n2,500*120=300,000\n\nTotal:\n\n2,028,000 +845,000 =2,873,000\n\n+1,872,000 =4,745,000\n\n+720,000 =5,465,000\n\n+325,000 =5,790,000\n\n+300,000 =6,090,000. Not 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, so no luck there.\n\nAlternatively, trying (110,110,80). Sum is 300.\n\nCompute T:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\na and b are 110, c is 80.\n\na\u00b2b =110\u00b2*110=12,100*110=1,331,000\n\na\u00b2c =110\u00b2*80=12,100*80=968,000\n\nb\u00b2a = same as a\u00b2b:1,331,000\n\nb\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2c:968,000\n\nc\u00b2a =80\u00b2*110=6,400*110=704,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as c\u00b2a:704,000\n\nTotal:\n\n1,331,000 +968,000 =2,299,000\n\n+1,331,000 =3,630,000\n\n+968,000 =4,598,000\n\n+704,000 =5,302,000\n\n+704,000 =6,006,000. Close but not exact.\n\nHmm, off by 6,000. Not quite.\n\nAlternatively, (125, 100,75). Let's see:\n\nSum is 300.\n\nCompute T:\n\na=125, b=100, c=75.\n\na\u00b2b=125\u00b2*100=15,625*100=1,562,500\n\na\u00b2c=15,625*75=1,171,875\n\nb\u00b2a=100\u00b2*125=125,000\n\nb\u00b2c=100\u00b2*75=750,000\n\nc\u00b2a=75\u00b2*125=56,25*125=7,031,25? Wait, 75\u00b2 is 5,625.\n\n5,625*125=703,125\n\nc\u00b2b=5,625*100=562,500.\n\nAdding all:\n\n1,562,500 +1,171,875 =2,734,375\n\n+125,000 =2,859,375\n\n+750,000 =3,609,375\n\n+703,125 =4,312,500\n\n+562,500 =4,875,000. Not enough.\n\nHmm. So it's difficult to find a non-AP triple that works. This suggests that all solutions are indeed in arithmetic progression.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ordered triples is 1 + 100*6 = 601. But wait, let me check again the count:\n\nWait, when d=0, there is 1 triple.\n\nFor d from 1 to 99, each gives 6 triples, so 99*6=594.\n\nFor d=100, gives 6 triples.\n\nTotal: 1 + 594 +6 = 601.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601. But the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on! Wait a second. Wait, in the arithmetic progression approach, the variables are (100 -d,100,100 +d). So the three variables must satisfy that the middle term is 100. So when we consider all permutations, the middle term can be any of the three variables. So actually, the arithmetic progression can be in any order. But in our count above, we considered all permutations, so that is already accounted for. So the count is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of triples is 601. But let me confirm with the initial examples:\n\n- The all-100 triple is counted once.\n\n- The triples with a zero are counted as part of d=100, giving 6 triples.\n\n- The triples like (150,100,50) give 6 triples each for each d from 1 to 99.\n\nTherefore, the total is indeed 601. But I need to check if d can go up to 100.\n\nWait, when d=100, the variables are (0,100,200). Which is valid, so yes, included.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 601. However, I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes in counting problems, there might be an off-by-one error. Let me check the count again:\n\nd ranges from 0 to 100 inclusive. That is 101 different values of d. For each d:\n\n- d=0: 1 triple.\n\n- d=1 to d=100: each gives 6 triples. 100 values, so 100\u00d76=600.\n\nTotal: 1 + 600 =601. Yes.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 601.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second! Wait, in the arithmetic progression, the three numbers must be (100-d, 100, 100+d). However, when we consider permutations, each of these triples can be arranged in any order. However, when d is not zero, all three numbers are distinct, so each permutation is unique. But when we count permutations for each d, we are counting all possible orderings of the three distinct numbers. However, when considering all d from 0 to 100, are there overlaps between different d's?\n\nFor example, is there a case where two different d's produce the same set of numbers?\n\nSuppose d1 and d2 such that (100 -d1, 100, 100 +d1) is a permutation of (100 -d2, 100, 100 +d2).\n\nThis would require that the sets {100 -d1, 100, 100 +d1} and {100 -d2, 100, 100 +d2} are equal.\n\nThis can only happen if d1 =d2 or d1 = -d2, but since d is nonnegative, so d1=d2. Hence, no overlaps. Thus each d gives a unique set of numbers, so their permutations are unique across all d.\n\nTherefore, the total is indeed 601.\n\nHowever, the problem might have a trick where some triples are counted multiple times. But I don't see how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the arithmetic progression assumption. Let me verify with another example where d is fractional? Wait, no, d has to be integer because variables are integers.\n\nWait, variables are nonnegative integers, so d must be integer between 0 and 100.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 601. But let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c)\". So ordered triples. So each permutation is distinct. Therefore, the arithmetic progression approach gives exactly 601 ordered triples.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601.\n\nWait, but I recall that in some problems like this, the count might be different. Let me think again.\n\nWait, but let me consider the case when d=50. The triple (50,100,150) can be arranged in 6 ways. Similarly, d=50 is just one value of d, so it's counted once in the 100 terms (d=1 to 100). So that is accounted for.\n\nTherefore, I think I have to go with 601.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem, the user might expect a different answer. Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me see.\n\nWe had earlier:\n\nWe have a + b + c =300,\n\nand the equation derived was a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 6abc =9,000,000.\n\nWait, let's see if this can be related to the identity for (a + b + c)^3.\n\nWait, (a + b + c)^3 = a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3(a + b)(a + c)(b + c) ?\n\nWait, let me recall the identity.\n\nWait, the standard identity is:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3(a + b)(a + c) + 3(b + c)(a + b + c) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the equation:\n\nWe had earlier:\n\nFrom the first equation, S = a + b + c =300,\n\nThe second equation T = a\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b =6,000,000,\n\nAnd the equation from expanding (a + b + c)^3:\n\n300^3 = a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3T +6abc,\n\nSo 27,000,000 = (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) + 3*6,000,000 +6abc,\n\nSo 27,000,000 = (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) + 18,000,000 +6abc,\n\nThus, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 +6abc =9,000,000.\n\nNow, I recall that there's an identity:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -ab - bc - ca).\n\nSo, rearranged, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 =3abc + (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -ab - bc - ca).\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n3abc + (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -ab - bc - ca) +6abc =9,000,000,\n\nSo, 9abc + (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -ab - bc - ca) =9,000,000,\n\nSince a + b + c =300,\n\nSo,\n\n9abc +300*(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -ab - bc - ca)=9,000,000,\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n3abc +100*(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -ab - bc - ca)=3,000,000.\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps, but perhaps we can express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -ab - bc - ca in terms of other variables.\n\nRecall that a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -ab - bc - ca = \u00bd[(a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2].\n\nTherefore, substituting,\n\n3abc +100*(\u00bd)[(a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2] =3,000,000,\n\nSo,\n\n3abc +50[(a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2] =3,000,000.\n\nHmm, this equation might be useful.\n\nIf the variables are in arithmetic progression, then the differences (a - b), (b - c), etc., are related. For example, in an arithmetic progression with common difference d, say a =100 -d, b=100, c=100 +d,\n\nThen (a - b)= -d, (b - c)= -d, (c - a)=2d,\n\nThus, the squares:\n\n(a - b)^2 =d\u00b2,\n\n(b - c)^2 =d\u00b2,\n\n(c - a)^2 =4d\u00b2,\n\nSum: d\u00b2 + d\u00b2 +4d\u00b2=6d\u00b2,\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe term [(a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2] =6d\u00b2,\n\nTherefore, substituting back into the equation:\n\n3abc +50*(6d\u00b2)=3,000,000,\n\nCompute abc:\n\na=100-d, b=100, c=100+d,\n\nThus, abc=(100 -d)(100)(100 +d)=100*(100\u00b2 -d\u00b2)=100*(10,000 -d\u00b2),\n\nThus,\n\n3*100*(10,000 -d\u00b2) +300d\u00b2 =3,000,000,\n\nSimplify:\n\n300*(10,000 -d\u00b2) +300d\u00b2 =3,000,000,\n\n300*10,000 -300d\u00b2 +300d\u00b2 =3,000,000,\n\n300*10,000 =3,000,000,\n\nWhich holds true. Therefore, this equation is satisfied for any d, which confirms our earlier result that arithmetic progressions satisfy the equation.\n\nNow, if a triple is not in arithmetic progression, then the sum of squares [(a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2] would be greater than zero. Therefore, the term 50*(sum of squares) would be positive, and thus 3abc would have to be less than 3,000,000 -50*(sum of squares). But unless the variables are in arithmetic progression, this might not hold. Hence, this suggests that only arithmetic progressions satisfy the equation.\n\nTherefore, the only solutions are arithmetic progressions, hence the count is indeed 601.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 601.\n\nWait, but the problem might have a different answer? Maybe I made a mistake in the permutation count.\n\nWait, let me consider the case when two variables are equal but not all three. Suppose a = b, but not equal to c. For example, let me take a = b = x, c = 300 -2x.\n\nThen, as we did earlier, we found that the only solution is x=100, leading to c=100, so all three equal. So that case only gives the all-equal triple.\n\nTherefore, there are no solutions where exactly two variables are equal, except when all three are equal.\n\nTherefore, the only solutions are either all three equal (d=0) or three distinct numbers in arithmetic progression (d from 1 to 100). Therefore, the count is correct as 601.\n\nWait, but in the case where d=100, the triple is (0,100,200), which has all distinct elements. So no cases with two variables equal except when d=0.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 601. But since the problem is from an Olympiad or competition, maybe the answer is different? Wait, let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the permutation count for d from 1 to 100. Let me see:\n\nFor each d from 1 to 100, the triple (100-d, 100, 100+d) has three distinct elements, so the number of permutations is 3! =6.\n\nTherefore, for each d from 1 to 100, there are 6 ordered triples. Thus, 100\u00d76=600. Plus the one for d=0 gives 601.\n\nTherefore, I think that's correct.\n\nThus, the answer should be 601. So I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{601}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance. Let me see how I can approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with equations involving sums and products of variables, sometimes it's helpful to use symmetric properties or substitutions. Since the problem involves three variables a, b, and c, and both equations are symmetric in them, maybe there's a way to simplify the problem by considering some symmetry.\n\nThe first equation is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. The second equation is the sum of terms like a\u00b2b, a\u00b2c, etc. Let me write that down again to see if I can factor it or find a pattern:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nHmm, each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me try to group terms:\n\nLooking at the terms, each pair like a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c can be factored as a\u00b2(b + c). Similarly, the other terms would be b\u00b2(a + c) and c\u00b2(a + b). So the entire expression becomes:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b).\n\nThat's a bit simpler. Let me write that as:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b).\n\nNow, since we know that a + b + c = 300, maybe we can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), and similarly for the other terms. Let's try that substitution.\n\nSo substituting:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c).\n\nTherefore, the second equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, and maybe consider each term individually. Let me see if I can find a relationship here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to express the original second equation. Let me recall that sometimes expressions like a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ... can be related to (a + b + c)^3 or similar expansions. Let me think about expanding (a + b + c)^3 and see if that can help.\n\nThe expansion of (a + b + c)^3 is a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3(a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) + 6abc. \n\nSo, if I rearrange this, the term 3(a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) is part of the expansion. Let me write that:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3(a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) + 6abc.\n\nGiven that a + b + c = 300, so (300)^3 = 27,000,000. Let me denote the second equation as:\n\nLet me call the second equation's left-hand side as T = a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000.\n\nSo from the expansion above, we have:\n\n300^3 = a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3*T + 6abc.\n\nPlugging in T = 6,000,000:\n\n27,000,000 = (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) + 3*(6,000,000) + 6abc.\n\nCalculating 3*6,000,000 = 18,000,000.\n\nTherefore,\n\n27,000,000 = (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) + 18,000,000 + 6abc.\n\nSubtracting 18,000,000 from both sides:\n\n9,000,000 = a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 6abc.\n\nHmm, so now we have another equation: a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 6abc = 9,000,000.\n\nI wonder if this can be simplified further. Let me recall some algebraic identities. There's an identity that relates a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - ab - bc - ca). But here, we have a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 6abc. Hmm, that might not directly apply. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 in terms of (a + b + c)^3 and other terms. Let me see:\n\nWe know that a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b)(a + c)(b + c) ?\n\nWait, actually, let me recall the standard expansion:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - ab - bc - ca). \n\nSo rearranged, that gives:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 3abc + (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - ab - bc - ca).\n\nHmm, maybe this can be helpful. Let me plug this into the equation we had earlier:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 6abc = 9,000,000\n\nSubstituting the identity:\n\n[3abc + (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - ab - bc - ca)] + 6abc = 9,000,000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3abc + 6abc = 9abc, so:\n\n9abc + (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - ab - bc - ca) = 9,000,000\n\nHmm, this might not be the most straightforward path. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider variables in terms of two variables since a + b + c = 300. Let me set variables such that, say, c = 300 - a - b, then express everything in terms of a and b. But that might get messy because of the second equation. Let me see if that's feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to assume symmetry here. Since the equations are symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps the solutions are symmetric as well. Maybe two variables are equal, or all three are equal? Let me check that.\n\nSuppose all three variables are equal. Then a = b = c. Since a + b + c = 300, each would be 100. Let's see if that satisfies the second equation.\n\nPlugging into T = a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nIf a = b = c = 100, then each term is (100)^2 * 100 = 100^3. There are six terms, so total is 6*100^3 = 6,000,000. Hey, that's exactly the value given in the problem! So (100, 100, 100) is a solution. So that's one solution.\n\nBut the problem asks for the number of triples, so there might be more solutions where variables are not all equal. Maybe two variables are equal and the third is different? Let's check that case.\n\nSuppose two variables are equal, say a = b, and c is different. Let me denote a = b = x, and c = 300 - 2x.\n\nThen, we can plug into the second equation T = 6,000,000.\n\nFirst, compute T:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nSince a = b = x and c = 300 - 2x:\n\nEach of the terms a\u00b2b and b\u00b2a would be x\u00b2*x = x\u00b3. There are two such terms: a\u00b2b and b\u00b2a, so total 2x\u00b3.\n\nThen, the terms a\u00b2c and b\u00b2c are each x\u00b2*(300 - 2x). There are two terms, so 2x\u00b2*(300 - 2x).\n\nSimilarly, the terms c\u00b2a and c\u00b2b are each (300 - 2x)^2 *x. Again two terms, so 2x*(300 - 2x)^2.\n\nTherefore, total T is:\n\n2x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2(300 - 2x) + 2x(300 - 2x)^2.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, expand each part:\n\nFirst term: 2x\u00b3.\n\nSecond term: 2x\u00b2*(300 - 2x) = 2x\u00b2*300 - 4x\u00b3 = 600x\u00b2 - 4x\u00b3.\n\nThird term: 2x*(300 - 2x)^2. Let me expand (300 - 2x)^2 first:\n\n(300 - 2x)^2 = 300\u00b2 - 2*300*2x + (2x)^2 = 90,000 - 1200x + 4x\u00b2.\n\nMultiply by 2x:\n\n2x*(90,000 - 1200x + 4x\u00b2) = 180,000x - 2400x\u00b2 + 8x\u00b3.\n\nNow, adding all three terms together:\n\nFirst term: 2x\u00b3.\n\nSecond term: 600x\u00b2 - 4x\u00b3.\n\nThird term: 180,000x - 2400x\u00b2 + 8x\u00b3.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nFor x\u00b3: 2x\u00b3 -4x\u00b3 +8x\u00b3 = 6x\u00b3.\n\nFor x\u00b2: 600x\u00b2 -2400x\u00b2 = -1800x\u00b2.\n\nFor x terms: 180,000x.\n\nSo overall, T = 6x\u00b3 -1800x\u00b2 + 180,000x.\n\nSet this equal to 6,000,000:\n\n6x\u00b3 -1800x\u00b2 + 180,000x = 6,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + 30,000x = 1,000,000.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + 30,000x - 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Maybe we can factor it or find integer roots.\n\nPossible rational roots would be factors of 1,000,000 divided by 1, so possible integer roots could be divisors of 1,000,000. Let's try x=100 first, since we already know (100,100,100) is a solution. Let's plug in x=100:\n\n100\u00b3 - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*(100) -1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 -1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 -1,000,000 = 0. Yes, so x=100 is a root. Therefore, (x - 100) is a factor.\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or factor it out. Let me write the cubic as:\n\n(x - 100)(x\u00b2 + bx + c) = x\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + 30,000x -1,000,000.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nx\u00b3 + (b -100)x\u00b2 + (c -100b)x -100c.\n\nSet coefficients equal:\n\nCoefficient of x\u00b3: 1, which matches.\n\nCoefficient of x\u00b2: (b -100) must equal -300 \u21d2 b -100 = -300 \u21d2 b = -200.\n\nCoefficient of x: (c -100b) must equal 30,000.\n\nPlugging b = -200:\n\nc -100*(-200) = c + 20,000 = 30,000 \u21d2 c = 10,000.\n\nConstant term: -100c must equal -1,000,000 \u21d2 -100c = -1,000,000 \u21d2 c =10,000. Which matches.\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as:\n\n(x - 100)(x\u00b2 - 200x + 10,000) = 0.\n\nNow, set the quadratic factor to zero:\n\nx\u00b2 -200x +10,000 =0.\n\nLet me solve this quadratic equation. The discriminant is (200)^2 -4*1*10,000 = 40,000 -40,000 =0. So discriminant is zero, so there's a double root at x = [200]/2 = 100. Wait, so actually, the quadratic factors as (x -100)^2. Therefore, the cubic is (x -100)^3 =0. Wait, hold on:\n\nWait, if the quadratic is x\u00b2 -200x +10,000, then discriminant is 200\u00b2 - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 -40,000=0. So the root is x=(200)/2=100. So quadratic is (x -100)^2. Therefore, the cubic is (x -100)^3=0. Wait, but let's check:\n\n(x -100)^3 = x\u00b3 -300x\u00b2 +30,000x -1,000,000. Yes, exactly matches. So the equation has a triple root at x=100. So the only solution here is x=100, so c = 300 -2x = 300 -200=100. So that brings us back to the case where all three variables are 100. So in this case, when we assumed two variables are equal, the only solution is when all three are equal. So that gives us only one solution here.\n\nHmm, so maybe the only solution where two variables are equal is the same as the all-equal case. So perhaps there are solutions where variables are not equal? Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are solutions where one variable is zero? Let me try that.\n\nSuppose c=0. Then the equations become a + b = 300, and the second equation becomes a\u00b2b + a\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2*0 + 0\u00b2a +0\u00b2b = a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 = ab(a + b).\n\nSince a + b = 300, so substituting, the second equation becomes ab*300 = 6,000,000 \u21d2 ab = 6,000,000 / 300 = 20,000.\n\nSo we need to find nonnegative integers a and b such that a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.\n\nLet me see if such a and b exist.\n\nLet me set a and b as roots of the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -300x +20,000 =0.\n\nCompute discriminant: 300\u00b2 -4*1*20,000 =90,000 -80,000 =10,000.\n\nSquare root of discriminant is 100. Therefore, roots are [300 \u00b1100]/2 = (400)/2=200 or (200)/2=100.\n\nSo a and b would be 200 and 100. So (a,b,c) could be (200,100,0), (100,200,0), (200,0,100), (100,0,200), (0,200,100), (0,100,200). Wait, but since c was set to zero, so actually, the solutions when c=0 are (200,100,0), (100,200,0). Similarly, if we set a=0 or b=0, we can have other permutations.\n\nWait, let me confirm. If c=0, then the solutions for a and b are 200 and 100. So the triples would be permutations where two variables are 200 and 100, and the third is 0. But actually, since c is fixed at 0, the triples would be (200,100,0), (100,200,0). Similarly, if a=0, then we have (0, 200,100) and (0,100,200). Similarly for b=0: (200,0,100) and (100,0,200). So total of 6 triples where one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100.\n\nWait, but hold on, when we set c=0, we get two solutions (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). Similarly, setting a=0 would give (0, 200,100) and (0,100,200). Setting b=0 would give (200,0,100) and (100,0,200). So total of 6 triples. Each of these would be distinct.\n\nSo that's 6 solutions where one variable is zero, and the other two are 200 and 100.\n\nTherefore, so far, we have the all-equal triple (100,100,100), and these 6 triples where one variable is 0 and the other two are 200 and 100. So total so far is 1 +6=7 solutions. But maybe there are more?\n\nWait, let me check if there are solutions where two variables are zero. Suppose two variables are zero. Let's say a=0, b=0, then c=300. Then plug into the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 0 + 0 +0 +0 +0 +0=0 \u22606,000,000. So that doesn't work. Similarly, any two variables zero would give T=0, so those are invalid. So only triples with at most one zero variable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are solutions where variables are different from 100, 200, and 0? Let's see.\n\nSuppose we have a triple where all three variables are different. Let's see if such a triple can satisfy the equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other triples where two variables are equal but not 100? Wait, earlier when we assumed two variables equal, the only solution was when all three are equal. So that suggests that there are no solutions where two variables are equal but not all three.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps variables can be arranged in another way. Let me see if there are other solutions besides the ones we found.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another case where two variables are equal but with different values. Wait, but when we considered two variables equal, the equation led us only to x=100, so perhaps that's the only case where two variables are equal. So maybe the only solutions are the all-equal case and the ones with a zero and two numbers 200 and 100. Let me check another case.\n\nSuppose, for example, that one variable is 150, another is 150, and the third is 0. Let's test that. So (150,150,0). Then, compute T:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b\n\n= (150)^2*150 + (150)^2*0 + (150)^2*150 + (150)^2*0 +0^2*150 +0^2*150\n\n= 150^3 + 150^3 = 2*(150)^3.\n\n150^3 is 3,375,000. Multiply by 2 gives 6,750,000 which is more than 6,000,000. So that's too big. Not a solution.\n\nAlternatively, let me try (150, 100, 50). Sum is 300. Let's compute T:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b =150\u00b2*100 =22,500*100=2,250,000\n\na\u00b2c=150\u00b2*50=22,500*50=1,125,000\n\nb\u00b2a=100\u00b2*150=10,000*150=1,500,000\n\nb\u00b2c=100\u00b2*50=10,000*50=500,000\n\nc\u00b2a=50\u00b2*150=2,500*150=375,000\n\nc\u00b2b=50\u00b2*100=2,500*100=250,000\n\nAdding all these:\n\n2,250,000 +1,125,000 =3,375,000\n\n+1,500,000 =4,875,000\n\n+500,000 =5,375,000\n\n+375,000 =5,750,000\n\n+250,000 =6,000,000.\n\nOh! Wait a second, that actually adds up to 6,000,000. So (150,100,50) is another solution!\n\nHmm, so that's a solution where all three variables are different. So that suggests that there are more solutions beyond the ones we considered earlier. So my previous assumption that only the symmetric case and the ones with a zero are solutions is incorrect. Hmm, so I need to think again.\n\nWait, so (150,100,50) is a solution. Let me check if permutations of this are also solutions. Since the problem counts triples (a,b,c) as distinct if the order is different, then permutations would also be solutions.\n\nSo (150,100,50), (150,50,100), (100,150,50), (100,50,150), (50,150,100), (50,100,150). That's 6 permutations. So that gives 6 more solutions.\n\nWait, so now total solutions would be 1 (all 100s) + 6 (with a zero) +6 (the 150,100,50 permutations). So total 13? Hmm, but maybe there are even more?\n\nWait, let's see another example. Let me try (200, 50, 50). Let me check that.\n\na + b +c =200+50+50=300. Good.\n\nCompute T:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b\n\n=200\u00b2*50 +200\u00b2*50 +50\u00b2*200 +50\u00b2*50 +50\u00b2*200 +50\u00b2*50.\n\nWait, let's compute term by term:\n\na\u00b2b =200\u00b2*50 =40,000*50=2,000,000\n\na\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2b because b and c are both 50, so another 2,000,000\n\nb\u00b2a =50\u00b2*200 =2,500*200=500,000\n\nb\u00b2c =50\u00b2*50=2,500*50=125,000\n\nc\u00b2a = same as b\u00b2a since c and b are same, so another 500,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as b\u00b2c, another 125,000\n\nAdding all up:\n\n2,000,000 +2,000,000 =4,000,000\n\n+500,000 =4,500,000\n\n+125,000 =4,625,000\n\n+500,000 =5,125,000\n\n+125,000 =5,250,000.\n\nThat's only 5,250,000, which is less than 6,000,000. So that's not a solution.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's see another combination. How about (120, 120, 60). Let's check:\n\nSum is 120+120+60=300.\n\nCompute T:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\na and b are 120, c is 60.\n\na\u00b2b =120\u00b2*120 =14,400*120 =1,728,000\n\na\u00b2c =120\u00b2*60=14,400*60=864,000\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2a = same as a\u00b2b:1,728,000\n\nb\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2c:864,000\n\nc\u00b2a =60\u00b2*120=3,600*120=432,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as c\u00b2a:432,000\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1,728,000 +864,000 =2,592,000\n\n+1,728,000 =4,320,000\n\n+864,000 =5,184,000\n\n+432,000 =5,616,000\n\n+432,000 =6,048,000.\n\nHmm, that's 6,048,000 which is more than 6,000,000. Close but not exact.\n\nHmm. Maybe (160, 100, 40). Let me check.\n\nSum is 160+100+40=300.\n\nCompute T:\n\na\u00b2b =160\u00b2*100 =25,600*100=2,560,000\n\na\u00b2c=160\u00b2*40=25,600*40=1,024,000\n\nb\u00b2a=100\u00b2*160=10,000*160=1,600,000\n\nb\u00b2c=100\u00b2*40=10,000*40=400,000\n\nc\u00b2a=40\u00b2*160=1,600*160=256,000\n\nc\u00b2b=40\u00b2*100=1,600*100=160,000\n\nAdding them all:\n\n2,560,000 +1,024,000=3,584,000\n\n+1,600,000=5,184,000\n\n+400,000=5,584,000\n\n+256,000=5,840,000\n\n+160,000=6,000,000.\n\nOh! That works too. So (160,100,40) is another solution. So permutations of this would also be valid. So (160,100,40), (160,40,100), (100,160,40), (100,40,160), (40,160,100), (40,100,160). That's 6 more solutions.\n\nHmm, so this is getting more complicated. It seems there are multiple solutions beyond the ones I initially considered. So maybe I need a more systematic approach here.\n\nLet me think again. Let's see, in the case where one variable is zero, we found solutions where the other two variables are 200 and 100. When all variables are equal, we have 100 each. And when variables are 150,100,50 and 160,100,40, etc. So perhaps there are multiple triples where the variables are in arithmetic progression? Let me see.\n\nWait, 150,100,50: differences are 50 each. 160,100,40: differences are 60 and 60? Wait, no. 160-100=60, 100-40=60. So that is an arithmetic progression with difference -60. Similarly, 150-100=50, 100-50=50. So arithmetic progression with difference -50. So maybe these are arithmetic sequences. Let me check another.\n\nSuppose variables are in arithmetic progression. Let me suppose that the three variables are x -d, x, x +d. Since they have to sum to 300, so (x -d) + x + (x +d) = 3x =300 \u21d2 x=100. So the variables would be 100 -d, 100, 100 +d. Then, let's compute T for these variables.\n\nCompute T = a\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nLet me denote a =100 -d, b=100, c=100 +d.\n\nThen,\n\na\u00b2b = (100 -d)^2 *100,\n\na\u00b2c = (100 -d)^2*(100 +d),\n\nb\u00b2a =100\u00b2*(100 -d),\n\nb\u00b2c =100\u00b2*(100 +d),\n\nc\u00b2a = (100 +d)^2*(100 -d),\n\nc\u00b2b = (100 +d)^2*100.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (100 -d)^2 *100.\n\nSecond term: (100 -d)^2*(100 +d).\n\nThird term: 100\u00b2*(100 -d).\n\nFourth term: 100\u00b2*(100 +d).\n\nFifth term: (100 +d)^2*(100 -d).\n\nSixth term: (100 +d)^2*100.\n\nHmm, this might be a bit tedious, but let me see if there's a pattern or simplification.\n\nAlternatively, notice that terms can be grouped:\n\nTerms 1 and 6: a\u00b2b + c\u00b2b = b(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, terms 2 and 5: a\u00b2c + c\u00b2a =ac(a + c).\n\nTerms 3 and 4: b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c =b\u00b2(a + c).\n\nSo total T = b(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + ac(a + c) + b\u00b2(a + c).\n\nHmm, let me see if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute T for arithmetic progression variables.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (100 -d)^2 *100 = (10000 -200d +d\u00b2)*100 =1,000,000 -20,000d +100d\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: (100 -d)^2*(100 +d) = (10000 -200d +d\u00b2)(100 +d).\n\nLet me expand that:\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n10000*100 =1,000,000\n\n10000*d =10,000d\n\n-200d*100 =-20,000d\n\n-200d*d =-200d\u00b2\n\nd\u00b2*100 =100d\u00b2\n\nd\u00b2*d =d\u00b3\n\nSo adding all together:\n\n1,000,000 +10,000d -20,000d -200d\u00b2 +100d\u00b2 +d\u00b3\n\nSimplify:\n\n1,000,000 -10,000d -100d\u00b2 +d\u00b3.\n\nThird term: 100\u00b2*(100 -d) =10,000*(100 -d)=1,000,000 -10,000d.\n\nFourth term:100\u00b2*(100 +d)=10,000*(100 +d)=1,000,000 +10,000d.\n\nFifth term: (100 +d)^2*(100 -d).\n\nSimilarly, expand (100 +d)^2*(100 -d):\n\nFirst compute (100 +d)^2 =10,000 +200d +d\u00b2.\n\nMultiply by (100 -d):\n\n(10,000 +200d +d\u00b2)(100 -d)\n\n=10,000*100 +10,000*(-d) +200d*100 +200d*(-d) +d\u00b2*100 +d\u00b2*(-d)\n\n=1,000,000 -10,000d +20,000d -200d\u00b2 +100d\u00b2 -d\u00b3\n\nSimplify:\n\n1,000,000 +10,000d -100d\u00b2 -d\u00b3.\n\nSixth term: (100 +d)^2*100 = (10,000 +200d +d\u00b2)*100 =1,000,000 +20,000d +100d\u00b2.\n\nNow, let me sum all six terms:\n\nFirst term: 1,000,000 -20,000d +100d\u00b2\n\nSecond term:1,000,000 -10,000d -100d\u00b2 +d\u00b3\n\nThird term:1,000,000 -10,000d\n\nFourth term:1,000,000 +10,000d\n\nFifth term:1,000,000 +10,000d -100d\u00b2 -d\u00b3\n\nSixth term:1,000,000 +20,000d +100d\u00b2.\n\nLet me write all terms:\n\n1. 1,000,000 -20,000d +100d\u00b2\n\n2. 1,000,000 -10,000d -100d\u00b2 +d\u00b3\n\n3. 1,000,000 -10,000d\n\n4. 1,000,000 +10,000d\n\n5. 1,000,000 +10,000d -100d\u00b2 -d\u00b3\n\n6. 1,000,000 +20,000d +100d\u00b2\n\nNow, let's add them term by term.\n\nFirst, the constants:\n\nEach term has 1,000,000. There are six terms, so 6,000,000.\n\nNext, terms with d:\n\nLooking at each term's d components:\n\nTerm1: -20,000d\n\nTerm2: -10,000d\n\nTerm3: -10,000d\n\nTerm4: +10,000d\n\nTerm5: +10,000d\n\nTerm6: +20,000d\n\nAdding these together:\n\n-20,000d -10,000d -10,000d +10,000d +10,000d +20,000d\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with -20,000d -10,000d = -30,000d\n\n-30,000d -10,000d = -40,000d\n\n-40,000d +10,000d = -30,000d\n\n-30,000d +10,000d = -20,000d\n\n-20,000d +20,000d = 0.\n\nSo the d terms cancel out.\n\nNow terms with d\u00b2:\n\nTerm1: +100d\u00b2\n\nTerm2: -100d\u00b2\n\nTerm3: 0\n\nTerm4:0\n\nTerm5: -100d\u00b2\n\nTerm6:+100d\u00b2\n\nAdding these:\n\n100d\u00b2 -100d\u00b2 -100d\u00b2 +100d\u00b2 = (100d\u00b2 -100d\u00b2) + (-100d\u00b2 +100d\u00b2) = 0 +0 =0.\n\nTerms with d\u00b3:\n\nTerm2: +d\u00b3\n\nTerm5: -d\u00b3\n\nSo d\u00b3 -d\u00b3 =0.\n\nThus, all terms except constants cancel out. So the total T =6,000,000 regardless of d? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, but according to this calculation, T is always 6,000,000 for any d when the variables are in arithmetic progression around 100. But when I tried with d=50 (so 150,100,50) it worked, and with d=60 (160,100,40) it also worked, but with d=0 (all 100s) it also worked. So in fact, any arithmetic progression centered at 100 with any difference d will satisfy the second equation?\n\nWait, that's surprising. Let me verify with d=0: that gives all 100s, which works. For d=50, we have 150,100,50, which worked. For d=60, 160,100,40, which worked. For d=10: 90,100,110. Let me check that.\n\nLet me test d=10. Variables would be 90,100,110. Sum is 300. Compute T:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na=90, b=100, c=110.\n\na\u00b2b = 8100*100 =810,000\n\na\u00b2c =8100*110= 891,000\n\nb\u00b2a =10,000*90=900,000\n\nb\u00b2c =10,000*110=1,100,000\n\nc\u00b2a=12,100*90=1,089,000\n\nc\u00b2b=12,100*100=1,210,000\n\nAdding all together:\n\n810,000 +891,000 =1,701,000\n\n+900,000 =2,601,000\n\n+1,100,000 =3,701,000\n\n+1,089,000 =4,790,000\n\n+1,210,000 =6,000,000. Exactly. So yes, works.\n\nTherefore, indeed, any arithmetic progression centered at 100 with difference d (so variables 100 -d, 100, 100 +d) will satisfy T =6,000,000. Therefore, this gives us infinitely many solutions in real numbers, but since we need nonnegative integers, d must be such that all variables are nonnegative integers.\n\nTherefore, the constraints are:\n\n100 -d \u22650 \u21d2 d \u2264100,\n\n100 +d \u22650 \u21d2 always true since d is nonnegative.\n\nThus, d can be any integer from 0 up to 100. However, since the variables must be nonnegative integers, d must be an integer between 0 and 100 inclusive.\n\nBut wait, actually, variables a, b, c must be nonnegative integers. Since a =100 -d, so d can be 0,1,...,100. For each integer d from 0 to 100, we have a distinct triple (100 -d,100,100 +d). However, note that when d=0, we get (100,100,100). For d from 1 to 100, each gives a unique triple, but these triples can be permuted.\n\nWait, but in the arithmetic progression case, the triple is ordered as (100 -d,100,100 +d). However, the problem counts triples (a,b,c) as different if the order is different. For example, when d=50, the triple is (50,100,150). But this can be permuted in different ways. Wait, but in the arithmetic progression setup, we have a specific ordering, but in reality, the variables can be in any order. Therefore, for each d from 1 to 100, the triple (100 -d,100,100 +d) is one specific permutation, but the actual solutions include all permutations of these three numbers.\n\nTherefore, for each d from 1 to 99, the triple (100 -d, 100, 100 +d) can be permuted in 6 ways (since all three numbers are distinct when d\u22600). However, when d=0, it's the same number in all three positions, so only 1 permutation. When d=100, the triple becomes (0,100,200). Here, two numbers are distinct (0,100,200), so permutations would be 3! /1! =6 (since all three are distinct). Wait, but 0,100,200 are all distinct. So actually, even when d=100, the numbers are distinct. Wait, when d=100, then the variables are (0,100,200). So yes, distinct. So for d=100, it's also 6 permutations.\n\nTherefore, for each d from 0 to 100:\n\n- d=0: gives (100,100,100), count as 1.\n\n- For d from 1 to 99: each gives 6 permutations.\n\n- d=100: gives (0,100,200), which also gives 6 permutations.\n\nWait, but hold on. When d=100, the triple is (0,100,200), which is the same as the case when one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100, which we had considered earlier. So actually, the arithmetic progression approach includes all those solutions where one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100. So the arithmetic progression approach actually covers all the solutions we found before, including those with a zero. So in this case, the total number of triples from arithmetic progression would be:\n\nFor d from 0 to 100 inclusive:\n\n- d=0: 1 triple.\n\n- d=1 to d=100: each gives 6 triples, so 100*6=600.\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, when d=1 and d=99, are they the same?\n\nWait, for example, d=1 gives (99,100,101), and d=99 gives (1,100,199). These are different triples. Similarly, d=2 and d=98 give different triples. So each d from 1 to 100 gives distinct triples when considering all permutations. But actually, the triples for d and 100 -d might be related? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, if you take d and 100 -d, for example, d=1 and d=99:\n\nd=1: (99,100,101)\n\nd=99: (1,100,199)\n\nThese are different triples, so they are distinct. So indeed, each d from 1 to 100 gives a unique set of numbers, and their permutations are all distinct.\n\nTherefore, total number of triples from arithmetic progression is 1 (for d=0) + 100*6 (for d=1 to d=100) =1 +600=601? Wait, but hold on, that can't be right. Wait, but actually, when d ranges from 1 to 100, each d gives a distinct unordered triple, but when considering permutations, each unordered triple corresponds to 6 ordered triples unless there are duplicates. But in our case, for d\u22600 and d\u2260100, the three numbers are distinct, so each gives 6 permutations. For d=100, the numbers are 0,100,200 which are distinct, so also 6 permutations. For d=0, all three numbers are same, so only 1 permutation.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples from the arithmetic progression approach is 1 + 100*6. Wait but d=1 to d=100 is 100 terms, each contributing 6 triples, so 100*6=600, plus the 1 gives 601. But this contradicts our earlier examples where we found (160,100,40), which would correspond to d=60, so that is included here. However, in the earlier case when I considered c=0, which gives the triple (200,100,0), which is d=100, so included here. So according to this, there are 601 solutions from the arithmetic progression approach.\n\nBut wait a second, this can't be correct because the problem is asking for nonnegative integers, and the arithmetic progression approach gives all triples where the numbers are in an arithmetic progression around 100. However, are there other triples not in arithmetic progression that satisfy the equations?\n\nEarlier, we found (150,100,50), which is in AP, yes. The (160,100,40) is also AP. The (200,100,0) is AP. The all 100s is AP. But what about the (120, 120, 60) which we tried earlier? That was not in AP, but didn't satisfy the equation. So maybe all solutions must be in AP?\n\nWait, let's suppose that any solution must be in an arithmetic progression. If that is the case, then the total number of triples would be 601. But let me check another triple not in AP.\n\nSuppose (180, 90, 30). Sum is 180+90+30=300.\n\nCompute T:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\na=180, b=90, c=30.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = 180\u00b2*90 = 32,400*90 = 2,916,000\n\na\u00b2c =180\u00b2*30 =32,400*30=972,000\n\nb\u00b2a =90\u00b2*180=8,100*180=1,458,000\n\nb\u00b2c =90\u00b2*30=8,100*30=243,000\n\nc\u00b2a =30\u00b2*180=900*180=162,000\n\nc\u00b2b =30\u00b2*90=900*90=81,000\n\nAdding all together:\n\n2,916,000 +972,000 =3,888,000\n\n+1,458,000 =5,346,000\n\n+243,000 =5,589,000\n\n+162,000 =5,751,000\n\n+81,000 =5,832,000 \u22606,000,000. So that doesn't work. So this triple isn't a solution.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there exists a solution not in AP.\n\nSuppose we take variables 140, 110, 50. Sum is 140+110+50=300.\n\nCompute T:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\n140\u00b2*110 +140\u00b2*50 +110\u00b2*140 +110\u00b2*50 +50\u00b2*140 +50\u00b2*110.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n140\u00b2 =19,600\n\n140\u00b2*110 =19,600*110=2,156,000\n\n140\u00b2*50=19,600*50=980,000\n\n110\u00b2=12,100\n\n110\u00b2*140=12,100*140=1,694,000\n\n110\u00b2*50=12,100*50=605,000\n\n50\u00b2=2,500\n\n50\u00b2*140=2,500*140=350,000\n\n50\u00b2*110=2,500*110=275,000\n\nAdding all together:\n\n2,156,000 +980,000 =3,136,000\n\n+1,694,000 =4,830,000\n\n+605,000 =5,435,000\n\n+350,000 =5,785,000\n\n+275,000 =6,060,000.\n\nThat's over by 60,000. Not a solution.\n\nHmm, so maybe all solutions are indeed in arithmetic progression. Let me think why that might be the case.\n\nEarlier, when I considered the second equation and the arithmetic progression, the T value turned out to be constant regardless of d. So that suggests that any arithmetic progression centered at 100 with difference d will satisfy T=6,000,000. Therefore, all such triples are solutions. Moreover, since the problem is symmetric, any permutation of such a triple is also a solution. Therefore, all solutions are the permutations of triples in arithmetic progression (100 -d, 100, 100 +d) for some d between 0 and 100.\n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions would be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each d from 0 to 100 inclusive:\n\n- When d=0: the triple is (100,100,100). Only 1 distinct permutation.\n\n- For d from 1 to 99: Each d gives three distinct numbers (since 100 -d, 100, 100 +d are all different). The number of permutations is 3! =6.\n\n- When d=100: The triple is (0,100,200). Again, three distinct numbers, so 6 permutations.\n\nTherefore, total number of triples is:\n\n1 (for d=0) + 99*6 (for d=1 to 99) +6 (for d=100).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1 + (99*6) +6 =1 + 594 +6 =601.\n\nWait, so 601 solutions?\n\nBut earlier, when I considered the case where one variable is zero, that was included in this count (as d=100 gives 6 permutations). The all-equal case is d=0, giving 1. The cases like (150,100,50) are included when d=50, etc.\n\nHowever, the problem states \"nonnegative integers\", so zero is allowed. Therefore, this count of 601 seems to be correct. But let me verify with another example.\n\nTake d=50: the triple is (50,100,150), which has 6 permutations. Similarly for d=60, (40,100,160) which also has 6 permutations. So each d from 1 to 100 gives 6 triples, except d=0 gives 1.\n\nWait, but 1 to 100 inclusive is 100 values. So 100*6=600, plus 1 gives 601. So that's correct.\n\nHowever, wait a second, but in the arithmetic progression approach, when we set variables as (100 -d, 100, 100 +d), these are ordered triples, but when we count permutations, we have to ensure that we are not overcounting. For example, if we have d=1 and d=99, are their permutations overlapping?\n\nWait, no. Because for d=1, the numbers are 99,100,101. For d=99, they are 1,100,199. These are different sets of numbers, so their permutations are entirely distinct. Similarly, each d gives a unique set of numbers except when d and (100 -d) might produce the same numbers? Wait, no, since the numbers are 100-d, 100, 100+d, so for different d's, the numbers are different.\n\nTherefore, indeed, each d from 0 to 100 gives unique triples when considering all permutations, so total number is 601.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c). So, if two different d's produce the same set of numbers but in different order, they would have been counted as different permutations, but since we are considering ordered triples, each permutation is counted separately. Therefore, the total is indeed 601.\n\nHowever, the problem might have constraints that I missed? Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says \"the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c)\" so ordered triples. So each permutation is a different triple. Therefore, the arithmetic progression approach gives all solutions, and the total is 601.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered the case where variables are 200,100,0, which is part of d=100, which is included in the 6 permutations. Similarly, the all-100 case is included. Therefore, this seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check when d=50, the triple is (50,100,150). The permutations of this are 6, which are all distinct triples.\n\nHowever, in my first analysis, I thought that the only solutions were the all-equal case, the ones with a zero, and the ones like 150,100,50. But according to this arithmetic progression approach, there are actually 601 solutions, which includes all of those and more.\n\nBut why didn't I get 601 when I considered specific examples? Because I only tried a few examples, but clearly there are many more.\n\nTherefore, is this the correct answer? 601?\n\nWait, but let me think again: when d ranges from 0 to 100, each d gives a unique triple up to permutation, and each of these corresponds to 6 ordered triples except when all three are equal (d=0) which gives 1, and when two variables are equal? Wait, no. Wait, in the arithmetic progression case, except when d=0, all triples have distinct elements, so their permutations are 6 each. When d=0, all three are same, so only 1. When d=100, the elements are 0,100,200 which are distinct, so 6 permutations. So total is indeed 1 + 100*6. Wait, 1 + (100)*6? Wait, no. Wait, d from 1 to 100 is 100 terms, each giving 6 permutations, so 100*6=600. Plus the 1 for d=0, total is 601.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 601?\n\nBut wait, I need to be careful here. Let me confirm with another angle.\n\nAlternatively, the equation reduces to requiring that the variables are in arithmetic progression. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that the three variables a, b, c are in arithmetic progression. Then, as we saw, the value of T is always 6,000,000. So all such triples satisfy the equation. Are there any other triples that satisfy the equation?\n\nSuppose there is a triple not in arithmetic progression that satisfies the equations. Let's assume such a triple exists. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLet me suppose variables a, b, c with a + b + c =300 and T=6,000,000, but not in AP.\n\nSuppose, for example, take a=140, b=100, c=60. Sum is 300.\n\nCompute T:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\na=140, b=100, c=60.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n140\u00b2*100 =19600*100=1,960,000\n\n140\u00b2*60=19600*60=1,176,000\n\n100\u00b2*140=10,000*140=1,400,000\n\n100\u00b2*60=10,000*60=600,000\n\n60\u00b2*140=3,600*140=504,000\n\n60\u00b2*100=3,600*100=360,000\n\nAdding all:\n\n1,960,000 +1,176,000 =3,136,000\n\n+1,400,000 =4,536,000\n\n+600,000 =5,136,000\n\n+504,000 =5,640,000\n\n+360,000 =6,000,000.\n\nWait a second! This also sums to 6,000,000. But the triple (140,100,60) is not in arithmetic progression. Let me check:\n\nThe numbers 140,100,60. Let's see if they form an AP.\n\nThe differences are 140-100=40 and 100-60=40. Wait a minute! 140, 100, 60 is an arithmetic progression with common difference -40. So it is an arithmetic progression. But arranged in order, it would be 60,100,140. So indeed, it is an arithmetic progression with d=40. Therefore, this is included in the previous count. So even though I thought it wasn't, it actually is an arithmetic progression. So my mistake was in the ordering.\n\nTherefore, any triple that satisfies the equations must be in arithmetic progression, and hence the count of 601 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ordered triples is 601. But let me confirm once more with another example.\n\nTake a=130, b=100, c=70. Sum 300.\n\nCompute T:\n\n130\u00b2*100 +130\u00b2*70 +100\u00b2*130 +100\u00b2*70 +70\u00b2*130 +70\u00b2*100.\n\n130\u00b2=16,900.\n\n16,900*100=1,690,000\n\n16,900*70=1,183,000\n\n100\u00b2=10,000.\n\n10,000*130=1,300,000\n\n10,000*70=700,000\n\n70\u00b2=4,900.\n\n4,900*130=637,000\n\n4,900*100=490,000\n\nAdding up:\n\n1,690,000 +1,183,000 =2,873,000\n\n+1,300,000 =4,173,000\n\n+700,000 =4,873,000\n\n+637,000 =5,510,000\n\n+490,000 =6,000,000. Exactly.\n\nThis triple (130,100,70) is an arithmetic progression with d=30: 100-30=70, 100, 100+30=130. So yes, included in the count.\n\nTherefore, it seems that indeed all solutions must be in arithmetic progression, so the total number of ordered triples is 601.\n\nWait, but hang on. Let me check a case where the variables are not in any order but still in AP. For example, (100, 150, 50). That's the same as (50,100,150), just reordered. So permutations are counted separately. So each unique set of three numbers in AP (with sum 300) corresponds to 6 ordered triples, except when all numbers are same (only 1 ordered triple).\n\nTherefore, the count is indeed 1 + 100*6 =601.\n\nHowever, let me check when d=100: variables (0,100,200). This is an AP with difference 100. The permutations of this are 6, which are all the triples where one is 0, one is 100, and one is 200. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, when d=50, the triple (50,100,150) has permutations like (150,50,100), etc., all of which are counted.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is 601. But the problem states \"nonnegative integers\", so zeros are allowed, so yes.\n\nWait, but let me check with d=100. The triple (0,100,200) is allowed, and that's counted as 6 permutations.\n\nHowever, when d=100, the third term is 100 +100 =200, so that's okay.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 601. But I need to make sure that there are no other solutions outside of arithmetic progression.\n\nSuppose there exists a triple (a,b,c) not in arithmetic progression that satisfies the equations. Let me try to find such a triple.\n\nSuppose a=120, b=110, c=70. Sum is 300. Let's compute T.\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n120\u00b2*110 =14,400*110=1,584,000\n\n120\u00b2*70 =14,400*70=1,008,000\n\n110\u00b2*120=12,100*120=1,452,000\n\n110\u00b2*70=12,100*70=847,000\n\n70\u00b2*120=4,900*120=588,000\n\n70\u00b2*110=4,900*110=539,000\n\nAdding all:\n\n1,584,000 +1,008,000 =2,592,000\n\n+1,452,000 =4,044,000\n\n+847,000 =4,891,000\n\n+588,000 =5,479,000\n\n+539,000 =6,018,000. That's over by 18,000. Not a solution.\n\nAnother try: (130, 120, 50). Sum is 300.\n\nCompute T:\n\n130\u00b2*120 +130\u00b2*50 +120\u00b2*130 +120\u00b2*50 +50\u00b2*130 +50\u00b2*120.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n130\u00b2=16,900\n\n16,900*120=2,028,000\n\n16,900*50=845,000\n\n120\u00b2=14,400\n\n14,400*130=1,872,000\n\n14,400*50=720,000\n\n50\u00b2=2,500\n\n2,500*130=325,000\n\n2,500*120=300,000\n\nTotal:\n\n2,028,000 +845,000 =2,873,000\n\n+1,872,000 =4,745,000\n\n+720,000 =5,465,000\n\n+325,000 =5,790,000\n\n+300,000 =6,090,000. Not 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, so no luck there.\n\nAlternatively, trying (110,110,80). Sum is 300.\n\nCompute T:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\na and b are 110, c is 80.\n\na\u00b2b =110\u00b2*110=12,100*110=1,331,000\n\na\u00b2c =110\u00b2*80=12,100*80=968,000\n\nb\u00b2a = same as a\u00b2b:1,331,000\n\nb\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2c:968,000\n\nc\u00b2a =80\u00b2*110=6,400*110=704,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as c\u00b2a:704,000\n\nTotal:\n\n1,331,000 +968,000 =2,299,000\n\n+1,331,000 =3,630,000\n\n+968,000 =4,598,000\n\n+704,000 =5,302,000\n\n+704,000 =6,006,000. Close but not exact.\n\nHmm, off by 6,000. Not quite.\n\nAlternatively, (125, 100,75). Let's see:\n\nSum is 300.\n\nCompute T:\n\na=125, b=100, c=75.\n\na\u00b2b=125\u00b2*100=15,625*100=1,562,500\n\na\u00b2c=15,625*75=1,171,875\n\nb\u00b2a=100\u00b2*125=125,000\n\nb\u00b2c=100\u00b2*75=750,000\n\nc\u00b2a=75\u00b2*125=56,25*125=7,031,25? Wait, 75\u00b2 is 5,625.\n\n5,625*125=703,125\n\nc\u00b2b=5,625*100=562,500.\n\nAdding all:\n\n1,562,500 +1,171,875 =2,734,375\n\n+125,000 =2,859,375\n\n+750,000 =3,609,375\n\n+703,125 =4,312,500\n\n+562,500 =4,875,000. Not enough.\n\nHmm. So it's difficult to find a non-AP triple that works. This suggests that all solutions are indeed in arithmetic progression.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ordered triples is 1 + 100*6 = 601. But wait, let me check again the count:\n\nWait, when d=0, there is 1 triple.\n\nFor d from 1 to 99, each gives 6 triples, so 99*6=594.\n\nFor d=100, gives 6 triples.\n\nTotal: 1 + 594 +6 = 601.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601. But the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on! Wait a second. Wait, in the arithmetic progression approach, the variables are (100 -d,100,100 +d). So the three variables must satisfy that the middle term is 100. So when we consider all permutations, the middle term can be any of the three variables. So actually, the arithmetic progression can be in any order. But in our count above, we considered all permutations, so that is already accounted for. So the count is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of triples is 601. But let me confirm with the initial examples:\n\n- The all-100 triple is counted once.\n\n- The triples with a zero are counted as part of d=100, giving 6 triples.\n\n- The triples like (150,100,50) give 6 triples each for each d from 1 to 99.\n\nTherefore, the total is indeed 601. But I need to check if d can go up to 100.\n\nWait, when d=100, the variables are (0,100,200). Which is valid, so yes, included.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 601. However, I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes in counting problems, there might be an off-by-one error. Let me check the count again:\n\nd ranges from 0 to 100 inclusive. That is 101 different values of d. For each d:\n\n- d=0: 1 triple.\n\n- d=1 to d=100: each gives 6 triples. 100 values, so 100\u00d76=600.\n\nTotal: 1 + 600 =601. Yes.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 601.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second! Wait, in the arithmetic progression, the three numbers must be (100-d, 100, 100+d). However, when we consider permutations, each of these triples can be arranged in any order. However, when d is not zero, all three numbers are distinct, so each permutation is unique. But when we count permutations for each d, we are counting all possible orderings of the three distinct numbers. However, when considering all d from 0 to 100, are there overlaps between different d's?\n\nFor example, is there a case where two different d's produce the same set of numbers?\n\nSuppose d1 and d2 such that (100 -d1, 100, 100 +d1) is a permutation of (100 -d2, 100, 100 +d2).\n\nThis would require that the sets {100 -d1, 100, 100 +d1} and {100 -d2, 100, 100 +d2} are equal.\n\nThis can only happen if d1 =d2 or d1 = -d2, but since d is nonnegative, so d1=d2. Hence, no overlaps. Thus each d gives a unique set of numbers, so their permutations are unique across all d.\n\nTherefore, the total is indeed 601.\n\nHowever, the problem might have a trick where some triples are counted multiple times. But I don't see how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the arithmetic progression assumption. Let me verify with another example where d is fractional? Wait, no, d has to be integer because variables are integers.\n\nWait, variables are nonnegative integers, so d must be integer between 0 and 100.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 601. But let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c)\". So ordered triples. So each permutation is distinct. Therefore, the arithmetic progression approach gives exactly 601 ordered triples.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601.\n\nWait, but I recall that in some problems like this, the count might be different. Let me think again.\n\nWait, but let me consider the case when d=50. The triple (50,100,150) can be arranged in 6 ways. Similarly, d=50 is just one value of d, so it's counted once in the 100 terms (d=1 to 100). So that is accounted for.\n\nTherefore, I think I have to go with 601.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem, the user might expect a different answer. Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me see.\n\nWe had earlier:\n\nWe have a + b + c =300,\n\nand the equation derived was a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 6abc =9,000,000.\n\nWait, let's see if this can be related to the identity for (a + b + c)^3.\n\nWait, (a + b + c)^3 = a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3(a + b)(a + c)(b + c) ?\n\nWait, let me recall the identity.\n\nWait, the standard identity is:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3(a + b)(a + c) + 3(b + c)(a + b + c) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the equation:\n\nWe had earlier:\n\nFrom the first equation, S = a + b + c =300,\n\nThe second equation T = a\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b =6,000,000,\n\nAnd the equation from expanding (a + b + c)^3:\n\n300^3 = a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3T +6abc,\n\nSo 27,000,000 = (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) + 3*6,000,000 +6abc,\n\nSo 27,000,000 = (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) + 18,000,000 +6abc,\n\nThus, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 +6abc =9,000,000.\n\nNow, I recall that there's an identity:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -ab - bc - ca).\n\nSo, rearranged, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 =3abc + (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -ab - bc - ca).\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n3abc + (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -ab - bc - ca) +6abc =9,000,000,\n\nSo, 9abc + (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -ab - bc - ca) =9,000,000,\n\nSince a + b + c =300,\n\nSo,\n\n9abc +300*(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -ab - bc - ca)=9,000,000,\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n3abc +100*(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -ab - bc - ca)=3,000,000.\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps, but perhaps we can express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -ab - bc - ca in terms of other variables.\n\nRecall that a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -ab - bc - ca = \u00bd[(a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2].\n\nTherefore, substituting,\n\n3abc +100*(\u00bd)[(a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2] =3,000,000,\n\nSo,\n\n3abc +50[(a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2] =3,000,000.\n\nHmm, this equation might be useful.\n\nIf the variables are in arithmetic progression, then the differences (a - b), (b - c), etc., are related. For example, in an arithmetic progression with common difference d, say a =100 -d, b=100, c=100 +d,\n\nThen (a - b)= -d, (b - c)= -d, (c - a)=2d,\n\nThus, the squares:\n\n(a - b)^2 =d\u00b2,\n\n(b - c)^2 =d\u00b2,\n\n(c - a)^2 =4d\u00b2,\n\nSum: d\u00b2 + d\u00b2 +4d\u00b2=6d\u00b2,\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe term [(a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2] =6d\u00b2,\n\nTherefore, substituting back into the equation:\n\n3abc +50*(6d\u00b2)=3,000,000,\n\nCompute abc:\n\na=100-d, b=100, c=100+d,\n\nThus, abc=(100 -d)(100)(100 +d)=100*(100\u00b2 -d\u00b2)=100*(10,000 -d\u00b2),\n\nThus,\n\n3*100*(10,000 -d\u00b2) +300d\u00b2 =3,000,000,\n\nSimplify:\n\n300*(10,000 -d\u00b2) +300d\u00b2 =3,000,000,\n\n300*10,000 -300d\u00b2 +300d\u00b2 =3,000,000,\n\n300*10,000 =3,000,000,\n\nWhich holds true. Therefore, this equation is satisfied for any d, which confirms our earlier result that arithmetic progressions satisfy the equation.\n\nNow, if a triple is not in arithmetic progression, then the sum of squares [(a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2] would be greater than zero. Therefore, the term 50*(sum of squares) would be positive, and thus 3abc would have to be less than 3,000,000 -50*(sum of squares). But unless the variables are in arithmetic progression, this might not hold. Hence, this suggests that only arithmetic progressions satisfy the equation.\n\nTherefore, the only solutions are arithmetic progressions, hence the count is indeed 601.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 601.\n\nWait, but the problem might have a different answer? Maybe I made a mistake in the permutation count.\n\nWait, let me consider the case when two variables are equal but not all three. Suppose a = b, but not equal to c. For example, let me take a = b = x, c = 300 -2x.\n\nThen, as we did earlier, we found that the only solution is x=100, leading to c=100, so all three equal. So that case only gives the all-equal triple.\n\nTherefore, there are no solutions where exactly two variables are equal, except when all three are equal.\n\nTherefore, the only solutions are either all three equal (d=0) or three distinct numbers in arithmetic progression (d from 1 to 100). Therefore, the count is correct as 601.\n\nWait, but in the case where d=100, the triple is (0,100,200), which has all distinct elements. So no cases with two variables equal except when d=0.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 601. But since the problem is from an Olympiad or competition, maybe the answer is different? Wait, let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the permutation count for d from 1 to 100. Let me see:\n\nFor each d from 1 to 100, the triple (100-d, 100, 100+d) has three distinct elements, so the number of permutations is 3! =6.\n\nTherefore, for each d from 1 to 100, there are 6 ordered triples. Thus, 100\u00d76=600. Plus the one for d=0 gives 601.\n\nTherefore, I think that's correct.\n\nThus, the answer should be 601. So I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{601}\n\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the number of triples of nonnegative integers \\((a, b, c)\\) satisfying \\(a + b + c = 300\\) and \\(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\\), we start by analyzing the given equations.\n\nFirst, we recognize that the second equation can be rewritten using the identity for the expansion of \\((a + b + c)^3\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b) + 6abc\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(a + b + c = 300\\), we substitute \\(S = 300\\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\n300^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3 \\times 6,000,000 + 6abc\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n\\[\n27,000,000 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 18,000,000 + 6abc\n\\]\n\n\\[\n9,000,000 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc\n\\]\n\nWe then consider the identity \\(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca)\\). However, we find that the key insight is recognizing that the solutions must form an arithmetic progression. \n\nAssuming \\(a, b, c\\) are in arithmetic progression, we set \\(a = 100 - d\\), \\(b = 100\\), and \\(c = 100 + d\\) for some nonnegative integer \\(d\\). This ensures \\(a + b + c = 300\\). The second equation is satisfied for any \\(d\\) because the terms simplify to the required value.\n\nFor each \\(d\\) from 0 to 100, we get a valid triple. The count of these triples is as follows:\n- When \\(d = 0\\), the triple is \\((100, 100, 100)\\), contributing 1 solution.\n- For each \\(d\\) from 1 to 100, the triple \\((100 - d, 100, 100 + d)\\) can be permuted in 6 ways (since all elements are distinct), contributing \\(100 \\times 6 = 600\\) solutions.\n\nSumming these, we get the total number of solutions:\n\n\\[\n1 + 600 = 601\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of triples \\((a, b, c)\\) is \\(\\boxed{601}\\).",
