      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nWe have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at points B and C intersect at point D. Then the line AD intersects the circle \u03c9 again at point P. We're given the sides AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length of AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then compute m + n.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some properties related to tangents and circles. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC, D is the exsimilicenter or the symmedian point? Wait, actually, the point where the two tangents meet is called the exsimilicenter of the circle with respect to B and C, but more importantly, in triangle geometry, this point D is known as the symmedian point? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, that makes D the pole of the side BC with respect to the circumcircle? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Wait, the pole of BC would be the point where the tangents at B and C meet? Wait, yes, actually, the polar of BC is the line through the tangents at B and C. So D is the pole of BC. But perhaps that's more projective geometry.\n\nAlternatively, in triangle ABC, the point where the two tangents at B and C meet is called the Bevan point? Or maybe not. Maybe it's simpler to just use power of a point here.\n\nPower of a point D with respect to \u03c9: since D lies on the tangents at B and C, the power of D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2. Because the tangent from D to \u03c9 has length squared equal to both DB and DC. Therefore, DB = DC. So D is equidistant from B and C, which makes sense since it's on both tangents.\n\nHmm, okay. So maybe we can use power of a point here. Let me think.\n\nWe need to find AP. Since AD is a line from A through D to P on the circumcircle, so AP is the length from A to P along that line. Since P is the second intersection point, AP is actually the length from A to P, which would be AD minus DP, but since they are on the same line, but I might need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use harmonic division or projective geometry concepts, but maybe inversion? Hmm, but maybe it's better to use power of a point.\n\nAlternatively, use coordinates or trigonometry. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem gives the sides of the triangle, maybe we can compute some lengths using the given sides.\n\nFirst, let me note that in triangle ABC, with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10, so perhaps first compute some angles or other elements like the circumradius?\n\nYes, maybe the circumradius R can be computed. Let's see.\n\nThe formula for the circumradius R of triangle ABC is given by R = (a)/(2 sin A), where a is the side opposite angle A. Alternatively, using the formula R = (a b c)/(4 area). Let me compute the area first.\n\nGiven sides a=BC=9, b=AC=10, c=AB=5. Wait, actually, in standard notation, a is BC, opposite angle A; b is AC opposite angle B; c is AB opposite angle C. Wait, actually, perhaps I should confirm.\n\nWait, in standard triangle notation, side a is opposite angle A, so in triangle ABC, side a is BC, side b is AC, and side c is AB. So:\n\na = BC = 9,\n\nb = AC = 10,\n\nc = AB = 5.\n\nTherefore, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (9 + 10 + 5)/2 = 24/2 = 12.\n\nThen area via Heron's formula: sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12 -9)(12 -10)(12 -5)] = sqrt[12*3*2*7] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] Wait, 12*3=36, 36*2=72, 72*7=504. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(16*31.5) Hmm, but 504 factors: 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but perhaps better as prime factors: 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, no, let's do prime factors:\n\n504 = 8*63 = 8*7*9 = 8*7*3^2. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(8*7*3^2) = 3*sqrt(56) = 3*sqrt(4*14) = 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14). Therefore the area is 6\u221a14.\n\nTherefore, area is 6\u221a14. Then the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4*area) = (9 * 10 * 5)/(4 * 6\u221a14) = (450)/(24\u221a14) = (75)/(4\u221a14). Rationalizing the denominator: (75\u221a14)/(4*14) = (75\u221a14)/56. Hmm, so R = (75\u221a14)/56. Hmm, that might come into play later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinates. Let me consider coordinate geometry.\n\nLet me place point C at the origin (0,0), point B somewhere on the x-axis, so let me set coordinates as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s set point C at (0, 0). Let me set point B at (9, 0), since BC = 9. Wait, but AC is 10, AB is 5. Wait, but then AC is from C(0,0) to A(x,y) with length 10, and AB is from A(x,y) to B(9,0) with length 5. Hmm, perhaps that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe coordinate system setup might complicate things. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, use power of point D with respect to the circle. Since D lies outside the circle, and the power of D is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DT\u00b2 where T is the point of tangency. Since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, so power of D is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = power w.r. to \u03c9.\n\nAlso, since AD passes through P, which is on the circumcircle, so AP * AD = power of A with respect to \u03c9? Wait, no. Wait, A is on the circle, so its power is zero. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since P is on the circumcircle and on line AD, so AP * AD' = something? Wait, perhaps use power of point D.\n\nPower of D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DP * DA. Because line DA passes through A and P, so DA is from D to A to P. Therefore, DP * DA = power of D, which is DB\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me recall the power of a point formula. If a line through D intersects the circle at X and Y, then DX * DY = power of D. Since D is outside, so if the line DA intersects the circle at A and P, then DA * DP = power of D. Wait, but actually, the power is equal to DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Wait, but which comes first? Let me check the exact formula.\n\nThe power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 (since DB is tangent). Also, the power is equal to DX * DY where DX and DY are the lengths from D to the two intersection points of line DP with the circle. Since line AD passes through D, A, and P, so the two intersection points are A and P. Therefore, DA * DP = power of D = DB\u00b2. Therefore, DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Therefore, if we can find DA and DP in terms of AP, maybe?\n\nWait, let me denote AP as x. Since AP is the segment from A to P, and AD is from A to D, so the total length from D to P would be DP = DA + AP? Wait, no, depends on the direction. Let me think.\n\nWait, points are in order: D is outside the circle, then the line DA goes from D through A to P. So the points are D---A---P on the line. Therefore, DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P, so DP = DA + AP. Wait, no, if D is outside, then going from D to A is towards the circle, then continuing to P, which is another intersection point. Wait, but since A is already on the circle, then P must be the other intersection, so actually, starting at D, going through A to P, so DA is from D to A, then AP is from A to P. Therefore, DP = DA + AP. Therefore, DA * DP = DA*(DA + AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nBut we need to find AP. Let me write variables:\n\nLet\u2019s denote DA = t, then DP = t + AP. So power of D gives t*(t + AP) = DB\u00b2. But we need another equation to relate these variables. Alternatively, perhaps express AP in terms of DA and DP?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use coordinates or trigonometry to find DB and DC, but since DB = DC, maybe we can compute DB?\n\nAlternatively, since we know the sides of triangle ABC, perhaps we can compute coordinates of points A, B, C, then find equations for the tangents at B and C, find their intersection D, then find equation of line AD, find its other intersection P with the circumcircle, then compute the distance from A to P.\n\nThis seems computational but doable. Let me try this approach.\n\nFirst, let me set coordinates.\n\nLet me place point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0), since BC =9. Let me let point A be at some coordinates (x,y). Then, AC =10, so distance from A to C(0,0) is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=10, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100.\n\nDistance from A(x,y) to B(9,0) is 5, so sqrt( (x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 ) =5, so (x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 =25.\n\nSo we can set up equations:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100,\n\n(x - 9)^2 + y\u00b2 =25.\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - [ (x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 ] =100 -25,\n\nx\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 -18x +81) =75,\n\nx\u00b2 -x\u00b2 +18x -81 =75,\n\n18x = 75 +81 = 156,\n\nx=156/18 = 26/3 \u2248 8.666...\n\nHmm, okay, so x coordinate of A is 26/3. Then y\u00b2 = 100 -x\u00b2 = 100 - (676/9) = (900 -676)/9 = 224/9, so y= \u00b1\u221a(224/9)= \u00b1(\u221a224)/3 = \u00b1(4\u221a14)/3. Since triangles are typically drawn in upper half-plane, let me take y positive. So coordinates of A are (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3).\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nC: (0,0)\n\nB: (9,0)\n\nA: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3)\n\nAlright, now we need to find the equations of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9. Since we have coordinates for A, B, C, we can find the equation of the circumcircle, then find the tangent lines at B and C.\n\nFirst, let me find the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9. Since three points are known, we can write the equation.\n\nLet me denote the general equation of a circle as: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nPlug in points A, B, C:\n\nFor point C(0,0):\n\n0 +0 +0 +0 + F =0 \u21d2 F=0.\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right? Wait, point C is (0,0), so plugging in gives 0 +0 + D*0 + E*0 + F =0 \u21d2 F=0.\n\nBut then point B(9,0):\n\n9\u00b2 +0\u00b2 + D*9 + E*0 +0 =0 \u21d2 81 +9D =0 \u21d2 9D = -81 \u21d2 D= -9.\n\nPoint A(26/3, 4\u221a14/3):\n\n( (26/3)^2 + (4\u221a14/3)^2 ) + D*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) + F =0.\n\nSince F=0, D=-9:\n\nCompute the terms:\n\nFirst, compute (26/3)^2: (676/9)\n\n(4\u221a14/3)^2: (16*14)/9 = 224/9\n\nSo sum of squares: (676 + 224)/9 = 900/9 = 100.\n\nThen, D*(26/3) = (-9)*(26/3) = -78.\n\nE*(4\u221a14/3) remains.\n\nSo altogether:\n\n100 -78 + (4\u221a14/3)*E =0 \u21d2 22 + (4\u221a14/3) E =0 \u21d2 (4\u221a14/3) E = -22 \u21d2 E = (-22 *3)/(4\u221a14) = (-66)/(4\u221a14) = (-33)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing the denominator:\n\nE = (-33)/(2\u221a14) * (\u221a14/\u221a14) = (-33\u221a14)/(28).\n\nTherefore, the equation of the circle is:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] y =0.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy, but okay. Alternatively, maybe it's better to write in standard form by completing the squares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute the tangent lines at B and C.\n\nAlternatively, the tangent at a point (x\u2080,y\u2080) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is given by:\n\nxx\u2080 + yy\u2080 + D(x + x\u2080)/2 + E(y + y\u2080)/2 + F =0. Wait, is that the formula?\n\nWait, the tangent line at point (x\u2080,y\u2080) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is:\n\nx x\u2080 + y y\u2080 + D(x + x\u2080)/2 + E(y + y\u2080)/2 + F =0. Let me verify this formula.\n\nAlternatively, the general tangent formula can be derived by using derivative, or using the fact that the tangent is perpendicular to the radius. Since the center of the circle is ( -D/2, -E/2 ), so the radius vector from center to point (x\u2080,y\u2080) is (x\u2080 + D/2, y\u2080 + E/2). The tangent line is perpendicular to this, so its equation can be written as (x\u2080 + D/2)(x - x\u2080) + (y\u2080 + E/2)(y - y\u2080)=0.\n\nExpanding that:\n\n(x\u2080 + D/2)(x - x\u2080) + (y\u2080 + E/2)(y - y\u2080) =0\n\nMultiply out:\n\nx\u2080 x - x\u2080\u00b2 + (D/2)x - (D/2)x\u2080 + y\u2080 y - y\u2080\u00b2 + (E/2)y - (E/2)y\u2080 =0\n\nRearranged:\n\nx\u2080 x + y\u2080 y + (D/2)x + (E/2)y - [x\u2080\u00b2 + (D/2)x\u2080 + y\u2080\u00b2 + (E/2)y\u2080] =0\n\nBut since (x\u2080,y\u2080) is on the circle, we have x\u2080\u00b2 + y\u2080\u00b2 + D x\u2080 + E y\u2080 + F =0 \u21d2 x\u2080\u00b2 + y\u2080\u00b2 = -Dx\u2080 - E y\u2080 -F. Substitute into the above:\n\nThe term in brackets becomes:\n\n[ -Dx\u2080 - E y\u2080 - F + (D/2)x\u2080 + (E/2)y\u2080 ] = [ - (D/2)x\u2080 - (E/2)y\u2080 - F ]\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\nx\u2080 x + y\u2080 y + (D/2)x + (E/2)y - [ - (D/2)x\u2080 - (E/2)y\u2080 - F ] =0\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe better to use another method.\n\nAlternatively, for the tangent at point B(9,0):\n\nThe tangent line at point B(9,0) on the circle. Let me use the formula for tangent line in terms of the circle equation.\n\nThe circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] y =0.\n\nWait, let me denote E as the coefficient for y, which is (-33\u221a14)/28.\n\nSo the tangent at point (x\u2080,y\u2080) is:\n\nx x\u2080 + y y\u2080 - (9/2)(x + x\u2080) + (E/2)(y + y\u2080) =0 ?\n\nWait, perhaps better to use derivative. Let me compute derivative at point B(9,0).\n\nDifferentiating implicitly:\n\n2x + 2y y\u2019 -9 + E y\u2019 =0.\n\nAt point (9,0):\n\n2*9 + 0 -9 + E y\u2019 =0 \u21d2 18 -9 + E y\u2019 =0 \u21d2 9 + E y\u2019 =0 \u21d2 y\u2019 = -9/E.\n\nWait, E is (-33\u221a14)/28, so substituting:\n\ny\u2019 = -9 / [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] = (9 *28)/(33\u221a14) = (252)/(33\u221a14) = (84)/(11\u221a14). Rationalize denominator:\n\n84/(11\u221a14) * \u221a14/\u221a14 = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (6\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the slope of tangent at B is (6\u221a14)/11. Wait, but the tangent line at B(9,0):\n\nThe slope is (6\u221a14)/11, so equation is y -0 = (6\u221a14)/11 (x -9).\n\nSimilarly, compute tangent at point C(0,0):\n\nWait, point C is (0,0). Let me compute the tangent at C.\n\nAgain, using derivative:\n\nAt point (0,0):\n\n2x + 2y y\u2019 -9 + E y\u2019 =0 \u21d2 0 +0 -9 + E y\u2019 =0 \u21d2 E y\u2019 =9 \u21d2 y\u2019 = 9/E.\n\nE is (-33\u221a14)/28, so y\u2019 =9 / [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] = 9*(-28)/(33\u221a14) = (-252)/(33\u221a14) = (-84)/(11\u221a14). Rationalize:\n\n-84/(11\u221a14) * \u221a14/\u221a14 = (-84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (-6\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C(0,0) has slope -6\u221a14/11. So equation is y -0 = (-6\u221a14)/11 (x -0), so y = (-6\u221a14)/11 x.\n\nTherefore, the two tangent lines are:\n\nAt B: y = (6\u221a14)/11 (x -9)\n\nAt C: y = (-6\u221a14)/11 x\n\nTheir intersection is point D. Let's find D by solving these two equations.\n\nSet the two equations equal:\n\n(6\u221a14)/11 (x -9) = (-6\u221a14)/11 x\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14) to eliminate coefficients:\n\n(x -9) = -x\n\nSo x -9 = -x \u21d2 2x =9 \u21d2 x= 9/2 =4.5\n\nThen substitute back to find y:\n\nUsing tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14)/11 * (9/2) = (-6\u221a14 *9)/(22) = (-54\u221a14)/22 = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nHmm, okay, so D is at (4.5, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, we need to find the equation of line AD, which connects point A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3) and D (9/2, -27\u221a14/11). Let me compute the parametric equations or the slope.\n\nFirst, let me compute the coordinates numerically to see if that helps, but perhaps better to keep as fractions.\n\nCompute the coordinates:\n\nPoint A: (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3 )\n\nPoint D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11 )\n\nLet me find the vector from A to D:\n\n\u0394x = 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6)= (-25/6)\n\n\u0394y = (-27\u221a14/11 - 4\u221a14/3 ) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3 ) = \u221a14*(- (81 +44)/33 ) = \u221a14*(-125/33 )\n\nTherefore, the direction vector is (-25/6, -125\u221a14/33 )\n\nAlternatively, the slope m of AD is (\u0394y)/(\u0394x) = [ -125\u221a14/33 ] / [ -25/6 ] = (125\u221a14/33 ) / (25/6 ) = (125/25)*(6/33)*\u221a14 = 5*(2/11)*\u221a14 = (10/11)\u221a14.\n\nSo the slope is (10\u221a14)/11.\n\nThus, the equation of line AD can be written in point-slope form using point A:\n\ny - (4\u221a14/3) = (10\u221a14/11)(x - 26/3 )\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of this line with the circumcircle \u03c9. Since A is already on both the line and the circle, P is the other intersection.\n\nTo find P, we can solve the system of equations: the line AD and the circle equation.\n\nFirst, let me write the circle equation again. Earlier, we had:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] y =0\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to write it in standard form (center and radius). Let me compute that.\n\nThe general equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0, so here D = -9, E = (-33\u221a14)/28, F=0.\n\nThe center is at (-D/2, -E/2) = (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56 )\n\nRadius squared is (D/2)^2 + (E/2)^2 - F = (81/4) + ( (33\u221a14)/56 )\u00b2 -0.\n\nBut maybe solving the system is better.\n\nLet me denote the line equation as y = m(x - x_A) + y_A, where m is the slope, and (x_A,y_A) is point A.\n\nAlternatively, let me express y from the line equation and substitute into the circle equation.\n\nGiven the line equation:\n\ny = (10\u221a14/11)(x -26/3) + (4\u221a14)/3\n\nLet me write this as y = (10\u221a14/11)x - (10\u221a14/11)(26/3) + (4\u221a14)/3\n\nCompute the constants:\n\nFirst term: (10\u221a14/11)x\n\nSecond term: - (260\u221a14)/(33)\n\nThird term: + (44\u221a14)/33 (since 4/3 = 44/33?)\n\nWait, 4\u221a14/3 = (4\u221a14 *11)/33 = 44\u221a14/33. So yes.\n\nSo combining the constants:\n\n-260\u221a14/33 +44\u221a14/33 = (-216\u221a14)/33 = (-72\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the equation of line AD is:\n\ny = (10\u221a14/11)x - (72\u221a14)/11\n\nSo y = (10\u221a14 x -72\u221a14)/11 = \u221a14(10x -72)/11.\n\nTherefore, substitute this into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] y =0\n\nLet me substitute y:\n\nFirst, compute y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 = [ \u221a14(10x -72)/11 ]\u00b2 = 14*(10x -72)^2 / (121)\n\nThen, the term [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] y = [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] * [ \u221a14(10x -72)/11 ] = [ (-33\u221a14 * \u221a14)/ (28*11) ]*(10x -72 )\n\nSimplify \u221a14*\u221a14 =14, so:\n\n= [ (-33*14)/(28*11) ]*(10x -72 )\n\nSimplify coefficients:\n\n33 and 11: 33/11=3,\n\n14 and 28: 14/28=1/2,\n\nThus: [ (-3 * 1/2 ) ]*(10x -72 ) = (-3/2)(10x -72 )\n\nTherefore, putting all into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + [14*(10x -72)^2 / 121 ] -9x + [ (-3/2)(10x -72) ] =0\n\nThis seems very algebra-heavy. Let me see if I can handle this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write all terms:\n\n1. x\u00b2\n\n2. 14*(10x -72)^2 / 121\n\n3. -9x\n\n4. (-3/2)(10x -72)\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\nx\u00b2 + [14*(10x -72)^2]/121 -9x - (3/2)(10x -72) =0\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: x\u00b2\n\nSecond term: Let me expand (10x -72)^2:\n\n(10x)^2 - 2*10x*72 +72\u00b2 = 100x\u00b2 -1440x +5184\n\nMultiply by 14: 1400x\u00b2 -20160x +72576\n\nDivide by 121: (1400x\u00b2 -20160x +72576)/121\n\nThird term: -9x\n\nFourth term: - (3/2)(10x -72) = -15x +108\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nx\u00b2 + (1400x\u00b2 -20160x +72576)/121 -9x -15x +108 =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nFirst, let me combine the x terms: -9x -15x = -24x\n\nConstants: +108\n\nSo:\n\nx\u00b2 + (1400x\u00b2 -20160x +72576)/121 -24x +108 =0\n\nTo combine all terms over 121 denominator, let me multiply every term by 121 to eliminate denominators:\n\n121x\u00b2 +1400x\u00b2 -20160x +72576 -24x*121 +108*121 =0\n\nCompute each term:\n\n121x\u00b2 +1400x\u00b2 = 1521x\u00b2\n\n-20160x remains\n\n-24x*121 = -2904x\n\n72576 +108*121: compute 108*121. 100*121=12100, 8*121=968 \u21d2 total 12100+968=13068. So total constants:72576 +13068 = 85644\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n1521x\u00b2 + (-20160x -2904x) +85644 =0\n\nCombine x terms:\n\n-20160 -2904 = -23064\n\nThus:\n\n1521x\u00b2 -23064x +85644 =0\n\nLet me divide all terms by GCD of coefficients. Let's see, 1521, 23064,85644.\n\n1521 is 39\u00b2 (since 39\u00b2=1521). Let me check GCD:\n\n23064 \u00f7 39: 23064 /39 = 23064 \u00f7 39: 39*591=23049, so 23064-23049=15 \u21d2 23064=39*591 +15 \u21d2 remainder 15.\n\nHmm, so GCD(1521,23064)= GCD(1521,15). 1521 \u00f715=101.4 \u21d2 15*101=1515, remainder 6. Then GCD(15,6)=3.\n\nThus GCD is 3. Let me divide equation by 3:\n\n1521/3=507, 23064/3=7688, 85644/3=28548.\n\nThus equation becomes:\n\n507x\u00b2 -7688x +28548 =0\n\nHmm, still not very nice. Maybe I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in expanding terms. Let me check the constants again:\n\nOriginal equation after multiplying by 121:\n\n121x\u00b2 + (1400x\u00b2 -20160x +72576) -24x*121 +108*121 =0\n\nWait, the 121x\u00b2 comes from multiplying the first term x\u00b2 by 121. The second term is 1400x\u00b2 -20160x +72576. Then the third term is -24x*121, and the last term is 108*121.\n\nSo 121x\u00b2 +1400x\u00b2 = (121+1400)x\u00b2 = 1521x\u00b2. That's correct.\n\nThen for the x terms:\n\n-20160x (from the second term) plus -24x*121.\n\n-24x*121 is indeed -2904x. So total x terms: -20160x -2904x = -23064x. Correct.\n\nConstants: 72576 (from second term) +108*121. Let me recalculate 108*121:\n\n121*100=12100, 121*8=968, so 12100+968=13068. Then 72576 +13068:\n\n72576 +13000=85576, plus 68 gives 85644. Correct.\n\nSo equation is indeed 1521x\u00b2 -23064x +85644 =0. Divided by 3: 507x\u00b2 -7688x +28548=0.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor out 507? 507= 3\u00d713\u00b2. Not sure. Alternatively, use quadratic formula.\n\nLet me write the equation as 507x\u00b2 -7688x +28548 =0.\n\nLet me compute discriminant D = (7688)^2 -4*507*28548.\n\nThis is going to be a huge number, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up equations. Let me think if there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, since we know points A and P lie on line AD and on the circle, so AP is the distance from A to P. Since we have parametric equations for line AD, perhaps parameterize the line and find the two intersection points (A and P), then compute the distance between them.\n\nLet me try parameterizing the line AD.\n\nLet me set a parameter t such that when t=0, we are at point A, and t=1 is at point D, but since we need to go beyond D to P, perhaps another parameterization.\n\nAlternatively, let me parameterize from D. Let me let t be a parameter such that when t=0, we are at D, and as t increases, we move towards A and beyond to P.\n\nBut perhaps better to use a parameter s where the line is given by:\n\nx = x_D + s*(x_A - x_D)\n\ny = y_D + s*(y_A - y_D)\n\nThen, substituting into the circle equation, we can solve for s. Since point A corresponds to s=1 (since x_A = x_D + (x_A -x_D)*1, etc.), so s=1 is one solution (point A), and the other solution will correspond to point P (s=?).\n\nTherefore, solving for s, we can find the value corresponding to P and then compute the distance.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nLet me denote coordinates:\n\nPoint D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11 )\n\nPoint A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3 )\n\nVector from D to A:\n\n\u0394x =26/3 -9/2 = (52/6 -27/6)=25/6\n\n\u0394y=4\u221a14/3 - (-27\u221a14/11)=4\u221a14/3 +27\u221a14/11 =\u221a14*(4/3 +27/11)=\u221a14*( (44 +81)/33 )=\u221a14*(125/33 )\n\nTherefore, parametric equations:\n\nx = 9/2 + (25/6)s\n\ny= -27\u221a14/11 + (125\u221a14/33)s\n\nWe need to substitute these into the circle equation and solve for s.\n\nThe circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] y =0\n\nSubstituting x and y in terms of s:\n\nFirst, compute x\u00b2:\n\n[9/2 + (25/6)s]^2 = (9/2)^2 + 2*(9/2)*(25/6)s + (25/6 s)^2 = 81/4 + (450/12)s + (625/36)s\u00b2 = 81/4 + (37.5)s + (625/36)s\u00b2\n\nWait, better to keep fractions:\n\n81/4 + ( (9/2)*(25/3) ) s + (625/36)s\u00b2. Wait:\n\nWait, expanding (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2:\n\na=9/2, b=(25/6)s\n\nThus, x\u00b2 = (81/4) + 2*(9/2)*(25/6)s + (25/6 s)^2\n\nCompute 2*(9/2)*(25/6)s = (9)*(25/6)s = (225/6)s = 75/2 s\n\nThen (25/6 s)^2 = (625/36)s\u00b2\n\nSo x\u00b2 = 81/4 + (75/2)s + (625/36)s\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, compute y\u00b2:\n\ny = -27\u221a14/11 + (125\u221a14/33)s\n\nThus y\u00b2 = [ -27\u221a14/11 + (125\u221a14/33)s ]^2\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14/11:\n\n= [ \u221a14/11 ( -27 + (125/3)s ) ]^2 = (14/121)*( -27 + (125/3)s )^2\n\nExpand the square inside:\n\n(-27 + (125/3)s)^2 = (-27)^2 + 2*(-27)*(125/3)s + (125/3 s)^2 = 729 - (6750/3)s + (15625/9)s\u00b2 = 729 - 2250s + (15625/9)s\u00b2\n\nThus, y\u00b2 = (14/121)*(729 -2250s + (15625/9)s\u00b2 )\n\n= (14/121)*(729) - (14/121)*(2250)s + (14/121)*(15625/9)s\u00b2\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 14*729 /121 = 10206 /121\n\nSecond term: -14*2250 /121 s = -31500/121 s\n\nThird term: (14*15625)/(121*9) s\u00b2 = (218750)/1089 s\u00b2\n\nSo y\u00b2 = (10206/121) - (31500/121)s + (218750/1089)s\u00b2\n\nNext, compute the term -9x:\n\n-9*(9/2 + (25/6)s ) = -81/2 - (225/6)s = -81/2 - (75/2)s\n\nThen the term [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] y:\n\nFirst, compute y:\n\ny = -27\u221a14/11 + (125\u221a14/33)s\n\nMultiply by (-33\u221a14)/28:\n\n[ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] * [ -27\u221a14/11 + (125\u221a14/33)s ]\n\nFirst term: (-33\u221a14)/28 * (-27\u221a14)/11 = (33*27)/(28*11) * (\u221a14)^2\n\n\u221a14 squared is 14, so:\n\n= (33*27*14)/(28*11)\n\nSimplify:\n\n33/11=3,\n\n27 remains,\n\n14/28=1/2,\n\nThus: 3*27*(1/2) = (81)/2\n\nSecond term:\n\n[ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] * [125\u221a14/33 s ] = (-33/33)*(\u221a14*\u221a14)*(125)/(28) s = (-1)*(14)*(125/28)s = (-14*125)/(28) s = (-1750)/28 s = (-125/2)s\n\nTherefore, the term [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] y = 81/2 - (125/2)s\n\nPutting all together, the entire circle equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] y =0\n\nSubstituting all computed terms:\n\n[81/4 + (75/2)s + (625/36)s\u00b2] + [10206/121 - (31500/121)s + (218750/1089)s\u00b2] + [ -81/2 - (75/2)s ] + [81/2 - (125/2)s ] =0\n\nNow, let me combine all terms step by step.\n\nFirst, combine the constants:\n\n81/4 + 10206/121 -81/2 +81/2\n\nNotice -81/2 +81/2 cancels, so remaining constants: 81/4 +10206/121\n\nSecond, terms with s:\n\n(75/2)s - (31500/121)s - (75/2)s - (125/2)s\n\nThird, terms with s\u00b2:\n\n(625/36)s\u00b2 + (218750/1089)s\u00b2\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\n1.

Let me check discriminant:\n\nD = (2250)^2 -4*1521*729\n\nCalculate:\n\n2250\u00b2 = (2000+250)^2 = 2000\u00b2 +2*2000*250 +250\u00b2 =4,000,000 +1,000,000 +62,500 =5,062,500\n\n4*1521*729:\n\nFirst compute 1521*4=6084,\n\n6084*729.\n\nCompute 6084*700=4,258,800,\n\n6084*29= 6084*(30-1)=182,520 -6,084=176,436,\n\nTotal 4,258,800 +176,436 =4,435,236.\n\nThus D =5,062,500 -4,435,236 =627,264.\n\nSquare root of D: sqrt(627,264). Let me see:\n\n627,264 divided by 144: 627264 /144=4356. sqrt(4356)=66. So sqrt(627264)=66*12=792. Since 66*12=792, and 792\u00b2= (800-8)^2=640,000 -12,800 +64=627,264. Yes.\n\nThus sqrt(D)=792.\n\nTherefore, solutions:\n\ns = [2250 \u00b1792]/(2*1521)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n2250 +792=3042,\n\n2250 -792=1458.\n\nThus:\n\ns\u2081=3042/(2*1521)=3042/3042=1,\n\ns\u2082=1458/(2*1521)=1458/3042= simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 6:\n\n1458 \u00f76=243, 3042 \u00f76=507.\n\n243/507. Divide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n81/169.\n\nThus s=81/169.\n\nSince s=1 corresponds to point A (as we parameterized from D to A as s increasing from 0 to 1), the other solution s=81/169 corresponds to point P?\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the parametrization:\n\nWe had x =9/2 + (25/6)s,\n\ny= -27\u221a14/11 + (125\u221a14/33)s,\n\nwhere s=0 is D, s=1 is A. So to get the other intersection P, we need s beyond A? Wait, but the quadratic equation gave s=1 and s=81/169 \u22480.48, which is between 0 and1. That can\u2019t be, since P is another intersection point on the line beyond A from D. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in parametrization direction.\n\nWait, let me think. The parametrization was:\n\nx = x_D + s*(x_A - x_D),\n\ny = y_D + s*(y_A - y_D).\n\nTherefore, when s=0, we are at D; when s=1, we are at A. To go beyond A towards P, s needs to be greater than 1. But the solution s=81/169 \u22480.48 is between 0 and1, so that would be between D and A, but since A is already on the circle, perhaps the other intersection is in the other direction?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the parametrization. Let me confirm:\n\nThe line AD goes from D to A and then extends to P. Since A is on the circle, P is the other intersection, so it should be on the extension beyond A from D. Therefore, s should be greater than 1. But according to the quadratic solution, the two roots are s=1 and s=81/169\u22480.48. Hmm, that suggests that the line AD intersects the circle at A (s=1) and another point between D and A (s=0.48). That contradicts the problem statement which says that P is where AD intersects the circle again, so perhaps I made an error in parametrization.\n\nWait, let me check the quadratic equation again.\n\nWait, when I set up the parametrization, I think I might have an error in the parametrization direction.\n\nWait, in the parametrization:\n\nx = x_D + s*(x_A - x_D),\n\nso when s=0, it's D; when s=1, it's A. So the parameter s increases from D to A. To go beyond A, s would need to be greater than 1, but the quadratic equation gave s=1 and s=81/169. So the other intersection is between D and A. But the problem states that P is the other intersection point, so maybe in this case, since D is outside the circle, the line DA goes from D to A (on the circle), then exits the circle at another point P? Wait, no, A is already on the circle, so the line AD starts at D, goes through A (on the circle), and then exits the circle again on the other side? Wait, no, a line through a point on the circle will intersect the circle only at that point if it's tangent, otherwise it will have two points. Since D is outside, the line DA is not tangent (since it passes through A which is on the circle), so it should intersect the circle at A and another point P, which is on the extension beyond A from D. Wait, but according to the solution, the other intersection is at s=0.48, which is between D and A. That would mean that the line DA intersects the circle at two points: one is A (s=1), and another is between D and A (s=0.48). That would mean that the other intersection is between D and A, so P is between D and A. But according to the problem statement, P is where AD intersects the circle again, so perhaps that is indeed the case, and the problem just defines P as the other intersection, which is between D and A. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the drawing shows P on the other side? Let me check the Asymptote code:\n\nThe Asymptote code says:\n\ndraw(A..B..C..cycle, red+dotted); // the circumcircle\n\ndraw(B--D--C--D--A); // connects B to D, D to C, C to D, D to A\n\nP = IP(D..A, A..B..C); // intersection point of line DA with the circle (other than A)\n\nSo the intersection point P is along DA beyond A? Or between D and A?\n\nThe function IP in Asymptote usually takes two paths and finds their intersection. So \"D..A\" is the line from D to A, and \"A..B..C\" is the circumcircle. So the intersection other than A would be the other point, which could be on the extension beyond A. Wait, but according to our calculation, the other intersection is between D and A, which is conflicting with the Asymptote code's drawing?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made an error in calculation. Let me see:\n\nWait, when I solved for s, the quadratic equation gave s=1 and s=81/169\u22480.48. So the two points are at s=0.48 and s=1. So the other intersection is between D and A, meaning that P is between D and A. So AP would be the distance from A to P, which is in the direction towards D. But the problem says \"AP can be written as the form...\", so maybe that's okay.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again:\n\n\"Let AD intersect \u03c9 at P\". Since A is on \u03c9, then AD intersects \u03c9 at A and P, so P is the other intersection point. So depending on the position, it could be on either side. Given that D is outside, the line DA starts at D, goes through P (if P is between D and A) then reaches A, but since A is on the circle, the other intersection is between D and A. So that must be P.\n\nTherefore, P is between D and A. Therefore, AP is the distance from A to P, which would be the length from A backwards towards D, so AP = DA - DP ?\n\nWait, but in terms of the parameter s, when moving from D (s=0) to A (s=1), P is at s=81/169. So the distance from A to P would be the distance from s=1 to s=81/169, which is a distance of (1 - 81/169) along the line.\n\nWait, but distance isn't linear in s unless the parameter s is scaled by the length. Since our parametrization is linear in s, but the parameter s itself isn't the distance. So to find AP, we need to compute the distance between points A and P.\n\nFirst, let me find the coordinates of P.\n\nSince s=81/169:\n\nx coordinate: 9/2 + (25/6)*(81/169) = compute this:\n\nFirst term: 9/2,\n\nSecond term: (25/6)*(81/169) = (2025)/1014 = simplify numerator and denominator by 3: 675/338.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n25*81 =2025,\n\n6*169=1014,\n\nThus 2025/1014 = divide numerator and denominator by 3: 675/338.\n\nSo total x =9/2 +675/338.\n\nConvert 9/2 to 1521/338 (since 9/2 = (9*169)/338 = 1521/338),\n\nThus x=1521/338 +675/338 =2196/338 = divide numerator and denominator by 2: 1098/169 \u22486.485.\n\nSimilarly, y coordinate:\n\ny = -27\u221a14/11 + (125\u221a14/33)*(81/169)\n\nFirst term: -27\u221a14/11,\n\nSecond term: (125*81)/(33*169) \u221a14.\n\nCompute 125*81=10,125,\n\n33*169=5,577,\n\nSo second term: (10,125 /5,577) \u221a14.\n\nSimplify 10,125/5,577: divide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n10,125 \u00f73=3,375; 5,577 \u00f73=1,859.\n\nCheck if they can be divided further: 3,375 and 1,859.\n\n1,859 divided by 7: 7*265=1,855, so no. 1,859 \u00f713=143, 13*143=1,859? 13*140=1,820 +13*3=39 \u2192 1,859. Yes, 13*143=1,859. 3,375 \u00f713: 13*259=3,367, so remainder 8. So no. Thus, the fraction is 3375/1859.\n\nTherefore, second term is (3375/1859)\u221a14.\n\nThus total y coordinate:\n\n-27\u221a14/11 + (3375/1859)\u221a14.\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ -27/11 + 3375/1859 ]\n\nCompute the terms inside:\n\nFind a common denominator, which is 11\u00d71859=20,449.\n\n-27/11 = -27\u00d71859 /20,449,\n\n3375/1859 =3375\u00d711 /20,449,\n\nThus,\n\nTotal: [ -27\u00d71859 +3375\u00d711 ] /20,449\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nFirst term: -27\u00d71859:\n\n27\u00d71800=48,600,\n\n27\u00d759=1,593,\n\nTotal: - (48,600 +1,593)= -49, 193? Wait 48,600+1,593=49,193, so -49,193.\n\nSecond term:3375\u00d711=37,125\n\nTotal numerator: -49,193 +37,125 = -12,068.\n\nThus,\n\ny coordinate: \u221a14*(-12,068)/20,449.\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by GCD(12,068,20,449). Let me check if 12,068 divides into 20,449.\n\n20,449 \u00f712,068 \u22481.7. Let me compute 20,449 -12,068=8,381.\n\nThen GCD(12,068,8,381). 12,068 \u00f78,381=1 with remainder 3,687.\n\nGCD(8,381,3,687). 8,381 \u00f73,687=2 with remainder 107.\n\nGCD(3,687,107). 3,687 \u00f7107=34.46\u2026 Let's see 107\u00d734=3,638, remainder 49.\n\nGCD(107,49). 107 \u00f749=2 r 9.\n\nGCD(49,9)=1. So GCD is 1.\n\nThus the fraction can't be reduced, so y= -12,068\u221a14 /20,449.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, to compute AP, the distance between point A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3 ) and point P (2196/338, -12068\u221a14/20449).\n\nWait, this is going to be very messy. Maybe there's a better way using power of a point.\n\nWait, going back to the power of point D: DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWe can compute DA and DB, then solve for DP, then AP = DA - DP or something?\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nPower of D: DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWe need to find AP. Let me see:\n\nAP = |DP - DA| or something?\n\nWait, in terms of the points on the line:\n\nIf the points are ordered as D---P---A---(extension), but according to our previous calculation, P is between D and A. So the distance from D to P is DP, and from P to A is PA. So DA = DP + PA \u21d2 PA = DA - DP.\n\nTherefore, AP = DA - DP.\n\nBut according to the power of point formula: DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nLet me denote DA = t, then DP = t - AP.\n\nWait, but AP = DA - DP \u21d2 DP = DA - AP.\n\nWait, substituting into power of point:\n\nDA*(DA - AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nBut we need another equation to relate DA and AP.\n\nAlternatively, express AP in terms of DA and DP.\n\nAlternatively, since AP = DA - DP,\n\nthen DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nand AP = DA - DP \u21d2 DP = DA - AP,\n\nso DA*(DA - AP) = DB\u00b2,\n\nbut that leaves two variables DA and AP.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express AP as a fraction of DA.\n\nLet me suppose that AP = k * DA, so that P divides DA in the ratio DP:PA = (DA - AP):AP = (1 -k):k.\n\nThen, power of D gives DA * DP = DA*(DA - AP) = DA\u00b2(1 -k) = DB\u00b2.\n\nThus, DA\u00b2(1 -k) = DB\u00b2 \u21d2 1 -k = (DB/DA)^2 \u21d2 k =1 - (DB/DA)^2.\n\nTherefore, AP = k DA = DA - (DB)^2 / DA.\n\nTherefore, AP = (DA\u00b2 - DB\u00b2)/DA.\n\nThus, AP = DA - (DB\u00b2)/DA.\n\nBut then to compute AP, we need DA and DB.\n\nAlternatively, compute DA and DB using coordinates.\n\nWe have coordinates for D and A, so DA is the distance between D(9/2, -27\u221a14/11 ) and A(26/3, 4\u221a14/3 ).\n\nCompute \u0394x =26/3 -9/2 = (52/6 -27/6)=25/6,\n\n\u0394y =4\u221a14/3 - (-27\u221a14/11 ) =4\u221a14/3 +27\u221a14/11 =\u221a14*(4/3 +27/11)=\u221a14*( (44 +81)/33 )=\u221a14*(125/33 )\n\nThus DA = sqrt( (25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14/33)^2 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(25/6)^2 =625/36,\n\n(125\u221a14/33)^2 = (125\u00b2 *14)/33\u00b2 = (15,625 *14)/1,089 =218,750/1,089.\n\nTherefore DA squared is:\n\n625/36 +218,750/1,089.\n\nConvert to common denominator 36*1089=39,204.\n\n625/36 = (625*1089)/39,204,\n\n218,750/1089 = (218,750*36)/39,204.\n\nCompute numerators:\n\n625\u00d71089=680,625,\n\n218,750\u00d736=7,875,000,\n\nTotal numerator: 680,625 +7,875,000 =8,555,625.\n\nThus DA squared =8,555,625 /39,204.\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n8,555,625 \u00f73=2,851,875,\n\n39,204 \u00f73=13,068.\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n2,851,875 \u00f73=950,625,\n\n13,068 \u00f73=4,356.\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n950,625 \u00f73=316,875,\n\n4,356 \u00f73=1,452.\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n316,875 \u00f73=105,625,\n\n1,452 \u00f73=484.\n\nNow, 105,625 and 484:\n\n484=4\u00d7121,\n\n105,625: ends with 5, 105,625 \u00f725=4,225. 4,225= 65\u00b2, so 105,625=25\u00d765\u00b2=25\u00d74225=105,625.\n\nThus,\n\nDA\u00b2= (105,625)/(484)= (25\u00d74225)/484=25\u00d7(65\u00b2)/(22\u00b2).\n\nThus DA = sqrt(25\u00d7(65\u00b2)/(22\u00b2))= (5\u00d765)/22= 325/22.\n\nWait, that's a much simpler result! So DA squared is (325/22)^2 = (325)^2 / (22)^2. Let me verify:\n\n325 squared is 105,625, and 22 squared is 484, so yes, DA\u00b2=105,625/484, so DA=325/22.\n\nWow, that's a relief.\n\nSimilarly, compute DB.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nWe have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at points B and C intersect at point D. Then the line AD intersects the circle \u03c9 again at point P. We're given the sides AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length of AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then compute m + n.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some properties related to tangents and circles. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC, D is the exsimilicenter or the symmedian point? Wait, actually, the point where the two tangents meet is called the exsimilicenter of the circle with respect to B and C, but more importantly, in triangle geometry, this point D is known as the symmedian point? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, that makes D the pole of the side BC with respect to the circumcircle? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Wait, the pole of BC would be the point where the tangents at B and C meet? Wait, yes, actually, the polar of BC is the line through the tangents at B and C. So D is the pole of BC. But perhaps that's more projective geometry.\n\nAlternatively, in triangle ABC, the point where the two tangents at B and C meet is called the Bevan point? Or maybe not. Maybe it's simpler to just use power of a point here.\n\nPower of a point D with respect to \u03c9: since D lies on the tangents at B and C, the power of D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2. Because the tangent from D to \u03c9 has length squared equal to both DB and DC. Therefore, DB = DC. So D is equidistant from B and C, which makes sense since it's on both tangents.\n\nHmm, okay. So maybe we can use power of a point here. Let me think.\n\nWe need to find AP. Since AD is a line from A through D to P on the circumcircle, so AP is the length from A to P along that line. Since P is the second intersection point, AP is actually the length from A to P, which would be AD minus DP, but since they are on the same line, but I might need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use harmonic division or projective geometry concepts, but maybe inversion? Hmm, but maybe it's better to use power of a point.\n\nAlternatively, use coordinates or trigonometry. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem gives the sides of the triangle, maybe we can compute some lengths using the given sides.\n\nFirst, let me note that in triangle ABC, with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10, so perhaps first compute some angles or other elements like the circumradius?\n\nYes, maybe the circumradius R can be computed. Let's see.\n\nThe formula for the circumradius R of triangle ABC is given by R = (a)/(2 sin A), where a is the side opposite angle A. Alternatively, using the formula R = (a b c)/(4 area). Let me compute the area first.\n\nGiven sides a=BC=9, b=AC=10, c=AB=5. Wait, actually, in standard notation, a is BC, opposite angle A; b is AC opposite angle B; c is AB opposite angle C. Wait, actually, perhaps I should confirm.\n\nWait, in standard triangle notation, side a is opposite angle A, so in triangle ABC, side a is BC, side b is AC, and side c is AB. So:\n\na = BC = 9,\n\nb = AC = 10,\n\nc = AB = 5.\n\nTherefore, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (9 + 10 + 5)/2 = 24/2 = 12.\n\nThen area via Heron's formula: sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12 -9)(12 -10)(12 -5)] = sqrt[12*3*2*7] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] Wait, 12*3=36, 36*2=72, 72*7=504. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(16*31.5) Hmm, but 504 factors: 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but perhaps better as prime factors: 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, no, let's do prime factors:\n\n504 = 8*63 = 8*7*9 = 8*7*3^2. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(8*7*3^2) = 3*sqrt(56) = 3*sqrt(4*14) = 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14). Therefore the area is 6\u221a14.\n\nTherefore, area is 6\u221a14. Then the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4*area) = (9 * 10 * 5)/(4 * 6\u221a14) = (450)/(24\u221a14) = (75)/(4\u221a14). Rationalizing the denominator: (75\u221a14)/(4*14) = (75\u221a14)/56. Hmm, so R = (75\u221a14)/56. Hmm, that might come into play later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinates. Let me consider coordinate geometry.\n\nLet me place point C at the origin (0,0), point B somewhere on the x-axis, so let me set coordinates as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s set point C at (0, 0). Let me set point B at (9, 0), since BC = 9. Wait, but AC is 10, AB is 5. Wait, but then AC is from C(0,0) to A(x,y) with length 10, and AB is from A(x,y) to B(9,0) with length 5. Hmm, perhaps that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe coordinate system setup might complicate things. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, use power of point D with respect to the circle. Since D lies outside the circle, and the power of D is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DT\u00b2 where T is the point of tangency. Since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, so power of D is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = power w.r. to \u03c9.\n\nAlso, since AD passes through P, which is on the circumcircle, so AP * AD = power of A with respect to \u03c9? Wait, no. Wait, A is on the circle, so its power is zero. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since P is on the circumcircle and on line AD, so AP * AD' = something? Wait, perhaps use power of point D.\n\nPower of D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DP * DA. Because line DA passes through A and P, so DA is from D to A to P. Therefore, DP * DA = power of D, which is DB\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me recall the power of a point formula. If a line through D intersects the circle at X and Y, then DX * DY = power of D. Since D is outside, so if the line DA intersects the circle at A and P, then DA * DP = power of D. Wait, but actually, the power is equal to DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Wait, but which comes first? Let me check the exact formula.\n\nThe power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 (since DB is tangent). Also, the power is equal to DX * DY where DX and DY are the lengths from D to the two intersection points of line DP with the circle. Since line AD passes through D, A, and P, so the two intersection points are A and P. Therefore, DA * DP = power of D = DB\u00b2. Therefore, DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Therefore, if we can find DA and DP in terms of AP, maybe?\n\nWait, let me denote AP as x. Since AP is the segment from A to P, and AD is from A to D, so the total length from D to P would be DP = DA + AP? Wait, no, depends on the direction. Let me think.\n\nWait, points are in order: D is outside the circle, then the line DA goes from D through A to P. So the points are D---A---P on the line. Therefore, DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P, so DP = DA + AP. Wait, no, if D is outside, then going from D to A is towards the circle, then continuing to P, which is another intersection point. Wait, but since A is already on the circle, then P must be the other intersection, so actually, starting at D, going through A to P, so DA is from D to A, then AP is from A to P. Therefore, DP = DA + AP. Therefore, DA * DP = DA*(DA + AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nBut we need to find AP. Let me write variables:\n\nLet\u2019s denote DA = t, then DP = t + AP. So power of D gives t*(t + AP) = DB\u00b2. But we need another equation to relate these variables. Alternatively, perhaps express AP in terms of DA and DP?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use coordinates or trigonometry to find DB and DC, but since DB = DC, maybe we can compute DB?\n\nAlternatively, since we know the sides of triangle ABC, perhaps we can compute coordinates of points A, B, C, then find equations for the tangents at B and C, find their intersection D, then find equation of line AD, find its other intersection P with the circumcircle, then compute the distance from A to P.\n\nThis seems computational but doable. Let me try this approach.\n\nFirst, let me set coordinates.\n\nLet me place point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0), since BC =9. Let me let point A be at some coordinates (x,y). Then, AC =10, so distance from A to C(0,0) is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=10, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100.\n\nDistance from A(x,y) to B(9,0) is 5, so sqrt( (x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 ) =5, so (x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 =25.\n\nSo we can set up equations:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100,\n\n(x - 9)^2 + y\u00b2 =25.\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - [ (x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 ] =100 -25,\n\nx\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 -18x +81) =75,\n\nx\u00b2 -x\u00b2 +18x -81 =75,\n\n18x = 75 +81 = 156,\n\nx=156/18 = 26/3 \u2248 8.666...\n\nHmm, okay, so x coordinate of A is 26/3. Then y\u00b2 = 100 -x\u00b2 = 100 - (676/9) = (900 -676)/9 = 224/9, so y= \u00b1\u221a(224/9)= \u00b1(\u221a224)/3 = \u00b1(4\u221a14)/3. Since triangles are typically drawn in upper half-plane, let me take y positive. So coordinates of A are (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3).\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nC: (0,0)\n\nB: (9,0)\n\nA: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3)\n\nAlright, now we need to find the equations of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9. Since we have coordinates for A, B, C, we can find the equation of the circumcircle, then find the tangent lines at B and C.\n\nFirst, let me find the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9. Since three points are known, we can write the equation.\n\nLet me denote the general equation of a circle as: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nPlug in points A, B, C:\n\nFor point C(0,0):\n\n0 +0 +0 +0 + F =0 \u21d2 F=0.\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right? Wait, point C is (0,0), so plugging in gives 0 +0 + D*0 + E*0 + F =0 \u21d2 F=0.\n\nBut then point B(9,0):\n\n9\u00b2 +0\u00b2 + D*9 + E*0 +0 =0 \u21d2 81 +9D =0 \u21d2 9D = -81 \u21d2 D= -9.\n\nPoint A(26/3, 4\u221a14/3):\n\n( (26/3)^2 + (4\u221a14/3)^2 ) + D*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) + F =0.\n\nSince F=0, D=-9:\n\nCompute the terms:\n\nFirst, compute (26/3)^2: (676/9)\n\n(4\u221a14/3)^2: (16*14)/9 = 224/9\n\nSo sum of squares: (676 + 224)/9 = 900/9 = 100.\n\nThen, D*(26/3) = (-9)*(26/3) = -78.\n\nE*(4\u221a14/3) remains.\n\nSo altogether:\n\n100 -78 + (4\u221a14/3)*E =0 \u21d2 22 + (4\u221a14/3) E =0 \u21d2 (4\u221a14/3) E = -22 \u21d2 E = (-22 *3)/(4\u221a14) = (-66)/(4\u221a14) = (-33)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing the denominator:\n\nE = (-33)/(2\u221a14) * (\u221a14/\u221a14) = (-33\u221a14)/(28).\n\nTherefore, the equation of the circle is:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] y =0.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy, but okay. Alternatively, maybe it's better to write in standard form by completing the squares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute the tangent lines at B and C.\n\nAlternatively, the tangent at a point (x\u2080,y\u2080) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is given by:\n\nxx\u2080 + yy\u2080 + D(x + x\u2080)/2 + E(y + y\u2080)/2 + F =0. Wait, is that the formula?\n\nWait, the tangent line at point (x\u2080,y\u2080) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is:\n\nx x\u2080 + y y\u2080 + D(x + x\u2080)/2 + E(y + y\u2080)/2 + F =0. Let me verify this formula.\n\nAlternatively, the general tangent formula can be derived by using derivative, or using the fact that the tangent is perpendicular to the radius. Since the center of the circle is ( -D/2, -E/2 ), so the radius vector from center to point (x\u2080,y\u2080) is (x\u2080 + D/2, y\u2080 + E/2). The tangent line is perpendicular to this, so its equation can be written as (x\u2080 + D/2)(x - x\u2080) + (y\u2080 + E/2)(y - y\u2080)=0.\n\nExpanding that:\n\n(x\u2080 + D/2)(x - x\u2080) + (y\u2080 + E/2)(y - y\u2080) =0\n\nMultiply out:\n\nx\u2080 x - x\u2080\u00b2 + (D/2)x - (D/2)x\u2080 + y\u2080 y - y\u2080\u00b2 + (E/2)y - (E/2)y\u2080 =0\n\nRearranged:\n\nx\u2080 x + y\u2080 y + (D/2)x + (E/2)y - [x\u2080\u00b2 + (D/2)x\u2080 + y\u2080\u00b2 + (E/2)y\u2080] =0\n\nBut since (x\u2080,y\u2080) is on the circle, we have x\u2080\u00b2 + y\u2080\u00b2 + D x\u2080 + E y\u2080 + F =0 \u21d2 x\u2080\u00b2 + y\u2080\u00b2 = -Dx\u2080 - E y\u2080 -F. Substitute into the above:\n\nThe term in brackets becomes:\n\n[ -Dx\u2080 - E y\u2080 - F + (D/2)x\u2080 + (E/2)y\u2080 ] = [ - (D/2)x\u2080 - (E/2)y\u2080 - F ]\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\nx\u2080 x + y\u2080 y + (D/2)x + (E/2)y - [ - (D/2)x\u2080 - (E/2)y\u2080 - F ] =0\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe better to use another method.\n\nAlternatively, for the tangent at point B(9,0):\n\nThe tangent line at point B(9,0) on the circle. Let me use the formula for tangent line in terms of the circle equation.\n\nThe circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] y =0.\n\nWait, let me denote E as the coefficient for y, which is (-33\u221a14)/28.\n\nSo the tangent at point (x\u2080,y\u2080) is:\n\nx x\u2080 + y y\u2080 - (9/2)(x + x\u2080) + (E/2)(y + y\u2080) =0 ?\n\nWait, perhaps better to use derivative. Let me compute derivative at point B(9,0).\n\nDifferentiating implicitly:\n\n2x + 2y y\u2019 -9 + E y\u2019 =0.\n\nAt point (9,0):\n\n2*9 + 0 -9 + E y\u2019 =0 \u21d2 18 -9 + E y\u2019 =0 \u21d2 9 + E y\u2019 =0 \u21d2 y\u2019 = -9/E.\n\nWait, E is (-33\u221a14)/28, so substituting:\n\ny\u2019 = -9 / [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] = (9 *28)/(33\u221a14) = (252)/(33\u221a14) = (84)/(11\u221a14). Rationalize denominator:\n\n84/(11\u221a14) * \u221a14/\u221a14 = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (6\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the slope of tangent at B is (6\u221a14)/11. Wait, but the tangent line at B(9,0):\n\nThe slope is (6\u221a14)/11, so equation is y -0 = (6\u221a14)/11 (x -9).\n\nSimilarly, compute tangent at point C(0,0):\n\nWait, point C is (0,0). Let me compute the tangent at C.\n\nAgain, using derivative:\n\nAt point (0,0):\n\n2x + 2y y\u2019 -9 + E y\u2019 =0 \u21d2 0 +0 -9 + E y\u2019 =0 \u21d2 E y\u2019 =9 \u21d2 y\u2019 = 9/E.\n\nE is (-33\u221a14)/28, so y\u2019 =9 / [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] = 9*(-28)/(33\u221a14) = (-252)/(33\u221a14) = (-84)/(11\u221a14). Rationalize:\n\n-84/(11\u221a14) * \u221a14/\u221a14 = (-84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (-6\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C(0,0) has slope -6\u221a14/11. So equation is y -0 = (-6\u221a14)/11 (x -0), so y = (-6\u221a14)/11 x.\n\nTherefore, the two tangent lines are:\n\nAt B: y = (6\u221a14)/11 (x -9)\n\nAt C: y = (-6\u221a14)/11 x\n\nTheir intersection is point D. Let's find D by solving these two equations.\n\nSet the two equations equal:\n\n(6\u221a14)/11 (x -9) = (-6\u221a14)/11 x\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14) to eliminate coefficients:\n\n(x -9) = -x\n\nSo x -9 = -x \u21d2 2x =9 \u21d2 x= 9/2 =4.5\n\nThen substitute back to find y:\n\nUsing tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14)/11 * (9/2) = (-6\u221a14 *9)/(22) = (-54\u221a14)/22 = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nHmm, okay, so D is at (4.5, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nNow, we need to find the equation of line AD, which connects point A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3) and D (9/2, -27\u221a14/11). Let me compute the parametric equations or the slope.\n\nFirst, let me compute the coordinates numerically to see if that helps, but perhaps better to keep as fractions.\n\nCompute the coordinates:\n\nPoint A: (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3 )\n\nPoint D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11 )\n\nLet me find the vector from A to D:\n\n\u0394x = 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6)= (-25/6)\n\n\u0394y = (-27\u221a14/11 - 4\u221a14/3 ) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3 ) = \u221a14*(- (81 +44)/33 ) = \u221a14*(-125/33 )\n\nTherefore, the direction vector is (-25/6, -125\u221a14/33 )\n\nAlternatively, the slope m of AD is (\u0394y)/(\u0394x) = [ -125\u221a14/33 ] / [ -25/6 ] = (125\u221a14/33 ) / (25/6 ) = (125/25)*(6/33)*\u221a14 = 5*(2/11)*\u221a14 = (10/11)\u221a14.\n\nSo the slope is (10\u221a14)/11.\n\nThus, the equation of line AD can be written in point-slope form using point A:\n\ny - (4\u221a14/3) = (10\u221a14/11)(x - 26/3 )\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of this line with the circumcircle \u03c9. Since A is already on both the line and the circle, P is the other intersection.\n\nTo find P, we can solve the system of equations: the line AD and the circle equation.\n\nFirst, let me write the circle equation again. Earlier, we had:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] y =0\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to write it in standard form (center and radius). Let me compute that.\n\nThe general equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0, so here D = -9, E = (-33\u221a14)/28, F=0.\n\nThe center is at (-D/2, -E/2) = (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56 )\n\nRadius squared is (D/2)^2 + (E/2)^2 - F = (81/4) + ( (33\u221a14)/56 )\u00b2 -0.\n\nBut maybe solving the system is better.\n\nLet me denote the line equation as y = m(x - x_A) + y_A, where m is the slope, and (x_A,y_A) is point A.\n\nAlternatively, let me express y from the line equation and substitute into the circle equation.\n\nGiven the line equation:\n\ny = (10\u221a14/11)(x -26/3) + (4\u221a14)/3\n\nLet me write this as y = (10\u221a14/11)x - (10\u221a14/11)(26/3) + (4\u221a14)/3\n\nCompute the constants:\n\nFirst term: (10\u221a14/11)x\n\nSecond term: - (260\u221a14)/(33)\n\nThird term: + (44\u221a14)/33 (since 4/3 = 44/33?)\n\nWait, 4\u221a14/3 = (4\u221a14 *11)/33 = 44\u221a14/33. So yes.\n\nSo combining the constants:\n\n-260\u221a14/33 +44\u221a14/33 = (-216\u221a14)/33 = (-72\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the equation of line AD is:\n\ny = (10\u221a14/11)x - (72\u221a14)/11\n\nSo y = (10\u221a14 x -72\u221a14)/11 = \u221a14(10x -72)/11.\n\nTherefore, substitute this into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] y =0\n\nLet me substitute y:\n\nFirst, compute y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 = [ \u221a14(10x -72)/11 ]\u00b2 = 14*(10x -72)^2 / (121)\n\nThen, the term [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] y = [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] * [ \u221a14(10x -72)/11 ] = [ (-33\u221a14 * \u221a14)/ (28*11) ]*(10x -72 )\n\nSimplify \u221a14*\u221a14 =14, so:\n\n= [ (-33*14)/(28*11) ]*(10x -72 )\n\nSimplify coefficients:\n\n33 and 11: 33/11=3,\n\n14 and 28: 14/28=1/2,\n\nThus: [ (-3 * 1/2 ) ]*(10x -72 ) = (-3/2)(10x -72 )\n\nTherefore, putting all into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + [14*(10x -72)^2 / 121 ] -9x + [ (-3/2)(10x -72) ] =0\n\nThis seems very algebra-heavy. Let me see if I can handle this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write all terms:\n\n1. x\u00b2\n\n2. 14*(10x -72)^2 / 121\n\n3. -9x\n\n4. (-3/2)(10x -72)\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\nx\u00b2 + [14*(10x -72)^2]/121 -9x - (3/2)(10x -72) =0\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: x\u00b2\n\nSecond term: Let me expand (10x -72)^2:\n\n(10x)^2 - 2*10x*72 +72\u00b2 = 100x\u00b2 -1440x +5184\n\nMultiply by 14: 1400x\u00b2 -20160x +72576\n\nDivide by 121: (1400x\u00b2 -20160x +72576)/121\n\nThird term: -9x\n\nFourth term: - (3/2)(10x -72) = -15x +108\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nx\u00b2 + (1400x\u00b2 -20160x +72576)/121 -9x -15x +108 =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nFirst, let me combine the x terms: -9x -15x = -24x\n\nConstants: +108\n\nSo:\n\nx\u00b2 + (1400x\u00b2 -20160x +72576)/121 -24x +108 =0\n\nTo combine all terms over 121 denominator, let me multiply every term by 121 to eliminate denominators:\n\n121x\u00b2 +1400x\u00b2 -20160x +72576 -24x*121 +108*121 =0\n\nCompute each term:\n\n121x\u00b2 +1400x\u00b2 = 1521x\u00b2\n\n-20160x remains\n\n-24x*121 = -2904x\n\n72576 +108*121: compute 108*121. 100*121=12100, 8*121=968 \u21d2 total 12100+968=13068. So total constants:72576 +13068 = 85644\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n1521x\u00b2 + (-20160x -2904x) +85644 =0\n\nCombine x terms:\n\n-20160 -2904 = -23064\n\nThus:\n\n1521x\u00b2 -23064x +85644 =0\n\nLet me divide all terms by GCD of coefficients. Let's see, 1521, 23064,85644.\n\n1521 is 39\u00b2 (since 39\u00b2=1521). Let me check GCD:\n\n23064 \u00f7 39: 23064 /39 = 23064 \u00f7 39: 39*591=23049, so 23064-23049=15 \u21d2 23064=39*591 +15 \u21d2 remainder 15.\n\nHmm, so GCD(1521,23064)= GCD(1521,15). 1521 \u00f715=101.4 \u21d2 15*101=1515, remainder 6. Then GCD(15,6)=3.\n\nThus GCD is 3. Let me divide equation by 3:\n\n1521/3=507, 23064/3=7688, 85644/3=28548.\n\nThus equation becomes:\n\n507x\u00b2 -7688x +28548 =0\n\nHmm, still not very nice. Maybe I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in expanding terms. Let me check the constants again:\n\nOriginal equation after multiplying by 121:\n\n121x\u00b2 + (1400x\u00b2 -20160x +72576) -24x*121 +108*121 =0\n\nWait, the 121x\u00b2 comes from multiplying the first term x\u00b2 by 121. The second term is 1400x\u00b2 -20160x +72576. Then the third term is -24x*121, and the last term is 108*121.\n\nSo 121x\u00b2 +1400x\u00b2 = (121+1400)x\u00b2 = 1521x\u00b2. That's correct.\n\nThen for the x terms:\n\n-20160x (from the second term) plus -24x*121.\n\n-24x*121 is indeed -2904x. So total x terms: -20160x -2904x = -23064x. Correct.\n\nConstants: 72576 (from second term) +108*121. Let me recalculate 108*121:\n\n121*100=12100, 121*8=968, so 12100+968=13068. Then 72576 +13068:\n\n72576 +13000=85576, plus 68 gives 85644. Correct.\n\nSo equation is indeed 1521x\u00b2 -23064x +85644 =0. Divided by 3: 507x\u00b2 -7688x +28548=0.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor out 507? 507= 3\u00d713\u00b2. Not sure. Alternatively, use quadratic formula.\n\nLet me write the equation as 507x\u00b2 -7688x +28548 =0.\n\nLet me compute discriminant D = (7688)^2 -4*507*28548.\n\nThis is going to be a huge number, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up equations. Let me think if there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, since we know points A and P lie on line AD and on the circle, so AP is the distance from A to P. Since we have parametric equations for line AD, perhaps parameterize the line and find the two intersection points (A and P), then compute the distance between them.\n\nLet me try parameterizing the line AD.\n\nLet me set a parameter t such that when t=0, we are at point A, and t=1 is at point D, but since we need to go beyond D to P, perhaps another parameterization.\n\nAlternatively, let me parameterize from D. Let me let t be a parameter such that when t=0, we are at D, and as t increases, we move towards A and beyond to P.\n\nBut perhaps better to use a parameter s where the line is given by:\n\nx = x_D + s*(x_A - x_D)\n\ny = y_D + s*(y_A - y_D)\n\nThen, substituting into the circle equation, we can solve for s. Since point A corresponds to s=1 (since x_A = x_D + (x_A -x_D)*1, etc.), so s=1 is one solution (point A), and the other solution will correspond to point P (s=?).\n\nTherefore, solving for s, we can find the value corresponding to P and then compute the distance.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nLet me denote coordinates:\n\nPoint D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11 )\n\nPoint A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3 )\n\nVector from D to A:\n\n\u0394x =26/3 -9/2 = (52/6 -27/6)=25/6\n\n\u0394y=4\u221a14/3 - (-27\u221a14/11)=4\u221a14/3 +27\u221a14/11 =\u221a14*(4/3 +27/11)=\u221a14*( (44 +81)/33 )=\u221a14*(125/33 )\n\nTherefore, parametric equations:\n\nx = 9/2 + (25/6)s\n\ny= -27\u221a14/11 + (125\u221a14/33)s\n\nWe need to substitute these into the circle equation and solve for s.\n\nThe circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] y =0\n\nSubstituting x and y in terms of s:\n\nFirst, compute x\u00b2:\n\n[9/2 + (25/6)s]^2 = (9/2)^2 + 2*(9/2)*(25/6)s + (25/6 s)^2 = 81/4 + (450/12)s + (625/36)s\u00b2 = 81/4 + (37.5)s + (625/36)s\u00b2\n\nWait, better to keep fractions:\n\n81/4 + ( (9/2)*(25/3) ) s + (625/36)s\u00b2. Wait:\n\nWait, expanding (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2:\n\na=9/2, b=(25/6)s\n\nThus, x\u00b2 = (81/4) + 2*(9/2)*(25/6)s + (25/6 s)^2\n\nCompute 2*(9/2)*(25/6)s = (9)*(25/6)s = (225/6)s = 75/2 s\n\nThen (25/6 s)^2 = (625/36)s\u00b2\n\nSo x\u00b2 = 81/4 + (75/2)s + (625/36)s\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, compute y\u00b2:\n\ny = -27\u221a14/11 + (125\u221a14/33)s\n\nThus y\u00b2 = [ -27\u221a14/11 + (125\u221a14/33)s ]^2\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14/11:\n\n= [ \u221a14/11 ( -27 + (125/3)s ) ]^2 = (14/121)*( -27 + (125/3)s )^2\n\nExpand the square inside:\n\n(-27 + (125/3)s)^2 = (-27)^2 + 2*(-27)*(125/3)s + (125/3 s)^2 = 729 - (6750/3)s + (15625/9)s\u00b2 = 729 - 2250s + (15625/9)s\u00b2\n\nThus, y\u00b2 = (14/121)*(729 -2250s + (15625/9)s\u00b2 )\n\n= (14/121)*(729) - (14/121)*(2250)s + (14/121)*(15625/9)s\u00b2\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 14*729 /121 = 10206 /121\n\nSecond term: -14*2250 /121 s = -31500/121 s\n\nThird term: (14*15625)/(121*9) s\u00b2 = (218750)/1089 s\u00b2\n\nSo y\u00b2 = (10206/121) - (31500/121)s + (218750/1089)s\u00b2\n\nNext, compute the term -9x:\n\n-9*(9/2 + (25/6)s ) = -81/2 - (225/6)s = -81/2 - (75/2)s\n\nThen the term [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] y:\n\nFirst, compute y:\n\ny = -27\u221a14/11 + (125\u221a14/33)s\n\nMultiply by (-33\u221a14)/28:\n\n[ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] * [ -27\u221a14/11 + (125\u221a14/33)s ]\n\nFirst term: (-33\u221a14)/28 * (-27\u221a14)/11 = (33*27)/(28*11) * (\u221a14)^2\n\n\u221a14 squared is 14, so:\n\n= (33*27*14)/(28*11)\n\nSimplify:\n\n33/11=3,\n\n27 remains,\n\n14/28=1/2,\n\nThus: 3*27*(1/2) = (81)/2\n\nSecond term:\n\n[ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] * [125\u221a14/33 s ] = (-33/33)*(\u221a14*\u221a14)*(125)/(28) s = (-1)*(14)*(125/28)s = (-14*125)/(28) s = (-1750)/28 s = (-125/2)s\n\nTherefore, the term [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] y = 81/2 - (125/2)s\n\nPutting all together, the entire circle equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + [ (-33\u221a14)/28 ] y =0\n\nSubstituting all computed terms:\n\n[81/4 + (75/2)s + (625/36)s\u00b2] + [10206/121 - (31500/121)s + (218750/1089)s\u00b2] + [ -81/2 - (75/2)s ] + [81/2 - (125/2)s ] =0\n\nNow, let me combine all terms step by step.\n\nFirst, combine the constants:\n\n81/4 + 10206/121 -81/2 +81/2\n\nNotice -81/2 +81/2 cancels, so remaining constants: 81/4 +10206/121\n\nSecond, terms with s:\n\n(75/2)s - (31500/121)s - (75/2)s - (125/2)s\n\nThird, terms with s\u00b2:\n\n(625/36)s\u00b2 + (218750/1089)s\u00b2\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\n1.

Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me just keep as fractions for now.\n\nPutting all together, the equation is:\n\n50625/484 + (-78125/242)s + (8,555,625/39,204)s\u00b2 =0\n\nMultiply all terms by 39,204 to eliminate denominators:\n\n39,204*(50625/484) + 39,204*(-78125/242)s +8,555,625 s\u00b2 =0\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term:\n\n39,204 /484 = 39204 \u00f7484: Let's divide numerator and denominator by 4: 9801/121 = 81, since 121\u00d781=9801. So 39204/484=81.\n\nThus first term: 81 \u00d750,625 = 81*50,625.\n\nCompute 50,625 \u00d780 =4,050,000, plus 50,625\u00d71=50,625 \u2192 total 4,100,625.\n\nSecond term:\n\n39,204 /242 = 39,204 \u00f7242. Let's see 242\u00d7162=242*(160+2)=38,720 +484=39,204. So 39,204/242=162.\n\nThus second term: 162*(-78,125)s = -162\u00d778,125 s.\n\nCompute 162\u00d778,125:\n\nFirst compute 162\u00d778,125 = 162\u00d7(70,000 +8,125)=162\u00d770,000 +162\u00d78,125\n\n162\u00d770,000 = 11,340,000\n\n162\u00d78,125: 162\u00d78,000=1,296,000; 162\u00d7125=20,250 \u2192 total 1,296,000 +20,250=1,316,250\n\nTotal: 11,340,000 +1,316,250 =12,656,250\n\nThus second term: -12,656,250 s\n\nThird term: 8,555,625 s\u00b2\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n4,100,625 -12,656,250 s +8,555,625 s\u00b2 =0\n\nDivide all terms by 75 to simplify:\n\n4,100,625 \u00f775=54,675,\n\n12,656,250 \u00f775=168,750,\n\n8,555,625 \u00f775=114,075.\n\nThus:\n\n54,675 -168,750 s +114,075 s\u00b2 =0\n\nDivide by 75 again:\n\n54,675/75=729,\n\n168,750/75=2,250,\n\n114,075/75=1,521.\n\nThus:\n\n729 -2,250 s +1,521 s\u00b2 =0\n\nRearranged:\n\n1521 s\u00b2 -2250 s +729 =0\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic equation. Let me check discriminant:\n\nD = (2250)^2 -4*1521*729\n\nCalculate:\n\n2250\u00b2 = (2000+250)^2 = 2000\u00b2 +2*2000*250 +250\u00b2 =4,000,000 +1,000,000 +62,500 =5,062,500\n\n4*1521*729:\n\nFirst compute 1521*4=6084,\n\n6084*729.\n\nCompute 6084*700=4,258,800,\n\n6084*29= 6084*(30-1)=182,520 -6,084=176,436,\n\nTotal 4,258,800 +176,436 =4,435,236.\n\nThus D =5,062,500 -4,435,236 =627,264.\n\nSquare root of D: sqrt(627,264). Let me see:\n\n627,264 divided by 144: 627264 /144=4356. sqrt(4356)=66. So sqrt(627264)=66*12=792. Since 66*12=792, and 792\u00b2= (800-8)^2=640,000 -12,800 +64=627,264. Yes.\n\nThus sqrt(D)=792.\n\nTherefore, solutions:\n\ns = [2250 \u00b1792]/(2*1521)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n2250 +792=3042,\n\n2250 -792=1458.\n\nThus:\n\ns\u2081=3042/(2*1521)=3042/3042=1,\n\ns\u2082=1458/(2*1521)=1458/3042= simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 6:\n\n1458 \u00f76=243, 3042 \u00f76=507.\n\n243/507. Divide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n81/169.\n\nThus s=81/169.\n\nSince s=1 corresponds to point A (as we parameterized from D to A as s increasing from 0 to 1), the other solution s=81/169 corresponds to point P?\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the parametrization:\n\nWe had x =9/2 + (25/6)s,\n\ny= -27\u221a14/11 + (125\u221a14/33)s,\n\nwhere s=0 is D, s=1 is A. So to get the other intersection P, we need s beyond A? Wait, but the quadratic equation gave s=1 and s=81/169 \u22480.48, which is between 0 and1. That can\u2019t be, since P is another intersection point on the line beyond A from D. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in parametrization direction.\n\nWait, let me think. The parametrization was:\n\nx = x_D + s*(x_A - x_D),\n\ny = y_D + s*(y_A - y_D).\n\nTherefore, when s=0, we are at D; when s=1, we are at A. To go beyond A towards P, s needs to be greater than 1. But the solution s=81/169 \u22480.48 is between 0 and1, so that would be between D and A, but since A is already on the circle, perhaps the other intersection is in the other direction?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the parametrization. Let me confirm:\n\nThe line AD goes from D to A and then extends to P. Since A is on the circle, P is the other intersection, so it should be on the extension beyond A from D. Therefore, s should be greater than 1. But according to the quadratic solution, the two roots are s=1 and s=81/169\u22480.48. Hmm, that suggests that the line AD intersects the circle at A (s=1) and another point between D and A (s=0.48). That contradicts the problem statement which says that P is where AD intersects the circle again, so perhaps I made an error in parametrization.\n\nWait, let me check the quadratic equation again.\n\nWait, when I set up the parametrization, I think I might have an error in the parametrization direction.\n\nWait, in the parametrization:\n\nx = x_D + s*(x_A - x_D),\n\nso when s=0, it's D; when s=1, it's A. So the parameter s increases from D to A. To go beyond A, s would need to be greater than 1, but the quadratic equation gave s=1 and s=81/169. So the other intersection is between D and A. But the problem states that P is the other intersection point, so maybe in this case, since D is outside the circle, the line DA goes from D to A (on the circle), then exits the circle at another point P? Wait, no, A is already on the circle, so the line AD starts at D, goes through A (on the circle), and then exits the circle again on the other side? Wait, no, a line through a point on the circle will intersect the circle only at that point if it's tangent, otherwise it will have two points. Since D is outside, the line DA is not tangent (since it passes through A which is on the circle), so it should intersect the circle at A and another point P, which is on the extension beyond A from D. Wait, but according to the solution, the other intersection is at s=0.48, which is between D and A. That would mean that the line DA intersects the circle at two points: one is A (s=1), and another is between D and A (s=0.48). That would mean that the other intersection is between D and A, so P is between D and A. But according to the problem statement, P is where AD intersects the circle again, so perhaps that is indeed the case, and the problem just defines P as the other intersection, which is between D and A. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the drawing shows P on the other side? Let me check the Asymptote code:\n\nThe Asymptote code says:\n\ndraw(A..B..C..cycle, red+dotted); // the circumcircle\n\ndraw(B--D--C--D--A); // connects B to D, D to C, C to D, D to A\n\nP = IP(D..A, A..B..C); // intersection point of line DA with the circle (other than A)\n\nSo the intersection point P is along DA beyond A? Or between D and A?\n\nThe function IP in Asymptote usually takes two paths and finds their intersection. So \"D..A\" is the line from D to A, and \"A..B..C\" is the circumcircle. So the intersection other than A would be the other point, which could be on the extension beyond A. Wait, but according to our calculation, the other intersection is between D and A, which is conflicting with the Asymptote code's drawing?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made an error in calculation. Let me see:\n\nWait, when I solved for s, the quadratic equation gave s=1 and s=81/169\u22480.48. So the two points are at s=0.48 and s=1. So the other intersection is between D and A, meaning that P is between D and A. So AP would be the distance from A to P, which is in the direction towards D. But the problem says \"AP can be written as the form...\", so maybe that's okay.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again:\n\n\"Let AD intersect \u03c9 at P\". Since A is on \u03c9, then AD intersects \u03c9 at A and P, so P is the other intersection point. So depending on the position, it could be on either side. Given that D is outside, the line DA starts at D, goes through P (if P is between D and A) then reaches A, but since A is on the circle, the other intersection is between D and A. So that must be P.\n\nTherefore, P is between D and A. Therefore, AP is the distance from A to P, which would be the length from A backwards towards D, so AP = DA - DP ?\n\nWait, but in terms of the parameter s, when moving from D (s=0) to A (s=1), P is at s=81/169. So the distance from A to P would be the distance from s=1 to s=81/169, which is a distance of (1 - 81/169) along the line.\n\nWait, but distance isn't linear in s unless the parameter s is scaled by the length. Since our parametrization is linear in s, but the parameter s itself isn't the distance. So to find AP, we need to compute the distance between points A and P.\n\nFirst, let me find the coordinates of P.\n\nSince s=81/169:\n\nx coordinate: 9/2 + (25/6)*(81/169) = compute this:\n\nFirst term: 9/2,\n\nSecond term: (25/6)*(81/169) = (2025)/1014 = simplify numerator and denominator by 3: 675/338.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n25*81 =2025,\n\n6*169=1014,\n\nThus 2025/1014 = divide numerator and denominator by 3: 675/338.\n\nSo total x =9/2 +675/338.\n\nConvert 9/2 to 1521/338 (since 9/2 = (9*169)/338 = 1521/338),\n\nThus x=1521/338 +675/338 =2196/338 = divide numerator and denominator by 2: 1098/169 \u22486.485.\n\nSimilarly, y coordinate:\n\ny = -27\u221a14/11 + (125\u221a14/33)*(81/169)\n\nFirst term: -27\u221a14/11,\n\nSecond term: (125*81)/(33*169) \u221a14.\n\nCompute 125*81=10,125,\n\n33*169=5,577,\n\nSo second term: (10,125 /5,577) \u221a14.\n\nSimplify 10,125/5,577: divide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n10,125 \u00f73=3,375; 5,577 \u00f73=1,859.\n\nCheck if they can be divided further: 3,375 and 1,859.\n\n1,859 divided by 7: 7*265=1,855, so no. 1,859 \u00f713=143, 13*143=1,859? 13*140=1,820 +13*3=39 \u2192 1,859. Yes, 13*143=1,859. 3,375 \u00f713: 13*259=3,367, so remainder 8. So no. Thus, the fraction is 3375/1859.\n\nTherefore, second term is (3375/1859)\u221a14.\n\nThus total y coordinate:\n\n-27\u221a14/11 + (3375/1859)\u221a14.\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ -27/11 + 3375/1859 ]\n\nCompute the terms inside:\n\nFind a common denominator, which is 11\u00d71859=20,449.\n\n-27/11 = -27\u00d71859 /20,449,\n\n3375/1859 =3375\u00d711 /20,449,\n\nThus,\n\nTotal: [ -27\u00d71859 +3375\u00d711 ] /20,449\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nFirst term: -27\u00d71859:\n\n27\u00d71800=48,600,\n\n27\u00d759=1,593,\n\nTotal: - (48,600 +1,593)= -49, 193? Wait 48,600+1,593=49,193, so -49,193.\n\nSecond term:3375\u00d711=37,125\n\nTotal numerator: -49,193 +37,125 = -12,068.\n\nThus,\n\ny coordinate: \u221a14*(-12,068)/20,449.\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by GCD(12,068,20,449). Let me check if 12,068 divides into 20,449.\n\n20,449 \u00f712,068 \u22481.7. Let me compute 20,449 -12,068=8,381.\n\nThen GCD(12,068,8,381). 12,068 \u00f78,381=1 with remainder 3,687.\n\nGCD(8,381,3,687). 8,381 \u00f73,687=2 with remainder 107.\n\nGCD(3,687,107). 3,687 \u00f7107=34.46\u2026 Let's see 107\u00d734=3,638, remainder 49.\n\nGCD(107,49). 107 \u00f749=2 r 9.\n\nGCD(49,9)=1. So GCD is 1.\n\nThus the fraction can't be reduced, so y= -12,068\u221a14 /20,449.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, to compute AP, the distance between point A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3 ) and point P (2196/338, -12068\u221a14/20449).\n\nWait, this is going to be very messy. Maybe there's a better way using power of a point.\n\nWait, going back to the power of point D: DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWe can compute DA and DB, then solve for DP, then AP = DA - DP or something?\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nPower of D: DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWe need to find AP. Let me see:\n\nAP = |DP - DA| or something?\n\nWait, in terms of the points on the line:\n\nIf the points are ordered as D---P---A---(extension), but according to our previous calculation, P is between D and A. So the distance from D to P is DP, and from P to A is PA. So DA = DP + PA \u21d2 PA = DA - DP.\n\nTherefore, AP = DA - DP.\n\nBut according to the power of point formula: DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nLet me denote DA = t, then DP = t - AP.\n\nWait, but AP = DA - DP \u21d2 DP = DA - AP.\n\nWait, substituting into power of point:\n\nDA*(DA - AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nBut we need another equation to relate DA and AP.\n\nAlternatively, express AP in terms of DA and DP.\n\nAlternatively, since AP = DA - DP,\n\nthen DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nand AP = DA - DP \u21d2 DP = DA - AP,\n\nso DA*(DA - AP) = DB\u00b2,\n\nbut that leaves two variables DA and AP.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express AP as a fraction of DA.\n\nLet me suppose that AP = k * DA, so that P divides DA in the ratio DP:PA = (DA - AP):AP = (1 -k):k.\n\nThen, power of D gives DA * DP = DA*(DA - AP) = DA\u00b2(1 -k) = DB\u00b2.\n\nThus, DA\u00b2(1 -k) = DB\u00b2 \u21d2 1 -k = (DB/DA)^2 \u21d2 k =1 - (DB/DA)^2.\n\nTherefore, AP = k DA = DA - (DB)^2 / DA.\n\nTherefore, AP = (DA\u00b2 - DB\u00b2)/DA.\n\nThus, AP = DA - (DB\u00b2)/DA.\n\nBut then to compute AP, we need DA and DB.\n\nAlternatively, compute DA and DB using coordinates.\n\nWe have coordinates for D and A, so DA is the distance between D(9/2, -27\u221a14/11 ) and A(26/3, 4\u221a14/3 ).\n\nCompute \u0394x =26/3 -9/2 = (52/6 -27/6)=25/6,\n\n\u0394y =4\u221a14/3 - (-27\u221a14/11 ) =4\u221a14/3 +27\u221a14/11 =\u221a14*(4/3 +27/11)=\u221a14*( (44 +81)/33 )=\u221a14*(125/33 )\n\nThus DA = sqrt( (25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14/33)^2 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(25/6)^2 =625/36,\n\n(125\u221a14/33)^2 = (125\u00b2 *14)/33\u00b2 = (15,625 *14)/1,089 =218,750/1,089.\n\nTherefore DA squared is:\n\n625/36 +218,750/1,089.\n\nConvert to common denominator 36*1089=39,204.\n\n625/36 = (625*1089)/39,204,\n\n218,750/1089 = (218,750*36)/39,204.\n\nCompute numerators:\n\n625\u00d71089=680,625,\n\n218,750\u00d736=7,875,000,\n\nTotal numerator: 680,625 +7,875,000 =8,555,625.\n\nThus DA squared =8,555,625 /39,204.\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n8,555,625 \u00f73=2,851,875,\n\n39,204 \u00f73=13,068.\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n2,851,875 \u00f73=950,625,\n\n13,068 \u00f73=4,356.\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n950,625 \u00f73=316,875,\n\n4,356 \u00f73=1,452.\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n316,875 \u00f73=105,625,\n\n1,452 \u00f73=484.\n\nNow, 105,625 and 484:\n\n484=4\u00d7121,\n\n105,625: ends with 5, 105,625 \u00f725=4,225. 4,225= 65\u00b2, so 105,625=25\u00d765\u00b2=25\u00d74225=105,625.\n\nThus,\n\nDA\u00b2= (105,625)/(484)= (25\u00d74225)/484=25\u00d7(65\u00b2)/(22\u00b2).\n\nThus DA = sqrt(25\u00d7(65\u00b2)/(22\u00b2))= (5\u00d765)/22= 325/22.\n\nWait, that's a much simpler result! So DA squared is (325/22)^2 = (325)^2 / (22)^2. Let me verify:\n\n325 squared is 105,625, and 22 squared is 484, so yes, DA\u00b2=105,625/484, so DA=325/22.\n\nWow, that's a relief.\n\nSimilarly, compute DB. Since D is at (9/2, -27\u221a14/11 ) and B is at (9,0).\n\nCompute \u0394x =9 -9/2 =9/2,\n\n\u0394y=0 - (-27\u221a14/11 )=27\u221a14/11.\n\nThus DB squared is (9/2)^2 + (27\u221a14/11)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(9/2)^2=81/4,\n\n(27\u221a14/11)^2= (27\u00b2\u00d714)/121 = (729\u00d714)/121 =10,206/121.\n\nThus DB squared is 81/4 +10,206/121.\n\nCommon denominator 4\u00d7121=484.\n\n81/4 = (81\u00d7121)/484 =9,801/484,\n\n10,206/121 = (10,206\u00d74)/484=40,824/484.\n\nTotal: (9,801 +40,824)/484 =50,625/484.\n\nThus DB squared is 50,625/484, so DB= sqrt(50,625/484)=225/22.\n\nTherefore, DB=225/22.\n\nNow, using power of point D: DA * DP = DB\u00b2 \u21d2 (325/22)*DP = (225/22)^2 \u21d2 DP = (225\u00b2 /22\u00b2 ) / (325/22 ) = (225\u00b2)/(22\u00b2 *325/22 ) = (225\u00b2)/(22*325).\n\nSimplify:\n\n225\u00b2 =50,625,\n\n22*325=7,150,\n\nThus DP=50,625 /7,150.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 25:\n\n50,625 \u00f725=2,025,\n\n7,150 \u00f725=286,\n\nThus DP=2,025/286.\n\nCheck if reducible:\n\n2,025 and 286.\n\n286=2\u00d711\u00d713,\n\n2,025=25\u00d781=25\u00d79\u00d79.\n\nNo common factors, so DP=2025/286.\n\nNow, AP=DA - DP = (325/22) - (2025/286).\n\nConvert to common denominator 286 (22\u00d713=286):\n\n325/22 = (325\u00d713)/286=4,225/286,\n\n2025/286 remains.\n\nThus AP= (4,225 -2,025)/286 =2,200/286.\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2:1,100/143.\n\nCheck if reducible: 143=11\u00d713,\n\n1,100 divided by 11=100,\n\n143 divided by 11=13.\n\nThus 1,100/143 = (100\u00d711)/(13\u00d711)=100/13.\n\nWait, yes! 1,100 \u00f711=100, 143 \u00f711=13. So yes, 1,100/143=100/13.\n\nTherefore AP=100/13.\n\nThus m=100, n=13, which are coprime. Therefore m +n=113.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{113}\n\n\nGiven triangle \\(ABC\\) inscribed in circle \\(\\omega\\) with \\(AB = 5\\), \\(BC = 9\\), and \\(AC = 10\\), we need to find the length of \\(AP\\) where \\(P\\) is the second intersection of line \\(AD\\) with \\(\\omega\\), and \\(D\\) is the intersection of the tangents to \\(\\omega\\) at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\).\n\n1. **Coordinates and Circle Equation**:\n   - Place \\(C\\) at \\((0, 0)\\), \\(B\\) at \\((9, 0)\\), and find coordinates of \\(A\\) using the given side lengths.\n   - Solve for \\(A\\) using the distance formula: \\(A\\) is found to be \\(\\left(\\frac{26}{3}, \\frac{4\\sqrt{14}}{3}\\right)\\).\n\n2. **Tangents at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\)**:\n   - Calculate the equations of the tangents at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) using derivatives and power of a point.\n   - Find the intersection \\(D\\) of these tangents: \\(D\\) is \\(\\left(\\frac{9}{2}, -\\frac{27\\sqrt{14}}{11}\\right)\\).\n\n3. **Power of Point \\(D\\)**:\n   - Use the power of point \\(D\\) with respect to \\(\\omega\\): \\(DB^2 = DC^2 = \\text{power of } D\\).\n   - Calculate \\(DB\\) and \\(DA\\):\n     - \\(DB = \\frac{225}{22}\\)\n     - \\(DA = \\frac{325}{22}\\)\n\n4. **Using Power of a Point**:\n   - Apply the power of point \\(D\\): \\(DA \\cdot DP = DB^2\\).\n   - Solve for \\(DP\\): \\(DP = \\frac{DB^2}{DA} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{225}{22}\\right)^2}{\\frac{325}{22}} = \\frac{2025}{286}\\).\n\n5. **Calculate \\(AP\\)**:\n   - \\(AP = DA - DP = \\frac{325}{22} - \\frac{2025}{286} = \\frac{100}{13}\\).\n\n6. **Result**:\n   - \\(AP = \\frac{100}{13}\\), so \\(m = 100\\) and \\(n = 13\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again carefully. It says:\n\nLet triangle ABC be inscribed in circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at B and C intersect at point D. Then line AD intersects \u03c9 again at P. We\u2019re given the sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find AP in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then compute m + n.\n\nHmm. Alright, so first, I need to recall some geometry concepts here. The problem involves a triangle inscribed in a circle, tangents from a point to a circle, and the intersection of a line with the circle again. Maybe some properties related to power of a point, cyclic quadrilaterals, or similar triangles?\n\nLet me start by drawing a rough sketch in my mind. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circle \u03c9 is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. So D is the exsymmedian point? Or maybe related to the symmedian? Wait, tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length, so DB = DC? Wait no, the tangent from D to B and C, but since D is the intersection of the two tangents, yes, DB and DC should both be tangent to the circle, so DB = DC. Wait, but tangents from a single point to a circle are equal, so yes, DB = DC.\n\nTherefore, D is equidistant from B and C along the tangents. So triangle DBC is isoceles? Wait, but BC is 9. Hmm, but maybe that's not directly important yet.\n\nWe need to find AP where P is the second intersection of AD with the circumcircle. So AD is a secant line from A through D, intersecting the circle again at P. So perhaps using power of a point D with respect to the circle?\n\nPower of a point D: the power with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 (since DB is tangent to \u03c9 at B), which is also DC\u00b2. So Power of D is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP, since AD is a secant line. So DA * DP = DB\u00b2. That seems useful.\n\nSo if we can find DA and DB, then we can relate them to DP and then solve for AP. Since AP = AD - PD? Wait, no, actually AP is from A to P, but since P is on the extension beyond D, or is it? Wait, depends on the configuration. Let me think.\n\nSince D is outside the circle (because it's the intersection of two tangents), so AD starts at A, goes through D, and then P is the other intersection with the circle. Wait, but the tangent points are at B and C, so D is outside the circle. So the line AD starts at A (on the circle), goes through D (outside), and then exits the circle again at P. Wait, actually, no. Wait, the line AD starts at A, goes through D, but since D is outside the circle, the line AD would intersect the circle again at P, which is between A and D? Or beyond D?\n\nWait, if you have a point outside the circle, and a line from a point on the circle through the external point, then the second intersection is on the extension beyond the external point. So in this case, starting at A (on the circle), going through D (outside), so the second intersection P is on the other side of D from A. Therefore, AP is the length from A to P, which would be AD + DP? Wait, no, if P is beyond D from A, then AP = AD + DP? Wait, but in terms of segments, AP would be longer than AD. Wait, but actually, in terms of directed lengths, maybe not, but in absolute terms, yes. Hmm, perhaps better to think in terms of power of a point.\n\nPower of D: DB\u00b2 = DA * DP. So rearranged, DP = DB\u00b2 / DA. Therefore, AP = AD + DP? Wait, if P is beyond D, then AP = AD + DP. Wait, but AD is from A to D, and DP is from D to P. So yes, AP would be AD + DP. But actually, since AP is from A to P, and the path goes through D, so AP = AD + DP. But according to power of a point, DA * DP = DB\u00b2, so DP = DB\u00b2 / DA. Therefore, AP = AD + (DB\u00b2 / DA). Hmm. So if I can express DA and DB in terms of the given sides, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to use inversion or other projective geometry concepts, but maybe I should try to compute coordinates?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using triangle properties. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, use coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Maybe set up coordinate system with triangle ABC, compute coordinates of D, then find equation of line AD, find intersection with the circumcircle again at P, then compute AP.\n\nBut that might be a bit involved. Alternatively, use barycentric coordinates? Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, use trigonometry?\n\nAlternatively, use the Law of Cosines to find angles of triangle ABC first, then find coordinates?\n\nLet me see. Let's first compute the sides: AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me check if it's a valid triangle. 5 + 9 >10, 5+10>9, 9+10>5. Yes, okay.\n\nLet me compute the circumradius of triangle ABC. Maybe that can help. The formula for the circumradius R is (a b c)/(4 area). Let's compute area first using Heron's formula.\n\nThe semi-perimeter s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.\n\nArea = sqrt(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)) = sqrt(12*7*3*2) = sqrt(12*7*6) = sqrt(504) = sqrt(16*31.5) Hmm, wait let me compute that again:\n\nWait 12-5=7, 12-9=3, 12-10=2. So 12*7*3*2 = 12*7=84, 84*3=252, 252*2=504. So sqrt(504). Let me simplify sqrt(504). 504= 16*31.5? Wait 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but maybe better to factor it:\n\n504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait no, let's factor:\n\n504 = 8 * 63 = 8 * 9 * 7 = 8*9*7. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(8*9*7) = 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14). Wait let me check:\n\nsqrt(8*9*7) = sqrt(8)*sqrt(9)*sqrt(7) = 2\u221a2 * 3 * \u221a7 = 6\u221a14. Yes, correct. So area is 6\u221a14.\n\nTherefore, the circumradius R = (a b c)/(4 area) = (5 * 9 * 10)/(4 * 6\u221a14) = 450/(24\u221a14) = (450)/(24\u221a14) = (75)/(4\u221a14). Rationalizing the denominator: 75\u221a14 / (4*14) = 75\u221a14 / 56. Hmm, but maybe I can leave it as 75/(4\u221a14) for now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use coordinates. Let me try to set coordinates for triangle ABC. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point B at (9,0), but wait, actually, given the sides, perhaps better to set coordinates such that calculations are easier.\n\nWait, given that AC =10, BC=9, AB=5. Let me set point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0). Then point A is somewhere in the plane. Let me find coordinates of A.\n\nLet me denote coordinates:\n\nLet me set point C at (0,0).\n\nPoint B is at (9, 0).\n\nPoint A is at (x,y). Then AC = 10, so distance from A to C (0,0) is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 10.\n\nDistance from A to B (9,0) is sqrt((x - 9)^2 + y\u00b2) =5.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100,\n\n(x - 9)^2 + y\u00b2 = 25.\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - [(x -9)^2 + y\u00b2] = 100 -25,\n\nx\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 - 18x +81) = 75,\n\nx\u00b2 -x\u00b2 +18x -81 =75,\n\n18x = 75 +81 = 156,\n\nx = 156 /18 = 26/3 \u2248 8.666...\n\nThen, substitute back to find y:\n\nx =26/3,\n\nx\u00b2 = (26/3)^2 = 676/9,\n\nSo y\u00b2 = 100 - 676/9 = (900 -676)/9 = 224/9,\n\nThus y = \u00b1\u221a(224/9) = \u00b1(\u221a224)/3 = \u00b1(2\u221a56)/3 = \u00b1(2*2\u221a14)/3 = \u00b1(4\u221a14)/3.\n\nSince triangles are typically drawn above the x-axis, let's take y positive. So coordinates of A are (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3).\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nC: (0,0)\n\nB: (9,0)\n\nA: (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3)\n\nNow, need to find point D, the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, we need the equations of the tangents at B and C.\n\nThe tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. Since the circumcircle passes through A, B, C, its center is the circumcenter O of triangle ABC. Let me find the coordinates of the circumcenter O.\n\nTo find circumcenter O, we can compute the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates for A, B, C, let me compute the perpendicular bisector of AB and BC, find their intersection.\n\nLet me compute the perpendicular bisector of AB:\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3)\n\nCoordinates of B: (9,0)\n\nMidpoint of AB: [(26/3 +9)/2, (4\u221a14/3 +0)/2] = [(26/3 +27/3)/2, (4\u221a14/3)/2] = [(53/3)/2, (2\u221a14)/3] = (53/6, (2\u221a14)/3)\n\nSlope of AB: (0 - 4\u221a14/3)/(9 -26/3) = (-4\u221a14/3)/( (27/3 -26/3)) = (-4\u221a14/3)/(1/3) = -4\u221a14.\n\nTherefore, the perpendicular bisector of AB has slope reciprocal and opposite: 1/(4\u221a14).\n\nSo equation of perpendicular bisector of AB:\n\nUsing point-slope form: y - (2\u221a14)/3 = (1/(4\u221a14))(x -53/6)\n\nSimilarly, compute perpendicular bisector of BC.\n\nCoordinates of B: (9,0), C: (0,0). Midpoint of BC is (4.5, 0). The slope of BC is (0 -0)/(0 -9) =0, so it's horizontal. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector is vertical, through midpoint (4.5,0), so equation x = 4.5.\n\nSo the perpendicular bisectors of AB and BC intersect at O.\n\nWe know that O lies on x=4.5, so substitute x=9/2 into the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB.\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\ny - (2\u221a14)/3 = (1/(4\u221a14))(x -53/6)\n\nSubstituting x = 9/2:\n\nFirst, convert 53/6 to over 6 denominator, and 9/2 is 27/6.\n\nx -53/6 = (27/6 -53/6) = (-26/6) = -13/3.\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = (2\u221a14)/3 + (1/(4\u221a14))*(-13/3)\n\nCompute the second term:\n\n(1/(4\u221a14))*(-13/3) = (-13)/(12\u221a14)\n\nSo y = (2\u221a14)/3 -13/(12\u221a14)\n\nLet me rationalize the second term:\n\n-13/(12\u221a14) = -13\u221a14/(12*14) = -13\u221a14/168\n\nSo combine the terms:\n\nFirst term: (2\u221a14)/3 = (2\u221a14 * 56)/168 = (112\u221a14)/168\n\nWait, maybe better to get a common denominator:\n\nThe first term is (2\u221a14)/3 = (2\u221a14 * 56)/168? Wait maybe better:\n\nLet me write both terms over 168 denominator:\n\n(2\u221a14)/3 = (2\u221a14 * 56)/168? Wait, 3*56=168, so yes:\n\n(2\u221a14)/3 = (2\u221a14 * 56)/168 = (112\u221a14)/168,\n\nWait, actually, 2\u221a14 /3 = (2\u221a14 * 56)/168? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 3 * 56 is 168, so to get denominator 168, multiply numerator and denominator by 56:\n\nWait, actually, 2\u221a14/3 = (2\u221a14 * 56)/(3 *56) = (112\u221a14)/168. Yes. Similarly, the second term:\n\n-13\u221a14/168 is already over 168.\n\nThus total y = [112\u221a14 -13\u221a14]/168 = (99\u221a14)/168.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n99 and 168: GCD is 3, so divide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n99 \u00f73 =33, 168 \u00f73=56. So 33\u221a14 /56.\n\nThus the coordinates of O are (9/2, 33\u221a14/56).\n\nHmm, okay, that's the circumcenter. Now, we need equations of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle. Let me recall that the tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point.\n\nSo tangent at B is perpendicular to OB. The slope of OB is (y_O - y_B)/(x_O -x_B) = (33\u221a14/56 -0)/(9/2 -9) ?\n\nWait, coordinates of B are (9,0), coordinates of O are (9/2, 33\u221a14/56). So the vector from O to B is (9 - 9/2, 0 - 33\u221a14/56) = (9/2, -33\u221a14/56). Therefore, the slope of OB is ( -33\u221a14/56 ) / (9/2 ) = (-33\u221a14 /56 ) * (2/9) = (-66\u221a14)/(504) = (-11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: (84)/(11\u221a14). Let me rationalize that:\n\n84/(11\u221a14) = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (84/14)*(\u221a14)/11 = 6*(\u221a14)/11. So slope is 6\u221a14/11.\n\nWait let me check:\n\nThe slope of OB was m = (-11\u221a14)/84? Wait, no, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, slope of OB is (y_O - y_B)/(x_O - x_B) = (33\u221a14/56 - 0)/( (9/2 - 9) )\n\nWait denominator is 9/2 -9 = 9/2 -18/2 = -9/2.\n\nSo slope is (33\u221a14/56) / (-9/2) = (33\u221a14)/56 * (-2/9) = (33\u221a14 * -2)/(56*9) = (-66\u221a14)/(504) = simplifying numerator and denominator by 6: (-11\u221a14)/84. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal of (-11\u221a14/84), so reciprocal is -84/(11\u221a14), and negative of that is 84/(11\u221a14). Rationalizing:\n\n84/(11\u221a14) = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (6*14\u221a14)/(11*14) = (6\u221a14)/11. So slope is 6\u221a14/11. So the tangent at B has slope 6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, equation of tangent at B: passes through B (9,0), slope m=6\u221a14/11.\n\nEquation: y -0 = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9).\n\nSimilarly, tangent at C: point C is (0,0). The tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC.\n\nCoordinates of O are (9/2, 33\u221a14/56). So vector OC is from O to C: (0 -9/2, 0 -33\u221a14/56) = (-9/2, -33\u221a14/56). So slope of OC is ( -33\u221a14/56 ) / ( -9/2 ) = (33\u221a14/56)/(9/2) = (33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (66\u221a14)/(504) = (11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so slope is the negative reciprocal of (11\u221a14)/84, which is -84/(11\u221a14). Rationalizing:\n\n-84/(11\u221a14) = -84\u221a14/(11*14) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, equation of tangent at C: passes through C (0,0), slope -6\u221a14/11. So equation is y = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nNow, point D is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.\n\nSo set the equations equal:\n\nFrom tangent at B: y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9)\n\nFrom tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nSet equal:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14)) to eliminate coefficients:\n\n(x -9) = -x\n\nx -9 = -x\n\n2x =9 => x =9/2\n\nThen plug back into tangent at C's equation:\n\ny = (-6\u221a14/11)*(9/2) = (-54\u221a14)/22 = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nHmm, so D is at (4.5, -27\u221a14/11). Now, need to find the equation of line AD, then find its other intersection P with the circumcircle, then compute AP.\n\nFirst, coordinates of A are (26/3, 4\u221a14/3). Coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nLet me compute the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nParametrize from A to D. Let me compute the direction vector from A to D:\n\n\u0394x = 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6)= (-25/6)\n\n\u0394y = (-27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3) = \u221a14*(- (81 +44)/33 ) = \u221a14*(-125/33)\n\nSo direction vector is (-25/6, -125\u221a14/33). To make it simpler, we can write parametric equations as:\n\nx = 26/3 + t*(-25/6)\n\ny = 4\u221a14/3 + t*(-125\u221a14/33)\n\nWe can also write in terms of a parameter t, but maybe it's better to find the equation in terms of slope.\n\nAlternatively, compute the equation of line AD. Let me find the slope first.\n\nSlope m_AD = ( y_D - y_A ) / (x_D - x_A )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\ny_D - y_A = (-27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3) = \u221a14*(- (81 + 44)/33 ) = \u221a14*(-125/33 )\n\nDenominator:\n\nx_D - x_A = 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6) = (-25/6)\n\nThus slope m_AD = [ -125\u221a14/33 ] / [ -25/6 ] = (125\u221a14/33) / (25/6) = (125/25)*(6/33)*\u221a14 = 5*(2/11)*\u221a14 = 10\u221a14/11.\n\nSo slope of AD is 10\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, equation of AD: using point A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3):\n\ny -4\u221a14/3 = (10\u221a14/11)(x -26/3)\n\nNow, need to find the other intersection point P of this line with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nThe equation of the circumcircle \u03c9 can be written using the circumcenter O (9/2, 33\u221a14/56) and radius R. Let me compute R squared.\n\nCoordinates of O: (9/2, 33\u221a14/56)\n\nRadius squared is the distance from O to A squared.\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3)\n\nCompute (x_A - x_O)^2 + (y_A - y_O)^2:\n\nx difference: 26/3 -9/2 = (52/6 -27/6)=25/6\n\ny difference: 4\u221a14/3 -33\u221a14/56 = \u221a14*(4/3 -33/56) = \u221a14*( (4*56 -33*3)/ (3*56) ) = \u221a14*( (224 -99)/168 )= \u221a14*(125/168 )\n\nThus squared terms:\n\n(25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14 /168)^2\n\nFirst term: 625/36\n\nSecond term: (125^2 *14)/(168^2 )\n\n125 squared is 15625, so 15625 *14 = 218750\n\n168 squared is 28224\n\nThus second term is 218750 /28224\n\nTherefore, R squared is 625/36 + 218750/28224\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps parametrize the line AD and find its second intersection with the circle.\n\nLet me proceed with parametrization.\n\nLet me let parameter t such that when t=0, we are at A, and t=1, we are at D, but since P is beyond D, maybe t>1?\n\nAlternatively, let me parametrize using a parameter s such that:\n\nx = x_A + s*(x_D - x_A)\n\ny = y_A + s*(y_D - y_A)\n\nThen, substitute into the equation of the circle and solve for s \u22600 (since A is already on the circle). The other solution will correspond to point P.\n\nSo let me set up the parametrization:\n\nLet me denote:\n\ndx = x_D - x_A = 9/2 -26/3 = as before, -25/6\n\ndy = y_D - y_A = -27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3 = as before, -125\u221a14/33\n\nThus parametrization:\n\nx = 26/3 + s*(-25/6)\n\ny = 4\u221a14/3 + s*(-125\u221a14/33 )\n\nWe need to plug this into the equation of the circle (which is centered at O(9/2, 33\u221a14/56) with radius R). The equation is:\n\n(x -9/2)^2 + (y - 33\u221a14/56)^2 = R^2.\n\nBut since point A is on the circle, when s=0, the equation holds, so substituting s=0 gives 0 +0 = R\u00b2, which is true. To find the other intersection, we need to plug in the parametrization and solve for s \u22600.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the power of point D, as I thought earlier.\n\nRecall that Power of D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP.\n\nWe can compute DA and DB, then compute DP = DB\u00b2 / DA, so AP = AD + DP? Wait, but need to confirm the direction.\n\nWait, AP is from A to P. Since P is on the extension of AD beyond D, then AP = AD + DP. But DP = DB\u00b2 / DA, so AP = AD + (DB\u00b2 / DA).\n\nAlternatively, AP = AD + DP, so AP = AD + (DB\u00b2 / DA). Therefore, if I can compute DA and DB, then I can compute AP.\n\nLet me compute DA and DB.\n\nFirst, DA is the distance from D to A.\n\nCoordinates of D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11)\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3)\n\nCompute DA:\n\n\u0394x = 26/3 -9/2 = (52/6 -27/6)=25/6\n\n\u0394y = 4\u221a14/3 - (-27\u221a14/11) =4\u221a14/3 +27\u221a14/11 = \u221a14*(4/3 +27/11) = \u221a14*( (44 +81)/33 ) = \u221a14*(125/33 )\n\nThus DA squared is (25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14/33)^2\n\nWait, but actually, DA is the distance between A and D, so:\n\nDA = sqrt[(25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14/33)^2 ]\n\nHmm, that seems messy, but maybe we can compute it numerically? Alternatively, perhaps compute DA * DP = DB\u00b2, so AP = AD + DP = AD + (DB\u00b2)/AD = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/AD. Wait, no, AP = AD + DP, and DP = DB\u00b2 / DA, so AP = AD + (DB\u00b2)/DA = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/AD.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute DB first.\n\nDB is the length of the tangent from D to B, but since D is on the tangent at B, DB is just the length of the tangent from D to the circle, which is equal to sqrt(OD\u00b2 - R\u00b2). Wait, but maybe easier to compute directly since coordinates are known.\n\nCoordinates of D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11), coordinates of B: (9,0). So DB squared is:\n\n\u0394x = 9 - 9/2 = 9/2, \u0394y = 0 - (-27\u221a14/11) =27\u221a14/11\n\nThus DB squared = (9/2)^2 + (27\u221a14/11)^2.\n\nCompute this:\n\n(81/4) + ( (27)^2 *14 )/(11^2 )\n\n27 squared is 729, so:\n\n81/4 + (729 *14)/121\n\nCompute 729*14 = 10206, so 10206 /121 = let's see, 121*84 = 10284 which is more, so 10206 /121 = 84.347...\n\nWait but maybe keep as fractions:\n\nDB squared = 81/4 + (729*14)/121 = 81/4 + (10206)/121\n\nTo add these, need common denominator. Let me see, but maybe compute numerators over common denominator 4*121=484.\n\n81/4 = (81*121)/484 = (9801)/484\n\n10206/121 = (10206*4)/484 = 40824/484\n\nThus total DB squared = (9801 +40824)/484 = 50625 /484\n\nTherefore, DB = sqrt(50625/484) = 225/22.\n\nSo DB is 225/22. That's nice. So DB squared is (225/22)^2 = 50625/484.\n\nNow, compute DA squared:\n\nEarlier, DA squared is (25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14/33)^2.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n25/6 squared is 625/36.\n\n(125\u221a14 /33)^2 = (125)^2 *14 / (33)^2 = (15625 *14)/1089 = 218750 /1089.\n\nSo DA squared = 625/36 + 218750/1089.\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 36*1089 = 39204.\n\n625/36 = (625 *1089)/39204\n\n218750/1089 = (218750 *36)/39204\n\nCompute numerators:\n\n625 *1089: Let's compute 625*1000=625000, 625*89=55625, so total 625000+55625=680,625.\n\n218750 *36: 200,000*36=7,200,000; 18,750*36=675,000 \u2192 total 7,200,000+675,000=7,875,000.\n\nThus total numerator: 680,625 +7,875,000 = 8,555,625.\n\nTherefore DA squared is 8,555,625 / 39,204.\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n8,555,625 \u00f73 = 2,851,875\n\n39,204 \u00f73 =13,068\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n2,851,875 \u00f73 = 950,625\n\n13,068 \u00f73 =4,356\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n950,625 \u00f73 = 316,875\n\n4,356 \u00f73 =1,452\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n316,875 \u00f73 =105,625\n\n1,452 \u00f73 =484\n\nSo now we have 105,625 /484.\n\nCheck if 105,625 and 484 have common factors.\n\n484 is 22\u00b2=4*121=4*11\u00b2. 105,625: Let's see 105,625 divided by 25 is 4,225. 4,225 divided by 25 is 169. So 105,625 =25*25*169 =25\u00b2 *13\u00b2. So sqrt(105,625)=25*13=325. Wait, 25*25 is 625, 625*169=105,625. So 105,625 = (25*13)^2 = 325\u00b2. And 484 is 22\u00b2. So DA squared = (325)^2 / (22)^2. Thus DA = 325/22.\n\nWow, so DA is 325/22. That's a relief!\n\nTherefore, DA = 325/22, DB =225/22.\n\nSo now, using power of point D: DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWe have DP = (DB\u00b2)/DA = ( (225/22)^2 ) / (325/22 ) = (225\u00b2 / (22\u00b2)) * (22/325 ) = (225\u00b2 *22 ) / (22\u00b2 *325 )\n\nSimplify: 225\u00b2 / (22 *325 )\n\n225 =25*9, 325=25*13, so 225/325 = 9/13.\n\nThus:\n\n225\u00b2 / (22*325) = (225 *225)/(22*325) = (225/325)*(225/22) = (9/13)*(225/22). Wait maybe better:\n\n225\u00b2/(22 *325 ) = (225/325)*(225/22) = (9/13)*(225/22). Wait, perhaps compute step by step:\n\n225 squared is 50625, 22*325 = 7150.\n\n50625 /7150. Let me see:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: 50625/25=2025, 7150/25=286.\n\n2025/286. Hmm, can this be simplified?\n\n2025 divided by 11? 11*184=2024, so no. 286 is 2*11*13. 2025 is 25*81, so factors 5\u00b2, 3\u2074. So no common factors. So 2025/286.\n\nWait, so DP = 2025/286.\n\nWait but let me check:\n\nWait DP = (225/22)^2 divided by (325/22) = (225^2)/(22^2) * (22/325) )= 225\u00b2/(22*325) = (225*225)/(22*325).\n\nYes, so 225*225 is 50625, 22*325 is 7150. 50625 divided by 7150:\n\nLet me compute 7150*7=50050, so 50625-50050=575. So 50625/7150 =7 +575/7150.\n\nSimplify 575/7150 divide numerator and denominator by 25: 23/286. So total is 7 +23/286 =7 23/286. But maybe keep as 50625/7150. Let me see if that reduces further.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 50625/5=10125, 7150/5=1430.\n\nAgain divide by 5: 10125/5=2025, 1430/5=286. So same as before. So 2025/286 is the simplified fraction. Therefore DP=2025/286.\n\nTherefore, AP = AD + DP = 325/22 + 2025/286.\n\nConvert to common denominator 286 (since 22*13=286). So 325/22 = (325*13)/286 = 4225/286. Then 4225 +2025 = 6250. So AP=6250/286.\n\nSimplify this fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 3125/143. Check if 3125 and 143 have common factors. 143 is 11*13. 3125 is 5^5. No common factors. Therefore, AP=3125/143. So m=3125, n=143. Are they coprime? Let's check GCD(3125,143). 143 divides into 3125 how many times? 143*21=3003, 3125-3003=122. GCD(143,122). 143-122=21, GCD(122,21). 122 divided by21 is 5*21=105, 122-105=17, GCD(21,17)=1. So GCD is 1. So yes, coprime. Therefore m +n=3125 +143=3268.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check my calculation again. Because 325/22 + 2025/286:\n\n325 divided by 22 is equal to 325*13 over 286, since 22*13=286. So 325*13 = 4225. 4225 +2025=6250. 6250/286. Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 3125/143. Yes. So 3125+143 is 3268. Hmm, but I need to confirm if my DA and DP are correct.\n\nWait let me verify the DA computation again because that was a key step.\n\nEarlier, I calculated DA squared as (25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14 /33)^2. Let me recalculate:\n\n25/6 squared is 625/36.\n\n125\u221a14 /33 squared is (125)^2*(14)/(33)^2 = (15625*14)/1089 = 218750 / 1089.\n\nThen converting to common denominator 39204 (36*1089):\n\n625/36 = (625 * 1089)/39204 = 625*1089. Let me compute 625*1000=625000, 625*89=55,625, so total 625,000 +55,625 =680,625. So 680,625/39204.\n\n218750 /1089 = (218,750 *36)/39204. 218,750 *36: 200,000*36=7,200,000; 18,750*36=675,000 \u2192 total 7,875,000. So 7,875,000 /39,204.\n\nAdding these two numerators: 680,625 +7,875,000 =8,555,625. So DA squared is 8,555,625 /39,204.\n\nThen simplifying:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n8,555,625 \u00f73=2,851,875; 39,204 \u00f73=13,068\n\nAgain by 3: 2,851,875 \u00f73=950,625; 13,068 \u00f73=4,356\n\nAgain by 3: 950,625 \u00f73=316,875; 4,356 \u00f73=1,452\n\nAgain by 3: 316,875 \u00f73=105,625; 1,452 \u00f73=484\n\nSo 105,625/484. Then 105625 is 325 squared (since 300\u00b2=90,000, 325\u00b2=105,625) and 484 is 22 squared. So sqrt(105625/484)=325/22. Yes, that's correct. So DA=325/22.\n\nThen DP= DB\u00b2 / DA = (225/22)^2 / (325/22) = (225\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) * (22/325)= 225\u00b2/(22*325). 225 squared is 50,625; 22*325 is 7,150. 50,625 divided by 7,150. Let me do this division:\n\n50,625 \u00f77,150. Let me see how many times 7,150 fits into 50,625.\n\n7,150*7=50,050. Subtract that from 50,625: 50,625 -50,050 =575.\n\nSo it's 7 +575/7,150. Simplify 575/7,150: divide numerator and denominator by 25: 23/286. So total is 7 +23/286= (7*286 +23)/286 = (2002 +23)/286=2025/286. Wait, wait, that's different from before?\n\nWait, hold on: 50,625 divided by 7,150.\n\nWait, 7,150 *7 =50,050. 50,625-50,050=575. So 575/7,150 reduces by 25 to 23/286. Thus total is 7 +23/286= 7*(286)/286 +23/286= (2002 +23)/286=2025/286. Wait so DP is 2025/286, not 2025/286? Wait yes, that's correct.\n\nThen AP = DA + DP = 325/22 +2025/286. Convert 325/22 to denominator 286:\n\n325/22 = (325 *13)/286 =4225/286. 4225 +2025=6250. So 6250/286=3125/143. So yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, AP=3125/143, so m=3125, n=143, sum is 3125+143= 3268. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, just to confirm, because 3125/143 seems a bit large. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, using power of a point. Since D has power DB\u00b2 = DA * DP, so DA * DP = (225/22)^2. So AP = DA + DP = DA + (DB\u00b2)/DA = (DA\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/DA.\n\nCompute DA\u00b2 is (325/22)^2, DB squared is (225/22)^2. So DA\u00b2 + DB\u00b2 = (325\u00b2 +225\u00b2)/22\u00b2.\n\nCompute numerator: 325\u00b2 +225\u00b2.\n\n325\u00b2 = 105,625\n\n225\u00b2=50,625\n\nTotal: 105,625 +50,625=156,250.\n\nSo (156,250)/ (22\u00b2) divided by (325/22):\n\nSo [(156250)/(484)] / [325/22] = (156250 /484) * (22/325) = (156250 *22)/(484 *325).\n\nSimplify denominator: 484*325 = (4*121)*(25*13)=4*25*121*13=100*1573=157,300? Wait better step by step:\n\n484 *325:\n\n484 * 300 =145,200\n\n484 *25 =12,100\n\nTotal:145,200 +12,100=157,300.\n\nNumerator:156,250 *22= 3,437,500.\n\nThus the fraction is 3,437,500 /157,300.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100: 34,375 /1,573.\n\nWait, but 157,300 divided by 100 is 1573, and 3,437,500 divided by 100 is 34,375.\n\nNow, check if 34,375 and 1,573 have common factors.\n\n1573 divided by 11: 11*143=1573. 143 is 11*13. So 1573=11*11*13.\n\n34,375: 34,375 divided by 5 is 6,875; again divided by 5 is 1,375; again 275; again 55; 11. So 34,375=5^4 *11.\n\nThus, GCD(34,375,1573)=11.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 11:\n\n34,375 \u00f711 =3,125\n\n1,573 \u00f711=143\n\nSo we have 3,125 /143, which matches the previous result. So AP=3125/143. So the answer is 3125+143=3268.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3268. But before I conclude, let me check if the problem states AP is written as m/n where m and n are coprime, so 3125 and 143 are coprime? Let me check with prime factors.\n\n3125 is 5^5.\n\n143 is 11\u00d713. So yes, no common factors. So yes, 3125/143 is reduced, so m+n=3268.\n\nHmm, okay, that seems correct. So I think the answer is 3268.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{3268}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again carefully. It says:\n\nLet triangle ABC be inscribed in circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at B and C intersect at point D. Then line AD intersects \u03c9 again at P. We\u2019re given the sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find AP in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then compute m + n.\n\nHmm. Alright, so first, I need to recall some geometry concepts here. The problem involves a triangle inscribed in a circle, tangents from a point to a circle, and the intersection of a line with the circle again. Maybe some properties related to power of a point, cyclic quadrilaterals, or similar triangles?\n\nLet me start by drawing a rough sketch in my mind. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circle \u03c9 is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. So D is the exsymmedian point? Or maybe related to the symmedian? Wait, tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length, so DB = DC? Wait no, the tangent from D to B and C, but since D is the intersection of the two tangents, yes, DB and DC should both be tangent to the circle, so DB = DC. Wait, but tangents from a single point to a circle are equal, so yes, DB = DC.\n\nTherefore, D is equidistant from B and C along the tangents. So triangle DBC is isoceles? Wait, but BC is 9. Hmm, but maybe that's not directly important yet.\n\nWe need to find AP where P is the second intersection of AD with the circumcircle. So AD is a secant line from A through D, intersecting the circle again at P. So perhaps using power of a point D with respect to the circle?\n\nPower of a point D: the power with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 (since DB is tangent to \u03c9 at B), which is also DC\u00b2. So Power of D is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP, since AD is a secant line. So DA * DP = DB\u00b2. That seems useful.\n\nSo if we can find DA and DB, then we can relate them to DP and then solve for AP. Since AP = AD - PD? Wait, no, actually AP is from A to P, but since P is on the extension beyond D, or is it? Wait, depends on the configuration. Let me think.\n\nSince D is outside the circle (because it's the intersection of two tangents), so AD starts at A, goes through D, and then P is the other intersection with the circle. Wait, but the tangent points are at B and C, so D is outside the circle. So the line AD starts at A (on the circle), goes through D (outside), and then exits the circle again at P. Wait, actually, no. Wait, the line AD starts at A, goes through D, but since D is outside the circle, the line AD would intersect the circle again at P, which is between A and D? Or beyond D?\n\nWait, if you have a point outside the circle, and a line from a point on the circle through the external point, then the second intersection is on the extension beyond the external point. So in this case, starting at A (on the circle), going through D (outside), so the second intersection P is on the other side of D from A. Therefore, AP is the length from A to P, which would be AD + DP? Wait, no, if P is beyond D from A, then AP = AD + DP? Wait, but in terms of segments, AP would be longer than AD. Wait, but actually, in terms of directed lengths, maybe not, but in absolute terms, yes. Hmm, perhaps better to think in terms of power of a point.\n\nPower of D: DB\u00b2 = DA * DP. So rearranged, DP = DB\u00b2 / DA. Therefore, AP = AD + DP? Wait, if P is beyond D, then AP = AD + DP. Wait, but AD is from A to D, and DP is from D to P. So yes, AP would be AD + DP. But actually, since AP is from A to P, and the path goes through D, so AP = AD + DP. But according to power of a point, DA * DP = DB\u00b2, so DP = DB\u00b2 / DA. Therefore, AP = AD + (DB\u00b2 / DA). Hmm. So if I can express DA and DB in terms of the given sides, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to use inversion or other projective geometry concepts, but maybe I should try to compute coordinates?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using triangle properties. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, use coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Maybe set up coordinate system with triangle ABC, compute coordinates of D, then find equation of line AD, find intersection with the circumcircle again at P, then compute AP.\n\nBut that might be a bit involved. Alternatively, use barycentric coordinates? Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, use trigonometry?\n\nAlternatively, use the Law of Cosines to find angles of triangle ABC first, then find coordinates?\n\nLet me see. Let's first compute the sides: AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me check if it's a valid triangle. 5 + 9 >10, 5+10>9, 9+10>5. Yes, okay.\n\nLet me compute the circumradius of triangle ABC. Maybe that can help. The formula for the circumradius R is (a b c)/(4 area). Let's compute area first using Heron's formula.\n\nThe semi-perimeter s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.\n\nArea = sqrt(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)) = sqrt(12*7*3*2) = sqrt(12*7*6) = sqrt(504) = sqrt(16*31.5) Hmm, wait let me compute that again:\n\nWait 12-5=7, 12-9=3, 12-10=2. So 12*7*3*2 = 12*7=84, 84*3=252, 252*2=504. So sqrt(504). Let me simplify sqrt(504). 504= 16*31.5? Wait 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but maybe better to factor it:\n\n504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait no, let's factor:\n\n504 = 8 * 63 = 8 * 9 * 7 = 8*9*7. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(8*9*7) = 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14). Wait let me check:\n\nsqrt(8*9*7) = sqrt(8)*sqrt(9)*sqrt(7) = 2\u221a2 * 3 * \u221a7 = 6\u221a14. Yes, correct. So area is 6\u221a14.\n\nTherefore, the circumradius R = (a b c)/(4 area) = (5 * 9 * 10)/(4 * 6\u221a14) = 450/(24\u221a14) = (450)/(24\u221a14) = (75)/(4\u221a14). Rationalizing the denominator: 75\u221a14 / (4*14) = 75\u221a14 / 56. Hmm, but maybe I can leave it as 75/(4\u221a14) for now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use coordinates. Let me try to set coordinates for triangle ABC. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point B at (9,0), but wait, actually, given the sides, perhaps better to set coordinates such that calculations are easier.\n\nWait, given that AC =10, BC=9, AB=5. Let me set point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0). Then point A is somewhere in the plane. Let me find coordinates of A.\n\nLet me denote coordinates:\n\nLet me set point C at (0,0).\n\nPoint B is at (9, 0).\n\nPoint A is at (x,y). Then AC = 10, so distance from A to C (0,0) is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 10.\n\nDistance from A to B (9,0) is sqrt((x - 9)^2 + y\u00b2) =5.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100,\n\n(x - 9)^2 + y\u00b2 = 25.\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - [(x -9)^2 + y\u00b2] = 100 -25,\n\nx\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 - 18x +81) = 75,\n\nx\u00b2 -x\u00b2 +18x -81 =75,\n\n18x = 75 +81 = 156,\n\nx = 156 /18 = 26/3 \u2248 8.666...\n\nThen, substitute back to find y:\n\nx =26/3,\n\nx\u00b2 = (26/3)^2 = 676/9,\n\nSo y\u00b2 = 100 - 676/9 = (900 -676)/9 = 224/9,\n\nThus y = \u00b1\u221a(224/9) = \u00b1(\u221a224)/3 = \u00b1(2\u221a56)/3 = \u00b1(2*2\u221a14)/3 = \u00b1(4\u221a14)/3.\n\nSince triangles are typically drawn above the x-axis, let's take y positive. So coordinates of A are (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3).\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nC: (0,0)\n\nB: (9,0)\n\nA: (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3)\n\nNow, need to find point D, the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, we need the equations of the tangents at B and C.\n\nThe tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. Since the circumcircle passes through A, B, C, its center is the circumcenter O of triangle ABC. Let me find the coordinates of the circumcenter O.\n\nTo find circumcenter O, we can compute the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates for A, B, C, let me compute the perpendicular bisector of AB and BC, find their intersection.\n\nLet me compute the perpendicular bisector of AB:\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3)\n\nCoordinates of B: (9,0)\n\nMidpoint of AB: [(26/3 +9)/2, (4\u221a14/3 +0)/2] = [(26/3 +27/3)/2, (4\u221a14/3)/2] = [(53/3)/2, (2\u221a14)/3] = (53/6, (2\u221a14)/3)\n\nSlope of AB: (0 - 4\u221a14/3)/(9 -26/3) = (-4\u221a14/3)/( (27/3 -26/3)) = (-4\u221a14/3)/(1/3) = -4\u221a14.\n\nTherefore, the perpendicular bisector of AB has slope reciprocal and opposite: 1/(4\u221a14).\n\nSo equation of perpendicular bisector of AB:\n\nUsing point-slope form: y - (2\u221a14)/3 = (1/(4\u221a14))(x -53/6)\n\nSimilarly, compute perpendicular bisector of BC.\n\nCoordinates of B: (9,0), C: (0,0). Midpoint of BC is (4.5, 0). The slope of BC is (0 -0)/(0 -9) =0, so it's horizontal. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector is vertical, through midpoint (4.5,0), so equation x = 4.5.\n\nSo the perpendicular bisectors of AB and BC intersect at O.\n\nWe know that O lies on x=4.5, so substitute x=9/2 into the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB.\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\ny - (2\u221a14)/3 = (1/(4\u221a14))(x -53/6)\n\nSubstituting x = 9/2:\n\nFirst, convert 53/6 to over 6 denominator, and 9/2 is 27/6.\n\nx -53/6 = (27/6 -53/6) = (-26/6) = -13/3.\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = (2\u221a14)/3 + (1/(4\u221a14))*(-13/3)\n\nCompute the second term:\n\n(1/(4\u221a14))*(-13/3) = (-13)/(12\u221a14)\n\nSo y = (2\u221a14)/3 -13/(12\u221a14)\n\nLet me rationalize the second term:\n\n-13/(12\u221a14) = -13\u221a14/(12*14) = -13\u221a14/168\n\nSo combine the terms:\n\nFirst term: (2\u221a14)/3 = (2\u221a14 * 56)/168 = (112\u221a14)/168\n\nWait, maybe better to get a common denominator:\n\nThe first term is (2\u221a14)/3 = (2\u221a14 * 56)/168? Wait maybe better:\n\nLet me write both terms over 168 denominator:\n\n(2\u221a14)/3 = (2\u221a14 * 56)/168? Wait, 3*56=168, so yes:\n\n(2\u221a14)/3 = (2\u221a14 * 56)/168 = (112\u221a14)/168,\n\nWait, actually, 2\u221a14 /3 = (2\u221a14 * 56)/168? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 3 * 56 is 168, so to get denominator 168, multiply numerator and denominator by 56:\n\nWait, actually, 2\u221a14/3 = (2\u221a14 * 56)/(3 *56) = (112\u221a14)/168. Yes. Similarly, the second term:\n\n-13\u221a14/168 is already over 168.\n\nThus total y = [112\u221a14 -13\u221a14]/168 = (99\u221a14)/168.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n99 and 168: GCD is 3, so divide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n99 \u00f73 =33, 168 \u00f73=56. So 33\u221a14 /56.\n\nThus the coordinates of O are (9/2, 33\u221a14/56).\n\nHmm, okay, that's the circumcenter. Now, we need equations of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle. Let me recall that the tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point.\n\nSo tangent at B is perpendicular to OB. The slope of OB is (y_O - y_B)/(x_O -x_B) = (33\u221a14/56 -0)/(9/2 -9) ?\n\nWait, coordinates of B are (9,0), coordinates of O are (9/2, 33\u221a14/56). So the vector from O to B is (9 - 9/2, 0 - 33\u221a14/56) = (9/2, -33\u221a14/56). Therefore, the slope of OB is ( -33\u221a14/56 ) / (9/2 ) = (-33\u221a14 /56 ) * (2/9) = (-66\u221a14)/(504) = (-11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: (84)/(11\u221a14). Let me rationalize that:\n\n84/(11\u221a14) = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (84/14)*(\u221a14)/11 = 6*(\u221a14)/11. So slope is 6\u221a14/11.\n\nWait let me check:\n\nThe slope of OB was m = (-11\u221a14)/84? Wait, no, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, slope of OB is (y_O - y_B)/(x_O - x_B) = (33\u221a14/56 - 0)/( (9/2 - 9) )\n\nWait denominator is 9/2 -9 = 9/2 -18/2 = -9/2.\n\nSo slope is (33\u221a14/56) / (-9/2) = (33\u221a14)/56 * (-2/9) = (33\u221a14 * -2)/(56*9) = (-66\u221a14)/(504) = simplifying numerator and denominator by 6: (-11\u221a14)/84. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal of (-11\u221a14/84), so reciprocal is -84/(11\u221a14), and negative of that is 84/(11\u221a14). Rationalizing:\n\n84/(11\u221a14) = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (6*14\u221a14)/(11*14) = (6\u221a14)/11. So slope is 6\u221a14/11. So the tangent at B has slope 6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, equation of tangent at B: passes through B (9,0), slope m=6\u221a14/11.\n\nEquation: y -0 = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9).\n\nSimilarly, tangent at C: point C is (0,0). The tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC.\n\nCoordinates of O are (9/2, 33\u221a14/56). So vector OC is from O to C: (0 -9/2, 0 -33\u221a14/56) = (-9/2, -33\u221a14/56). So slope of OC is ( -33\u221a14/56 ) / ( -9/2 ) = (33\u221a14/56)/(9/2) = (33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (66\u221a14)/(504) = (11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so slope is the negative reciprocal of (11\u221a14)/84, which is -84/(11\u221a14). Rationalizing:\n\n-84/(11\u221a14) = -84\u221a14/(11*14) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, equation of tangent at C: passes through C (0,0), slope -6\u221a14/11. So equation is y = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nNow, point D is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.\n\nSo set the equations equal:\n\nFrom tangent at B: y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9)\n\nFrom tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nSet equal:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14)) to eliminate coefficients:\n\n(x -9) = -x\n\nx -9 = -x\n\n2x =9 => x =9/2\n\nThen plug back into tangent at C's equation:\n\ny = (-6\u221a14/11)*(9/2) = (-54\u221a14)/22 = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nHmm, so D is at (4.5, -27\u221a14/11). Now, need to find the equation of line AD, then find its other intersection P with the circumcircle, then compute AP.\n\nFirst, coordinates of A are (26/3, 4\u221a14/3). Coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nLet me compute the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nParametrize from A to D. Let me compute the direction vector from A to D:\n\n\u0394x = 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6)= (-25/6)\n\n\u0394y = (-27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3) = \u221a14*(- (81 +44)/33 ) = \u221a14*(-125/33)\n\nSo direction vector is (-25/6, -125\u221a14/33). To make it simpler, we can write parametric equations as:\n\nx = 26/3 + t*(-25/6)\n\ny = 4\u221a14/3 + t*(-125\u221a14/33)\n\nWe can also write in terms of a parameter t, but maybe it's better to find the equation in terms of slope.\n\nAlternatively, compute the equation of line AD. Let me find the slope first.\n\nSlope m_AD = ( y_D - y_A ) / (x_D - x_A )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\ny_D - y_A = (-27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3) = \u221a14*(- (81 + 44)/33 ) = \u221a14*(-125/33 )\n\nDenominator:\n\nx_D - x_A = 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6) = (-25/6)\n\nThus slope m_AD = [ -125\u221a14/33 ] / [ -25/6 ] = (125\u221a14/33) / (25/6) = (125/25)*(6/33)*\u221a14 = 5*(2/11)*\u221a14 = 10\u221a14/11.\n\nSo slope of AD is 10\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, equation of AD: using point A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3):\n\ny -4\u221a14/3 = (10\u221a14/11)(x -26/3)\n\nNow, need to find the other intersection point P of this line with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nThe equation of the circumcircle \u03c9 can be written using the circumcenter O (9/2, 33\u221a14/56) and radius R. Let me compute R squared.\n\nCoordinates of O: (9/2, 33\u221a14/56)\n\nRadius squared is the distance from O to A squared.\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3)\n\nCompute (x_A - x_O)^2 + (y_A - y_O)^2:\n\nx difference: 26/3 -9/2 = (52/6 -27/6)=25/6\n\ny difference: 4\u221a14/3 -33\u221a14/56 = \u221a14*(4/3 -33/56) = \u221a14*( (4*56 -33*3)/ (3*56) ) = \u221a14*( (224 -99)/168 )= \u221a14*(125/168 )\n\nThus squared terms:\n\n(25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14 /168)^2\n\nFirst term: 625/36\n\nSecond term: (125^2 *14)/(168^2 )\n\n125 squared is 15625, so 15625 *14 = 218750\n\n168 squared is 28224\n\nThus second term is 218750 /28224\n\nTherefore, R squared is 625/36 + 218750/28224\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps parametrize the line AD and find its second intersection with the circle.\n\nLet me proceed with parametrization.\n\nLet me let parameter t such that when t=0, we are at A, and t=1, we are at D, but since P is beyond D, maybe t>1?\n\nAlternatively, let me parametrize using a parameter s such that:\n\nx = x_A + s*(x_D - x_A)\n\ny = y_A + s*(y_D - y_A)\n\nThen, substitute into the equation of the circle and solve for s \u22600 (since A is already on the circle). The other solution will correspond to point P.\n\nSo let me set up the parametrization:\n\nLet me denote:\n\ndx = x_D - x_A = 9/2 -26/3 = as before, -25/6\n\ndy = y_D - y_A = -27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3 = as before, -125\u221a14/33\n\nThus parametrization:\n\nx = 26/3 + s*(-25/6)\n\ny = 4\u221a14/3 + s*(-125\u221a14/33 )\n\nWe need to plug this into the equation of the circle (which is centered at O(9/2, 33\u221a14/56) with radius R). The equation is:\n\n(x -9/2)^2 + (y - 33\u221a14/56)^2 = R^2.\n\nBut since point A is on the circle, when s=0, the equation holds, so substituting s=0 gives 0 +0 = R\u00b2, which is true. To find the other intersection, we need to plug in the parametrization and solve for s \u22600.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the power of point D, as I thought earlier.\n\nRecall that Power of D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP.\n\nWe can compute DA and DB, then compute DP = DB\u00b2 / DA, so AP = AD + DP? Wait, but need to confirm the direction.\n\nWait, AP is from A to P. Since P is on the extension of AD beyond D, then AP = AD + DP. But DP = DB\u00b2 / DA, so AP = AD + (DB\u00b2 / DA).\n\nAlternatively, AP = AD + DP, so AP = AD + (DB\u00b2 / DA). Therefore, if I can compute DA and DB, then I can compute AP.\n\nLet me compute DA and DB.\n\nFirst, DA is the distance from D to A.\n\nCoordinates of D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11)\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3)\n\nCompute DA:\n\n\u0394x = 26/3 -9/2 = (52/6 -27/6)=25/6\n\n\u0394y = 4\u221a14/3 - (-27\u221a14/11) =4\u221a14/3 +27\u221a14/11 = \u221a14*(4/3 +27/11) = \u221a14*( (44 +81)/33 ) = \u221a14*(125/33 )\n\nThus DA squared is (25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14/33)^2\n\nWait, but actually, DA is the distance between A and D, so:\n\nDA = sqrt[(25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14/33)^2 ]\n\nHmm, that seems messy, but maybe we can compute it numerically? Alternatively, perhaps compute DA * DP = DB\u00b2, so AP = AD + DP = AD + (DB\u00b2)/AD = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/AD. Wait, no, AP = AD + DP, and DP = DB\u00b2 / DA, so AP = AD + (DB\u00b2)/DA = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/AD.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute DB first.\n\nDB is the length of the tangent from D to B, but since D is on the tangent at B, DB is just the length of the tangent from D to the circle, which is equal to sqrt(OD\u00b2 - R\u00b2). Wait, but maybe easier to compute directly since coordinates are known.\n\nCoordinates of D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11), coordinates of B: (9,0). So DB squared is:\n\n\u0394x = 9 - 9/2 = 9/2, \u0394y = 0 - (-27\u221a14/11) =27\u221a14/11\n\nThus DB squared = (9/2)^2 + (27\u221a14/11)^2.\n\nCompute this:\n\n(81/4) + ( (27)^2 *14 )/(11^2 )\n\n27 squared is 729, so:\n\n81/4 + (729 *14)/121\n\nCompute 729*14 = 10206, so 10206 /121 = let's see, 121*84 = 10284 which is more, so 10206 /121 = 84.347...\n\nWait but maybe keep as fractions:\n\nDB squared = 81/4 + (729*14)/121 = 81/4 + (10206)/121\n\nTo add these, need common denominator. Let me see, but maybe compute numerators over common denominator 4*121=484.\n\n81/4 = (81*121)/484 = (9801)/484\n\n10206/121 = (10206*4)/484 = 40824/484\n\nThus total DB squared = (9801 +40824)/484 = 50625 /484\n\nTherefore, DB = sqrt(50625/484) = 225/22.\n\nSo DB is 225/22. That's nice. So DB squared is (225/22)^2 = 50625/484.\n\nNow, compute DA squared:\n\nEarlier, DA squared is (25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14/33)^2.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n25/6 squared is 625/36.\n\n(125\u221a14 /33)^2 = (125)^2 *14 / (33)^2 = (15625 *14)/1089 = 218750 /1089.\n\nSo DA squared = 625/36 + 218750/1089.\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 36*1089 = 39204.\n\n625/36 = (625 *1089)/39204\n\n218750/1089 = (218750 *36)/39204\n\nCompute numerators:\n\n625 *1089: Let's compute 625*1000=625000, 625*89=55625, so total 625000+55625=680,625.\n\n218750 *36: 200,000*36=7,200,000; 18,750*36=675,000 \u2192 total 7,200,000+675,000=7,875,000.\n\nThus total numerator: 680,625 +7,875,000 = 8,555,625.\n\nTherefore DA squared is 8,555,625 / 39,204.\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n8,555,625 \u00f73 = 2,851,875\n\n39,204 \u00f73 =13,068\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n2,851,875 \u00f73 = 950,625\n\n13,068 \u00f73 =4,356\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n950,625 \u00f73 = 316,875\n\n4,356 \u00f73 =1,452\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n316,875 \u00f73 =105,625\n\n1,452 \u00f73 =484\n\nSo now we have 105,625 /484.\n\nCheck if 105,625 and 484 have common factors.\n\n484 is 22\u00b2=4*121=4*11\u00b2. 105,625: Let's see 105,625 divided by 25 is 4,225. 4,225 divided by 25 is 169. So 105,625 =25*25*169 =25\u00b2 *13\u00b2. So sqrt(105,625)=25*13=325. Wait, 25*25 is 625, 625*169=105,625. So 105,625 = (25*13)^2 = 325\u00b2. And 484 is 22\u00b2. So DA squared = (325)^2 / (22)^2. Thus DA = 325/22.\n\nWow, so DA is 325/22. That's a relief!\n\nTherefore, DA = 325/22, DB =225/22.\n\nSo now, using power of point D: DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWe have DP = (DB\u00b2)/DA = ( (225/22)^2 ) / (325/22 ) = (225\u00b2 / (22\u00b2)) * (22/325 ) = (225\u00b2 *22 ) / (22\u00b2 *325 )\n\nSimplify: 225\u00b2 / (22 *325 )\n\n225 =25*9, 325=25*13, so 225/325 = 9/13.\n\nThus:\n\n225\u00b2 / (22*325) = (225 *225)/(22*325) = (225/325)*(225/22) = (9/13)*(225/22). Wait maybe better:\n\n225\u00b2/(22 *325 ) = (225/325)*(225/22) = (9/13)*(225/22). Wait, perhaps compute step by step:\n\n225 squared is 50625, 22*325 = 7150.\n\n50625 /7150. Let me see:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: 50625/25=2025, 7150/25=286.\n\n2025/286. Hmm, can this be simplified?\n\n2025 divided by 11? 11*184=2024, so no. 286 is 2*11*13. 2025 is 25*81, so factors 5\u00b2, 3\u2074. So no common factors. So 2025/286.\n\nWait, so DP = 2025/286.\n\nWait but let me check:\n\nWait DP = (225/22)^2 divided by (325/22) = (225^2)/(22^2) * (22/325) )= 225\u00b2/(22*325) = (225*225)/(22*325).\n\nYes, so 225*225 is 50625, 22*325 is 7150. 50625 divided by 7150:\n\nLet me compute 7150*7=50050, so 50625-50050=575. So 50625/7150 =7 +575/7150.\n\nSimplify 575/7150 divide numerator and denominator by 25: 23/286. So total is 7 +23/286 =7 23/286. But maybe keep as 50625/7150. Let me see if that reduces further.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 50625/5=10125, 7150/5=1430.\n\nAgain divide by 5: 10125/5=2025, 1430/5=286. So same as before. So 2025/286 is the simplified fraction. Therefore DP=2025/286.\n\nTherefore, AP = AD + DP = 325/22 + 2025/286.\n\nConvert to common denominator 286 (since 22*13=286). So 325/22 = (325*13)/286 = 4225/286. Then 4225 +2025 = 6250. So AP=6250/286.\n\nSimplify this fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 3125/143. Check if 3125 and 143 have common factors. 143 is 11*13. 3125 is 5^5. No common factors. Therefore, AP=3125/143. So m=3125, n=143. Are they coprime? Let's check GCD(3125,143). 143 divides into 3125 how many times? 143*21=3003, 3125-3003=122. GCD(143,122). 143-122=21, GCD(122,21). 122 divided by21 is 5*21=105, 122-105=17, GCD(21,17)=1. So GCD is 1. So yes, coprime. Therefore m +n=3125 +143=3268.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check my calculation again. Because 325/22 + 2025/286:\n\n325 divided by 22 is equal to 325*13 over 286, since 22*13=286. So 325*13 = 4225. 4225 +2025=6250. 6250/286. Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 3125/143. Yes. So 3125+143 is 3268. Hmm, but I need to confirm if my DA and DP are correct.\n\nWait let me verify the DA computation again because that was a key step.\n\nEarlier, I calculated DA squared as (25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14 /33)^2. Let me recalculate:\n\n25/6 squared is 625/36.\n\n125\u221a14 /33 squared is (125)^2*(14)/(33)^2 = (15625*14)/1089 = 218750 / 1089.\n\nThen converting to common denominator 39204 (36*1089):\n\n625/36 = (625 * 1089)/39204 = 625*1089. Let me compute 625*1000=625000, 625*89=55,625, so total 625,000 +55,625 =680,625. So 680,625/39204.\n\n218750 /1089 = (218,750 *36)/39204. 218,750 *36: 200,000*36=7,200,000; 18,750*36=675,000 \u2192 total 7,875,000. So 7,875,000 /39,204.\n\nAdding these two numerators: 680,625 +7,875,000 =8,555,625. So DA squared is 8,555,625 /39,204.\n\nThen simplifying:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n8,555,625 \u00f73=2,851,875; 39,204 \u00f73=13,068\n\nAgain by 3: 2,851,875 \u00f73=950,625; 13,068 \u00f73=4,356\n\nAgain by 3: 950,625 \u00f73=316,875; 4,356 \u00f73=1,452\n\nAgain by 3: 316,875 \u00f73=105,625; 1,452 \u00f73=484\n\nSo 105,625/484. Then 105625 is 325 squared (since 300\u00b2=90,000, 325\u00b2=105,625) and 484 is 22 squared. So sqrt(105625/484)=325/22. Yes, that's correct. So DA=325/22.\n\nThen DP= DB\u00b2 / DA = (225/22)^2 / (325/22) = (225\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) * (22/325)= 225\u00b2/(22*325). 225 squared is 50,625; 22*325 is 7,150. 50,625 divided by 7,150. Let me do this division:\n\n50,625 \u00f77,150. Let me see how many times 7,150 fits into 50,625.\n\n7,150*7=50,050. Subtract that from 50,625: 50,625 -50,050 =575.\n\nSo it's 7 +575/7,150. Simplify 575/7,150: divide numerator and denominator by 25: 23/286. So total is 7 +23/286= (7*286 +23)/286 = (2002 +23)/286=2025/286. Wait, wait, that's different from before?\n\nWait, hold on: 50,625 divided by 7,150.\n\nWait, 7,150 *7 =50,050. 50,625-50,050=575. So 575/7,150 reduces by 25 to 23/286. Thus total is 7 +23/286= 7*(286)/286 +23/286= (2002 +23)/286=2025/286. Wait so DP is 2025/286, not 2025/286? Wait yes, that's correct.\n\nThen AP = DA + DP = 325/22 +2025/286. Convert 325/22 to denominator 286:\n\n325/22 = (325 *13)/286 =4225/286. 4225 +2025=6250. So 6250/286=3125/143. So yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, AP=3125/143, so m=3125, n=143, sum is 3125+143= 3268. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, just to confirm, because 3125/143 seems a bit large. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, using power of a point. Since D has power DB\u00b2 = DA * DP, so DA * DP = (225/22)^2. So AP = DA + DP = DA + (DB\u00b2)/DA = (DA\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/DA.\n\nCompute DA\u00b2 is (325/22)^2, DB squared is (225/22)^2. So DA\u00b2 + DB\u00b2 = (325\u00b2 +225\u00b2)/22\u00b2.\n\nCompute numerator: 325\u00b2 +225\u00b2.\n\n325\u00b2 = 105,625\n\n225\u00b2=50,625\n\nTotal: 105,625 +50,625=156,250.\n\nSo (156,250)/ (22\u00b2) divided by (325/22):\n\nSo [(156250)/(484)] / [325/22] = (156250 /484) * (22/325) = (156250 *22)/(484 *325).\n\nSimplify denominator: 484*325 = (4*121)*(25*13)=4*25*121*13=100*1573=157,300? Wait better step by step:\n\n484 *325:\n\n484 * 300 =145,200\n\n484 *25 =12,100\n\nTotal:145,200 +12,100=157,300.\n\nNumerator:156,250 *22= 3,437,500.\n\nThus the fraction is 3,437,500 /157,300.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100: 34,375 /1,573.\n\nWait, but 157,300 divided by 100 is 1573, and 3,437,500 divided by 100 is 34,375.\n\nNow, check if 34,375 and 1,573 have common factors.\n\n1573 divided by 11: 11*143=1573. 143 is 11*13. So 1573=11*11*13.\n\n34,375: 34,375 divided by 5 is 6,875; again divided by 5 is 1,375; again 275; again 55; 11. So 34,375=5^4 *11.\n\nThus, GCD(34,375,1573)=11.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 11:\n\n34,375 \u00f711 =3,125\n\n1,573 \u00f711=143\n\nSo we have 3,125 /143, which matches the previous result. So AP=3125/143. So the answer is 3125+143=3268.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3268. But before I conclude, let me check if the problem states AP is written as m/n where m and n are coprime, so 3125 and 143 are coprime? Let me check with prime factors.\n\n3125 is 5^5.\n\n143 is 11\u00d713. So yes, no common factors. So yes, 3125/143 is reduced, so m+n=3268.\n\nHmm, okay, that seems correct.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me see. I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents at B and C meet at D, and AD intersects the circle again at P. The sides are given as AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with tangents and circles, the power of a point theorem might be useful here. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then DB and DC are both tangent to the circle \u03c9. So, the power of point D with respect to \u03c9 should be equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2. That might come into play.\n\nAlso, since AD intersects the circle again at P, maybe I can use some properties related to intersecting chords or something else. Alternatively, perhaps using harmonic division or projective geometry concepts? Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates or trigonometry? Let me think. Since we have triangle sides given, maybe using the Law of Cosines to find angles, then coordinates?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use inversion? Hmm, inversion might complicate things. Let me see if there's a more straightforward approach.\n\nWait, there's a theorem called the pole and polar. The point D is the pole of line BC with respect to the circle \u03c9? Wait, no. The polar of D would be the line BC because the tangents from D touch at B and C. So, the polar of D is BC. Therefore, points on BC have some relation to lines through D? Maybe not immediately helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, since AD passes through P, and we need AP, perhaps using power of a point from A? Wait, but A is on the circle, so its power is zero. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, use Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem? Maybe with some triangle and a transversal?\n\nAlternatively, using coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place the triangle in coordinate plane. Let me set point C at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Let me let point A be at (10,0) since AC is 10. Then point B is somewhere in the plane. Let me denote coordinates as follows:\n\nLet me denote coordinates:\n\nLet\u2019s let point C be at (0,0), point A at (10,0). Then point B is somewhere in the plane. Let me find coordinates for B. Given that AB =5, BC=9, AC=10.\n\nSo coordinates of B must satisfy the distances from A (10,0) and C (0,0):\n\nLet\u2019s let coordinates of B be (x,y). Then,\n\nDistance from B to C: sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 9 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 81,\n\nDistance from B to A: sqrt( (x -10)^2 + y\u00b2 ) =5 \u21d2 (x -10)^2 + y\u00b2 =25.\n\nSubtract first equation from the second:\n\n(x -10)^2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =25 -81 \u21d2 (x\u00b2 -20x +100) -x\u00b2 = -56 \u21d2 -20x +100 = -56 \u21d2 -20x = -156 \u21d2 x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.\n\nSo x is 7.8, which is 39/5. Then, plugging back into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =81:\n\n(39/5)^2 + y\u00b2 =81,\n\nCalculating (39/5)^2: 39\u00b2=1521, so 1521/25 + y\u00b2 =81,\n\nThus y\u00b2 =81 - 1521/25 = (2025 -1521)/25 = 504/25 \u21d2 y = sqrt(504)/5.\n\nSimplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16*31.5? Wait 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but maybe better to factor it:\n\n504 = 16 * 31.5? Hmm, 504 divided by 4 is 126, divided by 4 again is 31.5. Not helpful. Let's see:\n\n504 = 8 * 63 = 8 * 7 * 9 = 8*7*9. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(8*7*9) = sqrt(8)*sqrt(7)*sqrt(9) = 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14). Wait, wait:\n\nWait 504 = 7*72 = 7*8*9 = 7*8*9. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(7*8*9) = sqrt(7)*sqrt(8)*sqrt(9) = 3*sqrt(56) = 3*sqrt(4*14) = 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6\u221a14. Wait, yes, that's right. So sqrt(504) is 6\u221a14. Therefore y = 6\u221a14 /5 \u2248 6*3.7417/5 \u2248 4.49, which matches the Asymptote code's coordinates (7.8, 4.4899). So that's correct.\n\nTherefore coordinates of B are (39/5, (6\u221a14)/5).\n\nAlright, now that I have coordinates for A, B, C, maybe I can find the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9, then find point D (intersection of tangents at B and C), then find equation of AD and its other intersection P with the circle, then compute AP.\n\nThis seems computational but doable.\n\nFirst, let's find the circumcircle equation. Since points A(10,0), B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), and C(0,0) lie on the circle.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nPlugging in point C (0,0):\n\n0 +0 +0 +0 + F =0 \u21d2 F=0.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0.\n\nNow plug in point A (10,0):\n\n10\u00b2 +0 +10D +0 =0 \u21d2 100 +10D =0 \u21d2 D = -10.\n\nNow plug in point B (39/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\n( (39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 ) + D*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) =0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 = (1521/25) + (36*14)/25 = (1521 + 504)/25 = 2025/25 = 81.\n\nThen D*(39/5) = (-10)*(39/5) = -78.\n\nE*(6\u221a14/5) term.\n\nSo altogether: 81 -78 + (6\u221a14/5) E =0 \u21d2 3 + (6\u221a14/5) E =0 \u21d2 (6\u221a14/5) E = -3 \u21d2 E = (-3)*(5)/(6\u221a14) = (-15)/(6\u221a14) = (-5)/(2\u221a14). Rationalize denominator:\n\nE = (-5)/(2\u221a14) * (\u221a14/\u221a14) = (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nThus the equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14)/28 y =0. Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, the general equation after plugging D and E is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + E y =0, right? Since D was -10 and E is the coefficient for y.\n\nWait, in the general equation, the coefficient for y is E, so plugging in E = (-5\u221a14)/28, so equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + [ (-5\u221a14)/28 ] y =0. Hmm, perhaps better to write in fractions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation here. Let me check again:\n\nThe equation after plugging in point B:\n\n( (39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 ) + D*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) =0.\n\nWe had (39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 = 81, correct. Then D is -10, so D*(39/5) is indeed -10*(39/5)= -78. Then:\n\n81 -78 + (6\u221a14/5)*E =0 \u21d2 3 + (6\u221a14/5)E =0 \u21d2 (6\u221a14/5)E = -3 \u21d2 E = (-3)*(5)/(6\u221a14) = -15/(6\u221a14) = -5/(2\u221a14). Yes, that's right. Then rationalizing gives E = (-5\u221a14)/28. Because multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\n-5/(2\u221a14) = (-5\u221a14)/(2*14) = (-5\u221a14)/28. Correct.\n\nSo the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14)/28 y =0. Hmm, this might be a bit messy, but okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can write it in standard form by completing the squares. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with x\u00b2 -10x + y\u00b2 - (5\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nFor the x terms: x\u00b2 -10x = (x -5)^2 -25.\n\nFor the y terms: y\u00b2 - (5\u221a14)/28 y. Let me denote coefficient of y is - (5\u221a14)/28. So half of that is - (5\u221a14)/56, square is (25*14)/(56\u00b2) ?\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\nLet me write the y terms:\n\ny\u00b2 - (5\u221a14)/28 y = y\u00b2 - (5\u221a14)/28 y + [ (5\u221a14/56)^2 ] - [ (5\u221a14/56)^2 ]\n\nCompleting the square:\n\n= [ y - (5\u221a14)/56 ]\u00b2 - ( (5\u221a14)/56 )\u00b2\n\nSo putting back into equation:\n\n(x -5)^2 -25 + [ y - (5\u221a14)/56 ]\u00b2 - ( (5\u221a14)/56 )\u00b2 =0\n\nThus,\n\n(x -5)^2 + [ y - (5\u221a14)/56 ]\u00b2 = 25 + ( (5\u221a14)/56 )\u00b2\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but maybe we can just proceed with coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps proceed step by step.\n\nWe need to find point D, the intersection of the tangents at B and C.\n\nFirst, let me find equations for the tangent lines at B and C.\n\nRecall that the tangent at a point (x\u2080,y\u2080) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is given by:\n\nxx\u2080 + yy\u2080 + D(x + x\u2080)/2 + E(y + y\u2080)/2 + F =0?\n\nWait, actually, the standard tangent line equation for a circle at point (x\u2080,y\u2080) is:\n\nFor circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r\u00b2, the tangent at (x\u2080,y\u2080) is (x\u2080 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2080 - k)(y -k ) = r\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, for the general equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0, the tangent at (x\u2080,y\u2080) is:\n\nxx\u2080 + yy\u2080 + D(x + x\u2080)/2 + E(y + y\u2080)/2 + F =0.\n\nWait, let me confirm this formula.\n\nYes, the tangent line at point (x\u2080, y\u2080) on the circle defined by x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is given by:\n\nxx\u2080 + yy\u2080 + D*(x + x\u2080)/2 + E*(y + y\u2080)/2 + F = 0.\n\nAlternatively, another way: the gradient at (x\u2080,y\u2080) is (2x\u2080 + D, 2y\u2080 + E), so the tangent line is perpendicular to this gradient. So the tangent line equation can be written as:\n\n(2x\u2080 + D)(x - x\u2080) + (2y\u2080 + E)(y - y\u2080) =0.\n\nBut perhaps the first formula is better here. Let me try both ways.\n\nAlternatively, since point C is (0,0). Let me find tangent at C first.\n\nSince C is (0,0). Plugging into the tangent formula:\n\nx*0 + y*0 + D*(x +0)/2 + E*(y +0)/2 + F =0 \u21d2 (D x)/2 + (E y)/2 + F =0.\n\nBut since point C is on the circle, so plugging into the circle equation: 0 +0 +0 +0 + F =0 \u21d2 F=0. So F is 0. Wait, in our case F was already 0 because C is on the circle and when we plugged in F=0.\n\nWait, actually in our equation earlier, after plugging in C(0,0), F=0. So the tangent at C is (D x)/2 + (E y)/2 +0 =0.\n\nGiven that D = -10, E = (-5\u221a14)/28,\n\nSo tangent at C is:\n\n(-10/2)x + [ (-5\u221a14)/28 / 2 ] y =0 \u21d2 -5x + [ (-5\u221a14)/56 ] y =0.\n\nWait, let me compute again:\n\nWait, the formula says:\n\nFor tangent at (x\u2080,y\u2080):\n\nxx\u2080 + yy\u2080 + D*(x +x\u2080)/2 + E*(y + y\u2080)/2 + F =0.\n\nSo for point C (0,0):\n\nx*0 + y*0 + D*(x +0)/2 + E*(y +0)/2 + F =0 \u21d2 (D/2)x + (E/2)y + F =0.\n\nSince F=0, that's (D/2)x + (E/2)y =0.\n\nSo D is -10, so ( -10/2 )x + ( E / 2 ) y =0 \u21d2 -5x + ( (-5\u221a14)/28 / 2 ) y =0? Wait, E is (-5\u221a14)/28, so E/2 is (-5\u221a14)/56. Thus,\n\n-5x + [ (-5\u221a14)/56 ] y =0.\n\nHmm, that's the tangent at C.\n\nSimilarly, tangent at point B (39/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\nUsing the tangent formula:\n\nx*(39/5) + y*(6\u221a14/5) + D*(x + 39/5)/2 + E*(y + 6\u221a14/5)/2 + F =0.\n\nAgain, F=0. Let me compute term by term.\n\nFirst term: (39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y\n\nSecond term: D*(x +39/5)/2 = (-10)*(x +39/5)/2 = (-10/2)(x +39/5) = -5*(x + 39/5) = -5x - 39.\n\nThird term: E*(y +6\u221a14/5)/2 = [ (-5\u221a14)/28 ]*(y +6\u221a14/5)/2 = [ (-5\u221a14)/56 ]*(y +6\u221a14/5 )\n\nFourth term: F=0.\n\nPutting all together:\n\n(39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y -5x -39 + [ (-5\u221a14)/56 ]*(y +6\u221a14/5 ) =0\n\nHmm, this is going to be complicated. Let me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, combine the x terms and y terms from the first two parts:\n\n(39/5 x -5x) + (6\u221a14/5 y) -39 + [ (-5\u221a14)/56 y + (-5\u221a14)/56 *6\u221a14/5 ) ] =0\n\nCompute 39/5 x -5x = (39/5 -25/5)x = 14/5 x.\n\nSimilarly, the y terms from first two parts are (6\u221a14/5)y.\n\nThen the third term's expansion:\n\n[ (-5\u221a14)/56 y ] and [ (-5\u221a14)/56 *6\u221a14/5 ]\n\nSo combine all terms:\n\n14/5 x + 6\u221a14/5 y -39 + [ (-5\u221a14)/56 y ] + [ (-5\u221a14 *6\u221a14)/(56*5) ) ] =0.\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst, the x term is 14/5 x.\n\nThe y terms: 6\u221a14/5 y + (-5\u221a14)/56 y.\n\nLet me get common denominators for the y coefficients.\n\nConvert 6\u221a14/5 to denominator 56: 6\u221a14/5 = (6\u221a14 * 56)/(5*56) = (336\u221a14)/280.\n\nWait, maybe better to compute numerically:\n\nLet me write coefficients:\n\n6\u221a14 /5 -5\u221a14 /56 = \u221a14*(6/5 -5/56) = \u221a14*( (6*56 -5*5)/ (5*56) )\n\nWait 6/5 -5/56 = (6*56 -5*5)/ (5*56) = (336 -25)/280 = 311/280.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n6/5 = 0.6, 5/56 \u22480.08928, so 0.6 -0.08928 \u22480.51072, but exact fractions:\n\n6/5 -5/56 = (6*56 -5*5)/(5*56)= (336 -25)/280 = 311/280. So yes.\n\nThus the coefficient of y is \u221a14*(311/280).\n\nWait, actually:\n\nWait, 6\u221a14/5 -5\u221a14/56 = \u221a14*(6/5 -5/56) = \u221a14*( (6*56 -5*5)/(5*56) ) = \u221a14*( (336 -25)/280 ) = \u221a14*(311/280). So that's the coefficient for y.\n\nNow the constant term:\n\n-39 + [ (-5\u221a14 *6\u221a14 ) / (56*5) ]\n\nCompute the second part:\n\n-5*6*(\u221a14)^2 / (56*5) = -30*(14)/ (280) = -420 /280 = -3/2.\n\nWait:\n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\nNumerator: (-5\u221a14)*(6\u221a14) = -5*6*(\u221a14)^2 = -30*(14) = -420.\n\nDenominator: 56*5 = 280.\n\nThus, the term is (-420)/280 = -1.5 = -3/2.\n\nTherefore, the constant term is -39 + (-3/2) = -39 -1.5 = -40.5 = -81/2.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nEquation of tangent at B is:\n\n(14/5)x + (\u221a14*(311/280)) y -81/2 =0.\n\nHmm, this is getting really messy. Maybe there's a better way to compute point D?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using parametric equations for the tangents?\n\nAlternatively, since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, perhaps we can use the fact that D lies along the polars of B and C?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that D is the exsymmedian or something? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates for B and C, maybe compute the equations of the tangents more carefully and then find their intersection D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using parametric coordinates for tangent lines.\n\nWait, another approach: the tangent at point B (x\u2081,y\u2081) on the circle can be written as:\n\nFor a general circle, the tangent at (x\u2081,y\u2081) is given by:\n\nxx\u2081 + yy\u2081 + D*(x +x\u2081)/2 + E*(y + y\u2081)/2 + F =0,\n\nas per the formula above.\n\nGiven that, let me recompute tangent at B with more care.\n\nGiven B is (39/5, 6\u221a14/5), D is -10, E is (-5\u221a14)/28, F is 0.\n\nThus, tangent at B:\n\nx*(39/5) + y*(6\u221a14/5) + (-10)*(x +39/5)/2 + [ (-5\u221a14)/28 ]*(y +6\u221a14/5)/2 =0.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step:\n\nFirst term: (39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y\n\nSecond term: (-10)/2*(x +39/5) = -5x - (5)*(39/5) = -5x -39\n\nThird term: [ (-5\u221a14)/28 ]*(y +6\u221a14/5)/2 = [ (-5\u221a14)/28 * (1/2) ]*(y +6\u221a14/5 ) = [ (-5\u221a14)/56 ]*(y +6\u221a14/5 )\n\nSo expanding this third term:\n\n= (-5\u221a14)/56 * y + (-5\u221a14)/56 * (6\u221a14/5 )\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst part: (-5\u221a14)/56 * y\n\nSecond part: (-5\u221a14 *6\u221a14)/(56*5) = (-30*(14))/(280) = (-420)/280 = -1.5 = -3/2\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\nFirst term: (39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y\n\nSecond term: -5x -39\n\nThird term: (-5\u221a14/56)y - 3/2\n\nNow combine like terms:\n\nFor x terms:\n\n(39/5)x -5x = (39/5 -25/5)x = (14/5)x\n\nFor y terms:\n\n(6\u221a14/5)y - (5\u221a14/56)y\n\nTo combine these, let me get common denominators. Let's convert 6/5 to 56 denominator:\n\n6/5 = (6*56)/(5*56) = 336/280\n\nSimilarly, 5/56 stays as 5/56 = 25/280\n\nWait, actually coefficients are:\n\n6\u221a14 /5 -5\u221a14 /56 = \u221a14*(6/5 -5/56)\n\nCompute 6/5 -5/56 = (6*56 -5*5)/(5*56) = (336 -25)/280 = 311/280.\n\nTherefore the y terms are \u221a14*(311/280)y.\n\nConstant terms:\n\n-39 - 3/2 = - (39 +1.5 ) = -40.5 = -81/2\n\nSo overall equation of tangent at B is:\n\n(14/5)x + (\u221a14*(311/280))y -81/2 =0.\n\nHmm, this seems correct but is quite complicated. Let me see the tangent at C first.\n\nEarlier, tangent at C was:\n\n-5x + [ (-5\u221a14)/56 ]y =0.\n\nWait, let me rewrite tangent at C equation:\n\nFrom earlier, tangent at C: (D/2)x + (E/2)y =0,\n\nWith D =-10, E= -5\u221a14/28,\n\nSo: (-10/2)x + (-5\u221a14/(28*2))y =0,\n\nWhich is -5x + (-5\u221a14/56)y =0,\n\nSo rearranged: 5x + (5\u221a14/56)y =0. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the equation was (D/2)x + (E/2)y =0,\n\nSo with D=-10, E = -5\u221a14/28,\n\nSo: (-10/2)x + ( (-5\u221a14/28)/2 )y =0 \u21d2 -5x - (5\u221a14)/(56)y =0 \u21d2 5x + (5\u221a14/56)y =0.\n\nWait, so tangent at C is 5x + (5\u221a14/56)y =0.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me recompute tangent at C:\n\nUsing the formula for tangent at (0,0):\n\nxx\u2080 + yy\u2080 + D(x +x\u2080)/2 + E(y + y\u2080)/2 + F =0,\n\nWhich with x\u2080 =0, y\u2080=0 gives:\n\n0 +0 + D*(x)/2 + E*(y)/2 +0 =0 \u21d2 (D/2)x + (E/2)y =0,\n\nSo D is -10, so (-10/2)x + (E/2)y =0 \u21d2 -5x + [ (-5\u221a14/28)/2 ]y =0 \u21d2 -5x - (5\u221a14)/56 y =0 \u21d2 5x + (5\u221a14)/56 y =0. Yes, so that's tangent at C.\n\nSo tangent at C: 5x + (5\u221a14)/56 y =0.\n\nSimilarly, tangent at B is the equation we had above:\n\n(14/5)x + (\u221a14*(311/280))y -81/2 =0.\n\nHmm, so to find point D, the intersection of these two tangents.\n\nLet me denote the two equations:\n\n1. 5x + (5\u221a14)/56 y =0 (from tangent at C)\n\n2. (14/5)x + ( (311\u221a14)/280 )y = 81/2 (from tangent at B, moving constants to RHS)\n\nFirst, let me simplify equation 1:\n\nEquation 1: 5x + (5\u221a14/56)y =0 \u21d2 divide both sides by 5:\n\nx + (\u221a14/56)y =0 \u21d2 x = - (\u221a14/56)y.\n\nSo from equation 1, x = - (\u221a14 /56)y. Let me call this equation 1a.\n\nNow substitute x from equation 1a into equation 2:\n\n(14/5)*( -\u221a14/56 y ) + (311\u221a14/280)y =81/2.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term:\n\n(14/5)*( -\u221a14/56 y ) = (14 /5) * (-\u221a14)/56 * y = (14 * -\u221a14 ) / (5*56) * y.\n\nSimplify 14/56 = 1/4, so this becomes ( -\u221a14 )/(5*4) * y = (-\u221a14 /20 ) y.\n\nSecond term:\n\n(311\u221a14 /280 ) y.\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\n[ (-\u221a14/20 ) + (311\u221a14 /280 ) ] y =81/2.\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (-1/20 + 311/280 ) ] y =81/2.\n\nCompute the bracket term:\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 280:\n\n-1/20 = -14/280,\n\nSo -14/280 +311/280 = ( -14 +311 ) /280 = 297/280.\n\nThus:\n\n\u221a14*(297/280)* y =81/2.\n\nSolve for y:\n\ny = (81/2) / ( \u221a14 *297/280 )\n\nSimplify:\n\ny = (81/2) * (280)/(297\u221a14 )\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\n81 and 297: 297 = 81*3.5? Wait, 81*3=243, 81*3.5=283.5, no. Wait 297 \u00f781= 3.666\u2026 Wait, actually 81*3=243, 297-243=54, so 81*3 +54 =297, but 54 is 81*(2/3). Hmm, maybe factor 81 and 297:\n\n81 = 9^2, 297=9*33=9*3*11. So GCD(81,297)=9*3=27.\n\nSimilarly, 280 and 2: 280 divisible by 2, so divide numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nNumerator: 81 *280\n\nDenominator: 2 *297 *\u221a14\n\nSo,\n\ny = (81 *280)/(2*297\u221a14 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: denominator becomes 297\u221a14, numerator 81*140.\n\nSo y = (81*140)/(297\u221a14 )\n\nSimplify 81 and 297: GCD 27.\n\n81 \u00f727=3, 297 \u00f727=11.\n\nSo,\n\ny = (3*140)/(11\u221a14 ) = (420)/(11\u221a14 )\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\ny = (420\u221a14 )/(11*14 ) = (420/14)*(\u221a14)/11 = 30*(\u221a14)/11 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nThus y = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nNow substitute back into equation 1a: x = - (\u221a14 /56 ) y.\n\nSo,\n\nx = - (\u221a14 /56 ) * (30\u221a14)/11 = - (30*14 )/(56*11 )\n\nBecause \u221a14*\u221a14 =14.\n\nThus,\n\nx = - (420)/(56*11 ) = - (420)/(616 )\n\nSimplify 420/616: divide numerator and denominator by 28: 420 \u00f728=15, 616 \u00f728=22.\n\nThus, x = -15/22.\n\nTherefore coordinates of D are ( -15/22, 30\u221a14/11 ).\n\nHmm, that seems okay. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, let me recheck the substitution step:\n\ny = (30\u221a14)/11,\n\nthen x = - (\u221a14 /56) * y = - (\u221a14 /56)*(30\u221a14 /11 ) = - [ (30 *14 ) / (56*11) ) ] because \u221a14 *\u221a14 =14,\n\nSo numerator: 30*14 = 420,\n\nDenominator:56*11=616,\n\nThus x= -420/616 = -15/22. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo D is at ( -15/22, 30\u221a14 /11 ).\n\nNow, need to find equation of line AD. Since A is at (10,0) and D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14 /11 ).\n\nLet me compute the parametric equations for line AD.\n\nParametrize from A to D. Let parameter t go from 0 to 1.\n\nThe vector from A to D is ( -15/22 -10, 30\u221a14 /11 -0 ) = ( - (15/22 + 220/22 ), 30\u221a14 /11 ) = ( -235/22, 30\u221a14 /11 ).\n\nThus parametric equations:\n\nx(t) =10 + t*( -235/22 -10 )? Wait, no:\n\nWait parametric equations starting at A(10,0):\n\nx(t) =10 + t*( Dx - Ax ) =10 + t*(-15/22 -10) =10 + t*(- (15 +220)/22 ) =10 - (235/22) t,\n\nSimilarly y(t) =0 + t*( Dy - Ay ) =0 + t*(30\u221a14 /11 -0 ) = (30\u221a14 /11 ) t.\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of line AD with the circle \u03c9, besides A.\n\nSo we can substitute x(t) and y(t) into the circle equation and solve for t \u22600 (since t=0 is point A).\n\nThe circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nPlugging in x(t) and y(t):\n\n[ x(t) ]\u00b2 + [ y(t) ]\u00b2 -10x(t) - (5\u221a14)/28 y(t) =0.\n\nLet me substitute:\n\nFirst compute [x(t)]\u00b2 = [10 - (235/22)t]^2,\n\n[ y(t) ]\u00b2 = [ (30\u221a14 /11 ) t ]\u00b2,\n\n-10x(t) = -10*(10 - (235/22)t ),\n\n- (5\u221a14)/28 y(t) = - (5\u221a14)/28 * (30\u221a14 /11 ) t.\n\nThis will be messy but let's proceed step by step.\n\nLet me denote t as variable, let me expand each term.\n\nFirst term: [10 - (235/22)t]^2 =100 - 2*10*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t\u00b2 = 100 - (4700/22)t + (235\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) t\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: [ (30\u221a14 /11 ) t ]\u00b2 = (900*14)/121 t\u00b2 = (12600)/121 t\u00b2.\n\nThird term: -10*(10 - (235/22)t ) = -100 + (2350/22)t.\n\nFourth term: - (5\u221a14)/28 * (30\u221a14 /11 ) t.\n\nCompute that term:\n\nMultiply constants:\n\n5*30 =150,\n\n\u221a14 *\u221a14 =14,\n\nThus numerator: 150*14 =2100,\n\nDenominator:28*11=308,\n\nSo term is - (2100)/(308) t.\n\nSimplify 2100/308: divide numerator and denominator by 4: 525/77. So - (525/77 ) t.\n\nPutting all terms together:\n\nFirst term: 100 - (4700/22)t + (235\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) t\u00b2,\n\nSecond term: +12600/121 t\u00b2,\n\nThird term: -100 + (2350/22)t,\n\nFourth term: -525/77 t.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nConstants: 100 -100 =0.\n\nTerms with t:\n\n[ -4700/22 +2350/22 -525/77 ] t\n\nTerms with t\u00b2:\n\n[ (235\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) +12600/121 ] t\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst, the t terms:\n\nFirst, combine the first two coefficients:\n\n-4700/22 +2350/22 = (-4700 +2350)/22 = (-2350)/22.\n\nThen subtract 525/77:\n\nSo total coefficient: (-2350/22) - (525/77).\n\nTo combine these, find common denominator of 22 and 77, which is 154 (22*7=154, 77*2=154).\n\nConvert -2350/22 = (-2350*7)/154 = -16450/154,\n\nConvert -525/77 = (-525*2)/154 = -1050/154,\n\nTotal: (-16450 -1050)/154 = (-17500)/154 = -17500/154 = can simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 14: 17500/14=1250, 154/14=11,\n\nThus -1250/11.\n\nWait let me check:\n\nWait 17500 divided by 14 is 17500/14 = 1250,\n\n154 divided by14 is 11. So yes, so -1250/11.\n\nTherefore the coefficient of t is -1250/11.\n\nNow the t\u00b2 terms:\n\nFirst term: (235)^2 / (22)^2,\n\nSecond term: 12600 /121.\n\nNote that 22\u00b2=484, 121=11\u00b2, so 121 is 22\u00b2/4? Not sure, but let's compute:\n\n(235)^2 =235*235. Let me compute that:\n\n200\u00b2=40000, 35\u00b2=1225, 2*200*35=14000,\n\nThus (200+35)^2 =40000+14000 +1225= 55225.\n\nTherefore (235)^2 =55225,\n\nThus first term: 55225/(22\u00b2)=55225/484.\n\nSecond term:12600/121 =12600/(11\u00b2).\n\nTo add these, need common denominator. Let me note that 484=44\u00b2= (4*11)^2=16*121.\n\nThus 484=4*121. So 55225/484 =55225/(4*121),\n\nand 12600/121 = (12600*4)/(4*121)=50400/(4*121).\n\nThus total t\u00b2 coefficient:\n\n[55225 +50400]/(4*121) = (105625)/(484).\n\nWait let me verify:\n\nWait, 55225/(4*121) +12600/121 = [55225 + (12600*4)]/(4*121)\n\nYes, because 12600/121 = (12600*4)/(4*121). So:\n\nNumerator:55225 + 50400 =105625,\n\nDenominator:4*121=484.\n\nThus the coefficient of t\u00b2 is 105625 /484.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n(105625 /484 ) t\u00b2 - (1250/11 ) t =0.\n\nFactor out t:\n\nt [ (105625 /484 ) t - 1250/11 ] =0.\n\nSolutions are t=0 (point A) and t= (1250/11 ) / (105625 /484 )\n\nCompute the second solution:\n\nt = (1250/11 ) * (484 /105625 )\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\nFirst, note that 484=4*121=4*11\u00b2,\n\nSo 484 /105625 = (4*11\u00b2)/105625,\n\nAlso, 1250/11 *4*11\u00b2 =1250*4*11,\n\nThus,\n\nt= (1250*4*11)/105625 = (5000*11)/105625.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n5000*11 =55000,\n\nDenominator 105625.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25:\n\n55000 /25 =2200,\n\n105625 /25=4225.\n\nSo t=2200/4225.\n\nSimplify further:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: 2200/25=88, 4225/25=169.\n\nThus t=88/169.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait 2200 \u00f725 is indeed 88, and 4225 \u00f725 is 169. So yes, so t=88/169.\n\nTherefore, the parameter t corresponding to point P is 88/169.\n\nThus coordinates of P are:\n\nx(t)=10 - (235/22)*(88/169),\n\ny(t)= (30\u221a14 /11)*(88/169).\n\nCompute x(t):\n\nFirst, 235/22 *88/169:\n\n235 and 22: 22 divides into 88 four times. So 88/22=4,\n\nThus, 235 *4 /169 =940/169,\n\nSo x(t)=10 -940/169 = (1690 -940)/169 =750/169.\n\nSimilarly, y(t)= (30\u221a14 /11)*(88/169).\n\nSimplify:\n\n30 and 11: no common factors with 88. 88/11=8,\n\nThus,\n\n30\u221a14 *8 /169 =240\u221a14 /169.\n\nThus coordinates of P are (750/169, 240\u221a14 /169).\n\nNow need to compute the distance AP.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point P is at (750/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nCompute the distance between them:\n\nAP = sqrt[ ( (750/169 -10)^2 + (240\u221a14/169 -0)^2 ) ]\n\nFirst compute 750/169 -10 = (750 -10*169)/169 = (750 -1690)/169 = (-940)/169.\n\nThus the x-coordinate difference squared: ( -940/169 )\u00b2 = (940\u00b2)/(169\u00b2).\n\nThe y-coordinate squared: (240\u221a14 /169 )\u00b2 = (240\u00b2 *14)/169\u00b2.\n\nThus,\n\nAP\u00b2 = [940\u00b2 +240\u00b2*14 ] /169\u00b2.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nFirst compute 940\u00b2:\n\n940\u00b2 = (900 +40)^2 =900\u00b2 +2*900*40 +40\u00b2 =810000 +72000 +1600 =883,200 +1600=884,800.\n\nWait let me compute step by step:\n\n900\u00b2=810,000,\n\n2*900*40= 2*36,000=72,000,\n\n40\u00b2=1,600,\n\nTotal: 810,000 +72,000 =882,000 +1,600=883,600. Wait, 810k +72k is 882k, plus 1.6k is 883,600.\n\nWait, but 940^2 is actually (94)^2 *100. Let me compute 94^2:\n\n94^2 = (90+4)^2 =8100 + 720 +16= 8100+720=8820 +16=8836. So 940^2=8836*100=883,600. Yes, correct.\n\nNow 240\u00b2*14:\n\n240\u00b2=57,600,\n\n57,600 *14 = 57,600*10 +57,600*4 =576,000 +230,400=806,400.\n\nThus numerator is 883,600 +806,400 =1,690,000.\n\nTherefore AP\u00b2 =1,690,000 / (169\u00b2).\n\nCompute sqrt(AP\u00b2)= sqrt(1,690,000)/169.\n\nsqrt(1,690,000)=sqrt(1690 *1000)=sqrt(1690)*sqrt(1000)= sqrt(169*10)*sqrt(1000)=13*sqrt(10)*10*sqrt(10)=13*10*10=1300. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait sqrt(1,690,000)=sqrt(1,690,000)=sqrt(1690000)=sqrt(16900*100)=sqrt(16900)*sqrt(100)=130*10=1300.\n\nYes, so sqrt(1,690,000)=1300.\n\nThus AP=1300 /169.\n\nSimplify 1300 divided by 169:\n\nSince 169 is 13\u00b2=169,\n\n1300 \u00f713=100, so 1300=13*100,\n\nThus 1300/169= (13*100)/(13\u00b2)=100/13.\n\nTherefore AP=100/13.\n\nHence m=100, n=13, which are coprime. Thus m +n=113.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward? Let me verify once again.\n\nWait AP squared was 1,690,000 divided by (169)^2. Since 169^2= (13^2)^2=13^4=28561.\n\nWait but 1,690,000 divided by 28561 equals (1300)^2/(169)^2= (1300/169)^2, so sqrt of that is 1300/169.\n\nBut 1300 divided by 169: 169*7=1183, 169*7.7=169*7 +169*0.7=1183+118.3=1301.3. Close but not exact. Wait, perhaps miscalculation?\n\nWait, wait. Wait 1300 divided by 169:\n\nSince 169*7=1183,\n\n1300-1183=117,\n\n169*0.7=118.3, which is more than 117.\n\nWait, 169*6.5=169*6 +169*0.5=1014 +84.5=1098.5, not helpful.\n\nWait perhaps 1300 divided by 169:\n\n169 \u00d77 = 1183,\n\n169\u00d77.7 =169*(7 +0.7)=1183 +118.3=1301.3, which is over.\n\nHmm, so perhaps my previous step was wrong.\n\nWait, AP squared is (1,690,000)/(169)^2.\n\nWait 1,690,000 =1690 *1000 =169*10*1000=169*10,000,\n\nWait wait 169*10,000=1,690,000,\n\nThus AP squared is (169 *10,000)/(169)^2)=10,000 /169,\n\nThus AP is sqrt(10,000/169)=100/13. Ah, that's correct! Because 169*100 =16,900, but wait:\n\nWait, 169 \u00d710,000 is 1,690,000, yes.\n\nSo numerator is 169\u00d710,000,\n\ndenominator is (169)^2,\n\nso AP squared is 10,000/169,\n\nso AP is 100/13. Yes, that's correct. So I made a mistake in my intermediate step where I thought of 1300/169, but actually sqrt(1,690,000)=sqrt(169*10,000)=13*100=1300, so numerator sqrt is 1300, denominator is 169, so 1300/169 = (13*100)/(13*13)=100/13. Yes, correct.\n\nTherefore AP=100/13, so m=100, n=13, sum is 113.\n\nTherefore the answer is 113.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{113}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let me see. I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents at B and C meet at D, and AD intersects the circle again at P. The sides are given as AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with tangents and circles, the power of a point theorem might be useful here. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then DB and DC are both tangent to the circle \u03c9. So, the power of point D with respect to \u03c9 should be equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2. That might come into play.\n\nAlso, since AD intersects the circle again at P, maybe I can use some properties related to intersecting chords or something else. Alternatively, perhaps using harmonic division or projective geometry concepts? Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates or trigonometry? Let me think. Since we have triangle sides given, maybe using the Law of Cosines to find angles, then coordinates?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use inversion? Hmm, inversion might complicate things. Let me see if there's a more straightforward approach.\n\nWait, there's a theorem called the pole and polar. The point D is the pole of line BC with respect to the circle \u03c9? Wait, no. The polar of D would be the line BC because the tangents from D touch at B and C. So, the polar of D is BC. Therefore, points on BC have some relation to lines through D? Maybe not immediately helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, since AD passes through P, and we need AP, perhaps using power of a point from A? Wait, but A is on the circle, so its power is zero. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, use Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem? Maybe with some triangle and a transversal?\n\nAlternatively, using coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place the triangle in coordinate plane. Let me set point C at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Let me let point A be at (10,0) since AC is 10. Then point B is somewhere in the plane. Let me denote coordinates as follows:\n\nLet me denote coordinates:\n\nLet\u2019s let point C be at (0,0), point A at (10,0). Then point B is somewhere in the plane. Let me find coordinates for B. Given that AB =5, BC=9, AC=10.\n\nSo coordinates of B must satisfy the distances from A (10,0) and C (0,0):\n\nLet\u2019s let coordinates of B be (x,y). Then,\n\nDistance from B to C: sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 9 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 81,\n\nDistance from B to A: sqrt( (x -10)^2 + y\u00b2 ) =5 \u21d2 (x -10)^2 + y\u00b2 =25.\n\nSubtract first equation from the second:\n\n(x -10)^2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =25 -81 \u21d2 (x\u00b2 -20x +100) -x\u00b2 = -56 \u21d2 -20x +100 = -56 \u21d2 -20x = -156 \u21d2 x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.\n\nSo x is 7.8, which is 39/5. Then, plugging back into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =81:\n\n(39/5)^2 + y\u00b2 =81,\n\nCalculating (39/5)^2: 39\u00b2=1521, so 1521/25 + y\u00b2 =81,\n\nThus y\u00b2 =81 - 1521/25 = (2025 -1521)/25 = 504/25 \u21d2 y = sqrt(504)/5.\n\nSimplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16*31.5? Wait 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but maybe better to factor it:\n\n504 = 16 * 31.5? Hmm, 504 divided by 4 is 126, divided by 4 again is 31.5. Not helpful. Let's see:\n\n504 = 8 * 63 = 8 * 7 * 9 = 8*7*9. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(8*7*9) = sqrt(8)*sqrt(7)*sqrt(9) = 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14). Wait, wait:\n\nWait 504 = 7*72 = 7*8*9 = 7*8*9. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(7*8*9) = sqrt(7)*sqrt(8)*sqrt(9) = 3*sqrt(56) = 3*sqrt(4*14) = 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6\u221a14. Wait, yes, that's right. So sqrt(504) is 6\u221a14. Therefore y = 6\u221a14 /5 \u2248 6*3.7417/5 \u2248 4.49, which matches the Asymptote code's coordinates (7.8, 4.4899). So that's correct.\n\nTherefore coordinates of B are (39/5, (6\u221a14)/5).\n\nAlright, now that I have coordinates for A, B, C, maybe I can find the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9, then find point D (intersection of tangents at B and C), then find equation of AD and its other intersection P with the circle, then compute AP.\n\nThis seems computational but doable.\n\nFirst, let's find the circumcircle equation. Since points A(10,0), B(39/5, 6\u221a14/5), and C(0,0) lie on the circle.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nPlugging in point C (0,0):\n\n0 +0 +0 +0 + F =0 \u21d2 F=0.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0.\n\nNow plug in point A (10,0):\n\n10\u00b2 +0 +10D +0 =0 \u21d2 100 +10D =0 \u21d2 D = -10.\n\nNow plug in point B (39/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\n( (39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 ) + D*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) =0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 = (1521/25) + (36*14)/25 = (1521 + 504)/25 = 2025/25 = 81.\n\nThen D*(39/5) = (-10)*(39/5) = -78.\n\nE*(6\u221a14/5) term.\n\nSo altogether: 81 -78 + (6\u221a14/5) E =0 \u21d2 3 + (6\u221a14/5) E =0 \u21d2 (6\u221a14/5) E = -3 \u21d2 E = (-3)*(5)/(6\u221a14) = (-15)/(6\u221a14) = (-5)/(2\u221a14). Rationalize denominator:\n\nE = (-5)/(2\u221a14) * (\u221a14/\u221a14) = (-5\u221a14)/28.\n\nThus the equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14)/28 y =0. Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, the general equation after plugging D and E is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + E y =0, right? Since D was -10 and E is the coefficient for y.\n\nWait, in the general equation, the coefficient for y is E, so plugging in E = (-5\u221a14)/28, so equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + [ (-5\u221a14)/28 ] y =0. Hmm, perhaps better to write in fractions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation here. Let me check again:\n\nThe equation after plugging in point B:\n\n( (39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 ) + D*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) =0.\n\nWe had (39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 = 81, correct. Then D is -10, so D*(39/5) is indeed -10*(39/5)= -78. Then:\n\n81 -78 + (6\u221a14/5)*E =0 \u21d2 3 + (6\u221a14/5)E =0 \u21d2 (6\u221a14/5)E = -3 \u21d2 E = (-3)*(5)/(6\u221a14) = -15/(6\u221a14) = -5/(2\u221a14). Yes, that's right. Then rationalizing gives E = (-5\u221a14)/28. Because multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\n-5/(2\u221a14) = (-5\u221a14)/(2*14) = (-5\u221a14)/28. Correct.\n\nSo the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14)/28 y =0. Hmm, this might be a bit messy, but okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can write it in standard form by completing the squares. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with x\u00b2 -10x + y\u00b2 - (5\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nFor the x terms: x\u00b2 -10x = (x -5)^2 -25.\n\nFor the y terms: y\u00b2 - (5\u221a14)/28 y. Let me denote coefficient of y is - (5\u221a14)/28. So half of that is - (5\u221a14)/56, square is (25*14)/(56\u00b2) ?\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\nLet me write the y terms:\n\ny\u00b2 - (5\u221a14)/28 y = y\u00b2 - (5\u221a14)/28 y + [ (5\u221a14/56)^2 ] - [ (5\u221a14/56)^2 ]\n\nCompleting the square:\n\n= [ y - (5\u221a14)/56 ]\u00b2 - ( (5\u221a14)/56 )\u00b2\n\nSo putting back into equation:\n\n(x -5)^2 -25 + [ y - (5\u221a14)/56 ]\u00b2 - ( (5\u221a14)/56 )\u00b2 =0\n\nThus,\n\n(x -5)^2 + [ y - (5\u221a14)/56 ]\u00b2 = 25 + ( (5\u221a14)/56 )\u00b2\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but maybe we can just proceed with coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps proceed step by step.\n\nWe need to find point D, the intersection of the tangents at B and C.\n\nFirst, let me find equations for the tangent lines at B and C.\n\nRecall that the tangent at a point (x\u2080,y\u2080) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is given by:\n\nxx\u2080 + yy\u2080 + D(x + x\u2080)/2 + E(y + y\u2080)/2 + F =0?\n\nWait, actually, the standard tangent line equation for a circle at point (x\u2080,y\u2080) is:\n\nFor circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r\u00b2, the tangent at (x\u2080,y\u2080) is (x\u2080 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2080 - k)(y -k ) = r\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, for the general equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0, the tangent at (x\u2080,y\u2080) is:\n\nxx\u2080 + yy\u2080 + D(x + x\u2080)/2 + E(y + y\u2080)/2 + F =0.\n\nWait, let me confirm this formula.\n\nYes, the tangent line at point (x\u2080, y\u2080) on the circle defined by x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is given by:\n\nxx\u2080 + yy\u2080 + D*(x + x\u2080)/2 + E*(y + y\u2080)/2 + F = 0.\n\nAlternatively, another way: the gradient at (x\u2080,y\u2080) is (2x\u2080 + D, 2y\u2080 + E), so the tangent line is perpendicular to this gradient. So the tangent line equation can be written as:\n\n(2x\u2080 + D)(x - x\u2080) + (2y\u2080 + E)(y - y\u2080) =0.\n\nBut perhaps the first formula is better here. Let me try both ways.\n\nAlternatively, since point C is (0,0). Let me find tangent at C first.\n\nSince C is (0,0). Plugging into the tangent formula:\n\nx*0 + y*0 + D*(x +0)/2 + E*(y +0)/2 + F =0 \u21d2 (D x)/2 + (E y)/2 + F =0.\n\nBut since point C is on the circle, so plugging into the circle equation: 0 +0 +0 +0 + F =0 \u21d2 F=0. So F is 0. Wait, in our case F was already 0 because C is on the circle and when we plugged in F=0.\n\nWait, actually in our equation earlier, after plugging in C(0,0), F=0. So the tangent at C is (D x)/2 + (E y)/2 +0 =0.\n\nGiven that D = -10, E = (-5\u221a14)/28,\n\nSo tangent at C is:\n\n(-10/2)x + [ (-5\u221a14)/28 / 2 ] y =0 \u21d2 -5x + [ (-5\u221a14)/56 ] y =0.\n\nWait, let me compute again:\n\nWait, the formula says:\n\nFor tangent at (x\u2080,y\u2080):\n\nxx\u2080 + yy\u2080 + D*(x +x\u2080)/2 + E*(y + y\u2080)/2 + F =0.\n\nSo for point C (0,0):\n\nx*0 + y*0 + D*(x +0)/2 + E*(y +0)/2 + F =0 \u21d2 (D/2)x + (E/2)y + F =0.\n\nSince F=0, that's (D/2)x + (E/2)y =0.\n\nSo D is -10, so ( -10/2 )x + ( E / 2 ) y =0 \u21d2 -5x + ( (-5\u221a14)/28 / 2 ) y =0? Wait, E is (-5\u221a14)/28, so E/2 is (-5\u221a14)/56. Thus,\n\n-5x + [ (-5\u221a14)/56 ] y =0.\n\nHmm, that's the tangent at C.\n\nSimilarly, tangent at point B (39/5, 6\u221a14/5):\n\nUsing the tangent formula:\n\nx*(39/5) + y*(6\u221a14/5) + D*(x + 39/5)/2 + E*(y + 6\u221a14/5)/2 + F =0.\n\nAgain, F=0. Let me compute term by term.\n\nFirst term: (39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y\n\nSecond term: D*(x +39/5)/2 = (-10)*(x +39/5)/2 = (-10/2)(x +39/5) = -5*(x + 39/5) = -5x - 39.\n\nThird term: E*(y +6\u221a14/5)/2 = [ (-5\u221a14)/28 ]*(y +6\u221a14/5)/2 = [ (-5\u221a14)/56 ]*(y +6\u221a14/5 )\n\nFourth term: F=0.\n\nPutting all together:\n\n(39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y -5x -39 + [ (-5\u221a14)/56 ]*(y +6\u221a14/5 ) =0\n\nHmm, this is going to be complicated. Let me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, combine the x terms and y terms from the first two parts:\n\n(39/5 x -5x) + (6\u221a14/5 y) -39 + [ (-5\u221a14)/56 y + (-5\u221a14)/56 *6\u221a14/5 ) ] =0\n\nCompute 39/5 x -5x = (39/5 -25/5)x = 14/5 x.\n\nSimilarly, the y terms from first two parts are (6\u221a14/5)y.\n\nThen the third term's expansion:\n\n[ (-5\u221a14)/56 y ] and [ (-5\u221a14)/56 *6\u221a14/5 ]\n\nSo combine all terms:\n\n14/5 x + 6\u221a14/5 y -39 + [ (-5\u221a14)/56 y ] + [ (-5\u221a14 *6\u221a14)/(56*5) ) ] =0.\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst, the x term is 14/5 x.\n\nThe y terms: 6\u221a14/5 y + (-5\u221a14)/56 y.\n\nLet me get common denominators for the y coefficients.\n\nConvert 6\u221a14/5 to denominator 56: 6\u221a14/5 = (6\u221a14 * 56)/(5*56) = (336\u221a14)/280.\n\nWait, maybe better to compute numerically:\n\nLet me write coefficients:\n\n6\u221a14 /5 -5\u221a14 /56 = \u221a14*(6/5 -5/56) = \u221a14*( (6*56 -5*5)/ (5*56) )\n\nWait 6/5 -5/56 = (6*56 -5*5)/ (5*56) = (336 -25)/280 = 311/280.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n6/5 = 0.6, 5/56 \u22480.08928, so 0.6 -0.08928 \u22480.51072, but exact fractions:\n\n6/5 -5/56 = (6*56 -5*5)/(5*56)= (336 -25)/280 = 311/280. So yes.\n\nThus the coefficient of y is \u221a14*(311/280).\n\nWait, actually:\n\nWait, 6\u221a14/5 -5\u221a14/56 = \u221a14*(6/5 -5/56) = \u221a14*( (6*56 -5*5)/(5*56) ) = \u221a14*( (336 -25)/280 ) = \u221a14*(311/280). So that's the coefficient for y.\n\nNow the constant term:\n\n-39 + [ (-5\u221a14 *6\u221a14 ) / (56*5) ]\n\nCompute the second part:\n\n-5*6*(\u221a14)^2 / (56*5) = -30*(14)/ (280) = -420 /280 = -3/2.\n\nWait:\n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\nNumerator: (-5\u221a14)*(6\u221a14) = -5*6*(\u221a14)^2 = -30*(14) = -420.\n\nDenominator: 56*5 = 280.\n\nThus, the term is (-420)/280 = -1.5 = -3/2.\n\nTherefore, the constant term is -39 + (-3/2) = -39 -1.5 = -40.5 = -81/2.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nEquation of tangent at B is:\n\n(14/5)x + (\u221a14*(311/280)) y -81/2 =0.\n\nHmm, this is getting really messy. Maybe there's a better way to compute point D?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using parametric equations for the tangents?\n\nAlternatively, since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, perhaps we can use the fact that D lies along the polars of B and C?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that D is the exsymmedian or something? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates for B and C, maybe compute the equations of the tangents more carefully and then find their intersection D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using parametric coordinates for tangent lines.\n\nWait, another approach: the tangent at point B (x\u2081,y\u2081) on the circle can be written as:\n\nFor a general circle, the tangent at (x\u2081,y\u2081) is given by:\n\nxx\u2081 + yy\u2081 + D*(x +x\u2081)/2 + E*(y + y\u2081)/2 + F =0,\n\nas per the formula above.\n\nGiven that, let me recompute tangent at B with more care.\n\nGiven B is (39/5, 6\u221a14/5), D is -10, E is (-5\u221a14)/28, F is 0.\n\nThus, tangent at B:\n\nx*(39/5) + y*(6\u221a14/5) + (-10)*(x +39/5)/2 + [ (-5\u221a14)/28 ]*(y +6\u221a14/5)/2 =0.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step:\n\nFirst term: (39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y\n\nSecond term: (-10)/2*(x +39/5) = -5x - (5)*(39/5) = -5x -39\n\nThird term: [ (-5\u221a14)/28 ]*(y +6\u221a14/5)/2 = [ (-5\u221a14)/28 * (1/2) ]*(y +6\u221a14/5 ) = [ (-5\u221a14)/56 ]*(y +6\u221a14/5 )\n\nSo expanding this third term:\n\n= (-5\u221a14)/56 * y + (-5\u221a14)/56 * (6\u221a14/5 )\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst part: (-5\u221a14)/56 * y\n\nSecond part: (-5\u221a14 *6\u221a14)/(56*5) = (-30*(14))/(280) = (-420)/280 = -1.5 = -3/2\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\nFirst term: (39/5)x + (6\u221a14/5)y\n\nSecond term: -5x -39\n\nThird term: (-5\u221a14/56)y - 3/2\n\nNow combine like terms:\n\nFor x terms:\n\n(39/5)x -5x = (39/5 -25/5)x = (14/5)x\n\nFor y terms:\n\n(6\u221a14/5)y - (5\u221a14/56)y\n\nTo combine these, let me get common denominators. Let's convert 6/5 to 56 denominator:\n\n6/5 = (6*56)/(5*56) = 336/280\n\nSimilarly, 5/56 stays as 5/56 = 25/280\n\nWait, actually coefficients are:\n\n6\u221a14 /5 -5\u221a14 /56 = \u221a14*(6/5 -5/56)\n\nCompute 6/5 -5/56 = (6*56 -5*5)/(5*56) = (336 -25)/280 = 311/280.\n\nTherefore the y terms are \u221a14*(311/280)y.\n\nConstant terms:\n\n-39 - 3/2 = - (39 +1.5 ) = -40.5 = -81/2\n\nSo overall equation of tangent at B is:\n\n(14/5)x + (\u221a14*(311/280))y -81/2 =0.\n\nHmm, this seems correct but is quite complicated. Let me see the tangent at C first.\n\nEarlier, tangent at C was:\n\n-5x + [ (-5\u221a14)/56 ]y =0.\n\nWait, let me rewrite tangent at C equation:\n\nFrom earlier, tangent at C: (D/2)x + (E/2)y =0,\n\nWith D =-10, E= -5\u221a14/28,\n\nSo: (-10/2)x + (-5\u221a14/(28*2))y =0,\n\nWhich is -5x + (-5\u221a14/56)y =0,\n\nSo rearranged: 5x + (5\u221a14/56)y =0. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the equation was (D/2)x + (E/2)y =0,\n\nSo with D=-10, E = -5\u221a14/28,\n\nSo: (-10/2)x + ( (-5\u221a14/28)/2 )y =0 \u21d2 -5x - (5\u221a14)/(56)y =0 \u21d2 5x + (5\u221a14/56)y =0.\n\nWait, so tangent at C is 5x + (5\u221a14/56)y =0.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me recompute tangent at C:\n\nUsing the formula for tangent at (0,0):\n\nxx\u2080 + yy\u2080 + D(x +x\u2080)/2 + E(y + y\u2080)/2 + F =0,\n\nWhich with x\u2080 =0, y\u2080=0 gives:\n\n0 +0 + D*(x)/2 + E*(y)/2 +0 =0 \u21d2 (D/2)x + (E/2)y =0,\n\nSo D is -10, so (-10/2)x + (E/2)y =0 \u21d2 -5x + [ (-5\u221a14/28)/2 ]y =0 \u21d2 -5x - (5\u221a14)/56 y =0 \u21d2 5x + (5\u221a14)/56 y =0. Yes, so that's tangent at C.\n\nSo tangent at C: 5x + (5\u221a14)/56 y =0.\n\nSimilarly, tangent at B is the equation we had above:\n\n(14/5)x + (\u221a14*(311/280))y -81/2 =0.\n\nHmm, so to find point D, the intersection of these two tangents.\n\nLet me denote the two equations:\n\n1. 5x + (5\u221a14)/56 y =0 (from tangent at C)\n\n2. (14/5)x + ( (311\u221a14)/280 )y = 81/2 (from tangent at B, moving constants to RHS)\n\nFirst, let me simplify equation 1:\n\nEquation 1: 5x + (5\u221a14/56)y =0 \u21d2 divide both sides by 5:\n\nx + (\u221a14/56)y =0 \u21d2 x = - (\u221a14/56)y.\n\nSo from equation 1, x = - (\u221a14 /56)y. Let me call this equation 1a.\n\nNow substitute x from equation 1a into equation 2:\n\n(14/5)*( -\u221a14/56 y ) + (311\u221a14/280)y =81/2.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term:\n\n(14/5)*( -\u221a14/56 y ) = (14 /5) * (-\u221a14)/56 * y = (14 * -\u221a14 ) / (5*56) * y.\n\nSimplify 14/56 = 1/4, so this becomes ( -\u221a14 )/(5*4) * y = (-\u221a14 /20 ) y.\n\nSecond term:\n\n(311\u221a14 /280 ) y.\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\n[ (-\u221a14/20 ) + (311\u221a14 /280 ) ] y =81/2.\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (-1/20 + 311/280 ) ] y =81/2.\n\nCompute the bracket term:\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 280:\n\n-1/20 = -14/280,\n\nSo -14/280 +311/280 = ( -14 +311 ) /280 = 297/280.\n\nThus:\n\n\u221a14*(297/280)* y =81/2.\n\nSolve for y:\n\ny = (81/2) / ( \u221a14 *297/280 )\n\nSimplify:\n\ny = (81/2) * (280)/(297\u221a14 )\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\n81 and 297: 297 = 81*3.5? Wait, 81*3=243, 81*3.5=283.5, no. Wait 297 \u00f781= 3.666\u2026 Wait, actually 81*3=243, 297-243=54, so 81*3 +54 =297, but 54 is 81*(2/3). Hmm, maybe factor 81 and 297:\n\n81 = 9^2, 297=9*33=9*3*11. So GCD(81,297)=9*3=27.\n\nSimilarly, 280 and 2: 280 divisible by 2, so divide numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nNumerator: 81 *280\n\nDenominator: 2 *297 *\u221a14\n\nSo,\n\ny = (81 *280)/(2*297\u221a14 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: denominator becomes 297\u221a14, numerator 81*140.\n\nSo y = (81*140)/(297\u221a14 )\n\nSimplify 81 and 297: GCD 27.\n\n81 \u00f727=3, 297 \u00f727=11.\n\nSo,\n\ny = (3*140)/(11\u221a14 ) = (420)/(11\u221a14 )\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\ny = (420\u221a14 )/(11*14 ) = (420/14)*(\u221a14)/11 = 30*(\u221a14)/11 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nThus y = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nNow substitute back into equation 1a: x = - (\u221a14 /56 ) y.\n\nSo,\n\nx = - (\u221a14 /56 ) * (30\u221a14)/11 = - (30*14 )/(56*11 )\n\nBecause \u221a14*\u221a14 =14.\n\nThus,\n\nx = - (420)/(56*11 ) = - (420)/(616 )\n\nSimplify 420/616: divide numerator and denominator by 28: 420 \u00f728=15, 616 \u00f728=22.\n\nThus, x = -15/22.\n\nTherefore coordinates of D are ( -15/22, 30\u221a14/11 ).\n\nHmm, that seems okay. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, let me recheck the substitution step:\n\ny = (30\u221a14)/11,\n\nthen x = - (\u221a14 /56) * y = - (\u221a14 /56)*(30\u221a14 /11 ) = - [ (30 *14 ) / (56*11) ) ] because \u221a14 *\u221a14 =14,\n\nSo numerator: 30*14 = 420,\n\nDenominator:56*11=616,\n\nThus x= -420/616 = -15/22. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo D is at ( -15/22, 30\u221a14 /11 ).\n\nNow, need to find equation of line AD. Since A is at (10,0) and D is at (-15/22, 30\u221a14 /11 ).\n\nLet me compute the parametric equations for line AD.\n\nParametrize from A to D. Let parameter t go from 0 to 1.\n\nThe vector from A to D is ( -15/22 -10, 30\u221a14 /11 -0 ) = ( - (15/22 + 220/22 ), 30\u221a14 /11 ) = ( -235/22, 30\u221a14 /11 ).\n\nThus parametric equations:\n\nx(t) =10 + t*( -235/22 -10 )? Wait, no:\n\nWait parametric equations starting at A(10,0):\n\nx(t) =10 + t*( Dx - Ax ) =10 + t*(-15/22 -10) =10 + t*(- (15 +220)/22 ) =10 - (235/22) t,\n\nSimilarly y(t) =0 + t*( Dy - Ay ) =0 + t*(30\u221a14 /11 -0 ) = (30\u221a14 /11 ) t.\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of line AD with the circle \u03c9, besides A.\n\nSo we can substitute x(t) and y(t) into the circle equation and solve for t \u22600 (since t=0 is point A).\n\nThe circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nPlugging in x(t) and y(t):\n\n[ x(t) ]\u00b2 + [ y(t) ]\u00b2 -10x(t) - (5\u221a14)/28 y(t) =0.\n\nLet me substitute:\n\nFirst compute [x(t)]\u00b2 = [10 - (235/22)t]^2,\n\n[ y(t) ]\u00b2 = [ (30\u221a14 /11 ) t ]\u00b2,\n\n-10x(t) = -10*(10 - (235/22)t ),\n\n- (5\u221a14)/28 y(t) = - (5\u221a14)/28 * (30\u221a14 /11 ) t.\n\nThis will be messy but let's proceed step by step.\n\nLet me denote t as variable, let me expand each term.\n\nFirst term: [10 - (235/22)t]^2 =100 - 2*10*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t\u00b2 = 100 - (4700/22)t + (235\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) t\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: [ (30\u221a14 /11 ) t ]\u00b2 = (900*14)/121 t\u00b2 = (12600)/121 t\u00b2.\n\nThird term: -10*(10 - (235/22)t ) = -100 + (2350/22)t.\n\nFourth term: - (5\u221a14)/28 * (30\u221a14 /11 ) t.\n\nCompute that term:\n\nMultiply constants:\n\n5*30 =150,\n\n\u221a14 *\u221a14 =14,\n\nThus numerator: 150*14 =2100,\n\nDenominator:28*11=308,\n\nSo term is - (2100)/(308) t.\n\nSimplify 2100/308: divide numerator and denominator by 4: 525/77. So - (525/77 ) t.\n\nPutting all terms together:\n\nFirst term: 100 - (4700/22)t + (235\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) t\u00b2,\n\nSecond term: +12600/121 t\u00b2,\n\nThird term: -100 + (2350/22)t,\n\nFourth term: -525/77 t.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nConstants: 100 -100 =0.\n\nTerms with t:\n\n[ -4700/22 +2350/22 -525/77 ] t\n\nTerms with t\u00b2:\n\n[ (235\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) +12600/121 ] t\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst, the t terms:\n\nFirst, combine the first two coefficients:\n\n-4700/22 +2350/22 = (-4700 +2350)/22 = (-2350)/22.\n\nThen subtract 525/77:\n\nSo total coefficient: (-2350/22) - (525/77).\n\nTo combine these, find common denominator of 22 and 77, which is 154 (22*7=154, 77*2=154).\n\nConvert -2350/22 = (-2350*7)/154 = -16450/154,\n\nConvert -525/77 = (-525*2)/154 = -1050/154,\n\nTotal: (-16450 -1050)/154 = (-17500)/154 = -17500/154 = can simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 14: 17500/14=1250, 154/14=11,\n\nThus -1250/11.\n\nWait let me check:\n\nWait 17500 divided by 14 is 17500/14 = 1250,\n\n154 divided by14 is 11. So yes, so -1250/11.\n\nTherefore the coefficient of t is -1250/11.\n\nNow the t\u00b2 terms:\n\nFirst term: (235)^2 / (22)^2,\n\nSecond term: 12600 /121.\n\nNote that 22\u00b2=484, 121=11\u00b2, so 121 is 22\u00b2/4? Not sure, but let's compute:\n\n(235)^2 =235*235. Let me compute that:\n\n200\u00b2=40000, 35\u00b2=1225, 2*200*35=14000,\n\nThus (200+35)^2 =40000+14000 +1225= 55225.\n\nTherefore (235)^2 =55225,\n\nThus first term: 55225/(22\u00b2)=55225/484.\n\nSecond term:12600/121 =12600/(11\u00b2).\n\nTo add these, need common denominator. Let me note that 484=44\u00b2= (4*11)^2=16*121.\n\nThus 484=4*121. So 55225/484 =55225/(4*121),\n\nand 12600/121 = (12600*4)/(4*121)=50400/(4*121).\n\nThus total t\u00b2 coefficient:\n\n[55225 +50400]/(4*121) = (105625)/(484).\n\nWait let me verify:\n\nWait, 55225/(4*121) +12600/121 = [55225 + (12600*4)]/(4*121)\n\nYes, because 12600/121 = (12600*4)/(4*121). So:\n\nNumerator:55225 + 50400 =105625,\n\nDenominator:4*121=484.\n\nThus the coefficient of t\u00b2 is 105625 /484.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n(105625 /484 ) t\u00b2 - (1250/11 ) t =0.\n\nFactor out t:\n\nt [ (105625 /484 ) t - 1250/11 ] =0.\n\nSolutions are t=0 (point A) and t= (1250/11 ) / (105625 /484 )\n\nCompute the second solution:\n\nt = (1250/11 ) * (484 /105625 )\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\nFirst, note that 484=4*121=4*11\u00b2,\n\nSo 484 /105625 = (4*11\u00b2)/105625,\n\nAlso, 1250/11 *4*11\u00b2 =1250*4*11,\n\nThus,\n\nt= (1250*4*11)/105625 = (5000*11)/105625.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n5000*11 =55000,\n\nDenominator 105625.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25:\n\n55000 /25 =2200,\n\n105625 /25=4225.\n\nSo t=2200/4225.\n\nSimplify further:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: 2200/25=88, 4225/25=169.\n\nThus t=88/169.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait 2200 \u00f725 is indeed 88, and 4225 \u00f725 is 169. So yes, so t=88/169.\n\nTherefore, the parameter t corresponding to point P is 88/169.\n\nThus coordinates of P are:\n\nx(t)=10 - (235/22)*(88/169),\n\ny(t)= (30\u221a14 /11)*(88/169).\n\nCompute x(t):\n\nFirst, 235/22 *88/169:\n\n235 and 22: 22 divides into 88 four times. So 88/22=4,\n\nThus, 235 *4 /169 =940/169,\n\nSo x(t)=10 -940/169 = (1690 -940)/169 =750/169.\n\nSimilarly, y(t)= (30\u221a14 /11)*(88/169).\n\nSimplify:\n\n30 and 11: no common factors with 88. 88/11=8,\n\nThus,\n\n30\u221a14 *8 /169 =240\u221a14 /169.\n\nThus coordinates of P are (750/169, 240\u221a14 /169).\n\nNow need to compute the distance AP.\n\nPoint A is at (10,0), and point P is at (750/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nCompute the distance between them:\n\nAP = sqrt[ ( (750/169 -10)^2 + (240\u221a14/169 -0)^2 ) ]\n\nFirst compute 750/169 -10 = (750 -10*169)/169 = (750 -1690)/169 = (-940)/169.\n\nThus the x-coordinate difference squared: ( -940/169 )\u00b2 = (940\u00b2)/(169\u00b2).\n\nThe y-coordinate squared: (240\u221a14 /169 )\u00b2 = (240\u00b2 *14)/169\u00b2.\n\nThus,\n\nAP\u00b2 = [940\u00b2 +240\u00b2*14 ] /169\u00b2.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nFirst compute 940\u00b2:\n\n940\u00b2 = (900 +40)^2 =900\u00b2 +2*900*40 +40\u00b2 =810000 +72000 +1600 =883,200 +1600=884,800.\n\nWait let me compute step by step:\n\n900\u00b2=810,000,\n\n2*900*40= 2*36,000=72,000,\n\n40\u00b2=1,600,\n\nTotal: 810,000 +72,000 =882,000 +1,600=883,600. Wait, 810k +72k is 882k, plus 1.6k is 883,600.\n\nWait, but 940^2 is actually (94)^2 *100. Let me compute 94^2:\n\n94^2 = (90+4)^2 =8100 + 720 +16= 8100+720=8820 +16=8836. So 940^2=8836*100=883,600. Yes, correct.\n\nNow 240\u00b2*14:\n\n240\u00b2=57,600,\n\n57,600 *14 = 57,600*10 +57,600*4 =576,000 +230,400=806,400.\n\nThus numerator is 883,600 +806,400 =1,690,000.\n\nTherefore AP\u00b2 =1,690,000 / (169\u00b2).\n\nCompute sqrt(AP\u00b2)= sqrt(1,690,000)/169.\n\nsqrt(1,690,000)=sqrt(1690 *1000)=sqrt(1690)*sqrt(1000)= sqrt(169*10)*sqrt(1000)=13*sqrt(10)*10*sqrt(10)=13*10*10=1300. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait sqrt(1,690,000)=sqrt(1,690,000)=sqrt(1690000)=sqrt(16900*100)=sqrt(16900)*sqrt(100)=130*10=1300.\n\nYes, so sqrt(1,690,000)=1300.\n\nThus AP=1300 /169.\n\nSimplify 1300 divided by 169:\n\nSince 169 is 13\u00b2=169,\n\n1300 \u00f713=100, so 1300=13*100,\n\nThus 1300/169= (13*100)/(13\u00b2)=100/13.\n\nTherefore AP=100/13.\n\nHence m=100, n=13, which are coprime. Thus m +n=113.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward? Let me verify once again.\n\nWait AP squared was 1,690,000 divided by (169)^2. Since 169^2= (13^2)^2=13^4=28561.\n\nWait but 1,690,000 divided by 28561 equals (1300)^2/(169)^2= (1300/169)^2, so sqrt of that is 1300/169.\n\nBut 1300 divided by 169: 169*7=1183, 169*7.7=169*7 +169*0.7=1183+118.3=1301.3. Close but not exact. Wait, perhaps miscalculation?\n\nWait, wait. Wait 1300 divided by 169:\n\nSince 169*7=1183,\n\n1300-1183=117,\n\n169*0.7=118.3, which is more than 117.\n\nWait, 169*6.5=169*6 +169*0.5=1014 +84.5=1098.5, not helpful.\n\nWait perhaps 1300 divided by 169:\n\n169 \u00d77 = 1183,\n\n169\u00d77.7 =169*(7 +0.7)=1183 +118.3=1301.3, which is over.\n\nHmm, so perhaps my previous step was wrong.\n\nWait, AP squared is (1,690,000)/(169)^2.\n\nWait 1,690,000 =1690 *1000 =169*10*1000=169*10,000,\n\nWait wait 169*10,000=1,690,000,\n\nThus AP squared is (169 *10,000)/(169)^2)=10,000 /169,\n\nThus AP is sqrt(10,000/169)=100/13. Ah, that's correct! Because 169*100 =16,900, but wait:\n\nWait, 169 \u00d710,000 is 1,690,000, yes.\n\nSo numerator is 169\u00d710,000,\n\ndenominator is (169)^2,\n\nso AP squared is 10,000/169,\n\nso AP is 100/13. Yes, that's correct. So I made a mistake in my intermediate step where I thought of 1300/169, but actually sqrt(1,690,000)=sqrt(169*10,000)=13*100=1300, so numerator sqrt is 1300, denominator is 169, so 1300/169 = (13*100)/(13*13)=100/13. Yes, correct.\n\nTherefore AP=100/13, so m=100, n=13, sum is 113.\n\nTherefore the answer is 113.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{113}\n\n\nGiven triangle \\(ABC\\) inscribed in circle \\(\\omega\\) with \\(AB = 5\\), \\(BC = 9\\), and \\(AC = 10\\), we need to find the length of \\(AP\\) where \\(P\\) is the second intersection of line \\(AD\\) with \\(\\omega\\), and \\(D\\) is the intersection of the tangents to \\(\\omega\\) at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\).\n\n1. **Coordinates of Points**:\n   - Place \\(C\\) at \\((0, 0)\\) and \\(A\\) at \\((10, 0)\\).\n   - Solve for coordinates of \\(B\\) using distances:\n     \\[\n     x^2 + y^2 = 81 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (x - 10)^2 + y^2 = 25\n     \\]\n     Solving these, we find \\(B = \\left(\\frac{39}{5}, \\frac{6\\sqrt{14}}{5}\\right)\\).\n\n2. **Equation of Circumcircle**:\n   - Using points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\), the circumcircle equation is derived as:\n     \\[\n     x^2 + y^2 - 10x - \\frac{5\\sqrt{14}}{28}y = 0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Tangents at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\)**:\n   - Tangent at \\(C\\) (0,0):\n     \\[\n     5x + \\frac{5\\sqrt{14}}{56}y = 0\n     \\]\n   - Tangent at \\(B\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{14}{5}x + \\frac{311\\sqrt{14}}{280}y - \\frac{81}{2} = 0\n     \\]\n\n4. **Intersection Point \\(D\\)**:\n   - Solving the tangent equations, we find \\(D = \\left(-\\frac{15}{22}, \\frac{30\\sqrt{14}}{11}\\right)\\).\n\n5. **Line \\(AD\\) and Intersection \\(P\\)**:\n   - Parametric equations for line \\(AD\\) are derived and substituted into the circle equation.\n   - Solving for parameter \\(t\\), we find \\(t = \\frac{88}{169}\\).\n   - Coordinates of \\(P\\) are found as \\(\\left(\\frac{750}{169}, \\frac{240\\sqrt{14}}{169}\\right)\\).\n\n6. **Distance \\(AP\\)**:\n   - Calculate the distance between \\(A(10, 0)\\) and \\(P\\left(\\frac{750}{169}, \\frac{240\\sqrt{14}}{169}\\right)\\):\n     \\[\n     AP = \\sqrt{\\left(10 - \\frac{750}{169}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{240\\sqrt{14}}{169}\\right)^2} = \\frac{100}{13}\n     \\]\n\nThus, \\(AP = \\frac{100}{13}\\), and \\(m + n = 100 + 13 = 113\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{113}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then line AD intersects the circle again at P. The sides are given as AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nHmm, first, let me recall some properties related to tangents and circles. The point where the tangents from a point to a circle meet has some important properties. Specifically, the point D is the exsymmedian or something? Wait, maybe I need to use power of a point here. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then DB and DC are both tangent to the circle \u03c9. So, by the power of point D with respect to \u03c9, we have DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. That seems useful because AP is part of AD, so maybe I can express DP in terms of AD and AP?\n\nLet me write that down. Power of point D gives DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. Since DB = DC (because both are tangents from D to the circle), so that checks out. So, DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Therefore, if I can find DA and DB, I can relate them to DP and AP. But AP is part of AD, so maybe I can write DP = AD + AP? Wait, no. Wait, AD is from A to D, and then P is another intersection point. Wait, actually, since AD starts at A, goes through D, and then intersects the circle again at P? Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says \"AD intersects \u03c9 at P\". But AD starts at A, which is already on the circle. So the other intersection point is P. Therefore, AP is the segment from A to P, which is along AD beyond A? Wait, no. Wait, actually, A is on the circle, so AD starts at A, goes through D, and then exits the circle again at P? Wait, but D is outside the circle, so AD starts at A (on the circle), goes through D (outside), so P must be the other intersection point? Wait, but then the line AD would pass through A, go to D, and then where is P? Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify the diagram.\n\nLooking back at the Asymptote code, they have P as the intersection of DA with the circle again. Since A is already on the circle, P is the second point where AD meets the circle. So, the path is A -> D -> P, but since D is outside the circle, AP must pass through D? Wait, no. Wait, the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then since D is outside, the line AD would exit the circle again at another point P beyond D? Wait, that can't be because A is already on the circle. So, the line AD starts at A (on the circle), goes through D (outside), so the other intersection point with the circle would be on the extension beyond D? Wait, that can't be because then P would be on the other side. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is different. Let me check the Asymptote code again:\n\nThe Asymptote code says: P = IP(D..A, A..B..C); Hmm, maybe that's a typo? Wait, \"IP\" is intersection point. So, D..A would be the line from D to A, and A..B..C is the circle? So, the circle is defined as going through A, B, C. Therefore, P is the second intersection point of line DA with the circle, so starting at D, going through A, and then exiting the circle again at P? Wait, but A is on the circle, so if you go from D through A, then the other intersection would be the same as A unless the line is tangent there. But the line DA is passing through A and going to D, so the second intersection point would be A itself if it's tangent, but since D is the intersection of two tangents, maybe DA isn't tangent. Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe P is between A and D? But if D is outside the circle, then the line AD would start at A (on the circle), go through D (outside), so the only other intersection with the circle is A. Therefore, maybe the problem states that P is the second intersection, so maybe my initial thought is wrong. Wait, perhaps the Asymptote code is drawing A..B..C..cycle, which is the circumcircle. So the line AD is extended beyond A to meet the circle again at P? Wait, that would make sense. If you go from D through A and then P is on the other side of A from D. Hmm, so that would mean AP is a segment from A to P, with D lying on AD between A and D? Wait, no. Let me try to parse this again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Let AD intersect \u03c9 at P\". Since A is already on \u03c9, the intersection other than A is P. So, the line AD intersects \u03c9 at A and P, so P is the other point. So depending on the direction, if D is outside the circle, then the line AD starts at A (on the circle), goes outward to D, so the other intersection P would be on the other side of A? Wait, no, that can't be because going from A towards D would exit the circle only at A. So maybe the line AD extended beyond D would meet the circle again? But then P would be on the extension beyond D. Wait, but in that case, the length AP would be AD + DP, but the problem might consider directed lengths. Hmm, perhaps the problem just wants the length regardless of direction. Maybe I need to use power of a point.\n\nLet me recall that Power of a Point says that for a point D outside the circle, the power is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. Since P is the second intersection point of line AD with the circle, then DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Therefore, if I let AP = x, then DP would be DA + AP? Wait, depends on the direction. If A is on the circle, and D is outside, then moving from D towards A, you reach A, then continuing past A to P, so DP would be DA + AP. Wait, but in that case, DA is from D to A, and AP is from A to P. So the entire length from D to P would be DA + AP. So then, DA * DP = DA*(DA + AP) = DA\u00b2 + DA*AP = DB\u00b2. Hmm, but maybe I should use directed lengths here. Since in power of a point, the product is signed. So, if we consider the power as DA * DP = DB\u00b2, where DA and DP are signed lengths. If D is outside, then DA is negative if we take direction from D to A, and DP would be DA + AP? Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think in terms of lengths.\n\nLet me denote AP as the length from A to P, and DP as the length from D to P. Since P is on AD extended beyond A, then DP would be DA + AP. Wait, no, if P is on the other side of A from D, then DP would be DA + AP. Wait, suppose D is outside the circle, and the line AD goes from D to A (on the circle), then P is the other intersection, so P must be on the opposite side of A from D. So, the line goes D -> A -> P. Therefore, the distance from D to P is DA + AP. Therefore, DA * DP = DA*(DA + AP) = DB\u00b2. So, if I let AP = x, then DA*(DA + x) = DB\u00b2. Therefore, x = (DB\u00b2 / DA) - DA. Therefore, AP = (DB\u00b2 / DA) - DA = (DB\u00b2 - DA\u00b2)/DA. Hmm, so if I can compute DA and DB, then I can compute AP.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to assign variables. Let me let AP = x, so then DP = DA + AP? Wait, but DA is the length from D to A, so if P is beyond A from D, then DP = DA + AP. So yes, so then DA * DP = DA*(DA + AP) = DB\u00b2. So, if I can find DA and DB, then I can solve for AP. Alternatively, if I can express DA in terms of DB, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use coordinate geometry? Let me see. Since the triangle has sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10, perhaps I can compute coordinates for the triangle and then find the equation of the circle, find point D, then compute AD and find P?\n\nAlternatively, use trigonometry. Let me think. Maybe first compute the circumradius of triangle ABC, since the triangle is inscribed in the circle \u03c9. Then, perhaps use some trigonometric relations.\n\nFirst, let me compute the circumradius R of triangle ABC. The formula for the circumradius is (a b c)/(4 area). Let's compute the area first using Heron's formula. The sides are AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Wait, let me check the sides again: AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Wait, so sides a, b, c opposite to A, B, C? Wait, actually, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So let me confirm:\n\nLet me denote the triangle sides as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let:\n\n- a = BC = 9,\n\n- b = AC = 10,\n\n- c = AB = 5.\n\nThen the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (9 + 10 + 5)/2 = 24/2 = 12.\n\nArea using Heron's formula: sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12 - 9)*(12 - 10)*(12 -5)] = sqrt[12*3*2*7] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] Wait, actually 12*3=36, 36*2=72, 72*7=504. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(16*31.5) Hmm, 504 factors into 16*31.5? Wait, better as 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, 16*31.5 is 504, but maybe better to factor into primes: 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but perhaps 504 = 8*63 = 8*9*7 = 2^3 * 3^2 *7. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(2^3 *3^2 *7) = 2^(1.5)*3*sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Wait, let me compute sqrt(504):\n\nsqrt(504) = sqrt( 16 * 31.5 )? Wait, perhaps better as sqrt(504) = sqrt( 16 * 31.5 ) is not helpful. Let me do 504 divided by 4 is 126, so sqrt(4*126)=2*sqrt(126). 126 is 9*14, so sqrt(126)=3*sqrt(14). So sqrt(504)=2*3*sqrt(14)=6\u221a14. So the area is 6\u221a14. Therefore, the area is 6\u221a14.\n\nTherefore, the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4*Area) = (9*10*5)/(4*6\u221a14). Let me compute numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 9*10=90, 90*5=450.\n\nDenominator: 4*6=24, so 24\u221a14.\n\nThus R = 450/(24\u221a14) = Simplify numerator and denominator by 6: 450/6=75, 24/6=4. So 75/(4\u221a14). Rationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14: (75\u221a14)/(4*14) = (75\u221a14)/56. So R = 75\u221a14 /56. Hmm, okay, so that's the circumradius. Not sure if this will help yet, but maybe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinates. Let me set coordinate system. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point B along the x-axis, so point B is (9, 0). Wait, but AC is 10, AB is 5, BC is 9. Wait, actually, hold on, in the problem, BC is 9, so if I place point B at (0,0), point C at (9,0), but then point A is somewhere else. Alternatively, maybe set point C at (0,0), point B at (x,0), but need to make sure the sides are correct. Let me see.\n\nLet me try to set point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0), since BC is 9. Then point A is somewhere in the plane. Let me denote coordinates:\n\nLet me denote coordinates as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s place point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0). Then point A has coordinates (x,y) such that AC = 10 and AB = 5. So, distance from A to C (0,0) is 10: sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 10, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100.\n\nDistance from A to B (9,0) is 5: sqrt( (x -9)^2 + y^2 ) =5, so (x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 =25.\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second: (x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =25 - 100 \u21d2 (x\u00b2 -18x +81) -x\u00b2 = -75 \u21d2 -18x +81 = -75 \u21d2 -18x = -156 \u21d2 x = 156 /18 = 26/3 \u2248 8.666...\n\nSo x=26/3. Then, substitute back into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =100:\n\n(26/3)^2 + y\u00b2 = 100 \u21d2 (676/9) + y\u00b2 = 100 \u21d2 y\u00b2 = 100 - 676/9 = (900 -676)/9 = 224/9 \u21d2 y = \u00b1\u221a(224/9) = \u00b1(\u221a224)/3 = \u00b1(4\u221a14)/3.\n\nSo coordinates of A are (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3) or (26/3, -4\u221a14/3). Since triangles are typically considered in upper half-plane unless specified, let's take the positive y-coordinate. So A is (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3).\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nC: (0,0)\n\nB: (9,0)\n\nA: (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3)\n\nNow, need to find the equations of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9. Then find their intersection D, then find equation of AD and find its other intersection P with \u03c9, then compute AP.\n\nFirst, let me find the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9. Since we have coordinates for A, B, C, we can compute the equation.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0. Plugging in the coordinates of A, B, C:\n\nFor point C (0,0):\n\n0 +0 +0 +0 + F =0 \u21d2 F=0.\n\nWait, but that can't be unless the circle passes through the origin. Wait, point C is at (0,0), so yes, so F=0.\n\nWait, but point B is (9,0):\n\nPlugging into equation: 9\u00b2 +0 + D*9 + E*0 + F =0 \u21d281 +9D +0 +0=0 (since F=0). Wait, but F was set to 0 because of point C. Wait, but 81 +9D =0 \u21d2 D= -81/9 = -9.\n\nSimilarly, point A (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3):\n\nPlug into equation:\n\n(26/3)^2 + ( (4\u221a14)/3 )^2 + D*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14)/3 =0.\n\nWe already have D = -9 and F=0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (26/3)^2 = (676)/9\n\nSecond term: (16*14)/9 = 224/9\n\nThird term: D*(26/3) = (-9)*(26/3) = -234/3 = -78\n\nFourth term: E*(4\u221a14)/3\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\n676/9 + 224/9 -78 + (4\u221a14 E)/3 =0\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n(676 +224)/9 = 900/9 =100\n\nSo 100 -78 + (4\u221a14 E)/3 =0 \u21d2 22 + (4\u221a14 E)/3 =0 \u21d2 (4\u221a14 E)/3 = -22 \u21d2 E= (-22 *3)/(4\u221a14) = (-66)/(4\u221a14) = (-33)/(2\u221a14). Rationalizing the denominator:\n\nE= (-33)/(2\u221a14) * (\u221a14/\u221a14) = (-33\u221a14)/(28).\n\nTherefore, the equation of the circle is:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the circumcircle using perpendicular bisectors?\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates for A, B, C, perhaps compute the tangent lines at B and C.\n\nThe tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the tangent at point B (9,0):\n\nThe center of the circle, let's find it first.\n\nWait, since we have the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0, we can find the center (h,k) by completing the squares.\n\nThe general form is x\u00b2 -9x + y\u00b2 - (33\u221a14/28)y =0.\n\nCompleting the square for x:\n\nx\u00b2 -9x = (x - 9/2)^2 - (81/4)\n\nFor y:\n\ny\u00b2 - (33\u221a14/28)y = [y - (33\u221a14)/56]^2 - ( (33\u221a14)/56 )\u00b2\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n(x - 9/2)^2 - 81/4 + [y - (33\u221a14)/56]^2 - [ (33\u221a14)/56 )\u00b2 ] =0\n\nThus,\n\n(x - 9/2)^2 + [y - (33\u221a14)/56]^2 = 81/4 + [ (33\u221a14)/56 )\u00b2 ]\n\nThis is the equation of the circle. Therefore, the center is at (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56 ), and the radius squared is the right-hand side. Hmm, this might be too complicated. Maybe better to compute the tangent lines using derivatives or point-form.\n\nAlternatively, the tangent at point B (9,0):\n\nThe slope of the radius from center to B is (0 - (33\u221a14)/56 ) / (9 - 9/2 ) = ( -33\u221a14 /56 ) / (9/2) = (-33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (-33\u221a14)/252 = (-11\u221a14)/84. Therefore, the tangent line at B is perpendicular to this radius, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: 84/(11\u221a14). Rationalizing, that's (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (6\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo the tangent at B has slope 6\u221a14 /11. Therefore, the equation is:\n\ny -0 = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9)\n\nSimilarly, tangent at point C (0,0):\n\nWait, point C is at (0,0). The radius to point C is from center (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56 ) to (0,0). The slope of that radius is [ (33\u221a14)/56 -0 ] / [9/2 -0] = (33\u221a14)/56 divided by 9/2 = (33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (33\u221a14)/252 = (11\u221a14)/84. Therefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to this, so slope is the negative reciprocal: -84/(11\u221a14) = -84/(11\u221a14). Rationalizing, that's -84\u221a14/(11*14) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C (0,0) has slope -6\u221a14 /11. So its equation is y = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nTherefore, the two tangent lines are:\n\nAt B: y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9)\n\nAt C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nWe need to find their intersection point D. Let me set the two equations equal:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14) to eliminate coefficients:\n\n(x -9) = -x\n\nSo x -9 = -x \u21d2 2x =9 \u21d2 x= 9/2.\n\nPlugging back into the tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)(9/2) = (-6\u221a14 *9)/(22) = (-54\u221a14)/22 = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, point D is at (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nHmm, okay, coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11). Now, need to find the equation of line AD, then find its other intersection P with the circle, then compute AP.\n\nFirst, coordinates of A are (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3), coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11). Let me compute the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nLet me parametrize line AD. Let me denote parameter t such that when t=0, we are at A, and t=1, we are at D. Then:\n\nx(t) = x_A + t*(x_D - x_A) = 26/3 + t*(9/2 -26/3 )\n\nSimilarly, y(t) = y_A + t*(y_D - y_A ) = (4\u221a14)/3 + t*( -27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3 )\n\nCompute the differences:\n\nx_D - x_A = 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6)= (-25/6)\n\ny_D - y_A = (-27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3 ) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3 ) = \u221a14*(-81/33 -44/33)= \u221a14*(-125/33)\n\nTherefore,\n\nx(t) = 26/3 - (25/6)t\n\ny(t) = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of line AD with the circle \u03c9. Since A is already on the circle, we need to find t \u22600 such that (x(t), y(t)) lies on the circle.\n\nThe equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nSubstitute x(t) and y(t) into the equation.\n\nLet me denote x(t) = 26/3 - (25/6)t,\n\ny(t) = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t\n\nThis seems quite involved. Let me see if there's a smarter way. Alternatively, since we know that AP * AD = something via power of a point? Wait, earlier thought: Power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. So DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Since DP is the length from D to P, and DA is from D to A. Since P is on the line AD beyond A (since D is outside, and the tangent lines are from D), then DP = DA + AP. Wait, but need to confirm direction.\n\nWait, actually, in terms of directed segments, if we take DA as a vector from D to A, then DP would be DA + AP (if P is beyond A). But in terms of lengths, if DA is the length from D to A, then DP would be DA + AP. Therefore, DA * DP = DA*(DA + AP) = DB\u00b2. So if I can compute DA and DB, then I can solve for AP.\n\nAlternatively, compute DA and DB using coordinates.\n\nFirst, compute DA: distance between D (9/2, -27\u221a14/11) and A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3).\n\nLet me compute the differences:\n\n\u0394x = 26/3 - 9/2 = (52/6 -27/6)=25/6\n\n\u0394y = (4\u221a14)/3 - (-27\u221a14/11) = (4\u221a14)/3 +27\u221a14/11 = \u221a14*(4/3 +27/11) = \u221a14*( (44 +81)/33 )= \u221a14*(125/33)\n\nTherefore, DA squared is (25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14/33)^2\n\nCompute (25/6)^2 = 625/36\n\n(125\u221a14 /33)^2 = (125^2)*(14)/(33^2) = (15625 *14)/(1089) = 218750/1089\n\nTherefore, DA\u00b2 = 625/36 + 218750/1089. Let me compute this:\n\nFirst, convert to common denominator. 36 and 1089. Let's see 1089 is 33\u00b2=1089, 36 is 6\u00b2. LCM of 36 and 1089. Since 36=4*9, 1089= 121*9, so LCM is 4*121*9= 4356.\n\nTherefore, 625/36 = (625 * 121)/4356\n\n218750/1089 = (218750 *4)/4356\n\nCompute 625*121: 625*121. 625*120=75000, plus 625*1=625 \u2192 75625.\n\n218750 *4 = 875,000.\n\nThus, DA\u00b2 = (75625 + 875000)/4356 = 950625 /4356.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: 950625 \u00f73 = 316,875; 4356 \u00f73=1452\n\nAgain by 3: 316,875 \u00f73=105,625; 1452 \u00f73=484\n\nAgain by 4: 105,625 \u00f7 4? Not divisible. Wait, 105625 divided by 25: 105625/25=4225, and 484/25? Not helpful. Let me check GCD of 950625 and 4356.\n\nWait, 950625 divided by 25 is 38025, 4356 divided by 25 is not integer. Let me see prime factors:\n\n4356: 4*1089 = 4*33\u00b2 = 4*(3*11)^2 = 2\u00b2*3\u00b2*11\u00b2.\n\n950625: let's factor 950625. Divide by 25: 950625 /25=38025. 38025 divided by 25=1521. 1521 is 39\u00b2= (13*3)^2. So 950625=25*25*39\u00b2=25\u00b2*(3*13)^2= (25*3*13)^2= (975)^2. Wait, 25*25=625, 625*39\u00b2. Hmm, 38025 is 195\u00b2 (since 200\u00b2=40,000, so 195\u00b2=38025). So 950625= (195*25)^2? Wait, no. Wait, 195\u00b2=38025, so 950625= 25\u00b2 * 195\u00b2? Wait, perhaps not. Wait 950625= (sqrt(950625))\u00b2. sqrt(950625)= 975, because 975\u00b2= (1000 -25)^2= 1000\u00b2 -2*1000*25 +25\u00b2= 1,000,000 -50,000 +625= 950,625. Yes! So sqrt(950625)=975, so DA\u00b2=975\u00b2/(2\u00b2*3\u00b2*11\u00b2). Wait, denominator is 4356= (2*3*11)^2= 66\u00b2. So DA\u00b2 = (975/66)^2. Therefore, DA=975/66. Simplify 975 divided by 66: divide numerator and denominator by 3: 325/22. So DA= 325/22.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nDA squared is 950625 /4356. 950625 divided by 4356:\n\nCompute 4356 * 218.75= ?\n\nWait, instead, 950625 \u00f7 4356: Let me see 4356 * 200 = 871200, subtract that from 950625: 950625 -871200 =79425. Then 4356*18=78408. 79425 -78408=1017. Hmm, so 200+18=218, with remainder 1017. Not helpful. Alternatively, since sqrt(950625)=975 and sqrt(4356)=66, so sqrt(DA\u00b2)=975/66= DA. So DA=975/66= 325/22 after dividing numerator and denominator by 3. Yes, because 975 \u00f73=325, 66 \u00f73=22. So DA=325/22.\n\nSimilarly, compute DB. Since DB is the length from D to B. Coordinates of B are (9,0), D is (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nCompute \u0394x= 9 -9/2=9/2, \u0394y=0 - (-27\u221a14/11)=27\u221a14/11\n\nThus, DB squared is (9/2)^2 + (27\u221a14/11)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(9/2)^2 =81/4\n\n(27\u221a14/11)^2 = (27\u00b2)*(14)/(11\u00b2)=729*14 /121 = 10,206 /121\n\nThus, DB\u00b2 =81/4 +10206/121. Let's compute this.\n\nCommon denominator is 4*121=484.\n\n81/4 = (81*121)/484= 9801/484\n\n10206/121= (10206*4)/484=40824/484\n\nTotal DB\u00b2 = (9801 +40824)/484 =50625/484\n\nTherefore, DB= sqrt(50625/484)=225/22.\n\nTherefore, DB is 225/22.\n\nTherefore, from Power of a Point: DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWe have DA=325/22, DP= ?\n\nWe need to find DP. Let me note that DP = DA + AP if P is beyond A from D. Wait, but in terms of directed segments, depending on parametrization. Let me think again.\n\nIf point P is on line AD beyond A from D, then the length DP would be DA + AP. But in terms of the Power of a Point formula, which uses signed lengths, so if we consider D to A to P, then DA is negative if direction is from D to A, and DP would be DA (negative) plus AP (positive?), but maybe it's better to just use magnitudes here.\n\nSince all are lengths, so DA * DP = DB\u00b2, where DA and DP are lengths. Since P is on the line AD beyond A from D, then DP = DA + AP. Therefore:\n\nDA*(DA + AP) = DB\u00b2 \u21d2 (325/22)*(325/22 + AP) = (225/22)^2.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n(325/22)*(325/22 + AP) = (225/22)^2\n\nMultiply both sides by 22\u00b2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n325*(325 +22 AP) =225\u00b2\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nLeft side: 325*(325 +22 AP) ?\n\nWait, actually, let me re-express:\n\nLet me denote AP = x. Then,\n\n325/22 * (325/22 + x) = (225/22)^2\n\nMultiply both sides by (22)^2:\n\n325*(325 +22x) =225\u00b2\n\nCompute 225\u00b2=50625\n\nLeft side: 325*325 + 325*22 x = (325)^2 + (7150)x\n\nCompute 325\u00b2: 325*325. Let me compute 300\u00b2=90000, 25\u00b2=625, and cross term 2*300*25=15000. So (300+25)^2= 90000 +15000 +625= 105625.\n\nSo left side:105625 +7150x =50625\n\nThus, 7150x =50625 -105625 = -55000\n\nTherefore, x= -55000 /7150.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 50: -1100/143. Hmm, 143 is 11*13, 1100 divided by 11 is 100, so:\n\n-1100/143 = -100/13.\n\nWait, but AP is a length, so can't be negative. Hmm, so perhaps my assumption about the direction was wrong. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps P is on the other side? If DP = |DA - AP|, but maybe I need to consider the direction.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the Power of a Point formula. The Power of point D with respect to circle \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP, where DA and DP are signed lengths. If we take the line AD, then the power is DA * DP, where DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P. If P is on the opposite side of A from D, then DP would be DA + AP, but in terms of signed lengths, if we take direction from D, then DA is positive towards A, and beyond A to P would be positive as well. Wait, perhaps the formula is just the product of the distances, so maybe my mistake was in the algebra.\n\nWait, let me write the equation again:\n\nDA * DP = DB\u00b2\n\nWe have DA = 325/22, DB =225/22, so DB squared is (225/22)^2.\n\nSo,\n\n(325/22) * DP = (225/22)^2 \u21d2 DP = (225/22)^2 / (325/22) = (225^2)/(325 *22)\n\nSimplify:\n\n225 /325 = 45/65 =9/13 (divided numerator and denominator by 5, then by 5 again? Wait 225 \u00f75=45, 325 \u00f75=65. Then 45/65 =9/13 (divided by 5 again? Wait 45 \u00f75=9, 65 \u00f75=13). So yes, 225/325 =9/13. So DP = (9/13)*(225/22) ?\n\nWait, wait, let me re-express:\n\nDP = (225/22)^2 divided by (325/22) = (225\u00b2 /22\u00b2) * (22/325) )= (225\u00b2 *22 )/(22\u00b2 *325) = (225\u00b2)/(22*325)\n\nWait, 225\u00b2 =225*225, 22*325=22*325. Let me compute:\n\n225 divided by 325: 225/325 = 45/65 =9/13 as before.\n\nThus, 225\u00b2 / (22*325) = (225/325)*225 /22 = (9/13)*(225)/22 = (9*225)/(13*22)\n\n225 divided by 22 is 225/22, so:\n\nDP = (9*225)/(13*22) = (2025)/(286). Let me see if this reduces. 2025 and 286.\n\n286 factors: 2*11*13.\n\n2025 is 25*81=25*9\u00b2, so factors are 5\u00b2*3^4. No common factors with 2,11,13. So DP is 2025/286.\n\nNow, since DP is the distance from D to P, and DA is the distance from D to A (325/22), then AP would be DP - DA? Wait, if P is beyond A from D, then DP = DA + AP \u21d2 AP = DP - DA.\n\nWait, yes. If you go from D to A is DA, then from A to P is AP, so total DP = DA + AP \u21d2 AP = DP - DA.\n\nTherefore, AP = DP - DA = (2025/286) - (325/22).\n\nConvert to common denominator. 286 is 22*13. So 22 denominator term can be converted to 286 by multiplying numerator and denominator by 13:\n\n325/22 = (325*13)/(22*13)= 4225/286.\n\nThus,\n\nAP =2025/286 -4225/286 = (2025 -4225)/286 = (-2200)/286.\n\nWait, negative? That can't be. Hmm, so that suggests that my assumption of the direction is wrong. AP came out negative, meaning that P is actually on the other side of D from A?\n\nWait, so maybe P is between D and A? But A is on the circle, so the line DA starts at D, goes through A, and then exits the circle again at P? Wait, no, the other intersection would be A itself. Wait, perhaps the parametrization earlier was different. Wait, when I set up the parametrization earlier with t=0 at A and t=1 at D, then P would correspond to a negative t?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Power of a Point formula gives DA * DP = DB\u00b2, but if P is on the other side, then DP would be DA - AP, but direction matters. Let me think again with signed lengths.\n\nAssume the line is parametrized such that D is at 0, A is at +DA, and P is at +DP from D. Then if P is beyond A, then DP = DA + AP \u21d2 AP = DP - DA. But if the calculation gives AP negative, then that would imply that P is in the opposite direction from A, i.e., between D and A.\n\nWait, let me see the value:\n\nAP = DP - DA = (2025/286 - 325/22) = (2025 - (325*13))/286. Because 325/22 = 325*13/(22*13)= 4225/286.\n\n2025 - 4225 = -2200. So AP = -2200/286. Negative, meaning direction is opposite. So P is between D and A, so AP is actually DA - DP?\n\nWait, maybe the formula is DA * DP = DB\u00b2, but if P is between D and A, then DP is less than DA, so DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me recast:\n\nLet me let AP = x, the length from A to P. If P is between D and A, then DP = DA - AP. So:\n\nDA*(DA - AP) = DB\u00b2 \u21d2 325/22*(325/22 -x ) = (225/22)^2\n\nSo expanding:\n\n(325/22)^2 - (325/22)x = (225/22)^2 \u21d2 (325\u00b2 -225\u00b2)/22\u00b2 = (325/22)x\n\nCompute numerator: 325\u00b2 -225\u00b2 = (325-225)(325+225)= 100*550=55,000.\n\nTherefore,\n\n55,000/(22\u00b2) = (325/22)x \u21d2 x= (55,000 / (22\u00b2)) * (22/325) = 55,000/(22*325) = (55,000)/(7,150)\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 50: 55,000/50=1,100; 7,150/50=143.\n\nThus, x=1100/143. Check if reducible: 1100 divided by 11 is 100, 143 divided by11 is13. So 1100/143 = (100/13). Since 143=11\u00d713, so 1100=100\u00d711, so yes, 1100/143 = (100\u00d711)/(11\u00d713)=100/13. So AP=100/13.\n\nAh, so that's positive. So I must have made a directional error before, assuming P was beyond A, but in reality, P is between D and A, so AP is DA - DP, and the calculation gives AP=100/13. So m=100, n=13, which are coprime, so m +n= 113.\n\nWait, let me confirm this result with another approach to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute using coordinates.\n\nWe had the parametrization of line AD as:\n\nx(t) =26/3 - (25/6)t,\n\ny(t)= (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t.\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P with the circle, which is not A (t=0). So substitute into the circle equation.\n\nThe circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nLet me plug in x(t) and y(t):\n\n[x(t)]\u00b2 + [y(t)]\u00b2 -9x(t) - (33\u221a14)/28 y(t) =0.\n\nThis will result in a quadratic equation in t, with one root at t=0 (point A), and the other root at t corresponding to point P. Let me compute this.\n\nFirst, compute [x(t)]\u00b2:\n\n(26/3 -25t/6)^2 = (26/3)^2 - 2*(26/3)*(25t/6) + (25t/6)^2 = (676/9) - (1300t)/18 + (625t\u00b2)/36\n\nSimilarly, [y(t)]\u00b2:\n\n[(4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14 t)/33]^2 = (4\u221a14/3)^2 - 2*(4\u221a14/3)*(125\u221a14 t)/33 + (125\u221a14 t /33)^2\n\nCompute term by term:\n\nFirst term: (16*14)/9 = 224/9\n\nSecond term: -2*(4\u221a14/3)*(125\u221a14 t)/33 = -2*(4*125*14 t)/(3*33) = - (125*56 t)/99 = - (7000 t)/99\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait, (\u221a14)*(\u221a14)=14. So:\n\nSecond term: -2*(4/3)*(125/33)*14 * t = -2*(4*125*14)/(3*33) *t = - (2*4*125*14)/(99) *t = (2*4=8; 8*125=1000; 1000*14=14,000; so -14,000/(99) *t )\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nThe cross term:\n\n-2*(4\u221a14/3)*(125\u221a14/33)*t = -2*(4*125)*(\u221a14 *\u221a14)/(3*33)*t = -2*(500)*(14)/(99)*t = -2*(7000)/99 *t = -14000/99 t\n\nThird term of y\u00b2: (125\u221a14 t /33)^2 = (125\u00b2 *14 t\u00b2)/33\u00b2 = (15625 *14)/1089 t\u00b2 = 218750/1089 t\u00b2\n\nNow, the third term in the circle equation: -9x(t) = -9*(26/3 -25t/6 )= -78 + (225t)/6 = -78 + 37.5t\n\nFourth term: -(33\u221a14)/28 * y(t) = - (33\u221a14)/28 * [ (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14 t)/33 ]\n\nLet me compute this term:\n\nFirst, distribute:\n\n- (33\u221a14)/28*(4\u221a14)/3 + (33\u221a14)/28*(125\u221a14 t)/33\n\nSimplify each part:\n\nFirst part:\n\n- (33\u221a14 *4\u221a14)/(28*3) = - (132*14)/(84) = - (1848)/84 = -22.\n\nSecond part:\n\n+ (33\u221a14 *125\u221a14 t)/(28*33) = (125*14 t)/28 = (1750 t)/28 = (875 t)/14 = 62.5 t\n\nTherefore, the fourth term simplifies to -22 + (62.5)t.\n\nNow, putting all terms together:\n\n[x(t)]\u00b2 + [y(t)]\u00b2 -9x(t) - (33\u221a14)/28 y(t) =\n\n[ (676/9 - 1300t/18 +625t\u00b2/36) + (224/9 -14000t/99 +218750t\u00b2/1089) ]\n\n+ [ -78 + 37.5t ]\n\n+ [ -22 +62.5t ]\n\nThis is quite complex. Let me try to combine term by term:\n\nFirst, combine the constants:\n\n676/9 +224/9 -78 -22.\n\n676 +224 = 900, so 900/9 =100. Then 100 -78 -22=0. So constants cancel out.\n\nNow linear terms in t:\n\n-1300t/18 -14000t/99 +37.5t +62.5t.\n\nConvert all terms to fractions with denominator 198 (LCM of 18,99,1,1):\n\n-1300t/18 = -1300*11 t /198 = -14300t/198\n\n-14000t/99 = -14000*2t /198 = -28000t/198\n\n37.5t =75/2 t = (75/2)*(99/99)t = but maybe better as decimal to fraction:\n\n37.5t = 75/2 t = (75/2)*(99/99)= (75*99)/198 t. Wait, perhaps convert all to over 198:\n\n37.5 t = 37.5 * (198/198) t = (37.5*198)/198 t. 37.5 *198 = 75/2 *198=75*99=7425. So 7425/198 t.\n\nSimilarly, 62.5t =125/2 t = (125/2)*(99/99)= (125*99)/198 t. 125*99=12,375. So 12,375/198 t.\n\nTherefore, linear terms total:\n\n(-14300 -28000 +7425 +12375)/198 t.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n-14300 -28000 = -42300\n\n7425 +12375 =19800\n\nTotal: -42300 +19800 =-22500\n\nThus linear terms: -22500/198 t = -22500 \u00f7 6 =-3750/33 t. Wait, simplifying -22500/198: divide numerator and denominator by 6: -3750/33, further divide by 3: -1250/11. Hmm, not sure, but maybe keep as -22500/198 t = -1250/11 t after simplifying 22500/198 = 22500 \u00f7 6 = 3750; 198 \u00f76=33. So 3750/33=1250/11. So yes, -1250/11 t.\n\nNow quadratic terms in t\u00b2:\n\n625t\u00b2/36 +218750t\u00b2/1089.\n\nConvert to common denominator. 36 and 1089. 36=4*9, 1089= 121*9. So LCM is 4*121*9= 4356.\n\n625/36 = (625*121)/4356 = 75625/4356\n\n218750/1089 = (218750*4)/4356 = 875,000/4356\n\nTotal quadratic term: (75625 +875000)/4356 t\u00b2 = 950,625/4356 t\u00b2 = (975\u00b2)/(66\u00b2) t\u00b2 from before, which is (975/66)^2 t\u00b2. Wait, but in any case, 950625/4356 = same as DA squared, which is (325/22)^2? Wait, 325/22 squared is (325)^2/(22)^2 = 105,625/484 \u2248218. So 950625/4356 \u2248218.25, which is similar.\n\nAnyway, the quadratic term is (950625 /4356 ) t\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the entire equation becomes:\n\n(950625 /4356 ) t\u00b2 - (1250/11 )t =0\n\nFactor out t:\n\nt [ (950625 /4356 ) t - 1250/11 ] =0\n\nSolutions are t=0 (which is point A) and t= (1250/11 ) / (950625 /4356 )\n\nCompute the second solution:\n\nt= (1250/11 ) * (4356 /950625 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst, note that 950625 = 975\u00b2, 4356=66\u00b2, but maybe factor numerators and denominators:\n\n1250 = 125*10 = 2*5^4,\n\n4356 = 4*1089=4*33\u00b2=4*(3*11)^2=2\u00b2*3\u00b2*11\u00b2,\n\n950625=975\u00b2= (25*39)^2=25\u00b2*(3*13)^2=5^4*3\u00b2*13\u00b2,\n\n11 is prime.\n\nSo,\n\nt= (2 *5^4 / 11 ) * (2\u00b2 *3\u00b2 *11\u00b2 / (5^4 *3\u00b2 *13\u00b2 )) )\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nt= [1250 /11 ] * [4356 /950625 ]\n\n= (1250 *4356 )/(11 *950625 )\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\n1250 = 125 *10 = 5^3 *2 *5 =5^4 *2? Wait, 1250= 125*10=5^3 * 2 *5=5^4 *2? Wait 5^3 *2*5 would be 5^4*2, yes. So 1250=2*5^4.\n\n4356= 4*1089=4*33\u00b2=4*(3*11)^2=2\u00b2*3\u00b2*11\u00b2.\n\nDenominator:\n\n11 *950625 =11*(975)^2 =11*(25*39)^2=11*(25)^2*(3*13)^2=11*5^4*3\u00b2*13\u00b2.\n\nTherefore,\n\nNumerator: 2*5^4 *2\u00b2*3\u00b2*11\u00b2 =2^(3)*5^4*3\u00b2*11\u00b2\n\nDenominator: 11*5^4*3\u00b2*13\u00b2*11 = 11\u00b2*5^4*3\u00b2*13\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, denominator is 11*(975)^2 =11*(25*39)^2=11*(25)^2*(3*13)^2=11*(5^4)*(3\u00b2)*(13\u00b2). So denominator is 11*5^4*3\u00b2*13\u00b2.\n\nThus,\n\nt= [2^3 *5^4 *3\u00b2 *11\u00b2 ] / [11*5^4 *3\u00b2 *13\u00b2 *11 ] ?\n\nWait, wait:\n\nWait numerator: 2^3*5^4*3\u00b2*11\u00b2,\n\ndenominator: 11*5^4*3\u00b2*13\u00b2*11? Wait, no, denominator is 11*(5^4 *3\u00b2 *13\u00b2).\n\nWait, the denominator is 11*(5^4 *3\u00b2 *13\u00b2). So:\n\nt= [2^3 *5^4 *3\u00b2 *11\u00b2 ] / [11*(5^4 *3\u00b2 *13\u00b2) ]\n\nCancel terms:\n\n5^4 cancels, 3\u00b2 cancels, 11\u00b2 cancels with 11 in denominator leaving 11:\n\nSo,\n\nt= (2^3 *11 ) / (13\u00b2 )\n\n= (8 *11)/169 = 88/169.\n\nTherefore, t=88/169.\n\nTherefore, the parameter t for point P is 88/169. Since t=0 is point A, and t=1 is point D, this t is between 0 and1, so P is between A and D. Therefore, AP is the distance from A to P, which is t=88/169 of the way from A to D? Wait, no. Wait in the parametrization, t is from A (t=0) to D (t=1). So the length from A to P is the length from A (t=0) to P (t=88/169). Since the total length from A to D is DA =325/22, then AP = t * DA?\n\nWait, no, the parameter t is scaling the vector from A to D. So the distance AP is |t| * DA, but since t is positive (88/169 <1), then AP = t * DA.\n\nWait, but in parametrization:\n\nThe coordinates of P are:\n\nx(t) =26/3 - (25/6)t,\n\ny(t) = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t.\n\nThe distance from A (at t=0) to P (at t=88/169):\n\n\u0394x= - (25/6)*(88/169),\n\n\u0394y= - (125\u221a14/33)*(88/169).\n\nThus,\n\nAP squared is [ (25/6 *88/169 ) ]\u00b2 + [ (125\u221a14/33 *88/169 ) ]\u00b2.\n\nFactor out (88/169)^2:\n\nAP\u00b2= (88/169)^2 [ (25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14/33)^2 ]\n\nBut notice that the expression inside the brackets is exactly DA squared, since DA squared is (25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14/33)^2 = (from previous computation) 950625 /4356 = (325/22)^2.\n\nTherefore,\n\nAP squared = (88/169)^2 * (325/22)^2\n\nTake square roots:\n\nAP = (88/169)*(325/22)= simplify:\n\n88 and 22: 88/22=4,\n\n325 and 169: 169=13\u00b2, 325=25*13,\n\nSo,\n\nAP= (4)*(25*13)/169 = (100*13)/169 = 1300/169 = 100/13. (since 1300 divided by13 is 100, and 169 is13\u00b2, so 1300/169=100/13).\n\nTherefore, AP=100/13, so m=100, n=13, which are coprime. So m +n= 113.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 113.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{113}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then line AD intersects the circle again at P. The sides are given as AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nHmm, first, let me recall some properties related to tangents and circles. The point where the tangents from a point to a circle meet has some important properties. Specifically, the point D is the exsymmedian or something? Wait, maybe I need to use power of a point here. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then DB and DC are both tangent to the circle \u03c9. So, by the power of point D with respect to \u03c9, we have DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. That seems useful because AP is part of AD, so maybe I can express DP in terms of AD and AP?\n\nLet me write that down. Power of point D gives DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. Since DB = DC (because both are tangents from D to the circle), so that checks out. So, DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Therefore, if I can find DA and DB, I can relate them to DP and AP. But AP is part of AD, so maybe I can write DP = AD + AP? Wait, no. Wait, AD is from A to D, and then P is another intersection point. Wait, actually, since AD starts at A, goes through D, and then intersects the circle again at P? Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says \"AD intersects \u03c9 at P\". But AD starts at A, which is already on the circle. So the other intersection point is P. Therefore, AP is the segment from A to P, which is along AD beyond A? Wait, no. Wait, actually, A is on the circle, so AD starts at A, goes through D, and then exits the circle again at P? Wait, but D is outside the circle, so AD starts at A (on the circle), goes through D (outside), so P must be the other intersection point? Wait, but then the line AD would pass through A, go to D, and then where is P? Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify the diagram.\n\nLooking back at the Asymptote code, they have P as the intersection of DA with the circle again. Since A is already on the circle, P is the second point where AD meets the circle. So, the path is A -> D -> P, but since D is outside the circle, AP must pass through D? Wait, no. Wait, the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then since D is outside, the line AD would exit the circle again at another point P beyond D? Wait, that can't be because A is already on the circle. So, the line AD starts at A (on the circle), goes through D (outside), so the other intersection point with the circle would be on the extension beyond D? Wait, that can't be because then P would be on the other side. Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is different. Let me check the Asymptote code again:\n\nThe Asymptote code says: P = IP(D..A, A..B..C); Hmm, maybe that's a typo? Wait, \"IP\" is intersection point. So, D..A would be the line from D to A, and A..B..C is the circle? So, the circle is defined as going through A, B, C. Therefore, P is the second intersection point of line DA with the circle, so starting at D, going through A, and then exiting the circle again at P? Wait, but A is on the circle, so if you go from D through A, then the other intersection would be the same as A unless the line is tangent there. But the line DA is passing through A and going to D, so the second intersection point would be A itself if it's tangent, but since D is the intersection of two tangents, maybe DA isn't tangent. Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe P is between A and D? But if D is outside the circle, then the line AD would start at A (on the circle), go through D (outside), so the only other intersection with the circle is A. Therefore, maybe the problem states that P is the second intersection, so maybe my initial thought is wrong. Wait, perhaps the Asymptote code is drawing A..B..C..cycle, which is the circumcircle. So the line AD is extended beyond A to meet the circle again at P? Wait, that would make sense. If you go from D through A and then P is on the other side of A from D. Hmm, so that would mean AP is a segment from A to P, with D lying on AD between A and D? Wait, no. Let me try to parse this again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Let AD intersect \u03c9 at P\". Since A is already on \u03c9, the intersection other than A is P. So, the line AD intersects \u03c9 at A and P, so P is the other point. So depending on the direction, if D is outside the circle, then the line AD starts at A (on the circle), goes outward to D, so the other intersection P would be on the other side of A? Wait, no, that can't be because going from A towards D would exit the circle only at A. So maybe the line AD extended beyond D would meet the circle again? But then P would be on the extension beyond D. Wait, but in that case, the length AP would be AD + DP, but the problem might consider directed lengths. Hmm, perhaps the problem just wants the length regardless of direction. Maybe I need to use power of a point.\n\nLet me recall that Power of a Point says that for a point D outside the circle, the power is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. Since P is the second intersection point of line AD with the circle, then DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Therefore, if I let AP = x, then DP would be DA + AP? Wait, depends on the direction. If A is on the circle, and D is outside, then moving from D towards A, you reach A, then continuing past A to P, so DP would be DA + AP. Wait, but in that case, DA is from D to A, and AP is from A to P. So the entire length from D to P would be DA + AP. So then, DA * DP = DA*(DA + AP) = DA\u00b2 + DA*AP = DB\u00b2. Hmm, but maybe I should use directed lengths here. Since in power of a point, the product is signed. So, if we consider the power as DA * DP = DB\u00b2, where DA and DP are signed lengths. If D is outside, then DA is negative if we take direction from D to A, and DP would be DA + AP? Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think in terms of lengths.\n\nLet me denote AP as the length from A to P, and DP as the length from D to P. Since P is on AD extended beyond A, then DP would be DA + AP. Wait, no, if P is on the other side of A from D, then DP would be DA + AP. Wait, suppose D is outside the circle, and the line AD goes from D to A (on the circle), then P is the other intersection, so P must be on the opposite side of A from D. So, the line goes D -> A -> P. Therefore, the distance from D to P is DA + AP. Therefore, DA * DP = DA*(DA + AP) = DB\u00b2. So, if I let AP = x, then DA*(DA + x) = DB\u00b2. Therefore, x = (DB\u00b2 / DA) - DA. Therefore, AP = (DB\u00b2 / DA) - DA = (DB\u00b2 - DA\u00b2)/DA. Hmm, so if I can compute DA and DB, then I can compute AP.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to assign variables. Let me let AP = x, so then DP = DA + AP? Wait, but DA is the length from D to A, so if P is beyond A from D, then DP = DA + AP. So yes, so then DA * DP = DA*(DA + AP) = DB\u00b2. So, if I can find DA and DB, then I can solve for AP. Alternatively, if I can express DA in terms of DB, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use coordinate geometry? Let me see. Since the triangle has sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10, perhaps I can compute coordinates for the triangle and then find the equation of the circle, find point D, then compute AD and find P?\n\nAlternatively, use trigonometry. Let me think. Maybe first compute the circumradius of triangle ABC, since the triangle is inscribed in the circle \u03c9. Then, perhaps use some trigonometric relations.\n\nFirst, let me compute the circumradius R of triangle ABC. The formula for the circumradius is (a b c)/(4 area). Let's compute the area first using Heron's formula. The sides are AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Wait, let me check the sides again: AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Wait, so sides a, b, c opposite to A, B, C? Wait, actually, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So let me confirm:\n\nLet me denote the triangle sides as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let:\n\n- a = BC = 9,\n\n- b = AC = 10,\n\n- c = AB = 5.\n\nThen the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (9 + 10 + 5)/2 = 24/2 = 12.\n\nArea using Heron's formula: sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12 - 9)*(12 - 10)*(12 -5)] = sqrt[12*3*2*7] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] Wait, actually 12*3=36, 36*2=72, 72*7=504. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(16*31.5) Hmm, 504 factors into 16*31.5? Wait, better as 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, 16*31.5 is 504, but maybe better to factor into primes: 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but perhaps 504 = 8*63 = 8*9*7 = 2^3 * 3^2 *7. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(2^3 *3^2 *7) = 2^(1.5)*3*sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Wait, let me compute sqrt(504):\n\nsqrt(504) = sqrt( 16 * 31.5 )? Wait, perhaps better as sqrt(504) = sqrt( 16 * 31.5 ) is not helpful. Let me do 504 divided by 4 is 126, so sqrt(4*126)=2*sqrt(126). 126 is 9*14, so sqrt(126)=3*sqrt(14). So sqrt(504)=2*3*sqrt(14)=6\u221a14. So the area is 6\u221a14. Therefore, the area is 6\u221a14.\n\nTherefore, the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4*Area) = (9*10*5)/(4*6\u221a14). Let me compute numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 9*10=90, 90*5=450.\n\nDenominator: 4*6=24, so 24\u221a14.\n\nThus R = 450/(24\u221a14) = Simplify numerator and denominator by 6: 450/6=75, 24/6=4. So 75/(4\u221a14). Rationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14: (75\u221a14)/(4*14) = (75\u221a14)/56. So R = 75\u221a14 /56. Hmm, okay, so that's the circumradius. Not sure if this will help yet, but maybe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinates. Let me set coordinate system. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point B along the x-axis, so point B is (9, 0). Wait, but AC is 10, AB is 5, BC is 9. Wait, actually, hold on, in the problem, BC is 9, so if I place point B at (0,0), point C at (9,0), but then point A is somewhere else. Alternatively, maybe set point C at (0,0), point B at (x,0), but need to make sure the sides are correct. Let me see.\n\nLet me try to set point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0), since BC is 9. Then point A is somewhere in the plane. Let me denote coordinates:\n\nLet me denote coordinates as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s place point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0). Then point A has coordinates (x,y) such that AC = 10 and AB = 5. So, distance from A to C (0,0) is 10: sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 10, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100.\n\nDistance from A to B (9,0) is 5: sqrt( (x -9)^2 + y^2 ) =5, so (x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 =25.\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second: (x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =25 - 100 \u21d2 (x\u00b2 -18x +81) -x\u00b2 = -75 \u21d2 -18x +81 = -75 \u21d2 -18x = -156 \u21d2 x = 156 /18 = 26/3 \u2248 8.666...\n\nSo x=26/3. Then, substitute back into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =100:\n\n(26/3)^2 + y\u00b2 = 100 \u21d2 (676/9) + y\u00b2 = 100 \u21d2 y\u00b2 = 100 - 676/9 = (900 -676)/9 = 224/9 \u21d2 y = \u00b1\u221a(224/9) = \u00b1(\u221a224)/3 = \u00b1(4\u221a14)/3.\n\nSo coordinates of A are (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3) or (26/3, -4\u221a14/3). Since triangles are typically considered in upper half-plane unless specified, let's take the positive y-coordinate. So A is (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3).\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nC: (0,0)\n\nB: (9,0)\n\nA: (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3)\n\nNow, need to find the equations of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9. Then find their intersection D, then find equation of AD and find its other intersection P with \u03c9, then compute AP.\n\nFirst, let me find the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9. Since we have coordinates for A, B, C, we can compute the equation.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0. Plugging in the coordinates of A, B, C:\n\nFor point C (0,0):\n\n0 +0 +0 +0 + F =0 \u21d2 F=0.\n\nWait, but that can't be unless the circle passes through the origin. Wait, point C is at (0,0), so yes, so F=0.\n\nWait, but point B is (9,0):\n\nPlugging into equation: 9\u00b2 +0 + D*9 + E*0 + F =0 \u21d281 +9D +0 +0=0 (since F=0). Wait, but F was set to 0 because of point C. Wait, but 81 +9D =0 \u21d2 D= -81/9 = -9.\n\nSimilarly, point A (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3):\n\nPlug into equation:\n\n(26/3)^2 + ( (4\u221a14)/3 )^2 + D*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14)/3 =0.\n\nWe already have D = -9 and F=0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (26/3)^2 = (676)/9\n\nSecond term: (16*14)/9 = 224/9\n\nThird term: D*(26/3) = (-9)*(26/3) = -234/3 = -78\n\nFourth term: E*(4\u221a14)/3\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\n676/9 + 224/9 -78 + (4\u221a14 E)/3 =0\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n(676 +224)/9 = 900/9 =100\n\nSo 100 -78 + (4\u221a14 E)/3 =0 \u21d2 22 + (4\u221a14 E)/3 =0 \u21d2 (4\u221a14 E)/3 = -22 \u21d2 E= (-22 *3)/(4\u221a14) = (-66)/(4\u221a14) = (-33)/(2\u221a14). Rationalizing the denominator:\n\nE= (-33)/(2\u221a14) * (\u221a14/\u221a14) = (-33\u221a14)/(28).\n\nTherefore, the equation of the circle is:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the circumcircle using perpendicular bisectors?\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates for A, B, C, perhaps compute the tangent lines at B and C.\n\nThe tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the tangent at point B (9,0):\n\nThe center of the circle, let's find it first.\n\nWait, since we have the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0, we can find the center (h,k) by completing the squares.\n\nThe general form is x\u00b2 -9x + y\u00b2 - (33\u221a14/28)y =0.\n\nCompleting the square for x:\n\nx\u00b2 -9x = (x - 9/2)^2 - (81/4)\n\nFor y:\n\ny\u00b2 - (33\u221a14/28)y = [y - (33\u221a14)/56]^2 - ( (33\u221a14)/56 )\u00b2\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n(x - 9/2)^2 - 81/4 + [y - (33\u221a14)/56]^2 - [ (33\u221a14)/56 )\u00b2 ] =0\n\nThus,\n\n(x - 9/2)^2 + [y - (33\u221a14)/56]^2 = 81/4 + [ (33\u221a14)/56 )\u00b2 ]\n\nThis is the equation of the circle. Therefore, the center is at (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56 ), and the radius squared is the right-hand side. Hmm, this might be too complicated. Maybe better to compute the tangent lines using derivatives or point-form.\n\nAlternatively, the tangent at point B (9,0):\n\nThe slope of the radius from center to B is (0 - (33\u221a14)/56 ) / (9 - 9/2 ) = ( -33\u221a14 /56 ) / (9/2) = (-33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (-33\u221a14)/252 = (-11\u221a14)/84. Therefore, the tangent line at B is perpendicular to this radius, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: 84/(11\u221a14). Rationalizing, that's (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (6\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo the tangent at B has slope 6\u221a14 /11. Therefore, the equation is:\n\ny -0 = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9)\n\nSimilarly, tangent at point C (0,0):\n\nWait, point C is at (0,0). The radius to point C is from center (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56 ) to (0,0). The slope of that radius is [ (33\u221a14)/56 -0 ] / [9/2 -0] = (33\u221a14)/56 divided by 9/2 = (33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (33\u221a14)/252 = (11\u221a14)/84. Therefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to this, so slope is the negative reciprocal: -84/(11\u221a14) = -84/(11\u221a14). Rationalizing, that's -84\u221a14/(11*14) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C (0,0) has slope -6\u221a14 /11. So its equation is y = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nTherefore, the two tangent lines are:\n\nAt B: y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9)\n\nAt C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nWe need to find their intersection point D. Let me set the two equations equal:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14) to eliminate coefficients:\n\n(x -9) = -x\n\nSo x -9 = -x \u21d2 2x =9 \u21d2 x= 9/2.\n\nPlugging back into the tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)(9/2) = (-6\u221a14 *9)/(22) = (-54\u221a14)/22 = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, point D is at (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nHmm, okay, coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11). Now, need to find the equation of line AD, then find its other intersection P with the circle, then compute AP.\n\nFirst, coordinates of A are (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3), coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11). Let me compute the parametric equation of line AD.\n\nLet me parametrize line AD. Let me denote parameter t such that when t=0, we are at A, and t=1, we are at D. Then:\n\nx(t) = x_A + t*(x_D - x_A) = 26/3 + t*(9/2 -26/3 )\n\nSimilarly, y(t) = y_A + t*(y_D - y_A ) = (4\u221a14)/3 + t*( -27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3 )\n\nCompute the differences:\n\nx_D - x_A = 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6)= (-25/6)\n\ny_D - y_A = (-27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3 ) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3 ) = \u221a14*(-81/33 -44/33)= \u221a14*(-125/33)\n\nTherefore,\n\nx(t) = 26/3 - (25/6)t\n\ny(t) = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of line AD with the circle \u03c9. Since A is already on the circle, we need to find t \u22600 such that (x(t), y(t)) lies on the circle.\n\nThe equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nSubstitute x(t) and y(t) into the equation.\n\nLet me denote x(t) = 26/3 - (25/6)t,\n\ny(t) = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t\n\nThis seems quite involved. Let me see if there's a smarter way. Alternatively, since we know that AP * AD = something via power of a point? Wait, earlier thought: Power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. So DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Since DP is the length from D to P, and DA is from D to A. Since P is on the line AD beyond A (since D is outside, and the tangent lines are from D), then DP = DA + AP. Wait, but need to confirm direction.\n\nWait, actually, in terms of directed segments, if we take DA as a vector from D to A, then DP would be DA + AP (if P is beyond A). But in terms of lengths, if DA is the length from D to A, then DP would be DA + AP. Therefore, DA * DP = DA*(DA + AP) = DB\u00b2. So if I can compute DA and DB, then I can solve for AP.\n\nAlternatively, compute DA and DB using coordinates.\n\nFirst, compute DA: distance between D (9/2, -27\u221a14/11) and A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3).\n\nLet me compute the differences:\n\n\u0394x = 26/3 - 9/2 = (52/6 -27/6)=25/6\n\n\u0394y = (4\u221a14)/3 - (-27\u221a14/11) = (4\u221a14)/3 +27\u221a14/11 = \u221a14*(4/3 +27/11) = \u221a14*( (44 +81)/33 )= \u221a14*(125/33)\n\nTherefore, DA squared is (25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14/33)^2\n\nCompute (25/6)^2 = 625/36\n\n(125\u221a14 /33)^2 = (125^2)*(14)/(33^2) = (15625 *14)/(1089) = 218750/1089\n\nTherefore, DA\u00b2 = 625/36 + 218750/1089. Let me compute this:\n\nFirst, convert to common denominator. 36 and 1089. Let's see 1089 is 33\u00b2=1089, 36 is 6\u00b2. LCM of 36 and 1089. Since 36=4*9, 1089= 121*9, so LCM is 4*121*9= 4356.\n\nTherefore, 625/36 = (625 * 121)/4356\n\n218750/1089 = (218750 *4)/4356\n\nCompute 625*121: 625*121. 625*120=75000, plus 625*1=625 \u2192 75625.\n\n218750 *4 = 875,000.\n\nThus, DA\u00b2 = (75625 + 875000)/4356 = 950625 /4356.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: 950625 \u00f73 = 316,875; 4356 \u00f73=1452\n\nAgain by 3: 316,875 \u00f73=105,625; 1452 \u00f73=484\n\nAgain by 4: 105,625 \u00f7 4? Not divisible. Wait, 105625 divided by 25: 105625/25=4225, and 484/25? Not helpful. Let me check GCD of 950625 and 4356.\n\nWait, 950625 divided by 25 is 38025, 4356 divided by 25 is not integer. Let me see prime factors:\n\n4356: 4*1089 = 4*33\u00b2 = 4*(3*11)^2 = 2\u00b2*3\u00b2*11\u00b2.\n\n950625: let's factor 950625. Divide by 25: 950625 /25=38025. 38025 divided by 25=1521. 1521 is 39\u00b2= (13*3)^2. So 950625=25*25*39\u00b2=25\u00b2*(3*13)^2= (25*3*13)^2= (975)^2. Wait, 25*25=625, 625*39\u00b2. Hmm, 38025 is 195\u00b2 (since 200\u00b2=40,000, so 195\u00b2=38025). So 950625= (195*25)^2? Wait, no. Wait, 195\u00b2=38025, so 950625= 25\u00b2 * 195\u00b2? Wait, perhaps not. Wait 950625= (sqrt(950625))\u00b2. sqrt(950625)= 975, because 975\u00b2= (1000 -25)^2= 1000\u00b2 -2*1000*25 +25\u00b2= 1,000,000 -50,000 +625= 950,625. Yes! So sqrt(950625)=975, so DA\u00b2=975\u00b2/(2\u00b2*3\u00b2*11\u00b2). Wait, denominator is 4356= (2*3*11)^2= 66\u00b2. So DA\u00b2 = (975/66)^2. Therefore, DA=975/66. Simplify 975 divided by 66: divide numerator and denominator by 3: 325/22. So DA= 325/22.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nDA squared is 950625 /4356. 950625 divided by 4356:\n\nCompute 4356 * 218.75= ?\n\nWait, instead, 950625 \u00f7 4356: Let me see 4356 * 200 = 871200, subtract that from 950625: 950625 -871200 =79425. Then 4356*18=78408. 79425 -78408=1017. Hmm, so 200+18=218, with remainder 1017. Not helpful. Alternatively, since sqrt(950625)=975 and sqrt(4356)=66, so sqrt(DA\u00b2)=975/66= DA. So DA=975/66= 325/22 after dividing numerator and denominator by 3. Yes, because 975 \u00f73=325, 66 \u00f73=22. So DA=325/22.\n\nSimilarly, compute DB. Since DB is the length from D to B. Coordinates of B are (9,0), D is (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nCompute \u0394x= 9 -9/2=9/2, \u0394y=0 - (-27\u221a14/11)=27\u221a14/11\n\nThus, DB squared is (9/2)^2 + (27\u221a14/11)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(9/2)^2 =81/4\n\n(27\u221a14/11)^2 = (27\u00b2)*(14)/(11\u00b2)=729*14 /121 = 10,206 /121\n\nThus, DB\u00b2 =81/4 +10206/121. Let's compute this.\n\nCommon denominator is 4*121=484.\n\n81/4 = (81*121)/484= 9801/484\n\n10206/121= (10206*4)/484=40824/484\n\nTotal DB\u00b2 = (9801 +40824)/484 =50625/484\n\nTherefore, DB= sqrt(50625/484)=225/22.\n\nTherefore, DB is 225/22.\n\nTherefore, from Power of a Point: DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWe have DA=325/22, DP= ?\n\nWe need to find DP. Let me note that DP = DA + AP if P is beyond A from D. Wait, but in terms of directed segments, depending on parametrization. Let me think again.\n\nIf point P is on line AD beyond A from D, then the length DP would be DA + AP. But in terms of the Power of a Point formula, which uses signed lengths, so if we consider D to A to P, then DA is negative if direction is from D to A, and DP would be DA (negative) plus AP (positive?), but maybe it's better to just use magnitudes here.\n\nSince all are lengths, so DA * DP = DB\u00b2, where DA and DP are lengths. Since P is on the line AD beyond A from D, then DP = DA + AP. Therefore:\n\nDA*(DA + AP) = DB\u00b2 \u21d2 (325/22)*(325/22 + AP) = (225/22)^2.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n(325/22)*(325/22 + AP) = (225/22)^2\n\nMultiply both sides by 22\u00b2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n325*(325 +22 AP) =225\u00b2\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nLeft side: 325*(325 +22 AP) ?\n\nWait, actually, let me re-express:\n\nLet me denote AP = x. Then,\n\n325/22 * (325/22 + x) = (225/22)^2\n\nMultiply both sides by (22)^2:\n\n325*(325 +22x) =225\u00b2\n\nCompute 225\u00b2=50625\n\nLeft side: 325*325 + 325*22 x = (325)^2 + (7150)x\n\nCompute 325\u00b2: 325*325. Let me compute 300\u00b2=90000, 25\u00b2=625, and cross term 2*300*25=15000. So (300+25)^2= 90000 +15000 +625= 105625.\n\nSo left side:105625 +7150x =50625\n\nThus, 7150x =50625 -105625 = -55000\n\nTherefore, x= -55000 /7150.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 50: -1100/143. Hmm, 143 is 11*13, 1100 divided by 11 is 100, so:\n\n-1100/143 = -100/13.\n\nWait, but AP is a length, so can't be negative. Hmm, so perhaps my assumption about the direction was wrong. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps P is on the other side? If DP = |DA - AP|, but maybe I need to consider the direction.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the Power of a Point formula. The Power of point D with respect to circle \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP, where DA and DP are signed lengths. If we take the line AD, then the power is DA * DP, where DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P. If P is on the opposite side of A from D, then DP would be DA + AP, but in terms of signed lengths, if we take direction from D, then DA is positive towards A, and beyond A to P would be positive as well. Wait, perhaps the formula is just the product of the distances, so maybe my mistake was in the algebra.\n\nWait, let me write the equation again:\n\nDA * DP = DB\u00b2\n\nWe have DA = 325/22, DB =225/22, so DB squared is (225/22)^2.\n\nSo,\n\n(325/22) * DP = (225/22)^2 \u21d2 DP = (225/22)^2 / (325/22) = (225^2)/(325 *22)\n\nSimplify:\n\n225 /325 = 45/65 =9/13 (divided numerator and denominator by 5, then by 5 again? Wait 225 \u00f75=45, 325 \u00f75=65. Then 45/65 =9/13 (divided by 5 again? Wait 45 \u00f75=9, 65 \u00f75=13). So yes, 225/325 =9/13. So DP = (9/13)*(225/22) ?\n\nWait, wait, let me re-express:\n\nDP = (225/22)^2 divided by (325/22) = (225\u00b2 /22\u00b2) * (22/325) )= (225\u00b2 *22 )/(22\u00b2 *325) = (225\u00b2)/(22*325)\n\nWait, 225\u00b2 =225*225, 22*325=22*325. Let me compute:\n\n225 divided by 325: 225/325 = 45/65 =9/13 as before.\n\nThus, 225\u00b2 / (22*325) = (225/325)*225 /22 = (9/13)*(225)/22 = (9*225)/(13*22)\n\n225 divided by 22 is 225/22, so:\n\nDP = (9*225)/(13*22) = (2025)/(286). Let me see if this reduces. 2025 and 286.\n\n286 factors: 2*11*13.\n\n2025 is 25*81=25*9\u00b2, so factors are 5\u00b2*3^4. No common factors with 2,11,13. So DP is 2025/286.\n\nNow, since DP is the distance from D to P, and DA is the distance from D to A (325/22), then AP would be DP - DA? Wait, if P is beyond A from D, then DP = DA + AP \u21d2 AP = DP - DA.\n\nWait, yes. If you go from D to A is DA, then from A to P is AP, so total DP = DA + AP \u21d2 AP = DP - DA.\n\nTherefore, AP = DP - DA = (2025/286) - (325/22).\n\nConvert to common denominator. 286 is 22*13. So 22 denominator term can be converted to 286 by multiplying numerator and denominator by 13:\n\n325/22 = (325*13)/(22*13)= 4225/286.\n\nThus,\n\nAP =2025/286 -4225/286 = (2025 -4225)/286 = (-2200)/286.\n\nWait, negative? That can't be. Hmm, so that suggests that my assumption of the direction is wrong. AP came out negative, meaning that P is actually on the other side of D from A?\n\nWait, so maybe P is between D and A? But A is on the circle, so the line DA starts at D, goes through A, and then exits the circle again at P? Wait, no, the other intersection would be A itself. Wait, perhaps the parametrization earlier was different. Wait, when I set up the parametrization earlier with t=0 at A and t=1 at D, then P would correspond to a negative t?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Power of a Point formula gives DA * DP = DB\u00b2, but if P is on the other side, then DP would be DA - AP, but direction matters. Let me think again with signed lengths.\n\nAssume the line is parametrized such that D is at 0, A is at +DA, and P is at +DP from D. Then if P is beyond A, then DP = DA + AP \u21d2 AP = DP - DA. But if the calculation gives AP negative, then that would imply that P is in the opposite direction from A, i.e., between D and A.\n\nWait, let me see the value:\n\nAP = DP - DA = (2025/286 - 325/22) = (2025 - (325*13))/286. Because 325/22 = 325*13/(22*13)= 4225/286.\n\n2025 - 4225 = -2200. So AP = -2200/286. Negative, meaning direction is opposite. So P is between D and A, so AP is actually DA - DP?\n\nWait, maybe the formula is DA * DP = DB\u00b2, but if P is between D and A, then DP is less than DA, so DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me recast:\n\nLet me let AP = x, the length from A to P. If P is between D and A, then DP = DA - AP. So:\n\nDA*(DA - AP) = DB\u00b2 \u21d2 325/22*(325/22 -x ) = (225/22)^2\n\nSo expanding:\n\n(325/22)^2 - (325/22)x = (225/22)^2 \u21d2 (325\u00b2 -225\u00b2)/22\u00b2 = (325/22)x\n\nCompute numerator: 325\u00b2 -225\u00b2 = (325-225)(325+225)= 100*550=55,000.\n\nTherefore,\n\n55,000/(22\u00b2) = (325/22)x \u21d2 x= (55,000 / (22\u00b2)) * (22/325) = 55,000/(22*325) = (55,000)/(7,150)\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 50: 55,000/50=1,100; 7,150/50=143.\n\nThus, x=1100/143. Check if reducible: 1100 divided by 11 is 100, 143 divided by11 is13. So 1100/143 = (100/13). Since 143=11\u00d713, so 1100=100\u00d711, so yes, 1100/143 = (100\u00d711)/(11\u00d713)=100/13. So AP=100/13.\n\nAh, so that's positive. So I must have made a directional error before, assuming P was beyond A, but in reality, P is between D and A, so AP is DA - DP, and the calculation gives AP=100/13. So m=100, n=13, which are coprime, so m +n= 113.\n\nWait, let me confirm this result with another approach to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute using coordinates.\n\nWe had the parametrization of line AD as:\n\nx(t) =26/3 - (25/6)t,\n\ny(t)= (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t.\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P with the circle, which is not A (t=0). So substitute into the circle equation.\n\nThe circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nLet me plug in x(t) and y(t):\n\n[x(t)]\u00b2 + [y(t)]\u00b2 -9x(t) - (33\u221a14)/28 y(t) =0.\n\nThis will result in a quadratic equation in t, with one root at t=0 (point A), and the other root at t corresponding to point P. Let me compute this.\n\nFirst, compute [x(t)]\u00b2:\n\n(26/3 -25t/6)^2 = (26/3)^2 - 2*(26/3)*(25t/6) + (25t/6)^2 = (676/9) - (1300t)/18 + (625t\u00b2)/36\n\nSimilarly, [y(t)]\u00b2:\n\n[(4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14 t)/33]^2 = (4\u221a14/3)^2 - 2*(4\u221a14/3)*(125\u221a14 t)/33 + (125\u221a14 t /33)^2\n\nCompute term by term:\n\nFirst term: (16*14)/9 = 224/9\n\nSecond term: -2*(4\u221a14/3)*(125\u221a14 t)/33 = -2*(4*125*14 t)/(3*33) = - (125*56 t)/99 = - (7000 t)/99\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait, (\u221a14)*(\u221a14)=14. So:\n\nSecond term: -2*(4/3)*(125/33)*14 * t = -2*(4*125*14)/(3*33) *t = - (2*4*125*14)/(99) *t = (2*4=8; 8*125=1000; 1000*14=14,000; so -14,000/(99) *t )\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nThe cross term:\n\n-2*(4\u221a14/3)*(125\u221a14/33)*t = -2*(4*125)*(\u221a14 *\u221a14)/(3*33)*t = -2*(500)*(14)/(99)*t = -2*(7000)/99 *t = -14000/99 t\n\nThird term of y\u00b2: (125\u221a14 t /33)^2 = (125\u00b2 *14 t\u00b2)/33\u00b2 = (15625 *14)/1089 t\u00b2 = 218750/1089 t\u00b2\n\nNow, the third term in the circle equation: -9x(t) = -9*(26/3 -25t/6 )= -78 + (225t)/6 = -78 + 37.5t\n\nFourth term: -(33\u221a14)/28 * y(t) = - (33\u221a14)/28 * [ (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14 t)/33 ]\n\nLet me compute this term:\n\nFirst, distribute:\n\n- (33\u221a14)/28*(4\u221a14)/3 + (33\u221a14)/28*(125\u221a14 t)/33\n\nSimplify each part:\n\nFirst part:\n\n- (33\u221a14 *4\u221a14)/(28*3) = - (132*14)/(84) = - (1848)/84 = -22.\n\nSecond part:\n\n+ (33\u221a14 *125\u221a14 t)/(28*33) = (125*14 t)/28 = (1750 t)/28 = (875 t)/14 = 62.5 t\n\nTherefore, the fourth term simplifies to -22 + (62.5)t.\n\nNow, putting all terms together:\n\n[x(t)]\u00b2 + [y(t)]\u00b2 -9x(t) - (33\u221a14)/28 y(t) =\n\n[ (676/9 - 1300t/18 +625t\u00b2/36) + (224/9 -14000t/99 +218750t\u00b2/1089) ]\n\n+ [ -78 + 37.5t ]\n\n+ [ -22 +62.5t ]\n\nThis is quite complex. Let me try to combine term by term:\n\nFirst, combine the constants:\n\n676/9 +224/9 -78 -22.\n\n676 +224 = 900, so 900/9 =100. Then 100 -78 -22=0. So constants cancel out.\n\nNow linear terms in t:\n\n-1300t/18 -14000t/99 +37.5t +62.5t.\n\nConvert all terms to fractions with denominator 198 (LCM of 18,99,1,1):\n\n-1300t/18 = -1300*11 t /198 = -14300t/198\n\n-14000t/99 = -14000*2t /198 = -28000t/198\n\n37.5t =75/2 t = (75/2)*(99/99)t = but maybe better as decimal to fraction:\n\n37.5t = 75/2 t = (75/2)*(99/99)= (75*99)/198 t. Wait, perhaps convert all to over 198:\n\n37.5 t = 37.5 * (198/198) t = (37.5*198)/198 t. 37.5 *198 = 75/2 *198=75*99=7425. So 7425/198 t.\n\nSimilarly, 62.5t =125/2 t = (125/2)*(99/99)= (125*99)/198 t. 125*99=12,375. So 12,375/198 t.\n\nTherefore, linear terms total:\n\n(-14300 -28000 +7425 +12375)/198 t.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n-14300 -28000 = -42300\n\n7425 +12375 =19800\n\nTotal: -42300 +19800 =-22500\n\nThus linear terms: -22500/198 t = -22500 \u00f7 6 =-3750/33 t. Wait, simplifying -22500/198: divide numerator and denominator by 6: -3750/33, further divide by 3: -1250/11. Hmm, not sure, but maybe keep as -22500/198 t = -1250/11 t after simplifying 22500/198 = 22500 \u00f7 6 = 3750; 198 \u00f76=33. So 3750/33=1250/11. So yes, -1250/11 t.\n\nNow quadratic terms in t\u00b2:\n\n625t\u00b2/36 +218750t\u00b2/1089.\n\nConvert to common denominator. 36 and 1089. 36=4*9, 1089= 121*9. So LCM is 4*121*9= 4356.\n\n625/36 = (625*121)/4356 = 75625/4356\n\n218750/1089 = (218750*4)/4356 = 875,000/4356\n\nTotal quadratic term: (75625 +875000)/4356 t\u00b2 = 950,625/4356 t\u00b2 = (975\u00b2)/(66\u00b2) t\u00b2 from before, which is (975/66)^2 t\u00b2. Wait, but in any case, 950625/4356 = same as DA squared, which is (325/22)^2? Wait, 325/22 squared is (325)^2/(22)^2 = 105,625/484 \u2248218. So 950625/4356 \u2248218.25, which is similar.\n\nAnyway, the quadratic term is (950625 /4356 ) t\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the entire equation becomes:\n\n(950625 /4356 ) t\u00b2 - (1250/11 )t =0\n\nFactor out t:\n\nt [ (950625 /4356 ) t - 1250/11 ] =0\n\nSolutions are t=0 (which is point A) and t= (1250/11 ) / (950625 /4356 )\n\nCompute the second solution:\n\nt= (1250/11 ) * (4356 /950625 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst, note that 950625 = 975\u00b2, 4356=66\u00b2, but maybe factor numerators and denominators:\n\n1250 = 125*10 = 2*5^4,\n\n4356 = 4*1089=4*33\u00b2=4*(3*11)^2=2\u00b2*3\u00b2*11\u00b2,\n\n950625=975\u00b2= (25*39)^2=25\u00b2*(3*13)^2=5^4*3\u00b2*13\u00b2,\n\n11 is prime.\n\nSo,\n\nt= (2 *5^4 / 11 ) * (2\u00b2 *3\u00b2 *11\u00b2 / (5^4 *3\u00b2 *13\u00b2 )) )\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nt= [1250 /11 ] * [4356 /950625 ]\n\n= (1250 *4356 )/(11 *950625 )\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\n1250 = 125 *10 = 5^3 *2 *5 =5^4 *2? Wait, 1250= 125*10=5^3 * 2 *5=5^4 *2? Wait 5^3 *2*5 would be 5^4*2, yes. So 1250=2*5^4.\n\n4356= 4*1089=4*33\u00b2=4*(3*11)^2=2\u00b2*3\u00b2*11\u00b2.\n\nDenominator:\n\n11 *950625 =11*(975)^2 =11*(25*39)^2=11*(25)^2*(3*13)^2=11*5^4*3\u00b2*13\u00b2.\n\nTherefore,\n\nNumerator: 2*5^4 *2\u00b2*3\u00b2*11\u00b2 =2^(3)*5^4*3\u00b2*11\u00b2\n\nDenominator: 11*5^4*3\u00b2*13\u00b2*11 = 11\u00b2*5^4*3\u00b2*13\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, denominator is 11*(975)^2 =11*(25*39)^2=11*(25)^2*(3*13)^2=11*(5^4)*(3\u00b2)*(13\u00b2). So denominator is 11*5^4*3\u00b2*13\u00b2.\n\nThus,\n\nt= [2^3 *5^4 *3\u00b2 *11\u00b2 ] / [11*5^4 *3\u00b2 *13\u00b2 *11 ] ?\n\nWait, wait:\n\nWait numerator: 2^3*5^4*3\u00b2*11\u00b2,\n\ndenominator: 11*5^4*3\u00b2*13\u00b2*11? Wait, no, denominator is 11*(5^4 *3\u00b2 *13\u00b2).\n\nWait, the denominator is 11*(5^4 *3\u00b2 *13\u00b2). So:\n\nt= [2^3 *5^4 *3\u00b2 *11\u00b2 ] / [11*(5^4 *3\u00b2 *13\u00b2) ]\n\nCancel terms:\n\n5^4 cancels, 3\u00b2 cancels, 11\u00b2 cancels with 11 in denominator leaving 11:\n\nSo,\n\nt= (2^3 *11 ) / (13\u00b2 )\n\n= (8 *11)/169 = 88/169.\n\nTherefore, t=88/169.\n\nTherefore, the parameter t for point P is 88/169. Since t=0 is point A, and t=1 is point D, this t is between 0 and1, so P is between A and D. Therefore, AP is the distance from A to P, which is t=88/169 of the way from A to D? Wait, no. Wait in the parametrization, t is from A (t=0) to D (t=1). So the length from A to P is the length from A (t=0) to P (t=88/169). Since the total length from A to D is DA =325/22, then AP = t * DA?\n\nWait, no, the parameter t is scaling the vector from A to D. So the distance AP is |t| * DA, but since t is positive (88/169 <1), then AP = t * DA.\n\nWait, but in parametrization:\n\nThe coordinates of P are:\n\nx(t) =26/3 - (25/6)t,\n\ny(t) = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t.\n\nThe distance from A (at t=0) to P (at t=88/169):\n\n\u0394x= - (25/6)*(88/169),\n\n\u0394y= - (125\u221a14/33)*(88/169).\n\nThus,\n\nAP squared is [ (25/6 *88/169 ) ]\u00b2 + [ (125\u221a14/33 *88/169 ) ]\u00b2.\n\nFactor out (88/169)^2:\n\nAP\u00b2= (88/169)^2 [ (25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14/33)^2 ]\n\nBut notice that the expression inside the brackets is exactly DA squared, since DA squared is (25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14/33)^2 = (from previous computation) 950625 /4356 = (325/22)^2.\n\nTherefore,\n\nAP squared = (88/169)^2 * (325/22)^2\n\nTake square roots:\n\nAP = (88/169)*(325/22)= simplify:\n\n88 and 22: 88/22=4,\n\n325 and 169: 169=13\u00b2, 325=25*13,\n\nSo,\n\nAP= (4)*(25*13)/169 = (100*13)/169 = 1300/169 = 100/13. (since 1300 divided by13 is 100, and 169 is13\u00b2, so 1300/169=100/13).\n\nTherefore, AP=100/13, so m=100, n=13, which are coprime. So m +n= 113.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 113.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{113}\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the length of \\(AP\\) in triangle \\(ABC\\) inscribed in circle \\(\\omega\\), where the tangents to \\(\\omega\\) at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) intersect at point \\(D\\), and line \\(AD\\) intersects \\(\\omega\\) again at \\(P\\). The given side lengths are \\(AB = 5\\), \\(BC = 9\\), and \\(AC = 10\\).\n\n1. **Circumradius Calculation**:\n   - Using Heron's formula, the area of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is calculated as \\(6\\sqrt{14}\\).\n   - The circumradius \\(R\\) of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is found using the formula \\(R = \\frac{abc}{4 \\times \\text{area}}\\), resulting in \\(R = \\frac{75\\sqrt{14}}{56}\\).\n\n2. **Coordinates of Points**:\n   - Placing \\(C\\) at \\((0, 0)\\), \\(B\\) at \\((9, 0)\\), and solving for \\(A\\) using distance formulas, we find \\(A\\) at \\(\\left(\\frac{26}{3}, \\frac{4\\sqrt{14}}{3}\\right)\\).\n\n3. **Equations of Tangents**:\n   - The tangent at \\(B\\) has the equation \\(y = \\frac{6\\sqrt{14}}{11}(x - 9)\\).\n   - The tangent at \\(C\\) has the equation \\(y = -\\frac{6\\sqrt{14}}{11}x\\).\n\n4. **Intersection Point \\(D\\)**:\n   - Solving the equations of the tangents, we find \\(D\\) at \\(\\left(\\frac{9}{2}, -\\frac{27\\sqrt{14}}{11}\\right)\\).\n\n5. **Power of a Point**:\n   - Using the power of point \\(D\\), we have \\(DA \\cdot DP = DB^2\\).\n   - Calculating distances \\(DA = \\frac{325}{22}\\) and \\(DB = \\frac{225}{22}\\), we solve for \\(DP\\) and find \\(AP\\) using the relation \\(AP = DP - DA\\).\n\n6. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Solving the quadratic equation derived from parametrizing line \\(AD\\) and substituting into the circle's equation, we find \\(AP = \\frac{100}{13}\\).\n\nThus, \\(AP = \\frac{100}{13}\\), where \\(m = 100\\) and \\(n = 13\\). Therefore, \\(m + n = 113\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{113}\n\\]",
