      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nWe have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all line segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. We need to find a unique point C on segment AB (other than A and B) that isn't part of any segment from F except maybe AB itself. Then, we have to compute OC squared, which will be a fraction p/q, and find p + q where p and q are coprime.\n\nHmm. Let me visualize this. The points O, A, and B form a triangle in the first quadrant. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), connecting these should form a right triangle? Wait, actually, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis, so triangle OAB is a right triangle with legs OA = 1/2 and OB = sqrt(3)/2. The hypotenuse AB would then be the segment between A and B.\n\nNow, the family F consists of all segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. Each such segment is in the first quadrant, so P has coordinates (p, 0) and Q has coordinates (0, q) with p, q \u2265 0, and the distance between them is 1. The distance formula gives sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. Therefore, all such segments PQ correspond to points (p,0) and (0,q) lying on the unit circle in their respective axes. Wait, actually, p and q can't both be greater than 1, but since they are in the first quadrant and the segment is of unit length, their coordinates must satisfy that equation.\n\nThe key part is that there is a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that is not on any segment from F except AB itself. So, C is on AB, and if you take any segment from F that passes through C, it must be the segment AB itself. In other words, C is only on AB and no other segments in F. So we need to find such a point C, then compute OC squared.\n\nFirst, let me parametrize segment AB. Let me find the parametric equations for AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the vector from A to B is (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So a point C on AB can be written as A + t*(vector AB) where t is between 0 and 1. Alternatively, since AB is a straight line, we can write parametric equations.\n\nAlternatively, since O, A, B form a triangle, perhaps it's better to parametrize AB. Let me do that.\n\nThe coordinates of AB can be parametrized as follows:\n\nStarting at A (1/2, 0), moving towards B (0, sqrt(3)/2). So the parametric equations can be written as:\n\nx = 1/2 - (1/2)*t,\n\ny = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)*t,\n\nwhere t ranges from 0 to 1. So when t=0, we are at A, and t=1, we are at B.\n\nAlternatively, using a parameter s from 0 to 1, so that when s=0 it's at A and s=1 it's at B, so:\n\nx = (1/2)(1 - s),\n\ny = (sqrt(3)/2)s,\n\nwhere s \u2208 [0,1].\n\nEither way, we can represent point C as ( (1/2)(1 - s), (sqrt(3)/2)s ) for some s between 0 and 1, excluding the endpoints (since it's distinct from A and B).\n\nNow, we need to find the point C on AB such that C is not on any segment PQ from F except AB. That is, if there exists a segment PQ in F (other than AB) that contains point C, then C is excluded. So we need the point C where the only segment in F passing through C is AB itself. So such a point must lie only on AB and no other PQ in F.\n\nTherefore, for point C, if we suppose that C is on some PQ in F (other than AB), then the coordinates of C must satisfy the equation of PQ, but we need to find the point where this is impossible except for AB.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point C is such that any line through C with a slope of -1 (since PQ segments from F have slope -q/p, but since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, maybe there's a relation) but perhaps another approach is better.\n\nWait, let's think of the set of all segments PQ in F. Each such segment connects (p,0) to (0,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. The point C lies on AB. We need that the only such PQ that contains C is AB itself.\n\nTherefore, for point C, if we suppose that there exists another PQ in F passing through C, then that would mean that C is on both AB and some other PQ. So, to have a unique such point C where this is not possible (except for AB), so C is not on any other PQ except AB. So we need to find the point on AB where if you try to have another PQ pass through it, it can't.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is the point where the tangent to some envelope of these segments PQ touches AB? Maybe the envelope of all these segments PQ forms a curve, and the point C is where this envelope is tangent to AB?\n\nHmm, that might be a way to approach it. The envelope of the family of lines PQ. Since each PQ is a line segment between (p,0) and (0,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. The envelope of these lines would be a curve such that each line is tangent to the curve. The point C would be where the envelope is tangent to AB, so that AB is tangent to the envelope at C, hence only touching at that point, so that C is the only point on AB lying on the envelope? Wait, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the lines PQ and find where they intersect AB, then find a point where this intersection only occurs for AB itself.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that any segment PQ in F is the line segment between (p,0) and (0,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. Let me write the equation of such a line.\n\nThe line PQ goes from (p,0) to (0,q). The equation of this line can be written as x/p + y/q =1. Since the segment is between those points, so the line equation is x/p + y/q =1, with p and q positive and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nSo for any such line, the equation is x/p + y/q =1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe need to find a point C on AB such that the only line of the form x/p + y/q =1 (with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1) passing through C is the line AB itself.\n\nSo first, let's find the equation of AB. Since A is (1/2,0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). Therefore, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAlternatively, written in standard form: sqrt(3)x + y = sqrt(3)/2. Multiply both sides by 2: 2sqrt(3)x + 2y = sqrt(3). Hmm, maybe not necessary yet.\n\nNow, the point C is on AB, so its coordinates satisfy y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Let me denote C as (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So, coordinates of C can be written as (x, sqrt(3)( (1/2) - x )).\n\nWe need that this point C lies on some line x/p + y/q =1 (with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1) only if that line is AB itself. So, to ensure that the only solution (p, q) to the equations:\n\n1. x/p + y/q =1,\n\n2. p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nand the line x/p + y/q =1 is the same as AB.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for point C, the system of equations given by substituting C into x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 has only one solution (p,q) corresponding to the line AB. Since AB is one such line, so if the system has only that solution, then C is our desired point.\n\nTherefore, substituting the coordinates of C into the equation x/p + y/q =1 gives an equation in p and q, along with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. If this system has only one solution (p,q) which corresponds to the line AB, then that's the point C.\n\nTherefore, let me set up the equations.\n\nLet me denote coordinates of C as (x, y), lying on AB, so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Let me plug into the line equation:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\nand we also have p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe need that for this x and y, the only solution (p, q) is the one corresponding to the line AB.\n\nFirst, let me find the p and q for line AB. Let's see, the line AB goes from point A (1/2, 0) to B (0, sqrt(3)/2). Therefore, in the line equation x/p + y/q =1, the p here would be the x-intercept, which is 1/2, and the q would be the y-intercept, which is sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, for line AB, p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2. Let me confirm:\n\nx/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3)/2) = 2x + (2/sqrt(3)) y =1. Wait, but the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Let's see if these are the same.\n\nStarting with 2x + (2/sqrt(3)) y =1,\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(3)/2: sqrt(3)x + y = sqrt(3)/2,\n\nWhich rearranged is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, which matches. So yes, the intercepts are p=1/2 and q= sqrt(3)/2, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 =1, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, for line AB, p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nTherefore, to have the only solution (p, q) be (1/2, sqrt(3)/2), the system:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nmust have only that solution when substituting x and y as coordinates on AB.\n\nTherefore, substituting y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into the first equation:\n\nx/p + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] / q =1.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\nx/p + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/q =1.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nx/p - (sqrt(3)x)/q + (sqrt(3)/2)/q =1.\n\nLet me group the terms with x:\n\nx(1/p - sqrt(3)/q) + (sqrt(3))/(2q) =1.\n\nHmm. So this is an equation in variables p and q, with the constraints p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. We need that for our point C (x,y), this equation combined with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 has only one solution (p,q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nTherefore, for the system to have a unique solution, the equations must be such that substituting one into the other gives a quadratic equation with a repeated root. That is, when we substitute p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 into the first equation, we can write everything in terms of one variable and get a quadratic equation. For it to have only one solution, the discriminant must be zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps parametrize p and q using an angle. Since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, we can write p = cos\u03b8 and q = sin\u03b8, but since p and q are intercepts on the axes, and since the segments are in the first quadrant, p and q are positive, so \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2.\n\nTherefore, let me set p = cos\u03b8, q = sin\u03b8, since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line becomes x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, substituting y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into this equation:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me combine terms:\n\nx [1/cos\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/sin\u03b8] + (sqrt(3)/2)/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nx * [ (sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8) / (sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8) ) ] + (sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8)) =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to multiply through by sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 to eliminate denominators:\n\nx ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) + (sqrt(3)/2) cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nHmm, maybe that's a way to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, let me rearrange the equation:\n\nx [1/cos\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/sin\u03b8] =1 - (sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8)).\n\nTherefore,\n\nx = [1 - (sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8))] / [1/cos\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/sin\u03b8].\n\nThis expression gives x in terms of \u03b8. Since x must be a fixed value (the x-coordinate of point C), this equation must hold for only one \u03b8, which is the \u03b8 corresponding to the line AB.\n\nFor line AB, which corresponds to p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2, so cos\u03b8 =1/2, so \u03b8= \u03c0/3 (since cos(\u03c0/3)=1/2, sin(\u03c0/3)=sqrt(3)/2). Therefore, \u03b8=60 degrees.\n\nTherefore, to have the above equation hold only when \u03b8=\u03c0/3, the equation must have a unique solution \u03b8=\u03c0/3 for the given x.\n\nTherefore, the equation above, when considered as an equation in \u03b8, must have a double root at \u03b8=\u03c0/3. That is, when we set up the equation, the solutions for \u03b8 would be \u03b8=\u03c0/3 (double root).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation can be written as a function of \u03b8, and we can set its derivative to zero at that point? Maybe not. Alternatively, since we need uniqueness, the equation must have only one solution, so discriminant zero.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for the point C (x,y), the line equations through C must have only the line AB. Therefore, the system of equations (the line equation and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1) must have only one solution. Therefore, substituting y into the line equation gives an equation relating p and q. Let me try substituting variables.\n\nLet me denote variables p and q, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, and the point C (x,y) lying on the line x/p + y/q =1. So substituting y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into the line equation gives:\n\nx/p + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/q =1.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nx/p - (sqrt(3)x)/q + (sqrt(3)/2)/q =1.\n\nLet me group terms with x:\n\nx(1/p - sqrt(3)/q) =1 - (sqrt(3))/(2 q).\n\nHmm. Let me denote this as equation (1).\n\nBut since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, perhaps we can write p in terms of q or vice versa and substitute.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider this as a linear equation in variables 1/p and 1/q. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables p and q. Let me set variables as p and q with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nLet me rearrange equation (1):\n\nx(1/p - sqrt(3)/q) =1 - (sqrt(3))/(2 q).\n\nLet me multiply both sides by p q to eliminate denominators:\n\nx ( q - sqrt(3) p ) = p q - (sqrt(3)/2) p.\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me write that again:\n\nStarting with equation (1):\n\nx(1/p - sqrt(3)/q) =1 - (sqrt(3))/(2 q).\n\nMultiply both sides by p q:\n\nx(q - sqrt(3) p) = p q - (sqrt(3)/2) p.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nx q - sqrt(3) x p - p q + (sqrt(3)/2) p =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor terms:\n\nGroup terms with p and q:\n\nTerms with p: (-sqrt(3)x - q + sqrt(3)/2 ) p,\n\nterms with q: x q,\n\nand the rest? Wait, maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, let me collect like terms:\n\n- sqrt(3) x p - p q + x q + (sqrt(3)/2)p =0.\n\nHmm, factor terms with p and q:\n\np ( -sqrt(3)x - q + sqrt(3)/2 ) + q x =0.\n\nHmm, maybe rearrange terms:\n\np ( -sqrt(3)x - q + sqrt(3)/2 ) = - q x.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there is a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the problem from another angle. Since the point C must lie on AB and not on any other segment PQ except AB, that means that C is the only intersection point between AB and that particular segment PQ (which is AB). For any other segment PQ in F, if it intersects AB, it must do so at some other point besides C. But for point C, no other PQ passes through it except AB.\n\nTherefore, the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of all the segments PQ in F. The envelope is a curve such that each PQ is tangent to it, and the point of tangency is the only point where PQ touches the envelope. If AB is tangent to this envelope at point C, then C is the only point on AB that lies on the envelope, hence the only point on AB that is on a segment PQ (the tangent one) besides AB itself. Wait, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, the envelope of the family of lines PQ is a curve, and the point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope. Therefore, at point C, AB is tangent to the envelope, so that C is the only point common to AB and the envelope. Thus, C is the desired point.\n\nTherefore, if I can find the envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, then find where AB is tangent to this envelope, that point of tangency is C.\n\nSo let me try to compute the envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nTo find the envelope of a family of curves given by an equation F(x,y,p,q)=0 with some constraint between parameters, we can use the method of differentiating with respect to the parameter and solving the system.\n\nAlternatively, since the lines are given by x/p + y/q =1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, perhaps we can parametrize p and q as p = cos\u03b8, q = sin\u03b8, as before, since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. Then the lines are x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nTherefore, the family of lines is F(x,y,\u03b8) = x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 -1 =0.\n\nThe envelope of this family satisfies the condition that dF/d\u03b8 =0 as well. Therefore, to find the envelope, we can solve the system:\n\nF(x,y,\u03b8) = x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 -1 =0,\n\ndF/d\u03b8 = x (sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y (cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1,\n\n2) x (sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y (cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nWe need to solve these equations for x and y in terms of \u03b8, and then eliminate \u03b8 to get the envelope's equation.\n\nLet me work with equation 2:\n\nx (sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 = y (cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\n=> x / cos\u00b2\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 = y / sin\u00b2\u03b8 * cos\u03b8,\n\n=> x / cos\u00b2\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 = y / sin\u00b2\u03b8 * cos\u03b8,\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8 to eliminate denominators:\n\nx sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8,\n\nThus,\n\nx / y = (cos^3\u03b8)/(sin^3\u03b8) = (cot\u03b8)^3,\n\nTherefore,\n\ncot\u03b8 = (x/y)^{1/3}.\n\nLet me denote cot\u03b8 = t, so t = (x/y)^{1/3}.\n\nThen, sin\u03b8 = 1 / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2),\n\ncos\u03b8 = t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nAlternatively, since cot\u03b8 = t, so cos\u03b8 = t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nsin\u03b8 = 1 / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nHmm, perhaps substituting back into equation 1.\n\nLet me express equation 1 in terms of t.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1,\n\nSubstituting cos\u03b8 = t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nsin\u03b8 = 1 / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nThus,\n\nx / ( t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) ) + y / (1 / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) ) =1,\n\nWhich is,\n\nx * sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)/t + y * sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) =1,\n\nFactor sqrt(1 + t\u00b2):\n\nsqrt(1 + t\u00b2) [x/t + y] =1,\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(1 + t\u00b2) = 1 / [x/t + y].\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n1 + t\u00b2 = 1 / (x/t + y)^2,\n\nBut t = (x/y)^{1/3}, so let me write t^3 = x / y,\n\nTherefore, t^3 y =x,\n\nHence, x = y t^3,\n\nLet me substitute x = y t^3 into the equation above:\n\n1 + t\u00b2 = 1 / ( (y t^3)/t + y )^2 = 1 / ( y t^2 + y )^2 = 1 / [ y^2 (t^2 +1) ) ]\n\nThus,\n\n1 + t\u00b2 = 1 / [ y^2 (t\u00b2 +1) ) ]\n\nMultiply both sides by y\u00b2 (t\u00b2 +1):\n\ny\u00b2 (1 + t\u00b2)^2 =1,\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = 1 / sqrt( (1 + t\u00b2)^2 )\n\nWait, but since we squared earlier, maybe absolute value? Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, sqrt( (1 + t\u00b2)^2 ) is (1 + t\u00b2). So,\n\ny\u00b2 (1 + t\u00b2)^2 =1,\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = 1 / [ (1 + t\u00b2) ]\n\nBut since y is positive (since in the first quadrant), we can take the positive root.\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = 1 / (1 + t\u00b2).\n\nBut t = (x/y)^{1/3}, so let me write t^3 = x/y,\n\nThus, t = (x/y)^{1/3},\n\nTherefore, substitute t into the expression for y:\n\ny =1/(1 + t\u00b2) =1/[1 + (x/y)^{2/3} ].\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me see if I can express this in terms of x and y.\n\nLet me denote t^3 = x/y,\n\nSo t = (x/y)^{1/3},\n\nThus, t\u00b2 = (x/y)^{2/3},\n\nSo,\n\ny =1/[1 + (x/y)^{2/3} ]\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\ny [1 + (x/y)^{2/3} ] =1,\n\nExpand:\n\ny + x^{2/3} y^{1 - 2/3} =1,\n\nSimplify exponents:\n\ny + x^{2/3} y^{1/3} =1,\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Let me try to write in terms of t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of t.\n\nWe have:\n\nFrom t^3 = x/y,\n\n=> x = y t^3,\n\nand from y =1/(1 + t^2),\n\nThus,\n\nx = [1/(1 + t^2)] * t^3,\n\nTherefore,\n\nx = t^3 / (1 + t^2),\n\nand y =1/(1 + t^2).\n\nTherefore, we can write the envelope parametrically as:\n\nx = t^3 / (1 + t^2),\n\ny =1/(1 + t^2),\n\nwhere t is a parameter (t>0, since in first quadrant).\n\nAlternatively, to eliminate t, note that y =1/(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nso t\u00b2 = (1/y) -1,\n\nand x = t^3/(1 + t\u00b2) = t^3 y,\n\nsince 1 + t\u00b2 =1/y,\n\nso t^3 y = x,\n\nbut t^2 = (1/y -1),\n\nso t = sqrt( (1/y -1) ),\n\nThus,\n\nx = [ (1/y -1)^{3/2} ] * y,\n\nHmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me set u = t\u00b2,\n\nthen,\n\nx = t^3/(1 + t\u00b2) = t * t\u00b2/(1 + t\u00b2) = t u/(1 + u),\n\ny =1/(1 + u),\n\nand u = t\u00b2,\n\nso t = sqrt(u),\n\nThus,\n\nx = sqrt(u) * u / (1 + u) = u^{3/2}/(1 + u),\n\nBut perhaps not helpful. Alternatively, let me consider that:\n\nLet me write x in terms of y:\n\nFrom y =1/(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nt\u00b2 = (1 - y)/y,\n\nso t = sqrt( (1 - y)/y ),\n\nthen,\n\nx = t^3 y,\n\nWait, since x = t^3/(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nand 1 + t\u00b2 =1/y,\n\nso x = t^3 y,\n\nBut t^3 = t * t\u00b2 = t*( (1 - y)/y )\n\nHmm, but t = sqrt( (1 - y)/y ),\n\nThus,\n\nx = sqrt( (1 - y)/y ) * ( (1 - y)/y ) * y,\n\nWait, this might not be leading anywhere. Alternatively, maybe parametrizing with t is okay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another substitution.\n\nAlternatively, since the envelope is given parametrically as:\n\nx = t^3/(1 + t\u00b2),\n\ny =1/(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nLet me denote s = t + 1/t or something? Not sure. Alternatively, let me see if this parametric equation can be converted into a Cartesian equation.\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me denote t as a parameter. Let me consider:\n\nLet me write x = t^3/(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nand y =1/(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nLet me note that x = t * (t\u00b2)/(1 + t\u00b2) = t*(1 - y),\n\nsince y =1/(1 + t\u00b2) => 1 - y = t\u00b2/(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nTherefore,\n\nx = t*(1 - y).\n\nTherefore, t = x/(1 - y).\n\nBut also, from y =1/(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nso t\u00b2 = (1 - y)/y,\n\nTherefore, t = sqrt( (1 - y)/y ).\n\nBut from above, t = x/(1 - y),\n\nso:\n\nx/(1 - y) = sqrt( (1 - y)/y ),\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nx\u00b2/(1 - y)^2 = (1 - y)/y,\n\nMultiply both sides by y(1 - y)^2:\n\nx\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3,\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3,\n\nThis is the Cartesian equation of the envelope.\n\nSo the envelope is the curve x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3.\n\nTherefore, the envelope of all those lines PQ is the curve x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3.\n\nTherefore, the point C must be the point where AB is tangent to this envelope. Because if AB is tangent to the envelope at point C, then C is the only point on AB that lies on the envelope. Since the envelope is the set of all points that lie on exactly one PQ segment (the tangent one), except for the points where multiple segments intersect, but tangency would mean only one. Wait, actually, the envelope is precisely the set of points where each point is on exactly one PQ segment (the tangent one). So, any point on the envelope lies on exactly one PQ, except perhaps at cusps or something. Therefore, the point C must be the intersection point of AB and the envelope, and since AB is tangent to the envelope at C, that point is unique (other than intersections at A or B if they are on the envelope). But since A is (1/2,0). Let's check if A is on the envelope:\n\nPlug x=1/2, y=0 into x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3,\n\nLeft side: (1/2)^2 *0 =0,\n\nRight side: (1 -0)^3 =1,\n\nSo 0 \u22601, so A is not on the envelope. Similarly, B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Plugging into the equation:\n\nLeft side: 0\u00b2*(sqrt(3)/2)=0,\n\nRight side: (1 - sqrt(3)/2)^3 \u2248 (1 -0.866)^3 \u2248 (0.134)^3 \u22480.0024, not zero. So B isn't on the envelope either. Thus, the only intersection between AB and the envelope is the point C where they are tangent.\n\nTherefore, to find point C, we need to find the point where AB is tangent to the envelope curve x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3.\n\nSo, let me parametrize AB as before. Let me write AB's equation as y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe can substitute this into the envelope equation x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3 and find the point(s) of intersection, then ensure that it's a double root (i.e., tangency), so the system has a double solution.\n\nLet me substitute y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3.\n\nFirst, compute 1 - y =1 - (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) =1 + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2 = (1 - sqrt(3)/2) + sqrt(3)x.\n\nLet me compute 1 - sqrt(3)/2 \u22481 -0.866\u22480.134, but let's keep it exact.\n\nTherefore, substituting into the equation:\n\nx\u00b2 [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] = [ (1 - sqrt(3)/2) + sqrt(3)x ]^3.\n\nThis looks complicated, but perhaps expanding both sides and then setting the equation to have a double root.\n\nAlternatively, since we need the intersection to be a point of tangency, the system has a double root, so the equation obtained after substitution will have a discriminant zero or something. Alternatively, set the derivative of the envelope curve equal to the slope of AB at the point of contact.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that at the point of contact C, the tangent to the envelope must coincide with AB's slope. The slope of AB is -sqrt(3), so the derivative of the envelope at point C must be -sqrt(3).\n\nLet me compute the derivative of the envelope curve x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3.\n\nLet me differentiate both sides with respect to x.\n\nLeft side: 2x y + x\u00b2 dy/dx,\n\nRight side: 3(1 - y)^2 (-dy/dx).\n\nTherefore,\n\n2x y + x\u00b2 dy/dx = -3(1 - y)^2 dy/dx,\n\nBring terms with dy/dx to one side:\n\nx\u00b2 dy/dx + 3(1 - y)^2 dy/dx = -2x y,\n\nFactor dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx [x\u00b2 + 3(1 - y)^2 ] = -2x y,\n\nThus,\n\ndy/dx = -2x y / [x\u00b2 + 3(1 - y)^2 ].\n\nAt the point of tangency C, this derivative must equal the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3). Therefore,\n\n-2x y / [x\u00b2 + 3(1 - y)^2 ] = -sqrt(3),\n\nCancel out the negatives,\n\n2x y / [x\u00b2 + 3(1 - y)^2 ] = sqrt(3),\n\nSo,\n\n2x y = sqrt(3) [x\u00b2 + 3(1 - y)^2 ].\n\nAdditionally, the point (x,y) lies on AB, so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nand on the envelope, so x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3.\n\nTherefore, we have three equations:\n\n1) y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\n2) x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3,\n\n3) 2x y = sqrt(3)(x\u00b2 + 3(1 - y)^2).\n\nWe can use equations 1 and 2 to find x and y, then check equation 3. Alternatively, since equation 3 comes from the derivative condition, it should be redundant if we already have 1 and 2, but perhaps better to solve equations 1 and 2 first.\n\nLet me substitute equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nLet me denote equation 2 as:\n\nx\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3,\n\nand equation 1 gives y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me substitute y into equation 2:\n\nx\u00b2 [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] = [1 - (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 )]^3.\n\nFirst compute the right-hand side (RHS):\n\n1 - (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) =1 + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2 = (1 - sqrt(3)/2) + sqrt(3)x,\n\nLet me denote this as (sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2 )),\n\nTherefore, RHS = [sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2 )]^3.\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS):\n\nx\u00b2 [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] = sqrt(3)x\u00b2 [ -x + 1/2 ].\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3)x\u00b2 ( -x + 1/2 ) = [sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2 )]^3.\n\nThis equation looks quite complex. Maybe it's better to let me set t = sqrt(3)x to simplify.\n\nLet me set t = sqrt(3)x,\n\nthen x = t / sqrt(3),\n\nand y = -sqrt(3)*(t / sqrt(3)) + sqrt(3)/2 = -t + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo y = -t + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nand substituting into LHS and RHS:\n\nLHS:\n\nsqrt(3)*( (t / sqrt(3))\u00b2 ) * ( - (t / sqrt(3)) + 1/2 )\n\nFirst compute (t / sqrt(3))\u00b2 = t\u00b2 / 3,\n\nso,\n\nsqrt(3) * (t\u00b2 /3 ) * [ - t/sqrt(3) + 1/2 ]\n\n= (sqrt(3) * t\u00b2 / 3 ) * [ - t / sqrt(3) + 1/2 ]\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst term inside the bracket: -t / sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(3) * t\u00b2 /3 * (-t / sqrt(3)) = (sqrt(3) * -t / sqrt(3)) * t\u00b2 /3 = (-t) * t\u00b2 /3 = - t\u00b3 /3,\n\nSecond term inside the bracket: 1/2:\n\nsqrt(3)* t\u00b2 /3 * 1/2 = (sqrt(3)/6) t\u00b2,\n\nThus, LHS total is:\n\n- t\u00b3 /3 + (sqrt(3)/6) t\u00b2.\n\nNow the RHS:\n\n[ sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) ]^3,\n\nBut sqrt(3)x = t,\n\nand 1 - sqrt(3)/2 remains,\n\nso,\n\n[ t + (1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) ]^3,\n\nLet me write that as [ t + c ]^3 where c =1 - sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 1 -0.866\u22480.134.\n\nExpanding [t + c]^3:\n\n= t^3 + 3t\u00b2 c + 3t c\u00b2 + c\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, RHS = t^3 + 3c t\u00b2 + 3c\u00b2 t + c\u00b3.\n\nPutting it all together, equation becomes:\n\nLHS = RHS,\n\nso,\n\n- (t\u00b3)/3 + (sqrt(3)/6) t\u00b2 = t^3 + 3c t\u00b2 + 3c\u00b2 t + c\u00b3,\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n- (t\u00b3)/3 + (sqrt(3)/6) t\u00b2 - t^3 - 3c t\u00b2 - 3c\u00b2 t - c\u00b3 =0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nFor t\u00b3: (-1/3 -1) t\u00b3 = -4/3 t\u00b3,\n\nFor t\u00b2: (sqrt(3)/6 -3c ) t\u00b2,\n\nFor t: -3c\u00b2 t,\n\nConstants: -c\u00b3,\n\nThus,\n\n-4/3 t\u00b3 + (sqrt(3)/6 - 3c ) t\u00b2 - 3c\u00b2 t - c\u00b3 =0,\n\nThis is a cubic equation in t. To solve this, perhaps substitute c =1 - sqrt(3)/2,\n\nLet me compute the coefficients step by step.\n\nFirst, let me compute c =1 - sqrt(3)/2 \u22481 -0.866=0.134.\n\nCompute sqrt(3)/6 - 3c:\n\nsqrt(3)/6 \u22480.2887,\n\n3c \u22483*(0.134)=0.402,\n\nThus sqrt(3)/6 -3c \u22480.2887 -0.402\u2248-0.113,\n\nBut let's compute exactly:\n\nsqrt(3)/6 - 3(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\n= sqrt(3)/6 -3 + (3 sqrt(3))/2\n\n= sqrt(3)/6 + (9 sqrt(3))/6 -3\n\n= (10 sqrt(3)/6 ) -3\n\n= (5 sqrt(3)/3 ) -3,\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me write all terms symbolically.\n\nLet me note c =1 - (sqrt(3)/2),\n\nthen,\n\nsqrt(3)/6 - 3c = sqrt(3)/6 - 3*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\n= sqrt(3)/6 -3 + (3 sqrt(3))/2\n\n= sqrt(3)/6 + (9 sqrt(3))/6 -3\n\n= (10 sqrt(3)/6 ) -3\n\n= (5 sqrt(3)/3 ) -3,\n\nSimilarly, 3c\u00b2 =3*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b2,\n\nand c\u00b3 = (1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b3,\n\nThis is getting very messy. Perhaps instead of substituting variables, I can try to find a smart substitution or notice a solution.\n\nAlternatively, since the point C is on AB and on the envelope, and the cubic equation must have a double root (since tangent), so there's a repeated root. Therefore, perhaps if I can factor out (t - t0)^2 from the cubic, where t0 is the root corresponding to point C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way. Let me consider that the system of equations (equations 1 and 2) might have a double solution, so when we substitute y from equation1 into equation2, the resulting equation in x has a double root, so discriminant zero.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFrom equation1: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nSubstitute into equation2: x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3,\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] = [1 - (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)]^3,\n\nLet me denote the left side as L and right side as R.\n\nLet me compute R first:\n\n1 - (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) =1 + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2).\n\nTherefore,\n\nR = [sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2)]^3,\n\nExpand R:\n\nLet me let a = sqrt(3)x,\n\nb =1 - sqrt(3)/2,\n\nthen R = (a + b)^3 = a\u00b3 + 3a\u00b2b + 3ab\u00b2 + b\u00b3.\n\nLHS:\n\nL = x\u00b2*(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) = sqrt(3)x\u00b2*(-x + 1/2).\n\nLet me write everything in terms of a = sqrt(3)x,\n\nthen x = a / sqrt(3),\n\nso,\n\nL = sqrt(3)*( (a / sqrt(3))\u00b2 )*(- (a / sqrt(3)) + 1/2 )\n\n= sqrt(3)*( a\u00b2 / 3 )*( -a/sqrt(3) + 1/2 )\n\n= ( sqrt(3) * a\u00b2 / 3 )*( -a/sqrt(3) + 1/2 )\n\n= (a\u00b2 / sqrt(3))*( -a + sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nsqrt(3) * (a\u00b2 / 3) = (sqrt(3)/3)a\u00b2,\n\nthen multiply by (-a/sqrt(3) + 1/2):\n\nFirst term: (sqrt(3)/3 a\u00b2)( -a/sqrt(3) ) = (sqrt(3)/3)(-a/sqrt(3)) a\u00b2 = (-a^3)/3,\n\nSecond term: (sqrt(3)/3 a\u00b2)(1/2 ) = (sqrt(3)/6) a\u00b2,\n\nThus, L = -a\u00b3/3 + (sqrt(3)/6)a\u00b2,\n\nBut R = (a + b)^3 = a\u00b3 + 3a\u00b2b + 3ab\u00b2 + b\u00b3,\n\nSet L = R,\n\nSo,\n\n- a\u00b3/3 + (sqrt(3)/6)a\u00b2 = a\u00b3 + 3a\u00b2b + 3ab\u00b2 + b\u00b3,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n- a\u00b3/3 - a\u00b3 + (sqrt(3)/6 a\u00b2 - 3a\u00b2b) - 3ab\u00b2 - b\u00b3 =0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nFor a\u00b3: (-1/3 -1)a\u00b3 = -4/3 a\u00b3,\n\nFor a\u00b2 terms: [ sqrt(3)/6 - 3b ] a\u00b2,\n\nFor a terms: -3 b\u00b2 a,\n\nConstants: -b\u00b3,\n\nThus,\n\n-4/3 a\u00b3 + ( sqrt(3)/6 - 3b )a\u00b2 - 3b\u00b2 a - b\u00b3 =0,\n\nBut b is a constant (1 - sqrt(3)/2),\n\nLet me plug in b =1 - sqrt(3)/2,\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n- (4/3)a\u00b3 + [ sqrt(3)/6 - 3(1 - sqrt(3)/2) ]a\u00b2 - 3(1 - sqrt(3)/2)^2 a - (1 - sqrt(3)/2)^3 =0.\n\nThis is a cubic equation in a. To have a double root, the cubic must have a repeated root. The condition for a cubic equation ax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d =0 to have a double root is that its discriminant is zero, but discriminant computation is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that the point C corresponds to a double root, so let me assume that a is a double root, so the cubic can be written as (a - k)^2 (ma + n) =0,\n\nBut this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can guess a value for a (or x) that satisfies both equations and the derivative condition.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the point C is somewhere between A and B. Let me try plugging in some values.\n\nWait, let me think about the parametrization of the envelope curve. The envelope is x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3. Let me see if there is a point along AB that satisfies this.\n\nLet me parameterize AB with a parameter s from 0 to1, so:\n\nx = (1/2)(1 - s),\n\ny = (sqrt(3)/2)s,\n\nas I did earlier.\n\nThen, substituting into the envelope equation:\n\nx\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3,\n\nSo,\n\n[ (1/2 (1 - s))\u00b2 ] * (sqrt(3)/2 s ) = [1 - (sqrt(3)/2 s )]^3,\n\nCompute left side:\n\n( (1 - s)^2 /4 ) * ( sqrt(3)/2 s ) = ( sqrt(3)/8 ) s (1 - s)^2,\n\nRight side:\n\n[1 - (sqrt(3)/2 s )]^3,\n\nSet them equal:\n\nsqrt(3)/8 * s (1 - s)^2 = [1 - (sqrt(3)/2 s )]^3,\n\nThis is an equation in s. We need to find s such that this holds, and also that the derivative condition is satisfied (tangency). Maybe solving this equation would give us the value of s corresponding to point C.\n\nThis still looks complicated, but perhaps we can make an intelligent substitution.\n\nLet me denote t = sqrt(3)/2 s,\n\nthen s = (2/sqrt(3)) t,\n\nand note that when s=0, t=0; s=1, t= sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866.\n\nThen, the left side becomes:\n\nsqrt(3)/8 * (2/sqrt(3) t) * (1 - (2/sqrt(3) t ))^2,\n\n= sqrt(3)/8 * (2/sqrt(3) t) * [1 - (2/sqrt(3) t)]^2,\n\n= (2/8) t [1 - (2/sqrt(3) t)]^2,\n\n= (1/4) t [1 - (2/sqrt(3) t)]^2,\n\nThe right side becomes:\n\n[1 - t]^3,\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\n(1/4) t [1 - (2/sqrt(3) t)]^2 = (1 - t)^3,\n\nHmm, still not obvious, but perhaps multiplying both sides by 4:\n\nt [1 - (2/sqrt(3) t)]^2 =4(1 - t)^3,\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\nFirst compute [1 - (2/sqrt(3) t)]^2 =1 - (4/sqrt(3)) t + (4/3) t\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nLeft side: t [1 - (4/sqrt(3)) t + (4/3) t\u00b2 ] = t - (4/sqrt(3)) t\u00b2 + (4/3) t^3,\n\nRight side:4(1 -3t +3t\u00b2 -t^3 )=4 -12 t +12 t\u00b2 -4 t^3,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nt - (4/sqrt(3)) t\u00b2 + (4/3) t^3 -4 +12 t -12 t\u00b2 +4 t^3 =0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nt terms: t +12t =13t,\n\nt\u00b2 terms: -4/sqrt(3) t\u00b2 -12 t\u00b2 = - [4/sqrt(3) +12 ] t\u00b2,\n\nt^3 terms: (4/3 +4 ) t^3 = (16/3) t^3,\n\nConstants: -4,\n\nSo,\n\n13t - [4/sqrt(3) +12] t\u00b2 + (16/3) t^3 -4 =0,\n\nThis is still a cubic equation.

So we can parametrize the envelope with parameter t and find the value of t where the point (x,y) lies on AB and the tangent to the envelope at that point has slope -sqrt(3).\n\nFrom earlier, we had the derivative of the envelope is dy/dx = -2xy/[x\u00b2 + 3(1 - y)^2].\n\nSetting this equal to -sqrt(3):\n\n-2xy/[x\u00b2 + 3(1 - y)^2] = -sqrt(3),\n\n=> 2xy = sqrt(3)(x\u00b2 + 3(1 - y)^2).\n\nAdditionally, the point (x,y) lies on AB: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAnd on the envelope: x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3.\n\nLet me try substituting y from AB into the derivative condition equation.\n\nLet me write:\n\n2x y = sqrt(3)(x\u00b2 + 3(1 - y)^2).\n\nReplace y with -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nso,\n\n2x*(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) = sqrt(3)[x\u00b2 +3(1 - (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ))^2 ]\n\nLeft side:\n\n2x*(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) = -2 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + sqrt(3) x.\n\nRight side:\n\nsqrt(3)[x\u00b2 +3(1 + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b2 ]\n\nLet me compute the term inside the brackets:\n\nLet me denote inside the bracket as:\n\nx\u00b2 +3[1 + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2]^2,\n\nFirst compute the expression inside the square:\n\n1 + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2),\n\nLet me denote that as sqrt(3)x + c, where c =1 - sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThus,\n\n[ sqrt(3)x + c ]^2 = 3x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3)c x +c\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nthe term becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 +3*(3x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3)c x +c\u00b2 ) =x\u00b2 +9x\u00b2 +6 sqrt(3)c x +3c\u00b2=10x\u00b2 +6 sqrt(3)c x +3c\u00b2,\n\nTherefore, the right side is sqrt(3)*(10x\u00b2 +6 sqrt(3)c x +3c\u00b2).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nLeft side: -2 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + sqrt(3)x,\n\nRight side: sqrt(3)*(10x\u00b2 +6 sqrt(3)c x +3c\u00b2),\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n-2x\u00b2 +x =10x\u00b2 +6 sqrt(3)c x +3c\u00b2,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-2x\u00b2 +x -10x\u00b2 -6 sqrt(3)c x -3c\u00b2 =0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-12x\u00b2 +x(1 -6 sqrt(3)c ) -3c\u00b2 =0,\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in x.\n\nRecall that c =1 - sqrt(3)/2,\n\nso let's compute coefficients:\n\nFirst coefficient: -12,\n\nSecond term: x*(1 -6 sqrt(3)c ) =x*(1 -6 sqrt(3)(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )),\n\nCompute inside:\n\n6 sqrt(3)(1) -6 sqrt(3)*(sqrt(3)/2 )=6 sqrt(3) -6*(3/2)=6 sqrt(3) -9,\n\nThus,\n\n1 - [6 sqrt(3) -9] =1 -6 sqrt(3) +9 =10 -6 sqrt(3),\n\nThird term: -3c\u00b2 = -3*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n-12x\u00b2 + (10 -6 sqrt(3))x -3*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b2 =0,\n\nLet me compute -3*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b2:\n\nFirst compute (1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b2 =1 - sqrt(3) + 3/4 = (1 + 3/4) - sqrt(3) =7/4 - sqrt(3),\n\nWait,\n\nWait, (a - b)^2 =a\u00b2 -2ab +b\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\n(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b2 =1\u00b2 -2*1*(sqrt(3)/2 ) + (sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b2 =1 - sqrt(3) + (3/4),\n\nThus,\n\n1 - sqrt(3) + 3/4 = (1 + 3/4) - sqrt(3) = 7/4 - sqrt(3),\n\nTherefore,\n\n-3*(7/4 - sqrt(3)) = -21/4 +3 sqrt(3),\n\nThus, the equation is:\n\n-12x\u00b2 + (10 -6 sqrt(3))x + (-21/4 +3 sqrt(3)) =0,\n\nMultiply all terms by 4 to eliminate fractions:\n\n-48x\u00b2 +4*(10 -6 sqrt(3))x + (-21 +12 sqrt(3)) =0,\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-48x\u00b2,\n\n4*(10 -6 sqrt(3))x =40x -24 sqrt(3)x,\n\n-21 +12 sqrt(3),\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\n-48x\u00b2 +40x -24 sqrt(3)x -21 +12 sqrt(3)=0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-48x\u00b2 + (40 -24 sqrt(3))x + (-21 +12 sqrt(3)) =0,\n\nThis quadratic equation in x can be solved using the quadratic formula.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n48x\u00b2 + (-40 +24 sqrt(3))x +21 -12 sqrt(3)=0,\n\nMultiply by -1,\n\n48x\u00b2 + (-40 +24 sqrt(3))x +21 -12 sqrt(3)=0,\n\nWait, actually, the equation is:\n\n-48x\u00b2 + (40 -24 sqrt(3))x + (-21 +12 sqrt(3)) =0,\n\nSo,\n\na= -48,\n\nb=40 -24 sqrt(3),\n\nc= -21 +12 sqrt(3),\n\nThus,\n\nx = [ -b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac) ]/(2a),\n\nCompute discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac,\n\nLet me compute:\n\nFirst, b =40 -24 sqrt(3),\n\nso b\u00b2 = (40)^2 + (24 sqrt(3))^2 - 2*40*24 sqrt(3),\n\n=1600 + 24\u00b2*3 - 1920 sqrt(3),\n\n24\u00b2=576, so 576*3=1728,\n\nThus,\n\nb\u00b2 =1600 +1728 -1920 sqrt(3)=3328 -1920 sqrt(3),\n\nThen, -4ac = -4*(-48)*( -21 +12 sqrt(3)),\n\nFirst compute -4*(-48)=192,\n\nThus,\n\n-4ac=192*( -21 +12 sqrt(3) )= -192*21 +192*12 sqrt(3),\n\n= -4032 +2304 sqrt(3),\n\nThus,\n\nD= b\u00b2 -4ac = (3328 -1920 sqrt(3)) + (-4032 +2304 sqrt(3)),\n\n= (3328 -4032) + (-1920 sqrt(3) +2304 sqrt(3)),\n\n= (-704) + (384 sqrt(3)),\n\nSo D= -704 +384 sqrt(3).\n\nHmm, sqrt(D) would be complicated. Maybe factor something out?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quadratic has a double root, so discriminant D must be zero? Wait, no, we already used the derivative condition, so this quadratic should have one solution (the x-coordinate of C).

That can't be.\n\nWait, that suggests no real solution, which contradicts the problem's statement that such a point exists. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nThis indicates an error in my algebra steps. Let me retrace the steps where I might have messed up.\n\nStarting from the derivative condition equation:\n\n2xy = sqrt(3)(x\u00b2 + 3(1 - y)^2),\n\nthen substituting y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nLeft side:2x*(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 )\n\n= -2 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 + sqrt(3)x,\n\nRight side:sqrt(3)*(x\u00b2 +3*(1 - (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ))^2 )\n\nInside the brackets:1 + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2,\n\nSo squared term is (sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2 ))^2,\n\nExpanding that gives 3x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3)x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) + (1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2,\n\nThus,\n\nthe term inside the right side:\n\nx\u00b2 +3*[3x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3)x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) + (1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2 ]\n\n= x\u00b2 +9x\u00b2 +6 sqrt(3)x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) +3*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2,\n\n=10x\u00b2 +6 sqrt(3)x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) +3*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2,\n\nThen, multiplying by sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(3)*10x\u00b2 + sqrt(3)*6 sqrt(3)x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) + sqrt(3)*3*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2,\n\n=10 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 +6*3 x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) +3 sqrt(3)*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2,\n\n=10 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 +18x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) +3 sqrt(3)*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2,\n\nThus, the right side is:\n\n10 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 +18x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) +3 sqrt(3)*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2,\n\nTherefore, setting equal to left side:\n\n-2 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 + sqrt(3)x =10 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 +18x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) +3 sqrt(3)*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-2 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 + sqrt(3)x -10 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 -18x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) -3 sqrt(3)*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2 =0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nFor x\u00b2 terms: (-2 sqrt(3) -10 sqrt(3))x\u00b2 =-12 sqrt(3)x\u00b2,\n\nFor x terms: sqrt(3)x -18x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) =x[ sqrt(3) -18 +9 sqrt(3) ] =x[10 sqrt(3) -18],\n\nConstants term: -3 sqrt(3)*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2,\n\nThus,\n\n-12 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 + (10 sqrt(3) -18)x -3 sqrt(3)*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2 =0,\n\nThis is different from what I had before.

So, for C, the only segment PQ of unit length from x-axis to y-axis passing through C is AB itself.\n\nSuppose C has coordinates (h,k) on AB.\n\nThe line through C must have intercepts p and q such that p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nand the line equation is x/p + y/q =1,\n\nand since C lies on this line,\n\nh/p +k/q =1,\n\nAlso, since C is on AB, k= -sqrt(3)h + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nWe need this equation to have only one solution (p,q) on the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1.\n\nSo, substituting k= -sqrt(3)h + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nthe equation becomes:\n\nh/p + [ -sqrt(3)h + sqrt(3)/2 ]/q =1,\n\nWith p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1.\n\nWe need this system to have exactly one solution (p,q).\n\nTo have a unique solution, the line in p and q must be tangent to the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1.\n\nWait a second! The system of equations h/p +k/q=1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1 must have a unique solution. That occurs when the line h/p +k/q=1 is tangent to the unit circle in the pq-plane.\n\nWait, actually, in terms of variables p and q, the equation h/p +k/q=1 can be rewritten as:\n\nq h + p k = p q,\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, treat p and q as variables, and the equation h/p +k/q =1 combined with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1 must have only one solution.\n\nThis occurs when the line h/p +k/q=1 is tangent to the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1.\n\nTo find when this is tangent, the distance from the center (0,0) to the line must be equal to the radius (1). Wait, but the line is in terms of 1/p and 1/q?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables p and q.\n\nLet me rewrite the equation h/p +k/q =1,\n\nMultiply both sides by pq: h q +k p = pq,\n\nRearrange: pq - h q -k p =0,\n\npq - h q -k p =0,\n\nLet me add hk to both sides: pq - h q -k p + hk = hk,\n\nFactor: (p - h)(q -k)= hk,\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider this as a linear equation in p and q:\n\nh q +k p = pq,\n\n=> pq -k p -h q =0,\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in two variables p and q.\n\nThe condition that this equation has exactly one solution on the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1 is that the system has a single solution, which would mean they are tangent.\n\nTo find the condition for tangency, we can use Lagrange multipliers or substitution.\n\nLet me use substitution.\n\nLet me parametrize p = cos\u03b8, q=sin\u03b8,\n\nthen the equation h q +k p = p q,\n\nbecomes h sin\u03b8 +k cos\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8,\n\nLet me write this as:\n\ncos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 - h sin\u03b8 -k cos\u03b8 =0,\n\nFactor terms:\n\nsin\u03b8 (cos\u03b8 - h) -k cos\u03b8 =0,\n\nHmm,\n\nAlternatively,\n\nLet me write everything in terms of tan\u03b8,\n\nLet me set t=tan\u03b8,\n\nthen sin\u03b8= t/sqrt(1+t\u00b2),\n\ncos\u03b8=1/sqrt(1+t\u00b2),\n\nSubstitute into equation:\n\nh*(t/sqrt(1+t\u00b2)) +k*(1/sqrt(1+t\u00b2)) = (t/sqrt(1+t\u00b2))*(1/sqrt(1+t\u00b2)),\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(1+t\u00b2):\n\nh t +k = t/(1 +t\u00b2),\n\nRearrange:\n\nh t +k - t/(1 +t\u00b2)=0,\n\nThis equation in t must have exactly one solution. Which would require that it's a tangent, so discriminant zero, but it's transcendental.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is that the quadratic equation obtained from substituting p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1 into the other equation has discriminant zero.\n\nLet me do that.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) h/p +k/q =1,\n\n2) p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1,\n\nLet me solve equation1 for q,\n\nFrom equation1: q = (k p)/(p -h),\n\nSubstitute into equation2:\n\np\u00b2 + [ (k p)/(p -h) ]^2 =1,\n\nMultiply both sides by (p -h)^2:\n\np\u00b2(p -h)^2 +k\u00b2 p\u00b2 = (p -h)^2,\n\nExpand p\u00b2(p -h)^2:\n\np\u00b2(p\u00b2 -2 h p +h\u00b2)= p^4 -2 h p^3 +h\u00b2 p\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\np^4 -2 h p^3 +h\u00b2 p\u00b2 +k\u00b2 p\u00b2 - (p -h)^2 =0,\n\nExpand (p -h)^2= p\u00b2 -2 h p +h\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\np^4 -2 h p^3 +h\u00b2 p\u00b2 +k\u00b2 p\u00b2 -p\u00b2 +2 h p -h\u00b2=0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\np^4 -2 h p^3 + (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 -1)p\u00b2 +2 h p -h\u00b2=0,\n\nThis quartic equation must have a double root for tangency. The condition is complicated, but perhaps for the system to have only one solution (the line AB), the point C must satisfy certain conditions related to the original triangle.\n\nAlternatively, since AB is itself a member of the family F when p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2,\n\nwhich satisfy p\u00b2 + q\u00b2= (1/4)+(3/4)=1,\n\nThus, AB is indeed a member of F.\n\nWe need that for point C on AB, there are no other segments in F passing through C except AB.\n\nSuppose there is another segment PQ in F passing through C. Then, the line PQ must intersect AB at C and possibly another point. But if C is such that this intersection is only at C, meaning the line is tangent to AB at C, but AB is straight, so the only way a line can intersect AB only at C is if the line is AB itself. Thus, C must be a point where any other line from F would intersect AB at another point, except AB.\n\nAlternatively, this is similar to the concept of an envelope, so the point C is where the envelope touches AB.\n\nEarlier, I derived the envelope equation x\u00b2 y=(1\u2212y)^3. The point C is the point of tangency between AB and this envelope.\n\nTo find the coordinates of C, I can set up the system of equations:\n\n1. y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 (equation of AB),\n\n2. x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3 (envelope equation),\n\n3. The derivative condition dy/dx = -sqrt(3) (slope of AB equals the envelope's slope at that point).\n\nWe can use equations 1 and 2 to solve for x and y, then verify with the third condition.\n\nLet me try solving equations 1 and 2 again carefully.\n\nFrom equation1: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nSubstitute into equation2:\n\nx\u00b2*(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) = (1 - (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2))^3,\n\nLet me compute both sides:\n\nLeft side: -sqrt(3)x\u00b3 + (sqrt(3)/2)x\u00b2,\n\nRight side: [1 + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2]^3 = [sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2)]^3,\n\nLet me denote a = sqrt(3)x,\n\nand b =1 - sqrt(3)/2,\n\nthen right side is (a + b)^3 = a\u00b3 + 3a\u00b2b + 3ab\u00b2 + b\u00b3,\n\nLeft side: -sqrt(3)x\u00b3 + (sqrt(3)/2)x\u00b2 = -a\u00b3 + (a\u00b2)/2,\n\nThus,\n\nEquation becomes:\n\n-a\u00b3 + (a\u00b2)/2 = a\u00b3 +3a\u00b2b +3ab\u00b2 +b\u00b3,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-2a\u00b3 - (5a\u00b2)/2 -3ab\u00b2 -3ab\u00b2 -b\u00b3 =0,\n\nWait, no, let me recompute:\n\nLeft side minus right side:\n\n(-a\u00b3 + (a\u00b2)/2 ) - (a\u00b3 +3a\u00b2b +3ab\u00b2 +b\u00b3 )= -2a\u00b3 + (a\u00b2)/2 -3a\u00b2b -3ab\u00b2 -b\u00b3 =0,\n\nFactor terms:\n\n-2a\u00b3 -3a\u00b2b + (a\u00b2/2) -3ab\u00b2 -b\u00b3 =0,\n\nThis seems complicated, but substituting back a = sqrt(3)x,\n\nand b =1 - sqrt(3)/2,\n\nwe can attempt to find a solution.\n\nAlternatively, let me assume that the x-coordinate of C is such that the point is the centroid or some known point, but given the coordinates of A and B, centroid would be ( (0 +1/2 +0)/3, (0 +0 +sqrt(3)/2)/3 ), but that might not be it.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the envelope equation x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3 can be rewritten as (x/y)^{2/3}*(y) = (1 - y)^2,\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nTake both sides to the power 1/3,\n\n(x\u00b2 y)^{1/3} = (1 - y),\n\n=> x^{2/3} y^{1/3} =1 - y,\n\nCube both sides:\n\nx\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3,\n\nYes, same equation.\n\nPerhaps setting u =x^{2/3}, v = y^{1/3},\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me make substitution z =1 - y,\n\nthen y =1 - z,\n\nso the equation becomes x\u00b2(1 - z)= z\u00b3,\n\nand from AB equation,\n\ny = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nso,\n\n1 - z = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\n=> z =1 + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2,\n\nThus,\n\nz = sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2),\n\nSubstitute into envelope equation:\n\nx\u00b2(1 - z)= z^3,\n\n=> x\u00b2(1 - [sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2) ]) = [sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2)]^3,\n\nSimplify inside:\n\n1 - sqrt(3)x -1 + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)x,\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2(sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)x ) = [sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2)]^3,\n\nFactor sqrt(3) from the left side:\n\nsqrt(3) x\u00b2 (1/2 -x ) = [sqrt(3)x + c]^3 where c=1 - sqrt(3)/2,\n\nThis still is complex.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps I can consider that the coordinates of C are (1/4, sqrt(3)/4), but let me check.\n\nLet me test point (1/4, sqrt(3)/4):\n\nCheck if it's on AB:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/4) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/4 + 2 sqrt(3)/4 )= sqrt(3)/4.

Wait, earlier that didn't satisfy the envelope equation, but let me try OC squared:\n\nIf point C were (1/4, sqrt(3)/4), then OC\u00b2 = (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 =1/16 +3/16=4/16=1/4, so 1/4 would give p+q=5, but I doubt that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, let's suppose the correct coordinates are (1/3, sqrt(3)/6):\n\nOC squared is (1/3)^2 + (sqrt(3)/6)^2=1/9 +1/12= (4 +3)/36=7/36, which gives 7+36=43.\n\nAlternatively, let's suppose the correct coordinates are (1/2,0) but that's point A.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the point C is the midpoint of AB.\n\nCoordinates of midpoint of AB: ( (0 +1/2)/2, (sqrt(3)/2 +0)/2 )=(1/4, sqrt(3)/4),\n\nBut as before, this doesn't satisfy the envelope equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coordinates are ( (sqrt(3)-1)/something ).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the envelope equation.\n\nLet me rederive the envelope equation.\n\nThe family of lines is x/p + y/q =1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1,\n\nParametrizing p=cos\u03b8, q=sin\u03b8,\n\nThus, lines are x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1,\n\nTo find the envelope, we take F(x,y,\u03b8)=x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 -1=0,\n\nThe envelope occurs where dF/d\u03b8=0,\n\nCompute derivative:\n\ndF/d\u03b8= x sin\u03b8/cos\u00b2\u03b8 -

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nWe have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all line segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. We need to find a unique point C on segment AB (other than A and B) that isn't part of any segment from F except maybe AB itself. Then, we have to compute OC squared, which will be a fraction p/q, and find p + q where p and q are coprime.\n\nHmm. Let me visualize this. The points O, A, and B form a triangle in the first quadrant. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), connecting these should form a right triangle? Wait, actually, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis, so triangle OAB is a right triangle with legs OA = 1/2 and OB = sqrt(3)/2. The hypotenuse AB would then be the segment between A and B.\n\nNow, the family F consists of all segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. Each such segment is in the first quadrant, so P has coordinates (p, 0) and Q has coordinates (0, q) with p, q \u2265 0, and the distance between them is 1. The distance formula gives sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. Therefore, all such segments PQ correspond to points (p,0) and (0,q) lying on the unit circle in their respective axes. Wait, actually, p and q can't both be greater than 1, but since they are in the first quadrant and the segment is of unit length, their coordinates must satisfy that equation.\n\nThe key part is that there is a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that is not on any segment from F except AB itself. So, C is on AB, and if you take any segment from F that passes through C, it must be the segment AB itself. In other words, C is only on AB and no other segments in F. So we need to find such a point C, then compute OC squared.\n\nFirst, let me parametrize segment AB. Let me find the parametric equations for AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the vector from A to B is (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So a point C on AB can be written as A + t*(vector AB) where t is between 0 and 1. Alternatively, since AB is a straight line, we can write parametric equations.\n\nAlternatively, since O, A, B form a triangle, perhaps it's better to parametrize AB. Let me do that.\n\nThe coordinates of AB can be parametrized as follows:\n\nStarting at A (1/2, 0), moving towards B (0, sqrt(3)/2). So the parametric equations can be written as:\n\nx = 1/2 - (1/2)*t,\n\ny = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)*t,\n\nwhere t ranges from 0 to 1. So when t=0, we are at A, and t=1, we are at B.\n\nAlternatively, using a parameter s from 0 to 1, so that when s=0 it's at A and s=1 it's at B, so:\n\nx = (1/2)(1 - s),\n\ny = (sqrt(3)/2)s,\n\nwhere s \u2208 [0,1].\n\nEither way, we can represent point C as ( (1/2)(1 - s), (sqrt(3)/2)s ) for some s between 0 and 1, excluding the endpoints (since it's distinct from A and B).\n\nNow, we need to find the point C on AB such that C is not on any segment PQ from F except AB. That is, if there exists a segment PQ in F (other than AB) that contains point C, then C is excluded. So we need the point C where the only segment in F passing through C is AB itself. So such a point must lie only on AB and no other PQ in F.\n\nTherefore, for point C, if we suppose that C is on some PQ in F (other than AB), then the coordinates of C must satisfy the equation of PQ, but we need to find the point where this is impossible except for AB.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point C is such that any line through C with a slope of -1 (since PQ segments from F have slope -q/p, but since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, maybe there's a relation) but perhaps another approach is better.\n\nWait, let's think of the set of all segments PQ in F. Each such segment connects (p,0) to (0,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. The point C lies on AB. We need that the only such PQ that contains C is AB itself.\n\nTherefore, for point C, if we suppose that there exists another PQ in F passing through C, then that would mean that C is on both AB and some other PQ. So, to have a unique such point C where this is not possible (except for AB), so C is not on any other PQ except AB. So we need to find the point on AB where if you try to have another PQ pass through it, it can't.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is the point where the tangent to some envelope of these segments PQ touches AB? Maybe the envelope of all these segments PQ forms a curve, and the point C is where this envelope is tangent to AB?\n\nHmm, that might be a way to approach it. The envelope of the family of lines PQ. Since each PQ is a line segment between (p,0) and (0,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. The envelope of these lines would be a curve such that each line is tangent to the curve. The point C would be where the envelope is tangent to AB, so that AB is tangent to the envelope at C, hence only touching at that point, so that C is the only point on AB lying on the envelope? Wait, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the lines PQ and find where they intersect AB, then find a point where this intersection only occurs for AB itself.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that any segment PQ in F is the line segment between (p,0) and (0,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. Let me write the equation of such a line.\n\nThe line PQ goes from (p,0) to (0,q). The equation of this line can be written as x/p + y/q =1. Since the segment is between those points, so the line equation is x/p + y/q =1, with p and q positive and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nSo for any such line, the equation is x/p + y/q =1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe need to find a point C on AB such that the only line of the form x/p + y/q =1 (with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1) passing through C is the line AB itself.\n\nSo first, let's find the equation of AB. Since A is (1/2,0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). Therefore, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAlternatively, written in standard form: sqrt(3)x + y = sqrt(3)/2. Multiply both sides by 2: 2sqrt(3)x + 2y = sqrt(3). Hmm, maybe not necessary yet.\n\nNow, the point C is on AB, so its coordinates satisfy y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Let me denote C as (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So, coordinates of C can be written as (x, sqrt(3)( (1/2) - x )).\n\nWe need that this point C lies on some line x/p + y/q =1 (with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1) only if that line is AB itself. So, to ensure that the only solution (p, q) to the equations:\n\n1. x/p + y/q =1,\n\n2. p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nand the line x/p + y/q =1 is the same as AB.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for point C, the system of equations given by substituting C into x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 has only one solution (p,q) corresponding to the line AB. Since AB is one such line, so if the system has only that solution, then C is our desired point.\n\nTherefore, substituting the coordinates of C into the equation x/p + y/q =1 gives an equation in p and q, along with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. If this system has only one solution (p,q) which corresponds to the line AB, then that's the point C.\n\nTherefore, let me set up the equations.\n\nLet me denote coordinates of C as (x, y), lying on AB, so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Let me plug into the line equation:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\nand we also have p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe need that for this x and y, the only solution (p, q) is the one corresponding to the line AB.\n\nFirst, let me find the p and q for line AB. Let's see, the line AB goes from point A (1/2, 0) to B (0, sqrt(3)/2). Therefore, in the line equation x/p + y/q =1, the p here would be the x-intercept, which is 1/2, and the q would be the y-intercept, which is sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, for line AB, p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2. Let me confirm:\n\nx/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3)/2) = 2x + (2/sqrt(3)) y =1. Wait, but the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Let's see if these are the same.\n\nStarting with 2x + (2/sqrt(3)) y =1,\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(3)/2: sqrt(3)x + y = sqrt(3)/2,\n\nWhich rearranged is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, which matches. So yes, the intercepts are p=1/2 and q= sqrt(3)/2, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 =1, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, for line AB, p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nTherefore, to have the only solution (p, q) be (1/2, sqrt(3)/2), the system:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nmust have only that solution when substituting x and y as coordinates on AB.\n\nTherefore, substituting y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into the first equation:\n\nx/p + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] / q =1.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\nx/p + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/q =1.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nx/p - (sqrt(3)x)/q + (sqrt(3)/2)/q =1.\n\nLet me group the terms with x:\n\nx(1/p - sqrt(3)/q) + (sqrt(3))/(2q) =1.\n\nHmm. So this is an equation in variables p and q, with the constraints p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. We need that for our point C (x,y), this equation combined with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 has only one solution (p,q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nTherefore, for the system to have a unique solution, the equations must be such that substituting one into the other gives a quadratic equation with a repeated root. That is, when we substitute p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 into the first equation, we can write everything in terms of one variable and get a quadratic equation. For it to have only one solution, the discriminant must be zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps parametrize p and q using an angle. Since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, we can write p = cos\u03b8 and q = sin\u03b8, but since p and q are intercepts on the axes, and since the segments are in the first quadrant, p and q are positive, so \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2.\n\nTherefore, let me set p = cos\u03b8, q = sin\u03b8, since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line becomes x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, substituting y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into this equation:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me combine terms:\n\nx [1/cos\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/sin\u03b8] + (sqrt(3)/2)/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nx * [ (sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8) / (sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8) ) ] + (sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8)) =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to multiply through by sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 to eliminate denominators:\n\nx ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) + (sqrt(3)/2) cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nHmm, maybe that's a way to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, let me rearrange the equation:\n\nx [1/cos\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/sin\u03b8] =1 - (sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8)).\n\nTherefore,\n\nx = [1 - (sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8))] / [1/cos\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/sin\u03b8].\n\nThis expression gives x in terms of \u03b8. Since x must be a fixed value (the x-coordinate of point C), this equation must hold for only one \u03b8, which is the \u03b8 corresponding to the line AB.\n\nFor line AB, which corresponds to p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2, so cos\u03b8 =1/2, so \u03b8= \u03c0/3 (since cos(\u03c0/3)=1/2, sin(\u03c0/3)=sqrt(3)/2). Therefore, \u03b8=60 degrees.\n\nTherefore, to have the above equation hold only when \u03b8=\u03c0/3, the equation must have a unique solution \u03b8=\u03c0/3 for the given x.\n\nTherefore, the equation above, when considered as an equation in \u03b8, must have a double root at \u03b8=\u03c0/3. That is, when we set up the equation, the solutions for \u03b8 would be \u03b8=\u03c0/3 (double root).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation can be written as a function of \u03b8, and we can set its derivative to zero at that point? Maybe not. Alternatively, since we need uniqueness, the equation must have only one solution, so discriminant zero.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for the point C (x,y), the line equations through C must have only the line AB. Therefore, the system of equations (the line equation and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1) must have only one solution. Therefore, substituting y into the line equation gives an equation relating p and q. Let me try substituting variables.\n\nLet me denote variables p and q, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, and the point C (x,y) lying on the line x/p + y/q =1. So substituting y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into the line equation gives:\n\nx/p + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/q =1.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nx/p - (sqrt(3)x)/q + (sqrt(3)/2)/q =1.\n\nLet me group terms with x:\n\nx(1/p - sqrt(3)/q) =1 - (sqrt(3))/(2 q).\n\nHmm. Let me denote this as equation (1).\n\nBut since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, perhaps we can write p in terms of q or vice versa and substitute.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider this as a linear equation in variables 1/p and 1/q. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables p and q. Let me set variables as p and q with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nLet me rearrange equation (1):\n\nx(1/p - sqrt(3)/q) =1 - (sqrt(3))/(2 q).\n\nLet me multiply both sides by p q to eliminate denominators:\n\nx ( q - sqrt(3) p ) = p q - (sqrt(3)/2) p.\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me write that again:\n\nStarting with equation (1):\n\nx(1/p - sqrt(3)/q) =1 - (sqrt(3))/(2 q).\n\nMultiply both sides by p q:\n\nx(q - sqrt(3) p) = p q - (sqrt(3)/2) p.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nx q - sqrt(3) x p - p q + (sqrt(3)/2) p =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor terms:\n\nGroup terms with p and q:\n\nTerms with p: (-sqrt(3)x - q + sqrt(3)/2 ) p,\n\nterms with q: x q,\n\nand the rest? Wait, maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, let me collect like terms:\n\n- sqrt(3) x p - p q + x q + (sqrt(3)/2)p =0.\n\nHmm, factor terms with p and q:\n\np ( -sqrt(3)x - q + sqrt(3)/2 ) + q x =0.\n\nHmm, maybe rearrange terms:\n\np ( -sqrt(3)x - q + sqrt(3)/2 ) = - q x.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there is a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the problem from another angle. Since the point C must lie on AB and not on any other segment PQ except AB, that means that C is the only intersection point between AB and that particular segment PQ (which is AB). For any other segment PQ in F, if it intersects AB, it must do so at some other point besides C. But for point C, no other PQ passes through it except AB.\n\nTherefore, the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of all the segments PQ in F. The envelope is a curve such that each PQ is tangent to it, and the point of tangency is the only point where PQ touches the envelope. If AB is tangent to this envelope at point C, then C is the only point on AB that lies on the envelope, hence the only point on AB that is on a segment PQ (the tangent one) besides AB itself. Wait, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, the envelope of the family of lines PQ is a curve, and the point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope. Therefore, at point C, AB is tangent to the envelope, so that C is the only point common to AB and the envelope. Thus, C is the desired point.\n\nTherefore, if I can find the envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, then find where AB is tangent to this envelope, that point of tangency is C.\n\nSo let me try to compute the envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nTo find the envelope of a family of curves given by an equation F(x,y,p,q)=0 with some constraint between parameters, we can use the method of differentiating with respect to the parameter and solving the system.\n\nAlternatively, since the lines are given by x/p + y/q =1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, perhaps we can parametrize p and q as p = cos\u03b8, q = sin\u03b8, as before, since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. Then the lines are x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nTherefore, the family of lines is F(x,y,\u03b8) = x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 -1 =0.\n\nThe envelope of this family satisfies the condition that dF/d\u03b8 =0 as well. Therefore, to find the envelope, we can solve the system:\n\nF(x,y,\u03b8) = x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 -1 =0,\n\ndF/d\u03b8 = x (sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y (cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1,\n\n2) x (sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y (cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nWe need to solve these equations for x and y in terms of \u03b8, and then eliminate \u03b8 to get the envelope's equation.\n\nLet me work with equation 2:\n\nx (sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 = y (cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\n=> x / cos\u00b2\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 = y / sin\u00b2\u03b8 * cos\u03b8,\n\n=> x / cos\u00b2\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 = y / sin\u00b2\u03b8 * cos\u03b8,\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8 to eliminate denominators:\n\nx sin^3\u03b8 = y cos^3\u03b8,\n\nThus,\n\nx / y = (cos^3\u03b8)/(sin^3\u03b8) = (cot\u03b8)^3,\n\nTherefore,\n\ncot\u03b8 = (x/y)^{1/3}.\n\nLet me denote cot\u03b8 = t, so t = (x/y)^{1/3}.\n\nThen, sin\u03b8 = 1 / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2),\n\ncos\u03b8 = t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nAlternatively, since cot\u03b8 = t, so cos\u03b8 = t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nsin\u03b8 = 1 / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nHmm, perhaps substituting back into equation 1.\n\nLet me express equation 1 in terms of t.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1,\n\nSubstituting cos\u03b8 = t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nsin\u03b8 = 1 / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nThus,\n\nx / ( t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) ) + y / (1 / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) ) =1,\n\nWhich is,\n\nx * sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)/t + y * sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) =1,\n\nFactor sqrt(1 + t\u00b2):\n\nsqrt(1 + t\u00b2) [x/t + y] =1,\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(1 + t\u00b2) = 1 / [x/t + y].\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n1 + t\u00b2 = 1 / (x/t + y)^2,\n\nBut t = (x/y)^{1/3}, so let me write t^3 = x / y,\n\nTherefore, t^3 y =x,\n\nHence, x = y t^3,\n\nLet me substitute x = y t^3 into the equation above:\n\n1 + t\u00b2 = 1 / ( (y t^3)/t + y )^2 = 1 / ( y t^2 + y )^2 = 1 / [ y^2 (t^2 +1) ) ]\n\nThus,\n\n1 + t\u00b2 = 1 / [ y^2 (t\u00b2 +1) ) ]\n\nMultiply both sides by y\u00b2 (t\u00b2 +1):\n\ny\u00b2 (1 + t\u00b2)^2 =1,\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = 1 / sqrt( (1 + t\u00b2)^2 )\n\nWait, but since we squared earlier, maybe absolute value? Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, sqrt( (1 + t\u00b2)^2 ) is (1 + t\u00b2). So,\n\ny\u00b2 (1 + t\u00b2)^2 =1,\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = 1 / [ (1 + t\u00b2) ]\n\nBut since y is positive (since in the first quadrant), we can take the positive root.\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = 1 / (1 + t\u00b2).\n\nBut t = (x/y)^{1/3}, so let me write t^3 = x/y,\n\nThus, t = (x/y)^{1/3},\n\nTherefore, substitute t into the expression for y:\n\ny =1/(1 + t\u00b2) =1/[1 + (x/y)^{2/3} ].\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me see if I can express this in terms of x and y.\n\nLet me denote t^3 = x/y,\n\nSo t = (x/y)^{1/3},\n\nThus, t\u00b2 = (x/y)^{2/3},\n\nSo,\n\ny =1/[1 + (x/y)^{2/3} ]\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\ny [1 + (x/y)^{2/3} ] =1,\n\nExpand:\n\ny + x^{2/3} y^{1 - 2/3} =1,\n\nSimplify exponents:\n\ny + x^{2/3} y^{1/3} =1,\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Let me try to write in terms of t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of t.\n\nWe have:\n\nFrom t^3 = x/y,\n\n=> x = y t^3,\n\nand from y =1/(1 + t^2),\n\nThus,\n\nx = [1/(1 + t^2)] * t^3,\n\nTherefore,\n\nx = t^3 / (1 + t^2),\n\nand y =1/(1 + t^2).\n\nTherefore, we can write the envelope parametrically as:\n\nx = t^3 / (1 + t^2),\n\ny =1/(1 + t^2),\n\nwhere t is a parameter (t>0, since in first quadrant).\n\nAlternatively, to eliminate t, note that y =1/(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nso t\u00b2 = (1/y) -1,\n\nand x = t^3/(1 + t\u00b2) = t^3 y,\n\nsince 1 + t\u00b2 =1/y,\n\nso t^3 y = x,\n\nbut t^2 = (1/y -1),\n\nso t = sqrt( (1/y -1) ),\n\nThus,\n\nx = [ (1/y -1)^{3/2} ] * y,\n\nHmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me set u = t\u00b2,\n\nthen,\n\nx = t^3/(1 + t\u00b2) = t * t\u00b2/(1 + t\u00b2) = t u/(1 + u),\n\ny =1/(1 + u),\n\nand u = t\u00b2,\n\nso t = sqrt(u),\n\nThus,\n\nx = sqrt(u) * u / (1 + u) = u^{3/2}/(1 + u),\n\nBut perhaps not helpful. Alternatively, let me consider that:\n\nLet me write x in terms of y:\n\nFrom y =1/(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nt\u00b2 = (1 - y)/y,\n\nso t = sqrt( (1 - y)/y ),\n\nthen,\n\nx = t^3 y,\n\nWait, since x = t^3/(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nand 1 + t\u00b2 =1/y,\n\nso x = t^3 y,\n\nBut t^3 = t * t\u00b2 = t*( (1 - y)/y )\n\nHmm, but t = sqrt( (1 - y)/y ),\n\nThus,\n\nx = sqrt( (1 - y)/y ) * ( (1 - y)/y ) * y,\n\nWait, this might not be leading anywhere. Alternatively, maybe parametrizing with t is okay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another substitution.\n\nAlternatively, since the envelope is given parametrically as:\n\nx = t^3/(1 + t\u00b2),\n\ny =1/(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nLet me denote s = t + 1/t or something? Not sure. Alternatively, let me see if this parametric equation can be converted into a Cartesian equation.\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me denote t as a parameter. Let me consider:\n\nLet me write x = t^3/(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nand y =1/(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nLet me note that x = t * (t\u00b2)/(1 + t\u00b2) = t*(1 - y),\n\nsince y =1/(1 + t\u00b2) => 1 - y = t\u00b2/(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nTherefore,\n\nx = t*(1 - y).\n\nTherefore, t = x/(1 - y).\n\nBut also, from y =1/(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nso t\u00b2 = (1 - y)/y,\n\nTherefore, t = sqrt( (1 - y)/y ).\n\nBut from above, t = x/(1 - y),\n\nso:\n\nx/(1 - y) = sqrt( (1 - y)/y ),\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nx\u00b2/(1 - y)^2 = (1 - y)/y,\n\nMultiply both sides by y(1 - y)^2:\n\nx\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3,\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3,\n\nThis is the Cartesian equation of the envelope.\n\nSo the envelope is the curve x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3.\n\nTherefore, the envelope of all those lines PQ is the curve x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3.\n\nTherefore, the point C must be the point where AB is tangent to this envelope. Because if AB is tangent to the envelope at point C, then C is the only point on AB that lies on the envelope. Since the envelope is the set of all points that lie on exactly one PQ segment (the tangent one), except for the points where multiple segments intersect, but tangency would mean only one. Wait, actually, the envelope is precisely the set of points where each point is on exactly one PQ segment (the tangent one). So, any point on the envelope lies on exactly one PQ, except perhaps at cusps or something. Therefore, the point C must be the intersection point of AB and the envelope, and since AB is tangent to the envelope at C, that point is unique (other than intersections at A or B if they are on the envelope). But since A is (1/2,0). Let's check if A is on the envelope:\n\nPlug x=1/2, y=0 into x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3,\n\nLeft side: (1/2)^2 *0 =0,\n\nRight side: (1 -0)^3 =1,\n\nSo 0 \u22601, so A is not on the envelope. Similarly, B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Plugging into the equation:\n\nLeft side: 0\u00b2*(sqrt(3)/2)=0,\n\nRight side: (1 - sqrt(3)/2)^3 \u2248 (1 -0.866)^3 \u2248 (0.134)^3 \u22480.0024, not zero. So B isn't on the envelope either. Thus, the only intersection between AB and the envelope is the point C where they are tangent.\n\nTherefore, to find point C, we need to find the point where AB is tangent to the envelope curve x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3.\n\nSo, let me parametrize AB as before. Let me write AB's equation as y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe can substitute this into the envelope equation x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3 and find the point(s) of intersection, then ensure that it's a double root (i.e., tangency), so the system has a double solution.\n\nLet me substitute y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3.\n\nFirst, compute 1 - y =1 - (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) =1 + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2 = (1 - sqrt(3)/2) + sqrt(3)x.\n\nLet me compute 1 - sqrt(3)/2 \u22481 -0.866\u22480.134, but let's keep it exact.\n\nTherefore, substituting into the equation:\n\nx\u00b2 [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] = [ (1 - sqrt(3)/2) + sqrt(3)x ]^3.\n\nThis looks complicated, but perhaps expanding both sides and then setting the equation to have a double root.\n\nAlternatively, since we need the intersection to be a point of tangency, the system has a double root, so the equation obtained after substitution will have a discriminant zero or something. Alternatively, set the derivative of the envelope curve equal to the slope of AB at the point of contact.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that at the point of contact C, the tangent to the envelope must coincide with AB's slope. The slope of AB is -sqrt(3), so the derivative of the envelope at point C must be -sqrt(3).\n\nLet me compute the derivative of the envelope curve x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3.\n\nLet me differentiate both sides with respect to x.\n\nLeft side: 2x y + x\u00b2 dy/dx,\n\nRight side: 3(1 - y)^2 (-dy/dx).\n\nTherefore,\n\n2x y + x\u00b2 dy/dx = -3(1 - y)^2 dy/dx,\n\nBring terms with dy/dx to one side:\n\nx\u00b2 dy/dx + 3(1 - y)^2 dy/dx = -2x y,\n\nFactor dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx [x\u00b2 + 3(1 - y)^2 ] = -2x y,\n\nThus,\n\ndy/dx = -2x y / [x\u00b2 + 3(1 - y)^2 ].\n\nAt the point of tangency C, this derivative must equal the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).

Alternatively, since equation 3 comes from the derivative condition, it should be redundant if we already have 1 and 2, but perhaps better to solve equations 1 and 2 first.\n\nLet me substitute equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nLet me denote equation 2 as:\n\nx\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3,\n\nand equation 1 gives y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me substitute y into equation 2:\n\nx\u00b2 [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] = [1 - (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 )]^3.\n\nFirst compute the right-hand side (RHS):\n\n1 - (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) =1 + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2 = (1 - sqrt(3)/2) + sqrt(3)x,\n\nLet me denote this as (sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2 )),\n\nTherefore, RHS = [sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2 )]^3.\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS):\n\nx\u00b2 [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] = sqrt(3)x\u00b2 [ -x + 1/2 ].\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(3)x\u00b2 ( -x + 1/2 ) = [sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2 )]^3.\n\nThis equation looks quite complex. Maybe it's better to let me set t = sqrt(3)x to simplify.\n\nLet me set t = sqrt(3)x,\n\nthen x = t / sqrt(3),\n\nand y = -sqrt(3)*(t / sqrt(3)) + sqrt(3)/2 = -t + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo y = -t + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nand substituting into LHS and RHS:\n\nLHS:\n\nsqrt(3)*( (t / sqrt(3))\u00b2 ) * ( - (t / sqrt(3)) + 1/2 )\n\nFirst compute (t / sqrt(3))\u00b2 = t\u00b2 / 3,\n\nso,\n\nsqrt(3) * (t\u00b2 /3 ) * [ - t/sqrt(3) + 1/2 ]\n\n= (sqrt(3) * t\u00b2 / 3 ) * [ - t / sqrt(3) + 1/2 ]\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst term inside the bracket: -t / sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(3) * t\u00b2 /3 * (-t / sqrt(3)) = (sqrt(3) * -t / sqrt(3)) * t\u00b2 /3 = (-t) * t\u00b2 /3 = - t\u00b3 /3,\n\nSecond term inside the bracket: 1/2:\n\nsqrt(3)* t\u00b2 /3 * 1/2 = (sqrt(3)/6) t\u00b2,\n\nThus, LHS total is:\n\n- t\u00b3 /3 + (sqrt(3)/6) t\u00b2.\n\nNow the RHS:\n\n[ sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) ]^3,\n\nBut sqrt(3)x = t,\n\nand 1 - sqrt(3)/2 remains,\n\nso,\n\n[ t + (1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) ]^3,\n\nLet me write that as [ t + c ]^3 where c =1 - sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 1 -0.866\u22480.134.\n\nExpanding [t + c]^3:\n\n= t^3 + 3t\u00b2 c + 3t c\u00b2 + c\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, RHS = t^3 + 3c t\u00b2 + 3c\u00b2 t + c\u00b3.\n\nPutting it all together, equation becomes:\n\nLHS = RHS,\n\nso,\n\n- (t\u00b3)/3 + (sqrt(3)/6) t\u00b2 = t^3 + 3c t\u00b2 + 3c\u00b2 t + c\u00b3,\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n- (t\u00b3)/3 + (sqrt(3)/6) t\u00b2 - t^3 - 3c t\u00b2 - 3c\u00b2 t - c\u00b3 =0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nFor t\u00b3: (-1/3 -1) t\u00b3 = -4/3 t\u00b3,\n\nFor t\u00b2: (sqrt(3)/6 -3c ) t\u00b2,\n\nFor t: -3c\u00b2 t,\n\nConstants: -c\u00b3,\n\nThus,\n\n-4/3 t\u00b3 + (sqrt(3)/6 - 3c ) t\u00b2 - 3c\u00b2 t - c\u00b3 =0,\n\nThis is a cubic equation in t. To solve this, perhaps substitute c =1 - sqrt(3)/2,\n\nLet me compute the coefficients step by step.\n\nFirst, let me compute c =1 - sqrt(3)/2 \u22481 -0.866=0.134.\n\nCompute sqrt(3)/6 - 3c:\n\nsqrt(3)/6 \u22480.2887,\n\n3c \u22483*(0.134)=0.402,\n\nThus sqrt(3)/6 -3c \u22480.2887 -0.402\u2248-0.113,\n\nBut let's compute exactly:\n\nsqrt(3)/6 - 3(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\n= sqrt(3)/6 -3 + (3 sqrt(3))/2\n\n= sqrt(3)/6 + (9 sqrt(3))/6 -3\n\n= (10 sqrt(3)/6 ) -3\n\n= (5 sqrt(3)/3 ) -3,\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me write all terms symbolically.\n\nLet me note c =1 - (sqrt(3)/2),\n\nthen,\n\nsqrt(3)/6 - 3c = sqrt(3)/6 - 3*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\n= sqrt(3)/6 -3 + (3 sqrt(3))/2\n\n= sqrt(3)/6 + (9 sqrt(3))/6 -3\n\n= (10 sqrt(3)/6 ) -3\n\n= (5 sqrt(3)/3 ) -3,\n\nSimilarly, 3c\u00b2 =3*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b2,\n\nand c\u00b3 = (1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b3,\n\nThis is getting very messy. Perhaps instead of substituting variables, I can try to find a smart substitution or notice a solution.\n\nAlternatively, since the point C is on AB and on the envelope, and the cubic equation must have a double root (since tangent), so there's a repeated root. Therefore, perhaps if I can factor out (t - t0)^2 from the cubic, where t0 is the root corresponding to point C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way. Let me consider that the system of equations (equations 1 and 2) might have a double solution, so when we substitute y from equation1 into equation2, the resulting equation in x has a double root, so discriminant zero.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFrom equation1: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nSubstitute into equation2: x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3,\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] = [1 - (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)]^3,\n\nLet me denote the left side as L and right side as R.\n\nLet me compute R first:\n\n1 - (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) =1 + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2).\n\nTherefore,\n\nR = [sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2)]^3,\n\nExpand R:\n\nLet me let a = sqrt(3)x,\n\nb =1 - sqrt(3)/2,\n\nthen R = (a + b)^3 = a\u00b3 + 3a\u00b2b + 3ab\u00b2 + b\u00b3.\n\nLHS:\n\nL = x\u00b2*(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) = sqrt(3)x\u00b2*(-x + 1/2).\n\nLet me write everything in terms of a = sqrt(3)x,\n\nthen x = a / sqrt(3),\n\nso,\n\nL = sqrt(3)*( (a / sqrt(3))\u00b2 )*(- (a / sqrt(3)) + 1/2 )\n\n= sqrt(3)*( a\u00b2 / 3 )*( -a/sqrt(3) + 1/2 )\n\n= ( sqrt(3) * a\u00b2 / 3 )*( -a/sqrt(3) + 1/2 )\n\n= (a\u00b2 / sqrt(3))*( -a + sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nsqrt(3) * (a\u00b2 / 3) = (sqrt(3)/3)a\u00b2,\n\nthen multiply by (-a/sqrt(3) + 1/2):\n\nFirst term: (sqrt(3)/3 a\u00b2)( -a/sqrt(3) ) = (sqrt(3)/3)(-a/sqrt(3)) a\u00b2 = (-a^3)/3,\n\nSecond term: (sqrt(3)/3 a\u00b2)(1/2 ) = (sqrt(3)/6) a\u00b2,\n\nThus, L = -a\u00b3/3 + (sqrt(3)/6)a\u00b2,\n\nBut R = (a + b)^3 = a\u00b3 + 3a\u00b2b + 3ab\u00b2 + b\u00b3,\n\nSet L = R,\n\nSo,\n\n- a\u00b3/3 + (sqrt(3)/6)a\u00b2 = a\u00b3 + 3a\u00b2b + 3ab\u00b2 + b\u00b3,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n- a\u00b3/3 - a\u00b3 + (sqrt(3)/6 a\u00b2 - 3a\u00b2b) - 3ab\u00b2 - b\u00b3 =0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nFor a\u00b3: (-1/3 -1)a\u00b3 = -4/3 a\u00b3,\n\nFor a\u00b2 terms: [ sqrt(3)/6 - 3b ] a\u00b2,\n\nFor a terms: -3 b\u00b2 a,\n\nConstants: -b\u00b3,\n\nThus,\n\n-4/3 a\u00b3 + ( sqrt(3)/6 - 3b )a\u00b2 - 3b\u00b2 a - b\u00b3 =0,\n\nBut b is a constant (1 - sqrt(3)/2),\n\nLet me plug in b =1 - sqrt(3)/2,\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n- (4/3)a\u00b3 + [ sqrt(3)/6 - 3(1 - sqrt(3)/2) ]a\u00b2 - 3(1 - sqrt(3)/2)^2 a - (1 - sqrt(3)/2)^3 =0.\n\nThis is a cubic equation in a. To have a double root, the cubic must have a repeated root. The condition for a cubic equation ax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d =0 to have a double root is that its discriminant is zero, but discriminant computation is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that the point C corresponds to a double root, so let me assume that a is a double root, so the cubic can be written as (a - k)^2 (ma + n) =0,\n\nBut this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can guess a value for a (or x) that satisfies both equations and the derivative condition.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the point C is somewhere between A and B. Let me try plugging in some values.\n\nWait, let me think about the parametrization of the envelope curve. The envelope is x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3. Let me see if there is a point along AB that satisfies this.\n\nLet me parameterize AB with a parameter s from 0 to1, so:\n\nx = (1/2)(1 - s),\n\ny = (sqrt(3)/2)s,\n\nas I did earlier.\n\nThen, substituting into the envelope equation:\n\nx\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3,\n\nSo,\n\n[ (1/2 (1 - s))\u00b2 ] * (sqrt(3)/2 s ) = [1 - (sqrt(3)/2 s )]^3,\n\nCompute left side:\n\n( (1 - s)^2 /4 ) * ( sqrt(3)/2 s ) = ( sqrt(3)/8 ) s (1 - s)^2,\n\nRight side:\n\n[1 - (sqrt(3)/2 s )]^3,\n\nSet them equal:\n\nsqrt(3)/8 * s (1 - s)^2 = [1 - (sqrt(3)/2 s )]^3,\n\nThis is an equation in s. We need to find s such that this holds, and also that the derivative condition is satisfied (tangency). Maybe solving this equation would give us the value of s corresponding to point C.\n\nThis still looks complicated, but perhaps we can make an intelligent substitution.\n\nLet me denote t = sqrt(3)/2 s,\n\nthen s = (2/sqrt(3)) t,\n\nand note that when s=0, t=0; s=1, t= sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866.\n\nThen, the left side becomes:\n\nsqrt(3)/8 * (2/sqrt(3) t) * (1 - (2/sqrt(3) t ))^2,\n\n= sqrt(3)/8 * (2/sqrt(3) t) * [1 - (2/sqrt(3) t)]^2,\n\n= (2/8) t [1 - (2/sqrt(3) t)]^2,\n\n= (1/4) t [1 - (2/sqrt(3) t)]^2,\n\nThe right side becomes:\n\n[1 - t]^3,\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\n(1/4) t [1 - (2/sqrt(3) t)]^2 = (1 - t)^3,\n\nHmm, still not obvious, but perhaps multiplying both sides by 4:\n\nt [1 - (2/sqrt(3) t)]^2 =4(1 - t)^3,\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\nFirst compute [1 - (2/sqrt(3) t)]^2 =1 - (4/sqrt(3)) t + (4/3) t\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nLeft side: t [1 - (4/sqrt(3)) t + (4/3) t\u00b2 ] = t - (4/sqrt(3)) t\u00b2 + (4/3) t^3,\n\nRight side:4(1 -3t +3t\u00b2 -t^3 )=4 -12 t +12 t\u00b2 -4 t^3,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nt - (4/sqrt(3)) t\u00b2 + (4/3) t^3 -4 +12 t -12 t\u00b2 +4 t^3 =0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nt terms: t +12t =13t,\n\nt\u00b2 terms: -4/sqrt(3) t\u00b2 -12 t\u00b2 = - [4/sqrt(3) +12 ] t\u00b2,\n\nt^3 terms: (4/3 +4 ) t^3 = (16/3) t^3,\n\nConstants: -4,\n\nSo,\n\n13t - [4/sqrt(3) +12] t\u00b2 + (16/3) t^3 -4 =0,\n\nThis is still a cubic equation.

Maybe another approach.\n\nLet me think back to the parametrization of the envelope as x = t\u00b3/(1 + t\u00b2), y =1/(1 + t\u00b2). The point C is the intersection of AB and the envelope where they are tangent. So we can parametrize the envelope with parameter t and find the value of t where the point (x,y) lies on AB and the tangent to the envelope at that point has slope -sqrt(3).\n\nFrom earlier, we had the derivative of the envelope is dy/dx = -2xy/[x\u00b2 + 3(1 - y)^2].\n\nSetting this equal to -sqrt(3):\n\n-2xy/[x\u00b2 + 3(1 - y)^2] = -sqrt(3),\n\n=> 2xy = sqrt(3)(x\u00b2 + 3(1 - y)^2).\n\nAdditionally, the point (x,y) lies on AB: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAnd on the envelope: x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3.\n\nLet me try substituting y from AB into the derivative condition equation.\n\nLet me write:\n\n2x y = sqrt(3)(x\u00b2 + 3(1 - y)^2).\n\nReplace y with -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nso,\n\n2x*(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) = sqrt(3)[x\u00b2 +3(1 - (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ))^2 ]\n\nLeft side:\n\n2x*(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) = -2 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + sqrt(3) x.\n\nRight side:\n\nsqrt(3)[x\u00b2 +3(1 + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b2 ]\n\nLet me compute the term inside the brackets:\n\nLet me denote inside the bracket as:\n\nx\u00b2 +3[1 + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2]^2,\n\nFirst compute the expression inside the square:\n\n1 + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2),\n\nLet me denote that as sqrt(3)x + c, where c =1 - sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThus,\n\n[ sqrt(3)x + c ]^2 = 3x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3)c x +c\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nthe term becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 +3*(3x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3)c x +c\u00b2 ) =x\u00b2 +9x\u00b2 +6 sqrt(3)c x +3c\u00b2=10x\u00b2 +6 sqrt(3)c x +3c\u00b2,\n\nTherefore, the right side is sqrt(3)*(10x\u00b2 +6 sqrt(3)c x +3c\u00b2).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nLeft side: -2 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 + sqrt(3)x,\n\nRight side: sqrt(3)*(10x\u00b2 +6 sqrt(3)c x +3c\u00b2),\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n-2x\u00b2 +x =10x\u00b2 +6 sqrt(3)c x +3c\u00b2,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-2x\u00b2 +x -10x\u00b2 -6 sqrt(3)c x -3c\u00b2 =0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-12x\u00b2 +x(1 -6 sqrt(3)c ) -3c\u00b2 =0,\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in x.\n\nRecall that c =1 - sqrt(3)/2,\n\nso let's compute coefficients:\n\nFirst coefficient: -12,\n\nSecond term: x*(1 -6 sqrt(3)c ) =x*(1 -6 sqrt(3)(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )),\n\nCompute inside:\n\n6 sqrt(3)(1) -6 sqrt(3)*(sqrt(3)/2 )=6 sqrt(3) -6*(3/2)=6 sqrt(3) -9,\n\nThus,\n\n1 - [6 sqrt(3) -9] =1 -6 sqrt(3) +9 =10 -6 sqrt(3),\n\nThird term: -3c\u00b2 = -3*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n-12x\u00b2 + (10 -6 sqrt(3))x -3*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b2 =0,\n\nLet me compute -3*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b2:\n\nFirst compute (1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b2 =1 - sqrt(3) + 3/4 = (1 + 3/4) - sqrt(3) =7/4 - sqrt(3),\n\nWait,\n\nWait, (a - b)^2 =a\u00b2 -2ab +b\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\n(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b2 =1\u00b2 -2*1*(sqrt(3)/2 ) + (sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b2 =1 - sqrt(3) + (3/4),\n\nThus,\n\n1 - sqrt(3) + 3/4 = (1 + 3/4) - sqrt(3) = 7/4 - sqrt(3),\n\nTherefore,\n\n-3*(7/4 - sqrt(3)) = -21/4 +3 sqrt(3),\n\nThus, the equation is:\n\n-12x\u00b2 + (10 -6 sqrt(3))x + (-21/4 +3 sqrt(3)) =0,\n\nMultiply all terms by 4 to eliminate fractions:\n\n-48x\u00b2 +4*(10 -6 sqrt(3))x + (-21 +12 sqrt(3)) =0,\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-48x\u00b2,\n\n4*(10 -6 sqrt(3))x =40x -24 sqrt(3)x,\n\n-21 +12 sqrt(3),\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\n-48x\u00b2 +40x -24 sqrt(3)x -21 +12 sqrt(3)=0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-48x\u00b2 + (40 -24 sqrt(3))x + (-21 +12 sqrt(3)) =0,\n\nThis quadratic equation in x can be solved using the quadratic formula.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n48x\u00b2 + (-40 +24 sqrt(3))x +21 -12 sqrt(3)=0,\n\nMultiply by -1,\n\n48x\u00b2 + (-40 +24 sqrt(3))x +21 -12 sqrt(3)=0,\n\nWait, actually, the equation is:\n\n-48x\u00b2 + (40 -24 sqrt(3))x + (-21 +12 sqrt(3)) =0,\n\nSo,\n\na= -48,\n\nb=40 -24 sqrt(3),\n\nc= -21 +12 sqrt(3),\n\nThus,\n\nx = [ -b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac) ]/(2a),\n\nCompute discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac,\n\nLet me compute:\n\nFirst, b =40 -24 sqrt(3),\n\nso b\u00b2 = (40)^2 + (24 sqrt(3))^2 - 2*40*24 sqrt(3),\n\n=1600 + 24\u00b2*3 - 1920 sqrt(3),\n\n24\u00b2=576, so 576*3=1728,\n\nThus,\n\nb\u00b2 =1600 +1728 -1920 sqrt(3)=3328 -1920 sqrt(3),\n\nThen, -4ac = -4*(-48)*( -21 +12 sqrt(3)),\n\nFirst compute -4*(-48)=192,\n\nThus,\n\n-4ac=192*( -21 +12 sqrt(3) )= -192*21 +192*12 sqrt(3),\n\n= -4032 +2304 sqrt(3),\n\nThus,\n\nD= b\u00b2 -4ac = (3328 -1920 sqrt(3)) + (-4032 +2304 sqrt(3)),\n\n= (3328 -4032) + (-1920 sqrt(3) +2304 sqrt(3)),\n\n= (-704) + (384 sqrt(3)),\n\nSo D= -704 +384 sqrt(3).\n\nHmm, sqrt(D) would be complicated. Maybe factor something out?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quadratic has a double root, so discriminant D must be zero? Wait, no, we already used the derivative condition, so this quadratic should have one solution (the x-coordinate of C). Since we derived this equation from the two conditions (slope and lying on AB and envelope), it should have exactly one solution. But discriminant is D= -704 +384 sqrt(3).\n\nCompute approximate value:\n\nsqrt(3)\u22481.732,\n\n384*1.732\u2248384*1.732\u2248665.1,\n\nThus, D\u2248-704 +665.1\u2248-38.9, which is negative? That can't be.\n\nWait, that suggests no real solution, which contradicts the problem's statement that such a point exists. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nThis indicates an error in my algebra steps. Let me retrace the steps where I might have messed up.\n\nStarting from the derivative condition equation:\n\n2xy = sqrt(3)(x\u00b2 + 3(1 - y)^2),\n\nthen substituting y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nLeft side:2x*(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 )\n\n= -2 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 + sqrt(3)x,\n\nRight side:sqrt(3)*(x\u00b2 +3*(1 - (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ))^2 )\n\nInside the brackets:1 + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2,\n\nSo squared term is (sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2 ))^2,\n\nExpanding that gives 3x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3)x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) + (1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2,\n\nThus,\n\nthe term inside the right side:\n\nx\u00b2 +3*[3x\u00b2 + 2 sqrt(3)x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) + (1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2 ]\n\n= x\u00b2 +9x\u00b2 +6 sqrt(3)x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) +3*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2,\n\n=10x\u00b2 +6 sqrt(3)x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) +3*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2,\n\nThen, multiplying by sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(3)*10x\u00b2 + sqrt(3)*6 sqrt(3)x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) + sqrt(3)*3*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2,\n\n=10 sqrt(3) x\u00b2 +6*3 x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) +3 sqrt(3)*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2,\n\n=10 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 +18x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) +3 sqrt(3)*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2,\n\nThus, the right side is:\n\n10 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 +18x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) +3 sqrt(3)*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2,\n\nTherefore, setting equal to left side:\n\n-2 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 + sqrt(3)x =10 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 +18x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) +3 sqrt(3)*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-2 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 + sqrt(3)x -10 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 -18x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) -3 sqrt(3)*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2 =0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nFor x\u00b2 terms: (-2 sqrt(3) -10 sqrt(3))x\u00b2 =-12 sqrt(3)x\u00b2,\n\nFor x terms: sqrt(3)x -18x*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 ) =x[ sqrt(3) -18 +9 sqrt(3) ] =x[10 sqrt(3) -18],\n\nConstants term: -3 sqrt(3)*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2,\n\nThus,\n\n-12 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 + (10 sqrt(3) -18)x -3 sqrt(3)*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )^2 =0,\n\nThis is different from what I had before. I must have made an error in the previous steps when expanding terms. Let's recalculate the constants properly.\n\nFirst, compute the constant term:\n\n-3 sqrt(3)*(1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b2.\n\nFirst compute (1 - sqrt(3)/2 )\u00b2 =1 - sqrt(3) + 3/4 = (7/4 - sqrt(3)),\n\nThus,\n\n-3 sqrt(3)*(7/4 - sqrt(3)) = -3 sqrt(3)*(7/4) +3 sqrt(3)*sqrt(3),\n\n= -21 sqrt(3)/4 + 9.\n\nThus,\n\nThe constant term is 9 - (21 sqrt(3))/4.\n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n\n-12 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 + (10 sqrt(3) -18)x +9 - (21 sqrt(3))/4 =0,\n\nMultiply all terms by 4 to eliminate fractions:\n\n-48 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 +4*(10 sqrt(3) -18)x +36 -21 sqrt(3) =0,\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: -48 sqrt(3)x\u00b2,\n\nSecond term:40 sqrt(3)x -72x,\n\nThird term:+36 -21 sqrt(3),\n\nThus,\n\n-48 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 + (40 sqrt(3) -72)x +36 -21 sqrt(3)=0,\n\nThis quadratic equation in x is still quite complex, but perhaps we can factor sqrt(3):\n\nLet me write terms involving sqrt(3):\n\n-48 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 +40 sqrt(3)x -21 sqrt(3),\n\nand the rest:\n\n-72x +36,\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(3)*(-48x\u00b2 +40x -21) + (-72x +36)=0,\n\nLet me factor terms:\n\nLet me see if I can factor the equation:\n\n-48 sqrt(3)x\u00b2 + (40 sqrt(3) -72)x + (36 -21 sqrt(3))=0,\n\nPerhaps factor terms with sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(3)*(-48x\u00b2 +40x -21) + (-72x +36)=0,\n\nLet me set this as:\n\nsqrt(3)*( -48x\u00b2 +40x -21 ) =72x -36,\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate sqrt(3), but this may introduce extraneous solutions.\n\nAlternatively, let me assume that x is of the form k/sqrt(3), but this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to find a solution by assuming x is a rational multiple or something.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that the equation can be factored.\n\nLet me write the equation as:\n\nsqrt(3)*(-48x\u00b2 +40x -21) =72x -36,\n\nMove all terms to left:\n\nsqrt(3)*(-48x\u00b2 +40x -21) -72x +36 =0,\n\nThis is still complicated.

Wait, but the line is in terms of 1/p and 1/q?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables p and q.\n\nLet me rewrite the equation h/p +k/q =1,\n\nMultiply both sides by pq: h q +k p = pq,\n\nRearrange: pq - h q -k p =0,\n\npq - h q -k p =0,\n\nLet me add hk to both sides: pq - h q -k p + hk = hk,\n\nFactor: (p - h)(q -k)= hk,\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider this as a linear equation in p and q:\n\nh q +k p = pq,\n\n=> pq -k p -h q =0,\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in two variables p and q.\n\nThe condition that this equation has exactly one solution on the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1 is that the system has a single solution, which would mean they are tangent.\n\nTo find the condition for tangency, we can use Lagrange multipliers or substitution.\n\nLet me use substitution.\n\nLet me parametrize p = cos\u03b8, q=sin\u03b8,\n\nthen the equation h q +k p = p q,\n\nbecomes h sin\u03b8 +k cos\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8,\n\nLet me write this as:\n\ncos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 - h sin\u03b8 -k cos\u03b8 =0,\n\nFactor terms:\n\nsin\u03b8 (cos\u03b8 - h) -k cos\u03b8 =0,\n\nHmm,\n\nAlternatively,\n\nLet me write everything in terms of tan\u03b8,\n\nLet me set t=tan\u03b8,\n\nthen sin\u03b8= t/sqrt(1+t\u00b2),\n\ncos\u03b8=1/sqrt(1+t\u00b2),\n\nSubstitute into equation:\n\nh*(t/sqrt(1+t\u00b2)) +k*(1/sqrt(1+t\u00b2)) = (t/sqrt(1+t\u00b2))*(1/sqrt(1+t\u00b2)),\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(1+t\u00b2):\n\nh t +k = t/(1 +t\u00b2),\n\nRearrange:\n\nh t +k - t/(1 +t\u00b2)=0,\n\nThis equation in t must have exactly one solution. Which would require that it's a tangent, so discriminant zero, but it's transcendental.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is that the quadratic equation obtained from substituting p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1 into the other equation has discriminant zero.\n\nLet me do that.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) h/p +k/q =1,\n\n2) p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1,\n\nLet me solve equation1 for q,\n\nFrom equation1: q = (k p)/(p -h),\n\nSubstitute into equation2:\n\np\u00b2 + [ (k p)/(p -h) ]^2 =1,\n\nMultiply both sides by (p -h)^2:\n\np\u00b2(p -h)^2 +k\u00b2 p\u00b2 = (p -h)^2,\n\nExpand p\u00b2(p -h)^2:\n\np\u00b2(p\u00b2 -2 h p +h\u00b2)= p^4 -2 h p^3 +h\u00b2 p\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\np^4 -2 h p^3 +h\u00b2 p\u00b2 +k\u00b2 p\u00b2 - (p -h)^2 =0,\n\nExpand (p -h)^2= p\u00b2 -2 h p +h\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\np^4 -2 h p^3 +h\u00b2 p\u00b2 +k\u00b2 p\u00b2 -p\u00b2 +2 h p -h\u00b2=0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\np^4 -2 h p^3 + (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 -1)p\u00b2 +2 h p -h\u00b2=0,\n\nThis quartic equation must have a double root for tangency. The condition is complicated, but perhaps for the system to have only one solution (the line AB), the point C must satisfy certain conditions related to the original triangle.\n\nAlternatively, since AB is itself a member of the family F when p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2,\n\nwhich satisfy p\u00b2 + q\u00b2= (1/4)+(3/4)=1,\n\nThus, AB is indeed a member of F.\n\nWe need that for point C on AB, there are no other segments in F passing through C except AB.\n\nSuppose there is another segment PQ in F passing through C. Then, the line PQ must intersect AB at C and possibly another point. But if C is such that this intersection is only at C, meaning the line is tangent to AB at C, but AB is straight, so the only way a line can intersect AB only at C is if the line is AB itself. Thus, C must be a point where any other line from F would intersect AB at another point, except AB.\n\nAlternatively, this is similar to the concept of an envelope, so the point C is where the envelope touches AB.\n\nEarlier, I derived the envelope equation x\u00b2 y=(1\u2212y)^3. The point C is the point of tangency between AB and this envelope.\n\nTo find the coordinates of C, I can set up the system of equations:\n\n1. y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 (equation of AB),\n\n2. x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3 (envelope equation),\n\n3. The derivative condition dy/dx = -sqrt(3) (slope of AB equals the envelope's slope at that point).\n\nWe can use equations 1 and 2 to solve for x and y, then verify with the third condition.\n\nLet me try solving equations 1 and 2 again carefully.\n\nFrom equation1: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nSubstitute into equation2:\n\nx\u00b2*(-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) = (1 - (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2))^3,\n\nLet me compute both sides:\n\nLeft side: -sqrt(3)x\u00b3 + (sqrt(3)/2)x\u00b2,\n\nRight side: [1 + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2]^3 = [sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2)]^3,\n\nLet me denote a = sqrt(3)x,\n\nand b =1 - sqrt(3)/2,\n\nthen right side is (a + b)^3 = a\u00b3 + 3a\u00b2b + 3ab\u00b2 + b\u00b3,\n\nLeft side: -sqrt(3)x\u00b3 + (sqrt(3)/2)x\u00b2 = -a\u00b3 + (a\u00b2)/2,\n\nThus,\n\nEquation becomes:\n\n-a\u00b3 + (a\u00b2)/2 = a\u00b3 +3a\u00b2b +3ab\u00b2 +b\u00b3,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-2a\u00b3 - (5a\u00b2)/2 -3ab\u00b2 -3ab\u00b2 -b\u00b3 =0,\n\nWait, no, let me recompute:\n\nLeft side minus right side:\n\n(-a\u00b3 + (a\u00b2)/2 ) - (a\u00b3 +3a\u00b2b +3ab\u00b2 +b\u00b3 )= -2a\u00b3 + (a\u00b2)/2 -3a\u00b2b -3ab\u00b2 -b\u00b3 =0,\n\nFactor terms:\n\n-2a\u00b3 -3a\u00b2b + (a\u00b2/2) -3ab\u00b2 -b\u00b3 =0,\n\nThis seems complicated, but substituting back a = sqrt(3)x,\n\nand b =1 - sqrt(3)/2,\n\nwe can attempt to find a solution.\n\nAlternatively, let me assume that the x-coordinate of C is such that the point is the centroid or some known point, but given the coordinates of A and B, centroid would be ( (0 +1/2 +0)/3, (0 +0 +sqrt(3)/2)/3 ), but that might not be it.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the envelope equation x\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3 can be rewritten as (x/y)^{2/3}*(y) = (1 - y)^2,\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nTake both sides to the power 1/3,\n\n(x\u00b2 y)^{1/3} = (1 - y),\n\n=> x^{2/3} y^{1/3} =1 - y,\n\nCube both sides:\n\nx\u00b2 y = (1 - y)^3,\n\nYes, same equation.\n\nPerhaps setting u =x^{2/3}, v = y^{1/3},\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me make substitution z =1 - y,\n\nthen y =1 - z,\n\nso the equation becomes x\u00b2(1 - z)= z\u00b3,\n\nand from AB equation,\n\ny = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nso,\n\n1 - z = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,\n\n=> z =1 + sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2,\n\nThus,\n\nz = sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2),\n\nSubstitute into envelope equation:\n\nx\u00b2(1 - z)= z^3,\n\n=> x\u00b2(1 - [sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2) ]) = [sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2)]^3,\n\nSimplify inside:\n\n1 - sqrt(3)x -1 + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)x,\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2(sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)x ) = [sqrt(3)x + (1 - sqrt(3)/2)]^3,\n\nFactor sqrt(3) from the left side:\n\nsqrt(3) x\u00b2 (1/2 -x ) = [sqrt(3)x + c]^3 where c=1 - sqrt(3)/2,\n\nThis still is complex.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps I can consider that the coordinates of C are (1/4, sqrt(3)/4), but let me check.\n\nLet me test point (1/4, sqrt(3)/4):\n\nCheck if it's on AB:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/4) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/4 + 2 sqrt(3)/4 )= sqrt(3)/4.

Wait, earlier that didn't satisfy the envelope equation, but let me try OC squared:\n\nIf point C were (1/4, sqrt(3)/4), then OC\u00b2 = (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 =1/16 +3/16=4/16=1/4, so 1/4 would give p+q=5, but I doubt that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, let's suppose the correct coordinates are (1/3, sqrt(3)/6):\n\nOC squared is (1/3)^2 + (sqrt(3)/6)^2=1/9 +1/12= (4 +3)/36=7/36, which gives 7+36=43.\n\nAlternatively, let's suppose the correct coordinates are (1/2,0) but that's point A.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the point C is the midpoint of AB.\n\nCoordinates of midpoint of AB: ( (0 +1/2)/2, (sqrt(3)/2 +0)/2 )=(1/4, sqrt(3)/4),\n\nBut as before, this doesn't satisfy the envelope equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coordinates are ( (sqrt(3)-1)/something ).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the envelope equation.\n\nLet me rederive the envelope equation.\n\nThe family of lines is x/p + y/q =1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1,\n\nParametrizing p=cos\u03b8, q=sin\u03b8,\n\nThus, lines are x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1,\n\nTo find the envelope, we take F(x,y,\u03b8)=x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 -1=0,\n\nThe envelope occurs where dF/d\u03b8=0,\n\nCompute derivative:\n\ndF/d\u03b8= x sin\u03b8/cos\u00b2\u03b8 -

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. Hmm, so we have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. We need to find a unique point C on segment AB (not A or B) that isn't part of any segment in F except AB itself. Then compute OC squared, which is p/q, and find p + q.\n\nFirst, let me visualize this. The points O, A, and B form a triangle. Since A is (1/2,0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the segment AB is part of this triangle. The family F consists of all unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. So, any such segment PQ would have P somewhere on the x-axis (so coordinates (p,0)) and Q on the y-axis (coordinates (0,q)), with the distance between them being 1. The equation for the distance between P and Q is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So all such segments lie on the unit circle, but only in the first quadrant with one endpoint on each axis.\n\nNow, the point C is on AB, not at A or B, and it's the only such point (other than on AB itself) that isn't on any other segment from F. So, in other words, any other segment in F that passes through C must be the segment AB itself. So C is a point that is only on AB and no other PQ segments from F. Since AB is part of F? Wait, actually, is AB part of F?\n\nWait, let me check: AB goes from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's compute the length of AB. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. Oh, so AB itself is a segment of unit length with endpoints on the axes, so AB is indeed part of the family F. So the problem is saying that there's another point C on AB (not A or B) which is not on any other segment from F except AB. So, for all other segments PQ in F, if C is on PQ, then PQ must be AB. So C is only on AB and no other PQ in F. So, we need to find such a point C.\n\nSo, the key is that for point C, if there exists any other segment PQ in F (other than AB) that contains C, then C is not the point we want. So the point C is such that any segment in F that contains C must be AB. So it's like a point that is only on AB and no other PQ in F.\n\nTo find such a point, perhaps we can parametrize AB and then see for a general point on AB, under what conditions it can lie on another PQ in F.\n\nFirst, let's parametrize segment AB. Let me write the parametric equations for AB. Since it goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's use a parameter t from 0 to 1. So:\n\nx = 1/2 - (1/2)t,\n\ny = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t,\n\nwhere t \u2208 [0,1]. So when t=0, we are at A, and t=1 at B. So any point C on AB can be written as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2)t ) for some t between 0 and 1, excluding t=0 and t=1 since we want points distinct from A and B.\n\nSo, suppose C is ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2)t ). Now, we need to ensure that this point C is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB. That is, if there exists another segment PQ in F (so PQ is a unit segment with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis) that passes through C, then PQ must be AB itself.\n\nAlternatively, if there exists another segment PQ (different from AB) in F that passes through C, then C is not the desired point. So the desired point C is such that the only PQ in F passing through it is AB. Therefore, to find such a point, we need to find a point on AB where any other PQ in F passing through C would have to coincide with AB. So, perhaps this point is where AB is tangent to some curve formed by the family F?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of all possible segments PQ in F as lines connecting (p,0) to (0,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. Each such segment can be represented by the equation (x/p) + (y/q) =1, since it's the line connecting (p,0) and (0,q). The condition is that the point C lies on such a line for some p and q with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, except when the line is AB itself. So, the problem reduces to finding a point C on AB such that the only (p,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 and (C's coordinates satisfy x/p + y/q =1) are the ones corresponding to AB.\n\nAlternatively, the point C must not lie on any such line except AB. So, for all other lines (p,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, except the one for AB, the point C does not lie on them. Therefore, the system of equations:\n\nx_C / p + y_C / q =1,\n\nand\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nshould have only one solution (p,q) corresponding to AB. So, if we can set up equations such that for C's coordinates, the above system has only the solution corresponding to AB, then C is our desired point.\n\nTherefore, let's denote coordinates of C as (x, y). Since C is on AB, we can parametrize it as before: x = (1/2)(1 - t), y = (sqrt(3)/2) t, for some t in (0,1). Then, we need that the only solution (p, q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 and x/p + y/q =1 is (p, q) corresponding to AB. Let's find what p and q are for AB.\n\nFor segment AB: point A is (1/2,0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Therefore, the equation of AB is x/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3)/2) =1. So, in the standard form, that is 2x + (2/sqrt(3)) y =1. So in terms of p and q, for AB, p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2. So, indeed, (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 =1, so that's valid.\n\nTherefore, the system of equations for point C must have only the solution p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2. To ensure that, when we plug in x and y (coordinates of C) into the equations x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, there is only one solution (p, q). So, we can set up these equations and find for which x and y (on AB) this system has a unique solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the equations:\n\nLet me denote x and y as coordinates of C. Since C is on AB, we can write x = (1/2)(1 - t), y = (sqrt(3)/2)t. Then, the equations become:\n\n( (1/2)(1 - t) ) / p + ( (sqrt(3)/2 t ) / q ) = 1,\n\nand\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe need this system to have only one solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, if we can find t such that the above equations have only that solution, then that t gives us point C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of this as follows: For a given point C(x,y), the set of lines PQ in F passing through C correspond to solutions (p, q) of x/p + y/q =1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. So, substituting q from the first equation into the second, perhaps?\n\nLet me try to substitute. From the first equation, x/p + y/q =1. Let's solve for q:\n\ny/q =1 - x/p => q = y / (1 - x/p).\n\nBut this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, let me let p and q be variables satisfying both equations. Let me consider the equations:\n\nEquation 1: x/p + y/q =1,\n\nEquation 2: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe can try to solve this system for p and q. Let me denote variables p and q. Let me rearrange Equation 1:\n\nx/p + y/q =1 => (x q + y p)/(p q) =1 => x q + y p = p q.\n\nSo, x q + y p = p q.\n\nLet me rearrange terms: p q - y p - x q =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor terms:\n\np(q - y) - x q =0. Not sure. Maybe better to express one variable in terms of another.\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for q in terms of p. Let's see:\n\nFrom Equation 1: x/p + y/q =1,\n\n=> y/q =1 - x/p,\n\n=> q = y / (1 - x/p) = y p / (p - x).\n\nSo, q = (y p)/(p - x).\n\nNow substitute into Equation 2: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 + [ (y p)/(p - x) ]\u00b2 =1.\n\nThis is an equation in p. Let me write it out:\n\np\u00b2 + (y\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(p - x)^2 =1.\n\nLet me factor out p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [1 + y\u00b2/(p - x)^2] =1.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps cross-multiplying terms:\n\nLet me denote equation:\n\np\u00b2 + (y\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(p - x)^2 =1.\n\nMultiply both sides by (p - x)^2 to eliminate denominator:\n\np\u00b2 (p - x)^2 + y\u00b2 p\u00b2 = (p - x)^2.\n\nHmm, this gives a quartic equation in p, which might be messy. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the system has a unique solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, if we plug in the coordinates of C into the equations, the system should have only that solution. Therefore, perhaps the point C is such that when we set up the equations for p and q, the resulting equation has a double root at p =1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAlternatively, the point C is where the line AB is tangent to the locus of midpoints or something? Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, think of all possible PQ segments in F as lines with intercepts (p,0) and (0,q) such that p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. The set of all such lines form a family of lines in the first quadrant. The envelope of these lines might form a curve, and the point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope? That might be a possibility. The envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. Let's try to compute the envelope.\n\nThe envelope of a family of curves is found by solving the system of the curve equation and the derivative with respect to the parameter. Here, the family can be parameterized by p (since q is determined by p via q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)), but since p and q are both variables subject to p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, perhaps we can parameterize by p, where p ranges from 0 to1, and q= sqrt(1 - p\u00b2).\n\nSo the family of lines is x/p + y/q =1, with q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2). Let me denote the parameter as p, so the equation becomes:\n\nx/p + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) =1.\n\nTo find the envelope, we can take the derivative of this equation with respect to p and set it equal to zero. Let me denote F(p, x, y) = x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) -1 =0.\n\nThe envelope occurs where F(p, x, y) =0 and dF/dp =0.\n\nCompute dF/dp:\n\ndF/dp = -x/p\u00b2 + y*( (1/2)(1 - p\u00b2)^(-3/2)*(2p) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= -x/p\u00b2 + y * ( p / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) )\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\n- x / p\u00b2 + y p / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) =0.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) =1,\n\n2. -x / p\u00b2 + y p / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) =0.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations. Let me denote equation 2:\n\n- x / p\u00b2 = - y p / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)\n\nWait, moving terms:\n\n- x / p\u00b2 = - ( y p ) / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nx / p\u00b2 = ( y p ) / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2 )\n\nThen,\n\nx / p\u00b2 = ( y p ) / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2 )\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nx = ( y p^3 ) / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2 )\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me see if I can express x and y from equation 1 and substitute here.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nx/p + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) =1,\n\nso,\n\nx = p [1 - y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ]\n\nHmm, perhaps substitute this into the expression for x from the second equation.\n\nWait, let me try to write equation 2 in terms of equation 1.\n\nLet me denote equation1: x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) =1,\n\nLet me denote sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) as q, so q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2). Then equation1 becomes x/p + y/q =1,\n\nand equation2 is -x/p\u00b2 + y p / q^3 =0.\n\nSo, equation2: -x/p\u00b2 + (y p)/ q^3 =0,\n\nLet me multiply equation1 by p: x + (y p)/q = p,\n\nSo, x = p - (y p)/q,\n\nNow plug this into equation2:\n\n- [ p - (y p)/q ] / p\u00b2 + (y p)/ q^3 =0,\n\nSimplify term1:\n\n- [1/p - y/(p q) ] + (y p)/ q^3 =0,\n\nMultiply through by p\u00b2 q^3 to eliminate denominators:\n\n- q^3 + y p q^2 + y p^3 =0,\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let me try substituting variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that the point C lies on both AB and the envelope of the family F. Since the envelope is the boundary of the region covered by all the segments PQ, then the point where AB is tangent to this envelope would be the point that is only on AB and the envelope. Since the envelope is the set of points where the lines are \"just touching\", so maybe that's the point C.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the point C is the point of tangency between AB and the envelope of the family F. Thus, solving for the envelope as above would give the envelope curve, and then intersecting that with AB would give the point C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is overcomplicating. Let me think of another approach.\n\nSuppose that the point C is such that there is only one line PQ in F passing through it (other than AB itself). Wait, but the problem states that C does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So actually, there are no other segments in F that pass through C. So, the only segment in F that passes through C is AB. So, the system of equations for p and q (with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 and x/p + y/q =1) must have only the solution (p, q)=(1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, when we set up the equations, the system must have only that solution.\n\nSo, suppose we have equations:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe can consider this as a system in variables p and q. For there to be only one solution (p, q)=(1/2, sqrt(3)/2), the system must have multiplicity two at that point, so the determinant of the Jacobian or something must be zero? Hmm, maybe another way.\n\nAlternatively, substituting q from the second equation into the first.\n\nWait, let me consider solving for p and q. Let me let\u2019s denote variables p and q, so that p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 and x/p + y/q =1. Let me treat x and y as constants (coordinates of point C). Let me try to write this as a system:\n\nEquation1: x/p + y/q =1,\n\nEquation2: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nLet me consider solving for p and q. Let me let\u2019s set variables u =1/p and v=1/q. Then Equation1 becomes x u + y v =1,\n\nand Equation2: (1/u\u00b2) + (1/v\u00b2)=1.\n\nHmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to express q from Equation1 in terms of p, then substitute into Equation2.\n\nFrom Equation1: x/p + y/q =1,\n\nso y/q =1 -x/p,\n\nso q = y/(1 -x/p).\n\nThen substitute into Equation2:\n\np\u00b2 + [ y/(1 -x/p) ]\u00b2 =1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\np\u00b2 + y\u00b2 / (1 -x/p)^2 =1.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator of the second term by p\u00b2 to make it easier:\n\np\u00b2 + (y\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(p -x)^2 =1.\n\nFactor out p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [1 + y\u00b2/(p -x)^2 ] =1.\n\nHmm, this equation must have only one solution p=1/2. Let me check when p=1/2:\n\nPlugging p=1/2 into the equation,\n\n( (1/2)^2 ) [1 + y\u00b2/( (1/2 -x)^2 ) ] =1,\n\nSo,\n\n1/4 [ 1 + y\u00b2/( (1/2 -x)^2 ) ] =1,\n\nWhich implies,\n\n1 + y\u00b2/( (1/2 -x)^2 ) =4,\n\nThus,\n\ny\u00b2/( (1/2 -x)^2 ) =3,\n\nSo,\n\ny/(1/2 -x)= \u00b1\u221a3,\n\nBut since we are in first quadrant, and x is between 0 and 1/2 (since C is on AB between A(1/2,0) and B(0,sqrt(3)/2)), so 1/2 -x is positive (since x is less than 1/2). Similarly, y is positive. So,\n\ny/( (1/2 -x) ) = sqrt(3),\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = sqrt(3)(1/2 -x).\n\nBut since point C is on AB, let's recall the parametrization of AB. Let me see:\n\nEarlier, we had parametrized C as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ). Let me check if this satisfies y = sqrt(3)(1/2 -x):\n\nLet x = (1/2)(1 - t),\n\nthen 1/2 -x =1/2 - (1/2)(1 -t)= (1/2)(1 - (1 -t))= (1/2)(t) = t/2,\n\nthen sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) = sqrt(3)*(t/2),\n\nand y is (sqrt(3)/2) t, so indeed y = sqrt(3)*(t/2). So yes, that equality holds for any point on AB. Therefore, this condition is automatically satisfied for any point on AB. Hmm, so that suggests that when we plug p=1/2 into the equation, it works for any point on AB. But we need the equation to have only p=1/2 as a solution.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the equation in p must have a double root at p=1/2. For that, the equation p\u00b2 [1 + y\u00b2/(p -x)^2 ] =1 must have a double root at p=1/2. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote f(p) = p\u00b2 [1 + y\u00b2/(p -x)^2 ] -1 =0.\n\nTo have a double root at p=1/2, f(1/2)=0 and f\u2019(1/2)=0.\n\nWe already know that f(1/2)=0 because when p=1/2, the point is on AB. So the first condition is satisfied for any point on AB. The second condition is that the derivative at p=1/2 must be zero. Let's compute the derivative f\u2019(p).\n\nFirst, write f(p) = p\u00b2 [1 + y\u00b2/(p -x)^2 ] -1.\n\nLet me compute f\u2019(p):\n\nf\u2019(p) = 2p [1 + y\u00b2/(p -x)^2 ] + p\u00b2 [ 0 + y\u00b2 * d/dp ( (p -x)^{-2} ) ]\n\nCompute the derivative inside:\n\nd/dp [ (p -x)^{-2} ] = -2 (p -x)^{-3}\n\nThus,\n\nf\u2019(p) = 2p [1 + y\u00b2/(p -x)^2 ] + p\u00b2 * y\u00b2 * [ -2/(p -x)^3 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 2p [1 + y\u00b2/(p -x)^2 ] - 2 p\u00b2 y\u00b2 / (p -x)^3\n\nFactor 2p:\n\n= 2p [ 1 + y\u00b2/(p -x)^2 - p y\u00b2 / (p -x)^3 ]\n\nLet me write all terms over (p -x)^3:\n\nFirst term inside the brackets:\n\n1 = (p -x)^3 / (p -x)^3,\n\nSecond term: y\u00b2/(p -x)^2 = y\u00b2 (p -x)/ (p -x)^3,\n\nThird term: - p y\u00b2 / (p -x)^3,\n\nThus,\n\nTotal:\n\n[ (p -x)^3 + y\u00b2 (p -x) - p y\u00b2 ] / (p -x)^3\n\nTherefore,\n\nf\u2019(p) = 2p [ ( (p -x)^3 + y\u00b2 (p -x) - p y\u00b2 ) / (p -x)^3 ) ]\n\nSimplify numerator of the fraction inside:\n\n(p -x)^3 + y\u00b2 (p -x - p )\n\nWait,\n\nWait, expanding:\n\n(p -x)^3 + y\u00b2 (p -x) - p y\u00b2\n\n= (p -x)^3 + y\u00b2 [ (p -x) - p ]\n\n= (p -x)^3 + y\u00b2 ( -x )\n\nSo,\n\n= (p -x)^3 - x y\u00b2\n\nTherefore,\n\nf\u2019(p) = 2p [ ( (p -x)^3 - x y\u00b2 ) / (p -x)^3 ) ]\n\nThus,\n\nf\u2019(p) = 2p [ 1 - (x y\u00b2)/( (p -x)^3 ) ]\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, the numerator was (p -x)^3 + y\u00b2 (p -x) - p y\u00b2,\n\nWait, let me expand step by step:\n\nFirst term: (p -x)^3,\n\nSecond term: y\u00b2 (p -x),\n\nThird term: - p y\u00b2,\n\nSo combining the second and third terms:\n\ny\u00b2 (p -x) - p y\u00b2 = y\u00b2 p - y\u00b2 x - p y\u00b2 = - y\u00b2 x,\n\nTherefore, total numerator is (p -x)^3 - x y\u00b2,\n\nYes, so the numerator is (p -x)^3 - x y\u00b2,\n\nTherefore, f\u2019(p) = 2p * [ ( (p -x)^3 - x y\u00b2 ) / (p -x)^3 ) ]\n\nTherefore, f\u2019(p) = 2p [ 1 - (x y\u00b2)/( (p -x)^3 ) ]\n\nHmm, okay. Now, to have f\u2019(1/2)=0,\n\nSet p=1/2,\n\nThus,\n\nf\u2019(1/2) = 2*(1/2) [ 1 - (x y\u00b2)/( ( (1/2) -x )^3 ) ]\n\n= [1 - (x y\u00b2)/( ( (1/2) -x )^3 ) ] =0.\n\nTherefore,\n\n1 = (x y\u00b2)/( ( (1/2) -x )^3 )\n\nThus,\n\n(x y\u00b2) = ( (1/2 -x )^3 )\n\nBut earlier, from the condition that y = sqrt(3)(1/2 -x), as derived from plugging p=1/2 into the equation, so let's substitute that in.\n\nSince y = sqrt(3)(1/2 -x),\n\nthen y\u00b2 = 3 (1/2 -x)^2,\n\nTherefore,\n\nx * 3 (1/2 -x)^2 = (1/2 -x)^3,\n\nDivide both sides by (1/2 -x)^2 (assuming 1/2 -x \u22600, which it is since x <1/2),\n\nSo,\n\n3x = (1/2 -x),\n\nThus,\n\n3x +x =1/2,\n\n4x =1/2,\n\nx=1/8,\n\nTherefore, x=1/8,\n\nThen, since y = sqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) = sqrt(3)(1/2 -1/8)= sqrt(3)(3/8)= (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nTherefore, the point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nNow, check if this is on AB. Let me see:\n\nAB is parametrized as x=(1/2)(1 -t), y=(sqrt(3)/2) t.\n\nSet x=1/8,\n\n(1/2)(1 - t)=1/8,\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 1 -t=1/4,\n\nThus, t= 3/4,\n\nThen y= (sqrt(3)/2)(3/4)= (3 sqrt(3))/8, which matches. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of C are (1/8, 3\u221a3/8). Now compute OC squared.\n\nOC squared is (1/8)^2 + (3\u221a3/8)^2,\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/8)^2 =1/64,\n\n(3\u221a3/8)^2= 9*3 /64 =27/64,\n\nSum: (1 +27)/64 =28/64 =7/16.\n\nWait, 1 +27 is 28? Wait, 1 +27 is 28, yes. 28/64 reduces to 7/16. So OC\u00b2=7/16.\n\nBut 7 and 16 are coprime, so p=7, q=16, so p + q=23.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me verify the calculation again.\n\nOC squared is (1/8)^2 + ( (3\u221a3)/8 )^2.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(1/8)^2 =1/64,\n\n(3\u221a3 /8)^2 =9*(3)/64 =27/64,\n\nAdding them: 1 +27=28, so 28/64 =7/16. Yes, so 7/16. 7+16=23. Therefore the answer is 23.\n\nBut wait, let me check the logic again because I might have made a mistake in assuming that the derivative being zero gives the double root. Let me confirm that with the point C at (1/8, 3\u221a3/8), there are no other segments PQ in F passing through it except AB.\n\nSuppose there is another segment PQ in F passing through C. Then, the equations x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 must have another solution besides p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2. But according to the calculation above, when we set the derivative to zero, we found that this point is exactly where the system has a double root, so the only solution is p=1/2. Therefore, there are no other solutions, so that point is indeed only on AB. So this must be the correct point.\n\nTherefore, OC squared is 7/16, so 7 +16=23.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify with another approach just to be sure.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nSuppose we parametrize point C on AB as ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2) t ), where t is between 0 and1. So x=(1 - t)/2, y=(sqrt(3)/2)t.\n\nWe need that the only line in F through C is AB. For another line in F through C, there must exist some p and q with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 and ( (1 - t)/2 )/p + ( (sqrt(3)/2 t ) / q ) =1.\n\nWe need that this equation only holds when p=1/2 and q= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me suppose that there is another solution p\u22601/2, then the system must have another solution. To prevent this, the system must have only one solution, which requires that the equations are dependent only at that point. The previous method using envelope and derivative gives the point where the system has a double root, so that's the only solution. So the calculation seems consistent.\n\nThus, I think the answer is 23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{23}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. Hmm, so we have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. We need to find a unique point C on segment AB (not A or B) that isn't part of any segment in F except AB itself. Then compute OC squared, which is p/q, and find p + q.\n\nFirst, let me visualize this. The points O, A, and B form a triangle. Since A is (1/2,0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the segment AB is part of this triangle. The family F consists of all unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. So, any such segment PQ would have P somewhere on the x-axis (so coordinates (p,0)) and Q on the y-axis (coordinates (0,q)), with the distance between them being 1. The equation for the distance between P and Q is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So all such segments lie on the unit circle, but only in the first quadrant with one endpoint on each axis.\n\nNow, the point C is on AB, not at A or B, and it's the only such point (other than on AB itself) that isn't on any other segment from F. So, in other words, any other segment in F that passes through C must be the segment AB itself. So C is a point that is only on AB and no other PQ segments from F. Since AB is part of F? Wait, actually, is AB part of F?\n\nWait, let me check: AB goes from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's compute the length of AB. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. Oh, so AB itself is a segment of unit length with endpoints on the axes, so AB is indeed part of the family F. So the problem is saying that there's another point C on AB (not A or B) which is not on any other segment from F except AB. So, for all other segments PQ in F, if C is on PQ, then PQ must be AB. So C is only on AB and no other PQ in F. So, we need to find such a point C.\n\nSo, the key is that for point C, if there exists any other segment PQ in F (other than AB) that contains C, then C is not the point we want. So the point C is such that any segment in F that contains C must be AB. So it's like a point that is only on AB and no other PQ in F.\n\nTo find such a point, perhaps we can parametrize AB and then see for a general point on AB, under what conditions it can lie on another PQ in F.\n\nFirst, let's parametrize segment AB. Let me write the parametric equations for AB. Since it goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's use a parameter t from 0 to 1. So:\n\nx = 1/2 - (1/2)t,\n\ny = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t,\n\nwhere t \u2208 [0,1]. So when t=0, we are at A, and t=1 at B. So any point C on AB can be written as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2)t ) for some t between 0 and 1, excluding t=0 and t=1 since we want points distinct from A and B.\n\nSo, suppose C is ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2)t ). Now, we need to ensure that this point C is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB. That is, if there exists another segment PQ in F (so PQ is a unit segment with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis) that passes through C, then PQ must be AB itself.\n\nAlternatively, if there exists another segment PQ (different from AB) in F that passes through C, then C is not the desired point. So the desired point C is such that the only PQ in F passing through it is AB. Therefore, to find such a point, we need to find a point on AB where any other PQ in F passing through C would have to coincide with AB. So, perhaps this point is where AB is tangent to some curve formed by the family F?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of all possible segments PQ in F as lines connecting (p,0) to (0,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. Each such segment can be represented by the equation (x/p) + (y/q) =1, since it's the line connecting (p,0) and (0,q). The condition is that the point C lies on such a line for some p and q with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, except when the line is AB itself. So, the problem reduces to finding a point C on AB such that the only (p,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 and (C's coordinates satisfy x/p + y/q =1) are the ones corresponding to AB.\n\nAlternatively, the point C must not lie on any such line except AB. So, for all other lines (p,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, except the one for AB, the point C does not lie on them. Therefore, the system of equations:\n\nx_C / p + y_C / q =1,\n\nand\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nshould have only one solution (p,q) corresponding to AB. So, if we can set up equations such that for C's coordinates, the above system has only the solution corresponding to AB, then C is our desired point.\n\nTherefore, let's denote coordinates of C as (x, y). Since C is on AB, we can parametrize it as before: x = (1/2)(1 - t), y = (sqrt(3)/2) t, for some t in (0,1). Then, we need that the only solution (p, q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 and x/p + y/q =1 is (p, q) corresponding to AB. Let's find what p and q are for AB.\n\nFor segment AB: point A is (1/2,0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Therefore, the equation of AB is x/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3)/2) =1. So, in the standard form, that is 2x + (2/sqrt(3)) y =1. So in terms of p and q, for AB, p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2. So, indeed, (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 =1, so that's valid.\n\nTherefore, the system of equations for point C must have only the solution p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2. To ensure that, when we plug in x and y (coordinates of C) into the equations x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, there is only one solution (p, q). So, we can set up these equations and find for which x and y (on AB) this system has a unique solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the equations:\n\nLet me denote x and y as coordinates of C. Since C is on AB, we can write x = (1/2)(1 - t), y = (sqrt(3)/2)t. Then, the equations become:\n\n( (1/2)(1 - t) ) / p + ( (sqrt(3)/2 t ) / q ) = 1,\n\nand\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe need this system to have only one solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, if we can find t such that the above equations have only that solution, then that t gives us point C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of this as follows: For a given point C(x,y), the set of lines PQ in F passing through C correspond to solutions (p, q) of x/p + y/q =1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. So, substituting q from the first equation into the second, perhaps?\n\nLet me try to substitute. From the first equation, x/p + y/q =1. Let's solve for q:\n\ny/q =1 - x/p => q = y / (1 - x/p).\n\nBut this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, let me let p and q be variables satisfying both equations. Let me consider the equations:\n\nEquation 1: x/p + y/q =1,\n\nEquation 2: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe can try to solve this system for p and q. Let me denote variables p and q. Let me rearrange Equation 1:\n\nx/p + y/q =1 => (x q + y p)/(p q) =1 => x q + y p = p q.\n\nSo, x q + y p = p q.\n\nLet me rearrange terms: p q - y p - x q =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor terms:\n\np(q - y) - x q =0. Not sure. Maybe better to express one variable in terms of another.\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for q in terms of p. Let's see:\n\nFrom Equation 1: x/p + y/q =1,\n\n=> y/q =1 - x/p,\n\n=> q = y / (1 - x/p) = y p / (p - x).\n\nSo, q = (y p)/(p - x).\n\nNow substitute into Equation 2: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 + [ (y p)/(p - x) ]\u00b2 =1.\n\nThis is an equation in p. Let me write it out:\n\np\u00b2 + (y\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(p - x)^2 =1.\n\nLet me factor out p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [1 + y\u00b2/(p - x)^2] =1.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps cross-multiplying terms:\n\nLet me denote equation:\n\np\u00b2 + (y\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(p - x)^2 =1.\n\nMultiply both sides by (p - x)^2 to eliminate denominator:\n\np\u00b2 (p - x)^2 + y\u00b2 p\u00b2 = (p - x)^2.\n\nHmm, this gives a quartic equation in p, which might be messy. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the system has a unique solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, if we plug in the coordinates of C into the equations, the system should have only that solution. Therefore, perhaps the point C is such that when we set up the equations for p and q, the resulting equation has a double root at p =1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAlternatively, the point C is where the line AB is tangent to the locus of midpoints or something? Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, think of all possible PQ segments in F as lines with intercepts (p,0) and (0,q) such that p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. The set of all such lines form a family of lines in the first quadrant. The envelope of these lines might form a curve, and the point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope? That might be a possibility. The envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. Let's try to compute the envelope.\n\nThe envelope of a family of curves is found by solving the system of the curve equation and the derivative with respect to the parameter. Here, the family can be parameterized by p (since q is determined by p via q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2)), but since p and q are both variables subject to p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, perhaps we can parameterize by p, where p ranges from 0 to1, and q= sqrt(1 - p\u00b2).\n\nSo the family of lines is x/p + y/q =1, with q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2). Let me denote the parameter as p, so the equation becomes:\n\nx/p + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) =1.\n\nTo find the envelope, we can take the derivative of this equation with respect to p and set it equal to zero. Let me denote F(p, x, y) = x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) -1 =0.\n\nThe envelope occurs where F(p, x, y) =0 and dF/dp =0.\n\nCompute dF/dp:\n\ndF/dp = -x/p\u00b2 + y*( (1/2)(1 - p\u00b2)^(-3/2)*(2p) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= -x/p\u00b2 + y * ( p / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) )\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\n- x / p\u00b2 + y p / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) =0.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) =1,\n\n2. -x / p\u00b2 + y p / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2) =0.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations. Let me denote equation 2:\n\n- x / p\u00b2 = - y p / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2)\n\nWait, moving terms:\n\n- x / p\u00b2 = - ( y p ) / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nx / p\u00b2 = ( y p ) / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2 )\n\nThen,\n\nx / p\u00b2 = ( y p ) / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2 )\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nx = ( y p^3 ) / (1 - p\u00b2)^(3/2 )\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me see if I can express x and y from equation 1 and substitute here.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nx/p + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) =1,\n\nso,\n\nx = p [1 - y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) ]\n\nHmm, perhaps substitute this into the expression for x from the second equation.\n\nWait, let me try to write equation 2 in terms of equation 1.\n\nLet me denote equation1: x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) =1,\n\nLet me denote sqrt(1 - p\u00b2) as q, so q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2). Then equation1 becomes x/p + y/q =1,\n\nand equation2 is -x/p\u00b2 + y p / q^3 =0.\n\nSo, equation2: -x/p\u00b2 + (y p)/ q^3 =0,\n\nLet me multiply equation1 by p: x + (y p)/q = p,\n\nSo, x = p - (y p)/q,\n\nNow plug this into equation2:\n\n- [ p - (y p)/q ] / p\u00b2 + (y p)/ q^3 =0,\n\nSimplify term1:\n\n- [1/p - y/(p q) ] + (y p)/ q^3 =0,\n\nMultiply through by p\u00b2 q^3 to eliminate denominators:\n\n- q^3 + y p q^2 + y p^3 =0,\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let me try substituting variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that the point C lies on both AB and the envelope of the family F. Since the envelope is the boundary of the region covered by all the segments PQ, then the point where AB is tangent to this envelope would be the point that is only on AB and the envelope. Since the envelope is the set of points where the lines are \"just touching\", so maybe that's the point C.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the point C is the point of tangency between AB and the envelope of the family F. Thus, solving for the envelope as above would give the envelope curve, and then intersecting that with AB would give the point C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is overcomplicating. Let me think of another approach.\n\nSuppose that the point C is such that there is only one line PQ in F passing through it (other than AB itself). Wait, but the problem states that C does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So actually, there are no other segments in F that pass through C. So, the only segment in F that passes through C is AB. So, the system of equations for p and q (with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 and x/p + y/q =1) must have only the solution (p, q)=(1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, when we set up the equations, the system must have only that solution.\n\nSo, suppose we have equations:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe can consider this as a system in variables p and q. For there to be only one solution (p, q)=(1/2, sqrt(3)/2), the system must have multiplicity two at that point, so the determinant of the Jacobian or something must be zero? Hmm, maybe another way.\n\nAlternatively, substituting q from the second equation into the first.\n\nWait, let me consider solving for p and q. Let me let\u2019s denote variables p and q, so that p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 and x/p + y/q =1. Let me treat x and y as constants (coordinates of point C). Let me try to write this as a system:\n\nEquation1: x/p + y/q =1,\n\nEquation2: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nLet me consider solving for p and q. Let me let\u2019s set variables u =1/p and v=1/q. Then Equation1 becomes x u + y v =1,\n\nand Equation2: (1/u\u00b2) + (1/v\u00b2)=1.\n\nHmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to express q from Equation1 in terms of p, then substitute into Equation2.\n\nFrom Equation1: x/p + y/q =1,\n\nso y/q =1 -x/p,\n\nso q = y/(1 -x/p).\n\nThen substitute into Equation2:\n\np\u00b2 + [ y/(1 -x/p) ]\u00b2 =1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\np\u00b2 + y\u00b2 / (1 -x/p)^2 =1.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator of the second term by p\u00b2 to make it easier:\n\np\u00b2 + (y\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(p -x)^2 =1.\n\nFactor out p\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 [1 + y\u00b2/(p -x)^2 ] =1.\n\nHmm, this equation must have only one solution p=1/2. Let me check when p=1/2:\n\nPlugging p=1/2 into the equation,\n\n( (1/2)^2 ) [1 + y\u00b2/( (1/2 -x)^2 ) ] =1,\n\nSo,\n\n1/4 [ 1 + y\u00b2/( (1/2 -x)^2 ) ] =1,\n\nWhich implies,\n\n1 + y\u00b2/( (1/2 -x)^2 ) =4,\n\nThus,\n\ny\u00b2/( (1/2 -x)^2 ) =3,\n\nSo,\n\ny/(1/2 -x)= \u00b1\u221a3,\n\nBut since we are in first quadrant, and x is between 0 and 1/2 (since C is on AB between A(1/2,0) and B(0,sqrt(3)/2)), so 1/2 -x is positive (since x is less than 1/2). Similarly, y is positive. So,\n\ny/( (1/2 -x) ) = sqrt(3),\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = sqrt(3)(1/2 -x).\n\nBut since point C is on AB, let's recall the parametrization of AB. Let me see:\n\nEarlier, we had parametrized C as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ). Let me check if this satisfies y = sqrt(3)(1/2 -x):\n\nLet x = (1/2)(1 - t),\n\nthen 1/2 -x =1/2 - (1/2)(1 -t)= (1/2)(1 - (1 -t))= (1/2)(t) = t/2,\n\nthen sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) = sqrt(3)*(t/2),\n\nand y is (sqrt(3)/2) t, so indeed y = sqrt(3)*(t/2). So yes, that equality holds for any point on AB. Therefore, this condition is automatically satisfied for any point on AB. Hmm, so that suggests that when we plug p=1/2 into the equation, it works for any point on AB. But we need the equation to have only p=1/2 as a solution.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the equation in p must have a double root at p=1/2. For that, the equation p\u00b2 [1 + y\u00b2/(p -x)^2 ] =1 must have a double root at p=1/2. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote f(p) = p\u00b2 [1 + y\u00b2/(p -x)^2 ] -1 =0.\n\nTo have a double root at p=1/2, f(1/2)=0 and f\u2019(1/2)=0.\n\nWe already know that f(1/2)=0 because when p=1/2, the point is on AB. So the first condition is satisfied for any point on AB. The second condition is that the derivative at p=1/2 must be zero. Let's compute the derivative f\u2019(p).\n\nFirst, write f(p) = p\u00b2 [1 + y\u00b2/(p -x)^2 ] -1.\n\nLet me compute f\u2019(p):\n\nf\u2019(p) = 2p [1 + y\u00b2/(p -x)^2 ] + p\u00b2 [ 0 + y\u00b2 * d/dp ( (p -x)^{-2} ) ]\n\nCompute the derivative inside:\n\nd/dp [ (p -x)^{-2} ] = -2 (p -x)^{-3}\n\nThus,\n\nf\u2019(p) = 2p [1 + y\u00b2/(p -x)^2 ] + p\u00b2 * y\u00b2 * [ -2/(p -x)^3 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 2p [1 + y\u00b2/(p -x)^2 ] - 2 p\u00b2 y\u00b2 / (p -x)^3\n\nFactor 2p:\n\n= 2p [ 1 + y\u00b2/(p -x)^2 - p y\u00b2 / (p -x)^3 ]\n\nLet me write all terms over (p -x)^3:\n\nFirst term inside the brackets:\n\n1 = (p -x)^3 / (p -x)^3,\n\nSecond term: y\u00b2/(p -x)^2 = y\u00b2 (p -x)/ (p -x)^3,\n\nThird term: - p y\u00b2 / (p -x)^3,\n\nThus,\n\nTotal:\n\n[ (p -x)^3 + y\u00b2 (p -x) - p y\u00b2 ] / (p -x)^3\n\nTherefore,\n\nf\u2019(p) = 2p [ ( (p -x)^3 + y\u00b2 (p -x) - p y\u00b2 ) / (p -x)^3 ) ]\n\nSimplify numerator of the fraction inside:\n\n(p -x)^3 + y\u00b2 (p -x - p )\n\nWait,\n\nWait, expanding:\n\n(p -x)^3 + y\u00b2 (p -x) - p y\u00b2\n\n= (p -x)^3 + y\u00b2 [ (p -x) - p ]\n\n= (p -x)^3 + y\u00b2 ( -x )\n\nSo,\n\n= (p -x)^3 - x y\u00b2\n\nTherefore,\n\nf\u2019(p) = 2p [ ( (p -x)^3 - x y\u00b2 ) / (p -x)^3 ) ]\n\nThus,\n\nf\u2019(p) = 2p [ 1 - (x y\u00b2)/( (p -x)^3 ) ]\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, the numerator was (p -x)^3 + y\u00b2 (p -x) - p y\u00b2,\n\nWait, let me expand step by step:\n\nFirst term: (p -x)^3,\n\nSecond term: y\u00b2 (p -x),\n\nThird term: - p y\u00b2,\n\nSo combining the second and third terms:\n\ny\u00b2 (p -x) - p y\u00b2 = y\u00b2 p - y\u00b2 x - p y\u00b2 = - y\u00b2 x,\n\nTherefore, total numerator is (p -x)^3 - x y\u00b2,\n\nYes, so the numerator is (p -x)^3 - x y\u00b2,\n\nTherefore, f\u2019(p) = 2p * [ ( (p -x)^3 - x y\u00b2 ) / (p -x)^3 ) ]\n\nTherefore, f\u2019(p) = 2p [ 1 - (x y\u00b2)/( (p -x)^3 ) ]\n\nHmm, okay. Now, to have f\u2019(1/2)=0,\n\nSet p=1/2,\n\nThus,\n\nf\u2019(1/2) = 2*(1/2) [ 1 - (x y\u00b2)/( ( (1/2) -x )^3 ) ]\n\n= [1 - (x y\u00b2)/( ( (1/2) -x )^3 ) ] =0.\n\nTherefore,\n\n1 = (x y\u00b2)/( ( (1/2) -x )^3 )\n\nThus,\n\n(x y\u00b2) = ( (1/2 -x )^3 )\n\nBut earlier, from the condition that y = sqrt(3)(1/2 -x), as derived from plugging p=1/2 into the equation, so let's substitute that in.\n\nSince y = sqrt(3)(1/2 -x),\n\nthen y\u00b2 = 3 (1/2 -x)^2,\n\nTherefore,\n\nx * 3 (1/2 -x)^2 = (1/2 -x)^3,\n\nDivide both sides by (1/2 -x)^2 (assuming 1/2 -x \u22600, which it is since x <1/2),\n\nSo,\n\n3x = (1/2 -x),\n\nThus,\n\n3x +x =1/2,\n\n4x =1/2,\n\nx=1/8,\n\nTherefore, x=1/8,\n\nThen, since y = sqrt(3)(1/2 -x ) = sqrt(3)(1/2 -1/8)= sqrt(3)(3/8)= (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nTherefore, the point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nNow, check if this is on AB. Let me see:\n\nAB is parametrized as x=(1/2)(1 -t), y=(sqrt(3)/2) t.\n\nSet x=1/8,\n\n(1/2)(1 - t)=1/8,\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 1 -t=1/4,\n\nThus, t= 3/4,\n\nThen y= (sqrt(3)/2)(3/4)= (3 sqrt(3))/8, which matches. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of C are (1/8, 3\u221a3/8). Now compute OC squared.\n\nOC squared is (1/8)^2 + (3\u221a3/8)^2,\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/8)^2 =1/64,\n\n(3\u221a3/8)^2= 9*3 /64 =27/64,\n\nSum: (1 +27)/64 =28/64 =7/16.\n\nWait, 1 +27 is 28? Wait, 1 +27 is 28, yes. 28/64 reduces to 7/16. So OC\u00b2=7/16.\n\nBut 7 and 16 are coprime, so p=7, q=16, so p + q=23.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me verify the calculation again.\n\nOC squared is (1/8)^2 + ( (3\u221a3)/8 )^2.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(1/8)^2 =1/64,\n\n(3\u221a3 /8)^2 =9*(3)/64 =27/64,\n\nAdding them: 1 +27=28, so 28/64 =7/16. Yes, so 7/16. 7+16=23. Therefore the answer is 23.\n\nBut wait, let me check the logic again because I might have made a mistake in assuming that the derivative being zero gives the double root. Let me confirm that with the point C at (1/8, 3\u221a3/8), there are no other segments PQ in F passing through it except AB.\n\nSuppose there is another segment PQ in F passing through C. Then, the equations x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 must have another solution besides p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2. But according to the calculation above, when we set the derivative to zero, we found that this point is exactly where the system has a double root, so the only solution is p=1/2. Therefore, there are no other solutions, so that point is indeed only on AB. So this must be the correct point.\n\nTherefore, OC squared is 7/16, so 7 +16=23.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify with another approach just to be sure.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nSuppose we parametrize point C on AB as ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2) t ), where t is between 0 and1. So x=(1 - t)/2, y=(sqrt(3)/2)t.\n\nWe need that the only line in F through C is AB. For another line in F through C, there must exist some p and q with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 and ( (1 - t)/2 )/p + ( (sqrt(3)/2 t ) / q ) =1.\n\nWe need that this equation only holds when p=1/2 and q= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me suppose that there is another solution p\u22601/2, then the system must have another solution. To prevent this, the system must have only one solution, which requires that the equations are dependent only at that point. The previous method using envelope and derivative gives the point where the system has a double root, so that's the only solution. So the calculation seems consistent.\n\nThus, I think the answer is 23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{23}\n\n\nGiven points \\( O(0,0) \\), \\( A\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right) \\), and \\( B\\left(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\), we need to find a unique point \\( C \\) on segment \\( \\overline{AB} \\) that does not belong to any segment from the family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) except \\( \\overline{AB} \\).
