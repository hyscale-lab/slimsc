      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many numbers n \u2264 2024 where Bob can force a win no matter what Alice does. Hmm, so Bob has a winning strategy for those n. \n\nFirst, maybe I should figure out for small values of n who would win. Let me start with n=1. If there's 1 token, Alice takes it and wins. So n=1 is a losing position for Bob. \n\nn=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob has to take the last one and win. Wait, no, if Alice takes 1 from 2, then Bob is left with 1 and can take it to win. Wait, but that would mean Bob wins? Wait, but Alice went first. Let me think again. If n=2, Alice's options are to take 1 or 4. But she can't take 4, so she takes 1. Then Bob is left with 1, so he takes it and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. Wait, so n=2 is a winning position for Bob? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, actually, the player who takes the last token wins. So if Alice takes 1 from n=2, Bob takes the last one and wins. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position for the first player (Alice), so Bob can win. So n=2 is a \"good\" n for Bob.\n\nn=3: Alice can take 1, leaving 2. Then Bob is in the same situation as above. Bob can take 1, leaving 1 for Alice, who then takes it and wins. Wait, so if Alice takes 1 from 3, leaving 2, then Bob's move: he can take 1 from 2, leaving 1 for Alice. Then Alice takes the last one and wins. Alternatively, Bob could take 4, but he can't. So Bob must take 1, leading to Alice's win. Alternatively, if Alice takes 1 from 3, Bob can only take 1, so Alice can win. Alternatively, maybe Alice can choose another move? Wait, from n=3, Alice can only take 1 or 4, but 4 is too many, so she can only take 1. Then Bob is left with 2, and as above, Bob can take 1, but that leaves 1 for Alice. Wait, so Bob can't force a win here. Wait, so maybe n=3 is a winning position for Alice? Let me check again.\n\nWait, if n=3, Alice takes 1, leaving 2. Then Bob's options are to take 1 or 4. He can only take 1, leaving 1 for Alice. Then Alice takes the last one and wins. So Bob can't win here. Alternatively, if Alice takes 1, Bob is forced into a losing position? Hmm, so maybe n=3 is a winning position for Alice. Therefore, Bob can't force a win here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Alice could have another strategy. Wait, no, she can only take 1. So n=3 is a win for Alice. \n\nn=4: Alice can take all 4 and win immediately. So n=4 is a win for Alice. \n\nn=5: Alice can take 1, leaving 4 for Bob. Then Bob can take all 4 and win. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4, leaving 1 for Bob, Bob takes it and wins. So no matter what Alice does, Bob can win. Wait, so n=5 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. So n=5 is a good n for Bob.\n\nWait, let me confirm. If n=5, Alice's options: take 1, leaving 4 for Bob (Bob takes 4 and wins). Or Alice takes 4, leaving 1 for Bob (Bob takes 1 and wins). So either way, Bob can win. Therefore n=5 is a losing position for the first player (Alice), so Bob can win. \n\nn=6: Let's see. Alice can take 1, leaving 5. Then Bob is in a position where he can win, as we saw with n=5. Wait, so if Alice leaves Bob at n=5, Bob can win. Therefore, Alice would not want to do that. Alternatively, maybe Alice can choose another move. From n=6, Alice can take 1 or 4. If she takes 4, leaving 2. Then Bob is left with 2, which as in n=2, Bob can take 1, leaving 1 for Alice. Wait, but Bob can take 1 from 2, leaving 1, so Alice takes the last one. Wait, so if Alice takes 4 from 6, leaving 2, then Bob can take 1, leaving 1 for Alice. Then Alice takes the last one and wins. Alternatively, Bob could take 4 from 2? No, he can't. So Bob must take 1, leading to Alice's win. Therefore, if Alice takes 4 from 6, Bob is forced into a position where Alice can win. Alternatively, if Alice takes 1 from 6, leaving 5, then Bob can win. Therefore, Alice can choose between leaving Bob at 5 (which is bad for her) or leaving Bob at 2 (which is also bad for her? Wait, no. Wait, when Alice takes 4, leaving 2, Bob is left with 2. Then Bob can take 1, leaving 1 for Alice. Then Alice takes the last token. So that's bad for Bob. Wait, but if Bob is left with 2, he can choose to take 1, but then Alice gets the last. Alternatively, Bob can take 1, but that's the only option. Wait, so in that case, Bob can't force a win. Hmm, so if Alice takes 4, Bob is left with 2, which is a position where Bob can't force a win? Wait, but earlier, n=2 was a losing position for the first player, which would be Alice in that case. Wait, but here Bob is the second player. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the initial player is Alice. For n=6:\n\nIf Alice takes 1, leaving 5. Then Bob is the next player, and he can win (as n=5 is a losing position for the first player, which is now Bob? Wait no, n=5 is a losing position for the first player. Wait, when Alice takes 1 from 6 to leave 5, then Bob is now the first player for the n=5 game. Since n=5 is a losing position for the first player, Bob would lose. Wait, so that would be good for Alice. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to formalize this as a recursive problem.\n\nPerhaps I should model this as a losing or winning position. Let me define:\n\nA position is a losing position if the current player cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.\n\nA position is a winning position if the current player can force a win.\n\nSo, for n=0, the game is over, so that's terminal. But since the last player to take a token wins, if n=0, no one can move, so the previous player has already won. So maybe we can consider positions where you can take the last token as winning.\n\nLet me try to define P(n) as true if the current player can force a win with n tokens remaining.\n\nBase cases:\n\nP(0) = False (no moves, so you lose if it's your turn)\n\nP(1) = True (take the last token)\n\nP(2): current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Alternatively, take 1, so opponent has 1 and can win. Wait, so if you take 1 from 2, opponent takes 1 and wins. Alternatively, you can't take 4. So all moves from 2 lead to opponent winning, so P(2) is False? Wait, but if you take 1, opponent takes 1 and wins, so you can't force a win, so P(2) is False? Wait, but that contradicts earlier thought.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think again. Let me think step by step.\n\nFor n=1, current player takes it and wins, so P(1)=True.\n\nFor n=2, current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then can take it and win. So the current player cannot force a win, so P(2)=False?\n\nWait, but that can't be. Wait, if n=2, the current player can take 1, but then the opponent takes the last one. Alternatively, if the current player takes 1, they lose. Alternatively, if they take 4, which they can't. So the current player can only take 1, leading to opponent's win, so P(2)=False. Therefore n=2 is a losing position. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. Wait so maybe my initial analysis was wrong.\n\nWait, so if n=2 is a losing position for the current player, then if Alice starts with n=2, she cannot win. Wait, so Bob would win? Wait, if Alice is the first player at n=2, since it's a losing position, that means she can't win, so Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for the first player (Alice), so Bob can win. So that's correct.\n\nWait, so P(n) is True if the current player can win, else False. So:\n\nP(0) = False (no move, you lose)\n\nP(1) = True (take the token)\n\nP(2): current player can only take 1, leading to P(1) which is True for the opponent. Since opponent can win, current player cannot. So P(2) = False.\n\nP(3): current player can take 1, leaving 2 (P(2)=False). So if current player takes 1, leaving opponent in a losing position. Then current player can force a win. Therefore P(3)=True.\n\nWait, because if you take 1 from 3, opponent is at P(2)=False, so they can't win, so you can win. So P(3)=True.\n\nP(4): current player can take 4 and win, so P(4)=True.\n\nP(5): current player can take 1, leaving 4 (P(4)=True for opponent), or take 4, leaving 1 (P(1)=True for opponent). Either way, opponent can win. So P(5)=False.\n\nAh! So n=5 is a losing position. Therefore, if n=5, the current player cannot force a win. So if Alice starts at n=5, she loses, so Bob can win. Therefore, n=5 is a \"good\" n for Bob. \n\nContinuing:\n\nP(6): current player can take 1, leaving 5 (P(5)=False). Therefore, opponent is in a losing position. So current player can win by taking 1. Therefore P(6)=True.\n\nAlternatively, taking 4 would leave 2 (P(2)=False). So either way, taking 1 or 4, opponent is in a losing position. Wait, so if you take 4 from 6, leaving 2 (which is P(2)=False). Therefore, P(6)=True. So P(6) is True.\n\nWait, so P(6)=True because you can move to a losing position. So the current player can win by taking 4, leaving 2, which is a losing position for opponent. Therefore, P(6)=True.\n\nWait, so let me make a table:\n\nn : P(n)\n\n0 : F\n\n1 : T\n\n2 : F\n\n3 : T\n\n4 : T\n\n5 : F\n\n6 : T\n\n7 : ?\n\nLet's compute P(7):\n\nCurrent player can take 1, leaving 6 (P(6)=T) or take 4, leaving 3 (P(3)=T). Since both moves leave opponent in a winning position, then current player cannot force a win. Therefore P(7)=False.\n\nWait, so if you take 1, opponent is at 6 (T), so opponent can win. If you take 4, opponent is at 3 (T), opponent can win. So no matter what you do, opponent can win. Therefore P(7)=False.\n\nP(7)=False.\n\nn=8:\n\nCurrent player can take 1, leaving 7 (F), so opponent is in a losing position. Therefore P(8)=True.\n\nAlternatively, take 4, leaving 4 (T). But since there's at least one move that leads to opponent losing, then P(8)=True.\n\nSimilarly, P(8)=True.\n\nn=9:\n\nCurrent player can take 1, leaving 8 (T). Or take 4, leaving 5 (F). So taking 4 would leave opponent at 5 (F). Therefore, current player can choose to take 4, leading to opponent's loss. Thus P(9)=True.\n\nWait, because taking 4 leaves opponent at 5 (F). So P(9)=True.\n\nWait, so P(9)=True.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nFor n=9, taking 4 leaves 5 (which is a losing position for opponent). Therefore, yes, P(9)=True.\n\nn=10:\n\nCurrent player can take 1, leaving 9 (True). Or take 4, leaving 6 (True). Since both options leave opponent in a winning position, so current player can't force a win. So P(10)=False.\n\nWait, so P(10)=False.\n\nn=11:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 10 (F). So opponent is in losing position. Therefore P(11)=True.\n\nn=12:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 11 (T) or take 4 \u2192 8 (T). Both are winning for opponent, so current can't. Therefore P(12)=False?\n\nWait, wait, if current takes 1 from 12 to leave 11, which is a winning position for opponent (since P(11)=True). So opponent can win from there. Alternatively, take 4 to leave 8 (P(8)=True). Either way, opponent can win. So P(12)=False.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nWait, n=12:\n\nIf you take 1, leaving 11 (P(11)=True), so opponent can win. If you take 4, leaving 8 (P(8)=True), opponent can win. So no moves to a losing position. Therefore P(12)=False.\n\nn=13:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 12 (F). So opponent is in losing position. Therefore P(13)=True.\n\nn=14:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 13 (T) or take 4 \u2192 10 (F). So taking 4 leaves opponent at 10 (F). Therefore, current can take 4 and win. Therefore P(14)=True.\n\nWait, because taking 4 from 14 leaves 10, which is F, so opponent can't win. So P(14)=True.\n\nWait, so P(14)=True.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tedious, but maybe there's a pattern here. Let me list out the P(n) values so far:\n\nn : P(n)\n\n0: F\n\n1: T\n\n2: F\n\n3: T\n\n4: T\n\n5: F\n\n6: T\n\n7: F\n\n8: T\n\n9: T\n\n10: F\n\n11: T\n\n12: F\n\n13: T\n\n14: T\n\n15: ?\n\nContinuing:\n\nn=15:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 14 (T) or take 4 \u2192 11 (T). Both leave opponent in winning positions, so P(15)=False.\n\nn=16:\n\nTake 1 \u219215 (F). So opponent is in losing position. Therefore P(16)=True.\n\nn=17:\n\nTake 1 \u219216 (T) or take4\u219213 (T). Both are T, so P(17)=False?\n\nWait, no. Wait, taking 1 leaves 16 (True), so opponent can win. Taking 4 leaves 13 (True), opponent can win. So no moves to F. Therefore P(17)=False.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check:\n\nWait n=17, current player can take 1 or 4. If they take 1, leaving 16 (True). Opponent can win. If they take 4, leaving 13 (True), opponent can win. So no way to force a win. So P(17)=False.\n\nn=18:\n\nTake 1 \u219217 (F). So opponent is in F. Therefore, current can win. So P(18)=True.\n\nn=19:\n\nTake1\u219218 (T) or take4\u219215 (F). Taking 4 leaves opponent at 15 (F). So current can choose that. Therefore P(19)=True.\n\nWait, taking 4 from 19 gives 15 (F), so opponent can't win. So yes, P(19)=True.\n\nn=20:\n\nTake1\u219219 (T) or take4\u219216 (T). Both are T, so P(20)=False.\n\nHmm, so continuing the pattern:\n\nLooking at the list up to n=20:\n\nn : P(n)\n\n0: F\n\n1: T\n\n2: F\n\n3: T\n\n4: T\n\n5: F\n\n6: T\n\n7: F\n\n8: T\n\n9: T\n\n10: F\n\n11: T\n\n12: F\n\n13: T\n\n14: T\n\n15: F\n\n16: T\n\n17: F\n\n18: T\n\n19: T\n\n20: F\n\nHmm, so the losing positions (P(n)=False) are at n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nLooking for a pattern here. Let's see the differences between these numbers:\n\n2, 5 (diff 3), 7 (diff 2), 10 (diff 3), 12 (diff 2), 15 (diff 3), 17 (diff 2), 20 (diff 3). Hmm, alternating differences of 3 and 2? 3,2,3,2,3,2,3... So starting from 2, adding 3 gives 5, then +2 gives 7, +3 gives 10, +2 gives 12, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 or 5 mod 3? Wait, let's see:\n\n2 mod 3 is 2, 5 mod3 is 2, 7 mod3 is 1, 10 mod3 is 1, 12 mod3 is 0, 15 mod3 is 0, 17 mod3 is 2, 20 mod3 is 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively mod5?\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\nLooking at the losing positions:\n\n2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nLet me see if they can be expressed as numbers of the form 5k + 2 or something?\n\nWait 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nLooking at the sequence: 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nIf we group them:\n\n2,5 (difference 3), then 7,10 (diff 3), then 12,15 (diff 3), 17,20 (diff3). But between the groups, the difference is 2? Wait, 5 to 7 is 2, 10 to 12 is 2, 15 to 17 is 2, 20 to... next would be 22, 25?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 and 0 mod 5? Wait 2 mod5, 5 mod5=0, 7 mod5=2, 10 mod5=0, 12 mod5=2, 15 mod5=0, 17 mod5=2, 20 mod5=0. So yes! It's numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, so 2 mod5, 5 mod5=0, 7 mod5=2, 10 mod5=0, 12 mod5=2, 15 mod5=0, 17 mod5=2, 20 mod5=0. So exactly the numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5. Wait, so the losing positions are n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5?\n\nLet me check with n=20, which is 0 mod5 (20/5=4). n=17 is 2 mod5 (17-15=2). n=15 is 0 mod5, yes. n=12 is 2 mod5 (12-10=2). n=10 is 0 mod5. n=7 is 2 mod5, n=5 is 0, n=2 is 2. So yes, that seems to hold.\n\nWait, let me check n=25. If the pattern holds, 25 is 0 mod5, so P(25)=False. Let me see:\n\nTo confirm, let's compute P(21), P(22), P(23), P(24), P(25):\n\nn=21:\n\nTake 1 \u219220 (F). So opponent is in losing position. Therefore P(21)=True.\n\nn=22:\n\nTake1\u219221 (T) or take4\u219218 (T). Both leave opponent in winning positions. So P(22)=False. Which is 22 mod5=2, so yes.\n\nn=23:\n\nTake1\u219222 (F). So P(23)=True.\n\nn=24:\n\nTake1\u219223 (T) or take4\u219220 (F). Taking 4 leaves 20 (F), so current can win. So P(24)=True.\n\nn=25:\n\nTake1\u219224 (T) or take4\u219221 (T). Both moves leave opponent in winning positions. So P(25)=False, which is 0 mod5. So the pattern holds.\n\nTherefore, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5. Therefore, if n \u22610 or 2 mod5, then P(n)=False (current player cannot force a win). \n\nTherefore, for the original problem, Bob can force a win when n is a losing position for Alice. Since Alice starts first, Bob can win iff n is a losing position (because Alice cannot force a win, so Bob can). \n\nTherefore, the numbers n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5 are the losing positions, so Bob can win there. \n\nTherefore, we need to count numbers from 1 to 2024 inclusive that are congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nFirst, let's compute how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5, and how many are \u22612 mod5, then add them.\n\nFor mod5 residues:\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5: 5,10,..., up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: 2,7,12,... up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nFirst, for residue 0 mod5:\n\nThe numbers are 5,10,...,2020 (since 2020=5\u00d7404). The count is 2020/5=404.\n\nWait, 5\u00d7404=2020. So 404 numbers.\n\nWait, but starting from 5, so the nth term is 5n. So n from 1 to 404 gives 5\u00d7404=2020. So 404 numbers.\n\nFor residue 2 mod5:\n\nNumbers start at 2,7,12,... Let's see the last term \u22642024.\n\nThe general term is 5k + 2. Find k such that 5k +2 \u22642024 \u2192 5k \u22642022 \u2192k \u22642022/5=404.4. So k_max=404, so the last term is 5\u00d7404 +2=2020+2=2022. \n\nSo the sequence is 2,7,...,2022. The number of terms is (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1 = 404 +1=405. Wait let me verify:\n\nFirst term: k=0: 5\u00d70 +2=2,\n\nk=1:7,\n\n...\n\nk=404: 5\u00d7404 +2=2022.\n\nThus total terms:405.\n\nWait, (2022 -2)/5 =2020/5=404, so 404 +1=405 terms.\n\nTherefore, total numbers is 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method.\n\nTotal numbers from 1 to N congruent to a mod m is floor((N -a)/m) +1, provided a \u2264N.\n\nSo for residue 0 mod5:\n\na=0, but since we start at 5, which is 0 mod5 but starting at 5. Wait actually, if we consider residue 0 mod5, numbers divisible by5, from 5 to 2020. So formula:\n\nNumber of terms= floor(2024/5) - floor(0/5). Wait, but starting at 5, so maybe better to compute as floor(2024/5). Since 2024 divided by5 is 404.8, so floor(2024/5)=404. But since 5\u00d7404=2020 \u22642024, so yes, 404 numbers.\n\nFor residue 2 mod5:\n\nNumbers are 2,7,...,2022. The count is floor((2024 -2)/5)+1 = floor(2022/5)+1=404.4\u2192404 +1=405. \n\nSo total numbers where Bob can win:404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check if n=0 is included. But the problem states positive integers n \u22642024, so starting at n=1. \n\nWait for residue 0 mod5, the numbers are 5,10,...,2020. So first term 5. So the count is correct as 404. \n\nFor residue 2 mod5, starting at 2, which is included (since n=2 is a positive integer). So 405 terms. \n\nThus total 404+405=809.\n\nWait, but let me check with a small N, say N=7. Let's see:\n\nNumbers where Bob can win (losing positions) are 2,5,7. So up to 7, there are 3 numbers. According to the formula:\n\nFor 0 mod5: up to 7, numbers are 5. So 1.\n\nFor 2 mod5: 2,7. So 2 numbers. Total 1+2=3. Which matches. \n\nAnother check with N=10:\n\nLosing positions up to 10:2,5,7,10. So 4 numbers. According to formula:\n\n0 mod5:5,10 \u21922 numbers.\n\n2 mod5:2,7 \u21922 numbers. Total 4. Correct.\n\nAnother check with N=12:\n\nLosing positions up to12:2,5,7,10,12. That's 5 numbers.\n\nFormula: 0 mod5:5,10 \u21922. 2 mod5:2,7,12 (since 12 mod5=2). So 3. Total 2+3=5. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. So for N=2024, it should be 404+405=809. \n\nWait but let me check the exact counts again.\n\nFor residue 0 mod5:\n\nFirst term 5, last term 2020. Number of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404. Correct.\n\nFor residue 2 mod5:\n\nFirst term 2, last term 2022. Number of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1 =2020/5 +1=404 +1=405. Correct.\n\nThus total is 809. So the answer is 809. Wait, but let me check once more with N=2024.\n\nWait, 2024 divided by5 is 404.8. So floor(2024/5)=404. But for residue 2 mod5, the last term is 5\u00d7404 +2=2022, which is indeed \u22642024. So 405 terms. So total is indeed 404+405=809.\n\nWait, but hold on, the problem says \"the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024\". So n from 1 to 2024. \n\nWait, but in the losing positions, 2 is included (n=2). So all counts are correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 809. But let me confirm once again with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, for each number from 1 to 2024, the number of n \u22610 or2 mod5 is equal to:\n\nTotal numbers \u22610 mod5: floor(2024/5)=404 (since 5\u00d7404=2020). \n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: floor((2024 -2)/5)+1 = floor(2022/5)+1=404 +1=405. \n\nThus total 809. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 809. Wait, but let me check if there's a mistake here. Wait 2024 mod5 is 2024 divided by5: 5\u00d7404=2020, so remainder 4. So 2024 mod5=4. \n\nTherefore, for residue 2 mod5, the last term is 2022 as 2022 mod5=2. \n\nYes, so the count is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 809. \n\nBut wait, wait, let me think again: the losing positions are when n \u22610 or2 mod5. So for each n in 1..2024, if n mod5 is 0 or2, then it's a losing position for the first player (Alice), so Bob can win. \n\nTherefore the total numbers are 809. \n\nHence, the answer should be 809.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{809}\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we analyze the game using the concept of winning and losing positions. A position is losing if the current player cannot force a win, assuming optimal play by the opponent.\n\nWe define \\( P(n) \\) as true if the current player can force a win with \\( n \\) tokens remaining. Through analysis, we find the losing positions (where \\( P(n) \\) is false) occur when \\( n \\equiv 0 \\) or \\( 2 \\mod 5 \\).\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Identify Losing Positions**:\n   - Losing positions are numbers \\( n \\) such that \\( n \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\) or \\( n \\equiv 2 \\mod 5 \\).\n\n2. **Count Numbers \\( \\leq 2024 \\)**:\n   - **For \\( n \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\)**:\n     - The numbers are \\( 5, 10, 15, \\ldots, 2020 \\).\n     - The count is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 404 \\).\n   - **For \\( n \\equiv 2 \\mod 5 \\)**:\n     - The numbers are \\( 2, 7, 12, \\ldots, 2022 \\).\n     - The count is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2022 - 2}{5} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2020}{5} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405 \\).\n\n3. **Sum the Counts**:\n   - Total losing positions: \\( 404 + 405 = 809 \\).\n\nThus, the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) where Bob can force a win is \\(\\boxed{809}\\).",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many numbers n \u2264 2024 where Bob can force a win no matter what Alice does. Hmm, so Bob has a winning strategy for those n. \n\nFirst, maybe I should figure out for small values of n who would win. Let me start with n=1. If there's 1 token, Alice takes it and wins. So n=1 is a losing position for Bob. \n\nn=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob has to take the last one and win. Wait, no, if Alice takes 1 from 2, then Bob is left with 1 and can take it to win. Wait, but that would mean Bob wins? Wait, but Alice went first. Let me think again. If n=2, Alice's options are to take 1 or 4. But she can't take 4, so she takes 1. Then Bob is left with 1, so he takes it and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. Wait, so n=2 is a winning position for Bob? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, actually, the player who takes the last token wins. So if Alice takes 1 from n=2, Bob takes the last one and wins. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position for the first player (Alice), so Bob can win. So n=2 is a \"good\" n for Bob.\n\nn=3: Alice can take 1, leaving 2. Then Bob is in the same situation as above. Bob can take 1, leaving 1 for Alice, who then takes it and wins. Wait, so if Alice takes 1 from 3, leaving 2, then Bob's move: he can take 1 from 2, leaving 1 for Alice. Then Alice takes the last one and wins. Alternatively, Bob could take 4, but he can't. So Bob must take 1, leading to Alice's win. Alternatively, if Alice takes 1 from 3, Bob can only take 1, so Alice can win. Alternatively, maybe Alice can choose another move? Wait, from n=3, Alice can only take 1 or 4, but 4 is too many, so she can only take 1. Then Bob is left with 2, and as above, Bob can take 1, but that leaves 1 for Alice. Wait, so Bob can't force a win here. Wait, so maybe n=3 is a winning position for Alice? Let me check again.\n\nWait, if n=3, Alice takes 1, leaving 2. Then Bob's options are to take 1 or 4. He can only take 1, leaving 1 for Alice. Then Alice takes the last one and wins. So Bob can't win here. Alternatively, if Alice takes 1, Bob is forced into a losing position? Hmm, so maybe n=3 is a winning position for Alice. Therefore, Bob can't force a win here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Alice could have another strategy. Wait, no, she can only take 1. So n=3 is a win for Alice. \n\nn=4: Alice can take all 4 and win immediately. So n=4 is a win for Alice. \n\nn=5: Alice can take 1, leaving 4 for Bob. Then Bob can take all 4 and win. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4, leaving 1 for Bob, Bob takes it and wins. So no matter what Alice does, Bob can win. Wait, so n=5 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. So n=5 is a good n for Bob.\n\nWait, let me confirm. If n=5, Alice's options: take 1, leaving 4 for Bob (Bob takes 4 and wins). Or Alice takes 4, leaving 1 for Bob (Bob takes 1 and wins). So either way, Bob can win. Therefore n=5 is a losing position for the first player (Alice), so Bob can win. \n\nn=6: Let's see. Alice can take 1, leaving 5. Then Bob is in a position where he can win, as we saw with n=5. Wait, so if Alice leaves Bob at n=5, Bob can win. Therefore, Alice would not want to do that. Alternatively, maybe Alice can choose another move. From n=6, Alice can take 1 or 4. If she takes 4, leaving 2. Then Bob is left with 2, which as in n=2, Bob can take 1, leaving 1 for Alice. Wait, but Bob can take 1 from 2, leaving 1, so Alice takes the last one. Wait, so if Alice takes 4 from 6, leaving 2, then Bob can take 1, leaving 1 for Alice. Then Alice takes the last one and wins. Alternatively, Bob could take 4 from 2? No, he can't. So Bob must take 1, leading to Alice's win. Therefore, if Alice takes 4 from 6, Bob is forced into a position where Alice can win. Alternatively, if Alice takes 1 from 6, leaving 5, then Bob can win. Therefore, Alice can choose between leaving Bob at 5 (which is bad for her) or leaving Bob at 2 (which is also bad for her? Wait, no. Wait, when Alice takes 4, leaving 2, Bob is left with 2. Then Bob can take 1, leaving 1 for Alice. Then Alice takes the last token. So that's bad for Bob. Wait, but if Bob is left with 2, he can choose to take 1, but then Alice gets the last. Alternatively, Bob can take 1, but that's the only option. Wait, so in that case, Bob can't force a win. Hmm, so if Alice takes 4, Bob is left with 2, which is a position where Bob can't force a win? Wait, but earlier, n=2 was a losing position for the first player, which would be Alice in that case. Wait, but here Bob is the second player. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the initial player is Alice. For n=6:\n\nIf Alice takes 1, leaving 5. Then Bob is the next player, and he can win (as n=5 is a losing position for the first player, which is now Bob? Wait no, n=5 is a losing position for the first player. Wait, when Alice takes 1 from 6 to leave 5, then Bob is now the first player for the n=5 game. Since n=5 is a losing position for the first player, Bob would lose. Wait, so that would be good for Alice. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to formalize this as a recursive problem.\n\nPerhaps I should model this as a losing or winning position. Let me define:\n\nA position is a losing position if the current player cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.\n\nA position is a winning position if the current player can force a win.\n\nSo, for n=0, the game is over, so that's terminal. But since the last player to take a token wins, if n=0, no one can move, so the previous player has already won. So maybe we can consider positions where you can take the last token as winning.\n\nLet me try to define P(n) as true if the current player can force a win with n tokens remaining.\n\nBase cases:\n\nP(0) = False (no moves, so you lose if it's your turn)\n\nP(1) = True (take the last token)\n\nP(2): current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Alternatively, take 1, so opponent has 1 and can win. Wait, so if you take 1 from 2, opponent takes 1 and wins. Alternatively, you can't take 4. So all moves from 2 lead to opponent winning, so P(2) is False? Wait, but if you take 1, opponent takes 1 and wins, so you can't force a win, so P(2) is False? Wait, but that contradicts earlier thought.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think again. Let me think step by step.\n\nFor n=1, current player takes it and wins, so P(1)=True.\n\nFor n=2, current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then can take it and win. So the current player cannot force a win, so P(2)=False?\n\nWait, but that can't be. Wait, if n=2, the current player can take 1, but then the opponent takes the last one. Alternatively, if the current player takes 1, they lose. Alternatively, if they take 4, which they can't. So the current player can only take 1, leading to opponent's win, so P(2)=False. Therefore n=2 is a losing position. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. Wait so maybe my initial analysis was wrong.\n\nWait, so if n=2 is a losing position for the current player, then if Alice starts with n=2, she cannot win. Wait, so Bob would win? Wait, if Alice is the first player at n=2, since it's a losing position, that means she can't win, so Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for the first player (Alice), so Bob can win. So that's correct.\n\nWait, so P(n) is True if the current player can win, else False. So:\n\nP(0) = False (no move, you lose)\n\nP(1) = True (take the token)\n\nP(2): current player can only take 1, leading to P(1) which is True for the opponent. Since opponent can win, current player cannot. So P(2) = False.\n\nP(3): current player can take 1, leaving 2 (P(2)=False). So if current player takes 1, leaving opponent in a losing position. Then current player can force a win. Therefore P(3)=True.\n\nWait, because if you take 1 from 3, opponent is at P(2)=False, so they can't win, so you can win. So P(3)=True.\n\nP(4): current player can take 4 and win, so P(4)=True.\n\nP(5): current player can take 1, leaving 4 (P(4)=True for opponent), or take 4, leaving 1 (P(1)=True for opponent). Either way, opponent can win. So P(5)=False.\n\nAh! So n=5 is a losing position. Therefore, if n=5, the current player cannot force a win. So if Alice starts at n=5, she loses, so Bob can win. Therefore, n=5 is a \"good\" n for Bob. \n\nContinuing:\n\nP(6): current player can take 1, leaving 5 (P(5)=False). Therefore, opponent is in a losing position. So current player can win by taking 1. Therefore P(6)=True.\n\nAlternatively, taking 4 would leave 2 (P(2)=False). So either way, taking 1 or 4, opponent is in a losing position. Wait, so if you take 4 from 6, leaving 2 (which is P(2)=False). Therefore, P(6)=True. So P(6) is True.\n\nWait, so P(6)=True because you can move to a losing position. So the current player can win by taking 4, leaving 2, which is a losing position for opponent. Therefore, P(6)=True.\n\nWait, so let me make a table:\n\nn : P(n)\n\n0 : F\n\n1 : T\n\n2 : F\n\n3 : T\n\n4 : T\n\n5 : F\n\n6 : T\n\n7 : ?\n\nLet's compute P(7):\n\nCurrent player can take 1, leaving 6 (P(6)=T) or take 4, leaving 3 (P(3)=T). Since both moves leave opponent in a winning position, then current player cannot force a win. Therefore P(7)=False.\n\nWait, so if you take 1, opponent is at 6 (T), so opponent can win. If you take 4, opponent is at 3 (T), opponent can win. So no matter what you do, opponent can win. Therefore P(7)=False.\n\nP(7)=False.\n\nn=8:\n\nCurrent player can take 1, leaving 7 (F), so opponent is in a losing position. Therefore P(8)=True.\n\nAlternatively, take 4, leaving 4 (T). But since there's at least one move that leads to opponent losing, then P(8)=True.\n\nSimilarly, P(8)=True.\n\nn=9:\n\nCurrent player can take 1, leaving 8 (T). Or take 4, leaving 5 (F). So taking 4 would leave opponent at 5 (F). Therefore, current player can choose to take 4, leading to opponent's loss. Thus P(9)=True.\n\nWait, because taking 4 leaves opponent at 5 (F). So P(9)=True.\n\nWait, so P(9)=True.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nFor n=9, taking 4 leaves 5 (which is a losing position for opponent). Therefore, yes, P(9)=True.\n\nn=10:\n\nCurrent player can take 1, leaving 9 (True). Or take 4, leaving 6 (True). Since both options leave opponent in a winning position, so current player can't force a win. So P(10)=False.\n\nWait, so P(10)=False.\n\nn=11:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 10 (F). So opponent is in losing position. Therefore P(11)=True.\n\nn=12:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 11 (T) or take 4 \u2192 8 (T). Both are winning for opponent, so current can't. Therefore P(12)=False?\n\nWait, wait, if current takes 1 from 12 to leave 11, which is a winning position for opponent (since P(11)=True). So opponent can win from there. Alternatively, take 4 to leave 8 (P(8)=True). Either way, opponent can win. So P(12)=False.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nWait, n=12:\n\nIf you take 1, leaving 11 (P(11)=True), so opponent can win. If you take 4, leaving 8 (P(8)=True), opponent can win. So no moves to a losing position. Therefore P(12)=False.\n\nn=13:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 12 (F). So opponent is in losing position. Therefore P(13)=True.\n\nn=14:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 13 (T) or take 4 \u2192 10 (F). So taking 4 leaves opponent at 10 (F). Therefore, current can take 4 and win. Therefore P(14)=True.\n\nWait, because taking 4 from 14 leaves 10, which is F, so opponent can't win. So P(14)=True.\n\nWait, so P(14)=True.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tedious, but maybe there's a pattern here. Let me list out the P(n) values so far:\n\nn : P(n)\n\n0: F\n\n1: T\n\n2: F\n\n3: T\n\n4: T\n\n5: F\n\n6: T\n\n7: F\n\n8: T\n\n9: T\n\n10: F\n\n11: T\n\n12: F\n\n13: T\n\n14: T\n\n15: ?\n\nContinuing:\n\nn=15:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 14 (T) or take 4 \u2192 11 (T). Both leave opponent in winning positions, so P(15)=False.\n\nn=16:\n\nTake 1 \u219215 (F). So opponent is in losing position. Therefore P(16)=True.\n\nn=17:\n\nTake 1 \u219216 (T) or take4\u219213 (T). Both are T, so P(17)=False?\n\nWait, no. Wait, taking 1 leaves 16 (True), so opponent can win. Taking 4 leaves 13 (True), opponent can win. So no moves to F. Therefore P(17)=False.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check:\n\nWait n=17, current player can take 1 or 4. If they take 1, leaving 16 (True). Opponent can win. If they take 4, leaving 13 (True), opponent can win. So no way to force a win. So P(17)=False.\n\nn=18:\n\nTake 1 \u219217 (F). So opponent is in F. Therefore, current can win. So P(18)=True.\n\nn=19:\n\nTake1\u219218 (T) or take4\u219215 (F). Taking 4 leaves opponent at 15 (F). So current can choose that. Therefore P(19)=True.\n\nWait, taking 4 from 19 gives 15 (F), so opponent can't win. So yes, P(19)=True.\n\nn=20:\n\nTake1\u219219 (T) or take4\u219216 (T). Both are T, so P(20)=False.\n\nHmm, so continuing the pattern:\n\nLooking at the list up to n=20:\n\nn : P(n)\n\n0: F\n\n1: T\n\n2: F\n\n3: T\n\n4: T\n\n5: F\n\n6: T\n\n7: F\n\n8: T\n\n9: T\n\n10: F\n\n11: T\n\n12: F\n\n13: T\n\n14: T\n\n15: F\n\n16: T\n\n17: F\n\n18: T\n\n19: T\n\n20: F\n\nHmm, so the losing positions (P(n)=False) are at n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nLooking for a pattern here. Let's see the differences between these numbers:\n\n2, 5 (diff 3), 7 (diff 2), 10 (diff 3), 12 (diff 2), 15 (diff 3), 17 (diff 2), 20 (diff 3). Hmm, alternating differences of 3 and 2? 3,2,3,2,3,2,3... So starting from 2, adding 3 gives 5, then +2 gives 7, +3 gives 10, +2 gives 12, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 or 5 mod 3? Wait, let's see:\n\n2 mod 3 is 2, 5 mod3 is 2, 7 mod3 is 1, 10 mod3 is 1, 12 mod3 is 0, 15 mod3 is 0, 17 mod3 is 2, 20 mod3 is 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively mod5?\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\nLooking at the losing positions:\n\n2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nLet me see if they can be expressed as numbers of the form 5k + 2 or something?\n\nWait 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nLooking at the sequence: 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nIf we group them:\n\n2,5 (difference 3), then 7,10 (diff 3), then 12,15 (diff 3), 17,20 (diff3). But between the groups, the difference is 2? Wait, 5 to 7 is 2, 10 to 12 is 2, 15 to 17 is 2, 20 to... next would be 22, 25?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 and 0 mod 5? Wait 2 mod5, 5 mod5=0, 7 mod5=2, 10 mod5=0, 12 mod5=2, 15 mod5=0, 17 mod5=2, 20 mod5=0. So yes! It's numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, so 2 mod5, 5 mod5=0, 7 mod5=2, 10 mod5=0, 12 mod5=2, 15 mod5=0, 17 mod5=2, 20 mod5=0. So exactly the numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5. Wait, so the losing positions are n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5?\n\nLet me check with n=20, which is 0 mod5 (20/5=4). n=17 is 2 mod5 (17-15=2). n=15 is 0 mod5, yes. n=12 is 2 mod5 (12-10=2). n=10 is 0 mod5. n=7 is 2 mod5, n=5 is 0, n=2 is 2. So yes, that seems to hold.\n\nWait, let me check n=25. If the pattern holds, 25 is 0 mod5, so P(25)=False. Let me see:\n\nTo confirm, let's compute P(21), P(22), P(23), P(24), P(25):\n\nn=21:\n\nTake 1 \u219220 (F). So opponent is in losing position. Therefore P(21)=True.\n\nn=22:\n\nTake1\u219221 (T) or take4\u219218 (T). Both leave opponent in winning positions. So P(22)=False. Which is 22 mod5=2, so yes.\n\nn=23:\n\nTake1\u219222 (F). So P(23)=True.\n\nn=24:\n\nTake1\u219223 (T) or take4\u219220 (F). Taking 4 leaves 20 (F), so current can win. So P(24)=True.\n\nn=25:\n\nTake1\u219224 (T) or take4\u219221 (T). Both moves leave opponent in winning positions. So P(25)=False, which is 0 mod5. So the pattern holds.\n\nTherefore, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5. Therefore, if n \u22610 or 2 mod5, then P(n)=False (current player cannot force a win). \n\nTherefore, for the original problem, Bob can force a win when n is a losing position for Alice. Since Alice starts first, Bob can win iff n is a losing position (because Alice cannot force a win, so Bob can). \n\nTherefore, the numbers n \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5 are the losing positions, so Bob can win there. \n\nTherefore, we need to count numbers from 1 to 2024 inclusive that are congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nFirst, let's compute how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5, and how many are \u22612 mod5, then add them.\n\nFor mod5 residues:\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5: 5,10,..., up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: 2,7,12,... up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nFirst, for residue 0 mod5:\n\nThe numbers are 5,10,...,2020 (since 2020=5\u00d7404). The count is 2020/5=404.\n\nWait, 5\u00d7404=2020. So 404 numbers.\n\nWait, but starting from 5, so the nth term is 5n. So n from 1 to 404 gives 5\u00d7404=2020. So 404 numbers.\n\nFor residue 2 mod5:\n\nNumbers start at 2,7,12,... Let's see the last term \u22642024.\n\nThe general term is 5k + 2. Find k such that 5k +2 \u22642024 \u2192 5k \u22642022 \u2192k \u22642022/5=404.4. So k_max=404, so the last term is 5\u00d7404 +2=2020+2=2022. \n\nSo the sequence is 2,7,...,2022. The number of terms is (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1 = 404 +1=405. Wait let me verify:\n\nFirst term: k=0: 5\u00d70 +2=2,\n\nk=1:7,\n\n...\n\nk=404: 5\u00d7404 +2=2022.\n\nThus total terms:405.\n\nWait, (2022 -2)/5 =2020/5=404, so 404 +1=405 terms.\n\nTherefore, total numbers is 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method.\n\nTotal numbers from 1 to N congruent to a mod m is floor((N -a)/m) +1, provided a \u2264N.\n\nSo for residue 0 mod5:\n\na=0, but since we start at 5, which is 0 mod5 but starting at 5. Wait actually, if we consider residue 0 mod5, numbers divisible by5, from 5 to 2020. So formula:\n\nNumber of terms= floor(2024/5) - floor(0/5). Wait, but starting at 5, so maybe better to compute as floor(2024/5). Since 2024 divided by5 is 404.8, so floor(2024/5)=404. But since 5\u00d7404=2020 \u22642024, so yes, 404 numbers.\n\nFor residue 2 mod5:\n\nNumbers are 2,7,...,2022. The count is floor((2024 -2)/5)+1 = floor(2022/5)+1=404.4\u2192404 +1=405. \n\nSo total numbers where Bob can win:404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check if n=0 is included. But the problem states positive integers n \u22642024, so starting at n=1. \n\nWait for residue 0 mod5, the numbers are 5,10,...,2020. So first term 5. So the count is correct as 404. \n\nFor residue 2 mod5, starting at 2, which is included (since n=2 is a positive integer). So 405 terms. \n\nThus total 404+405=809.\n\nWait, but let me check with a small N, say N=7. Let's see:\n\nNumbers where Bob can win (losing positions) are 2,5,7. So up to 7, there are 3 numbers. According to the formula:\n\nFor 0 mod5: up to 7, numbers are 5. So 1.\n\nFor 2 mod5: 2,7. So 2 numbers. Total 1+2=3. Which matches. \n\nAnother check with N=10:\n\nLosing positions up to 10:2,5,7,10. So 4 numbers. According to formula:\n\n0 mod5:5,10 \u21922 numbers.\n\n2 mod5:2,7 \u21922 numbers. Total 4. Correct.\n\nAnother check with N=12:\n\nLosing positions up to12:2,5,7,10,12. That's 5 numbers.\n\nFormula: 0 mod5:5,10 \u21922. 2 mod5:2,7,12 (since 12 mod5=2). So 3. Total 2+3=5. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. So for N=2024, it should be 404+405=809. \n\nWait but let me check the exact counts again.\n\nFor residue 0 mod5:\n\nFirst term 5, last term 2020. Number of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404. Correct.\n\nFor residue 2 mod5:\n\nFirst term 2, last term 2022. Number of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1 =2020/5 +1=404 +1=405. Correct.\n\nThus total is 809. So the answer is 809. Wait, but let me check once more with N=2024.\n\nWait, 2024 divided by5 is 404.8. So floor(2024/5)=404. But for residue 2 mod5, the last term is 5\u00d7404 +2=2022, which is indeed \u22642024. So 405 terms. So total is indeed 404+405=809.\n\nWait, but hold on, the problem says \"the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024\". So n from 1 to 2024. \n\nWait, but in the losing positions, 2 is included (n=2). So all counts are correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 809. But let me confirm once again with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, for each number from 1 to 2024, the number of n \u22610 or2 mod5 is equal to:\n\nTotal numbers \u22610 mod5: floor(2024/5)=404 (since 5\u00d7404=2020). \n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: floor((2024 -2)/5)+1 = floor(2022/5)+1=404 +1=405. \n\nThus total 809. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 809. Wait, but let me check if there's a mistake here. Wait 2024 mod5 is 2024 divided by5: 5\u00d7404=2020, so remainder 4. So 2024 mod5=4. \n\nTherefore, for residue 2 mod5, the last term is 2022 as 2022 mod5=2. \n\nYes, so the count is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 809. \n\nBut wait, wait, let me think again: the losing positions are when n \u22610 or2 mod5. So for each n in 1..2024, if n mod5 is 0 or2, then it's a losing position for the first player (Alice), so Bob can win. \n\nTherefore the total numbers are 809. \n\nHence, the answer should be 809.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{809}\n\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we analyze the game using the concept of winning and losing positions. A position is losing if the current player cannot force a win, assuming optimal play by the opponent.\n\nWe define \\( P(n) \\) as true if the current player can force a win with \\( n \\) tokens remaining. Through analysis, we find the losing positions (where \\( P(n) \\) is false) occur when \\( n \\equiv 0 \\) or \\( 2 \\mod 5 \\).\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Identify Losing Positions**:\n   - Losing positions are numbers \\( n \\) such that \\( n \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\) or \\( n \\equiv 2 \\mod 5 \\).\n\n2. **Count Numbers \\( \\leq 2024 \\)**:\n   - **For \\( n \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\)**:\n     - The numbers are \\( 5, 10, 15, \\ldots, 2020 \\).\n     - The count is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 404 \\).\n   - **For \\( n \\equiv 2 \\mod 5 \\)**:\n     - The numbers are \\( 2, 7, 12, \\ldots, 2022 \\).\n     - The count is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2022 - 2}{5} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2020}{5} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405 \\).\n\n3. **Sum the Counts**:\n   - Total losing positions: \\( 404 + 405 = 809 \\).\n\nThus, the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) where Bob can force a win is \\(\\boxed{809}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. The question is about a game between Alice and Bob with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the one who takes the last token wins. We need to find how many numbers n \u2264 2024 are such that Bob has a winning strategy, no matter what Alice does.\n\nHmm, so first, I remember these types of games are often analyzed using dynamic programming or by finding a pattern in the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the current player cannot force a win, no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a winning position means the current player can force a win with the right moves.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the base cases and see if a pattern emerges.\n\nLet's denote by W(n) if the current player can force a win with n tokens left, and L(n) if they can't (i.e., it's a losing position). We need to find all n where the second player (Bob) can force a win, which would mean that n is a losing position for the first player (Alice). So essentially, we need to count all n \u2264 2024 where n is a losing position.\n\nStarting with small n:\n\nn=1: The first player takes 1 token and wins. So W(1).\n\nn=2: The first player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the second player, who then takes it and wins. Wait, no. Wait, if first player takes 1 from 2, leaves 1, then the second player takes that last one and wins. So actually, if n=2, the first player can't force a win? Wait, but wait, the first player could also take 4 tokens, but there's only 2, so that's not allowed. So the only move is to take 1. Then the second player takes the last one. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position for the first player. Wait, so that would mean L(2). But hold on, that contradicts my initial thought.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify:\n\nFor n=1: Current player takes 1 and wins. So W(1).\n\nn=2: Current player can only take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent who then takes it and wins. So current player (the one with n=2) will lose if the opponent plays optimally. Therefore, L(2).\n\nWait, so n=2 is a losing position. Hmm.\n\nn=3: Similarly, the current player can take 1, leaving 2 tokens. Since 2 is a losing position, the next player is in a losing position. Therefore, the current player can force a win by moving to 2. Therefore, W(3).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf n=3, current player takes 1, leaving n=2 (a losing position for the opponent). Therefore, current player can win. So W(3).\n\nAlternatively, taking 4 is not possible here, so only option is to take 1.\n\nn=4: Current player can take all 4 and win. So W(4).\n\nn=5: Current player can take 1, leaving 4, which is a winning position for the opponent (they can take 4 and win). Alternatively, take 4, leaving 1, which is a winning position for the opponent (they can take 1 and win). So no matter what the current player does, the opponent can win. Therefore, n=5 is a losing position? Wait, let's check:\n\nIf n=5, current player's options:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 leaves 4, opponent can take 4 and win.\n\nTake 4 \u2192 leaves 1, opponent takes 1 and wins.\n\nSo indeed, no matter what the current player does, opponent can win. So n=5 is L(5).\n\nn=6:\n\nCurrent player can take 1 \u2192 leaves 5 (a losing position for opponent). Therefore, current player can force a win. So W(6).\n\nAlternatively, taking 4 would leave 2, which is also a losing position. Wait, so taking 4 from 6 leaves 2 (L), so that's even better. So either way, the current player can choose between moving to L(5) or L(2). Therefore, W(6).\n\nWait, so n=6 is a winning position.\n\nn=7:\n\nCurrent player can take 1 \u2192 leaves 6 (W). Opponent can win from there.\n\nTake 4 \u2192 leaves 3 (W). Opponent can win.\n\nHmm, so both options leave the opponent in a winning position. Therefore, n=7 is a losing position?\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\nIf n=7, current player's moves:\n\n1. Take 1 \u2192 6 left. Since 6 is W, opponent can win. So opponent can force a win from 6.\n\n2. Take 4 \u2192 3 left. Since 3 is W, opponent can take 1 to leave 2 (L), then current player (original player) is in L. Wait, no, opponent would take 1 from 3, leaving 2, which is a losing position for the next player (the original player). So opponent can indeed win. So both moves from 7 lead to opponent winning. Therefore, n=7 is L(7).\n\nWait, that seems correct. So n=7 is a losing position.\n\nn=8:\n\nCurrent player can take 1 \u2192 7 (L). So opponent is in a losing position. Therefore, current player can win by moving to L(7). So W(8).\n\nAlternatively, take 4 \u2192 4 left, which is W(4). Opponent can take all 4 and win. Hmm, so if the current player takes 4 from 8, leaving 4, opponent can take 4 and win. Therefore, that move is bad. But since the current player can choose to take 1 and leave 7 (L), they can force a win. So n=8 is W(8).\n\nn=9:\n\nCurrent player can take 1 \u2192 8 (W). Opponent can win from there.\n\nTake 4 \u2192 5 (L). So opponent is in L(5). Therefore, if current player takes 4 from 9, leaving 5 (L), then opponent cannot win. Wait, so that's a good move. So taking 4 is a winning move. Therefore, n=9 is W(9).\n\nWait, so if the player takes 4 from 9, leaving 5 (L), then the opponent is in a losing position. Therefore, n=9 is a winning position.\n\nn=10:\n\nCurrent player can take 1 \u2192 9 (W). Opponent can win.\n\nTake 4 \u2192 6 (W). Opponent can win.\n\nTherefore, both moves lead to opponent winning. Therefore, n=10 is L(10).\n\nHmm, so n=10 is a losing position.\n\nWait, let's check again:\n\nn=10:\n\nIf current player takes 1, leaves 9, which is W. Opponent can take 4 to leave 5 (L), so opponent can win.\n\nIf current player takes 4, leaves 6 (W). Opponent can take 1 to leave 5 (L), so opponent can win.\n\nTherefore, no matter what current player does, opponent can win. So yes, L(10).\n\nContinuing:\n\nn=11:\n\nCurrent player can take 1 \u2192 10 (L). So opponent is in L, so current player can win. Therefore W(11).\n\nAlternatively, take 4 \u2192 7 (L). So opponent is in L. Either way, current player can move to L, so W(11).\n\nn=12:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 11 (W). Opponent can win.\n\nTake 4 \u2192 8 (W). Opponent can win.\n\nHmm, so both moves leave opponent in a winning position. Therefore, n=12 is L(12)?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, n=12: taking 1 leaves 11 (W). Opponent can take 4 to get to 7 (L), so opponent can win.\n\nTaking 4 leaves 8 (W). Opponent can take 1 to get to 7 (L), so opponent can win.\n\nTherefore, yes, n=12 is L(12).\n\nWait, but let me check n=12 again. Hmm.\n\nWait, so n=12 is a losing position? So the losing positions so far are n=2,5,7,10,12?\n\nWait, let me tabulate the results so far:\n\nn : W/L\n\n1: W\n\n2: L\n\n3: W\n\n4: W\n\n5: L\n\n6: W\n\n7: L\n\n8: W\n\n9: W\n\n10:L\n\n11:W\n\n12:L\n\nHmm, trying to see a pattern here. Let me list them up to n=12:\n\nLosing positions at 2,5,7,10,12.\n\nLooking at the differences between them: 2 to 5 is +3, 5 to 7 is +2, 7 to 10 is +3, 10 to 12 is +2. Hmm, alternating between adding 3 and 2? Let's see if that continues.\n\nContinuing:\n\nn=13:\n\nCurrent player can take 1 \u2192 12 (L). So opponent is in L. Therefore, current player can win. So W(13).\n\nTake 4 \u2192 9 (W). Opponent can win from there, but since the first move is possible to L, so W(13).\n\nn=14:\n\nTake 1 \u219213 (W). Opponent can take 1 to 12 (L), so opponent can win.\n\nTake 4 \u219210 (L). So leaving opponent at L(10). Therefore, current player can choose to take 4, leaving L(10), so opponent cannot win. Therefore, n=14 is W(14)?\n\nWait, hold on. If current player takes 4 from 14, leaving 10 (L). Since L means opponent can't win, so current player can force a win by doing that. So n=14 is W(14).\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me verify again.\n\nWait, n=14:\n\nIf you take 4, leaving 10, which is a losing position. So opponent is in L(10), so they can't force a win. So current player can win. So n=14 is W(14).\n\nWait, so n=14 is a winning position. Hmm.\n\nWait, so n=14 is W, so the next losing position might be?\n\nn=15:\n\nTake 1 \u219214 (W). Opponent can win.\n\nTake 4 \u219211 (W). Opponent can win.\n\nTherefore, both moves leave opponent in W positions, so current player can't force a win. Therefore, n=15 is L(15).\n\nSo adding n=15 as a losing position. The previous losing positions were 2,5,7,10,12,15. The differences between them are 3,2,3,2,3. So the pattern seems to be every 2 and 3 alternately? Let me see.\n\nSo starting at 2, then adding 3 to get 5, then 2 to get 7, then 3 to get 10, then 2 to get 12, then 3 to get 15. So the pattern of differences is 3,2,3,2,3, etc. So the losing positions are at 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,... and so on?\n\nContinuing further:\n\nn=16:\n\nTake 1 \u219215 (L). So opponent is in L, so current player can win by moving to 15. Therefore, W(16).\n\nTake 4 \u219212 (L). Also a losing position. So either way, current player can win. W(16).\n\nn=17:\n\nTake 1 \u219216 (W). Opponent can take 1 to 15 (L). So opponent can win.\n\nTake 4 \u219213 (W). Opponent can take 4 to 9, then... Hmm, opponent can choose a move to L. Wait, opponent would have 13, which is a winning position. Let's see:\n\nIf current player takes 4 from 17 to get 13, opponent can take 1 to get to 12 (L). So opponent can win. So both moves from 17 lead to opponent winning. Therefore, n=17 is L(17). So that continues the pattern.\n\nContinuing, n=18:\n\nTake 1 \u219217 (L). So opponent is in L, so current player can win. Therefore, W(18).\n\nTake 4 \u219214 (W). Opponent can win from there, but since the first move is possible to L, so W(18).\n\nn=19:\n\nTake 1 \u219218 (W). Opponent can take 1 to 17 (L). So opponent can win.\n\nTake 4 \u219215 (L). So leaving opponent at L(15). Therefore, current player can choose to take 4 and win. Wait, so taking 4 from 19 leaves 15 (L). Therefore, opponent is in losing position, so current player can win. Therefore, n=19 is W(19).\n\nWait, that contradicts the previous pattern. Wait, according to the previous pattern, after 17 (L), adding 3 would get to 20 (L). But here n=19 is W. Hmm, maybe my previous thought about the pattern was wrong?\n\nWait, let's check n=19 again.\n\nIf n=19, current player can take 4, leaving 15 (which is L). So opponent cannot win from 15. Therefore, current player can force a win. So n=19 is W(19). Therefore, the next losing position would be n=20?\n\nWait let's check n=20:\n\nTake 1 \u219219 (W). Opponent can take 4 to 15 (L). So opponent can win.\n\nTake 4 \u219216 (W). Opponent can take 1 to 15 (L). So opponent can win.\n\nTherefore, both options lead to opponent winning, so n=20 is L(20). So the losing positions continue as 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nSo the pattern between losing positions is indeed +3, +2, +3, +2, etc. So every two steps, adding 3 and 2 alternately. So starting at 2:\n\n2 +3=5,\n\n5 +2=7,\n\n7 +3=10,\n\n10 +2=12,\n\n12 +3=15,\n\n15 +2=17,\n\n17 +3=20,\n\n20 +2=22,\n\n22 +3=25,\n\n25 +2=27,\n\nand so on.\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 or 5 mod something? Wait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the sequence: 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,...\n\nLooking at modulo 5:\n\n2 mod5=2,\n\n5 mod5=0,\n\n7 mod5=2,\n\n10 mod5=0,\n\n12 mod5=2,\n\n15 mod5=0,\n\n17 mod5=2,\n\n20 mod5=0,\n\n22 mod5=2,\n\n25 mod5=0,\n\n27 mod5=2,...\n\nHmm, so alternates between 2 mod5 and 0 mod5. So starting at 2, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5? Wait, but 5 is 0 mod5, 7 is 2 mod5, 10 is 0 mod5, 12 is 2 mod5, etc. So yes, the losing positions are numbers that are either 0 or 2 mod5. Wait, let's check n=2: 2 mod5=2, yes. n=5:5 mod5=0. n=7:7 mod5=2. n=10:0. n=12:2. n=15:0, etc. So that seems to hold.\n\nWait, but let me check n=22: 22 mod5 is 2. n=25 mod5 is 0. n=27 mod5 is 2. So that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the losing positions are numbers where n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5?\n\nWait, let me check n=17:17 mod5 is 2, which is in the losing positions. n=20 mod5 is 0. So yes. But let's check n=1:1 mod5=1, which is a winning position. n=3 mod5=3, which is winning. n=4 mod5=4, which is winning. So the losing positions are exactly numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5. If that's the case, then the losing positions are all n where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nWait, but let me check n=20. 20 mod5 is 0, which is a losing position. n=22 mod5 is 2, which is a losing position. n=25 mod5 is 0, losing. So that seems to hold. But let me check n=1 mod5=1, which is a winning position, yes. n=3 mod5=3, which is W. n=4 mod5=4, which is W. So yeah, seems like the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5. Wait but let's check n=7 mod5=2, which is a losing position. n=12 mod5=2, yes. n=5 mod5=0, yes. So that seems to hold.\n\nWait, but let me check n=15 mod5=0, which is L. n=17 mod5=2, which is L. So the pattern seems to hold. Therefore, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5. Therefore, for any n, if n mod5 is 0 or 2, then it's a losing position. If not, it's a winning position. Wait, but let me confirm with another number, say n=27: 27 mod5=2, which should be a losing position. Let's see:\n\nn=27:\n\nTake 1 \u219226. 26 mod5 is 1 (since 25 is 0, so 26 is 1). 1 is a winning position, so opponent can win.\n\nTake4 \u219223. 23 mod5 is 3, which is a winning position. Opponent can move to 22 (L) by taking 1. So opponent can win. Therefore, n=27 is indeed a losing position. So that works.\n\nAnother test: n=6 mod5=1, which is a winning position, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5. Therefore, the answer is the number of integers \u22642024 that are congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nTherefore, we need to compute the count of numbers \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nTo compute this, let's compute the number of numbers \u22642024 congruent to 0 mod5, plus those congruent to 2 mod5.\n\nFirst, numbers congruent to 0 mod5: these are 5,10,..., up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nSimilarly, numbers congruent to 2 mod5: 2,7,12,..., up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nCompute each separately.\n\nFor numbers \u22610 mod5:\n\nThe first term is 5, the last term is the largest multiple of 5 \u22642024.\n\n2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so the last term is 5*404=2020.\n\nNumber of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1= 403 +1=404.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nThe formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last - first)/difference) +1.\n\nHere, first term a=5, last term l=2020, difference d=5.\n\nNumber of terms = (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1= 403 +1=404. Correct.\n\nFor numbers \u22612 mod5:\n\nFirst term is 2, then 7,12,..., up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nWhat's the last term? Let's compute 2024 divided by 5:\n\n2024 \u00f75 = 404.8, so 5*404=2020. 2020 +2=2022, which is 2 mod5. 2022 +5=2027 which is over. So the last term is 2022.\n\nSo first term a=2, last term l=2022, difference d=5.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1 =404 +1=405.\n\nWait, 2022-2=2020, divided by 5 is 404, plus 1 is 405. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, total losing positions up to 2024: 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5)= 809.\n\nBut wait, hold on, let me confirm the last term for 2 mod5 again.\n\nWait, 2022 is indeed 2 mod5 (2020 is 0 mod5, so 2020+2=2022). The next term would be 2027, which is beyond 2024, so yes, 2022 is the last term. So the count is indeed (2022-2)/5 +1= (2020)/5 +1=404+1=405.\n\nSimilarly for 0 mod5, last term 2020, so count is (2020-5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403+1=404.\n\nTotal is 404 +405=809.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 0 mod5 includes n=0? But the problem states positive integers n \u22642024, so starting from n=1. Therefore, 0 mod5 starts at 5, so that's correct. The count for 0 mod5 is numbers 5,10,...,2020, which is 404 numbers. Similarly, numbers congruent to 2 mod5 start at 2, so 2,7,...,2022, which is 405 numbers. So total 809.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller number to see if this holds.\n\nTake n=10. The losing positions up to 10 are 2,5,7,10. That's 4 numbers. Let's compute via formula.\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5 up to 10: 5,10 \u2192 2 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5 up to 10: 2,7 \u2192 2 numbers. Total 4, which matches. So that works.\n\nAnother check with n=12. Losing positions up to 12: 2,5,7,10,12 \u21925 numbers.\n\nUsing formula:\n\n0 mod5: up to 10 (since 12 isn't a multiple of 5). 5,10 \u21922 numbers.\n\n2 mod5: 2,7,12 (since 12 mod5 is 2). Wait 12 mod5 is 12-10=2, yes. So 2,7,12 \u21923 numbers. Total 2+3=5. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works here. So for n=2024, the total is 404+405=809. Therefore, the answer is 809.\n\nBut hold on, let me check another edge case. Let's say n=2. The count would be for n=2: numbers up to 2. The losing positions are 2, so count=1. Using formula:\n\n0 mod5: none (since 5>2). 2 mod5: 2 \u21921. So total 1. Correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=7. Losing positions up to 7: 2,5,7 \u21923 numbers.\n\nFormula:\n\n0 mod5 up to7:5 \u21921.\n\n2 mod5 up to7:2,7 \u21922. Total 3. Correct.\n\nOkay, so seems the formula works. Therefore, the answer should be 809. But let me confirm once again with the exact numbers.\n\nWait, let's recheck the count for 2 mod5 up to 2024.\n\nFirst term a=2, last term l=2022. The formula is (l - a)/d +1 = (2022 -2)/5 +1 = 2020/5 +1 =404 +1=405. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, 0 mod5: a=5, l=2020. (2020 -5)/5 +1=2015/5 +1=403 +1=404. Correct. So total 809.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 809. But wait, hold on. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.\"\n\nSince Bob is the second player, Bob can only force a win if the starting n is a losing position for the first player (Alice). Therefore, the losing positions are exactly the n where Bob can win with optimal play. So the count is indeed the number of losing positions up to 2024, which is 809. Therefore, the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check once again if my analysis of the losing positions is correct. Let me see n=15.\n\nn=15 is a losing position. Let me see:\n\nIf Alice starts with n=15, she can take 1, leaving 14 (W). Bob can then take 4 to leave 10 (L), putting Alice back into a losing position. Wait, but if Alice takes 1, leaving 14 (which is W for Bob), Bob can choose a move to L. So Bob can win. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4 from 15, leaving 11 (W). Bob can take 1 to leave 10 (L). Either way, Bob can force Alice into a losing position. Therefore, n=15 is indeed a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. That's correct.\n\nAnother check: n=2 mod5=2. For n=2, Alice takes 1, leaving 1, which Bob takes and wins. So Bob can win, so yes, n=2 is a losing position for Alice. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 809. Wait, but let me compute once again the numbers:\n\nNumbers congruent to 0 mod5 up to 2024:\n\nFirst term 5, last term 2020. The number of terms is (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1 =403+1=404. Correct.\n\nNumbers congruent to 2 mod5 up to 2024:\n\nFirst term 2, last term 2022. The number of terms is (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405. Correct.\n\nTotal 404 + 405 = 809. So yeah, that's solid. Therefore, the answer is 809.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{809}\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to identify the losing positions. A losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves. \n\nBy analyzing small values of \\( n \\), we observe a pattern in the losing positions. The losing positions are found to be numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5. \n\nTo verify this pattern:\n- For \\( n \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\) or \\( n \\equiv 2 \\mod 5 \\), the current player cannot force a win, making these losing positions.\n- For other values of \\( n \\), the current player can always move to a losing position, making them winning positions.\n\nNext, we count the numbers \\( \\leq 2024 \\) that are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.\n\n1. **Numbers congruent to 0 mod 5**:\n   - The sequence is 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020.\n   - The number of terms is \\(\\frac{2020 - 5}{5} + 1 = \\frac{2015}{5} + 1 = 403 + 1 = 404\\).\n\n2. **Numbers congruent to 2 mod 5**:\n   - The sequence is 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022.\n   - The number of terms is \\(\\frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = \\frac{2020}{5} + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405\\).\n\nSumming these counts gives the total number of losing positions:\n\\[ 404 + 405 = 809 \\]\n\nThus, the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) for which Bob has a winning strategy is \\(\\boxed{809}\\).",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. The question is about a game between Alice and Bob with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the one who takes the last token wins. We need to find how many numbers n \u2264 2024 are such that Bob has a winning strategy, no matter what Alice does.\n\nHmm, so first, I remember these types of games are often analyzed using dynamic programming or by finding a pattern in the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the current player cannot force a win, no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a winning position means the current player can force a win with the right moves.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the base cases and see if a pattern emerges.\n\nLet's denote by W(n) if the current player can force a win with n tokens left, and L(n) if they can't (i.e., it's a losing position). We need to find all n where the second player (Bob) can force a win, which would mean that n is a losing position for the first player (Alice). So essentially, we need to count all n \u2264 2024 where n is a losing position.\n\nStarting with small n:\n\nn=1: The first player takes 1 token and wins. So W(1).\n\nn=2: The first player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the second player, who then takes it and wins. Wait, no. Wait, if first player takes 1 from 2, leaves 1, then the second player takes that last one and wins. So actually, if n=2, the first player can't force a win? Wait, but wait, the first player could also take 4 tokens, but there's only 2, so that's not allowed. So the only move is to take 1. Then the second player takes the last one. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position for the first player. Wait, so that would mean L(2). But hold on, that contradicts my initial thought.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify:\n\nFor n=1: Current player takes 1 and wins. So W(1).\n\nn=2: Current player can only take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent who then takes it and wins. So current player (the one with n=2) will lose if the opponent plays optimally. Therefore, L(2).\n\nWait, so n=2 is a losing position. Hmm.\n\nn=3: Similarly, the current player can take 1, leaving 2 tokens. Since 2 is a losing position, the next player is in a losing position. Therefore, the current player can force a win by moving to 2. Therefore, W(3).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf n=3, current player takes 1, leaving n=2 (a losing position for the opponent). Therefore, current player can win. So W(3).\n\nAlternatively, taking 4 is not possible here, so only option is to take 1.\n\nn=4: Current player can take all 4 and win. So W(4).\n\nn=5: Current player can take 1, leaving 4, which is a winning position for the opponent (they can take 4 and win). Alternatively, take 4, leaving 1, which is a winning position for the opponent (they can take 1 and win). So no matter what the current player does, the opponent can win. Therefore, n=5 is a losing position? Wait, let's check:\n\nIf n=5, current player's options:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 leaves 4, opponent can take 4 and win.\n\nTake 4 \u2192 leaves 1, opponent takes 1 and wins.\n\nSo indeed, no matter what the current player does, opponent can win. So n=5 is L(5).\n\nn=6:\n\nCurrent player can take 1 \u2192 leaves 5 (a losing position for opponent). Therefore, current player can force a win. So W(6).\n\nAlternatively, taking 4 would leave 2, which is also a losing position. Wait, so taking 4 from 6 leaves 2 (L), so that's even better. So either way, the current player can choose between moving to L(5) or L(2). Therefore, W(6).\n\nWait, so n=6 is a winning position.\n\nn=7:\n\nCurrent player can take 1 \u2192 leaves 6 (W). Opponent can win from there.\n\nTake 4 \u2192 leaves 3 (W). Opponent can win.\n\nHmm, so both options leave the opponent in a winning position. Therefore, n=7 is a losing position?\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\nIf n=7, current player's moves:\n\n1. Take 1 \u2192 6 left. Since 6 is W, opponent can win. So opponent can force a win from 6.\n\n2. Take 4 \u2192 3 left. Since 3 is W, opponent can take 1 to leave 2 (L), then current player (original player) is in L. Wait, no, opponent would take 1 from 3, leaving 2, which is a losing position for the next player (the original player). So opponent can indeed win. So both moves from 7 lead to opponent winning. Therefore, n=7 is L(7).\n\nWait, that seems correct. So n=7 is a losing position.\n\nn=8:\n\nCurrent player can take 1 \u2192 7 (L). So opponent is in a losing position. Therefore, current player can win by moving to L(7). So W(8).\n\nAlternatively, take 4 \u2192 4 left, which is W(4). Opponent can take all 4 and win. Hmm, so if the current player takes 4 from 8, leaving 4, opponent can take 4 and win. Therefore, that move is bad. But since the current player can choose to take 1 and leave 7 (L), they can force a win. So n=8 is W(8).\n\nn=9:\n\nCurrent player can take 1 \u2192 8 (W). Opponent can win from there.\n\nTake 4 \u2192 5 (L). So opponent is in L(5). Therefore, if current player takes 4 from 9, leaving 5 (L), then opponent cannot win. Wait, so that's a good move. So taking 4 is a winning move. Therefore, n=9 is W(9).\n\nWait, so if the player takes 4 from 9, leaving 5 (L), then the opponent is in a losing position. Therefore, n=9 is a winning position.\n\nn=10:\n\nCurrent player can take 1 \u2192 9 (W). Opponent can win.\n\nTake 4 \u2192 6 (W). Opponent can win.\n\nTherefore, both moves lead to opponent winning. Therefore, n=10 is L(10).\n\nHmm, so n=10 is a losing position.\n\nWait, let's check again:\n\nn=10:\n\nIf current player takes 1, leaves 9, which is W. Opponent can take 4 to leave 5 (L), so opponent can win.\n\nIf current player takes 4, leaves 6 (W). Opponent can take 1 to leave 5 (L), so opponent can win.\n\nTherefore, no matter what current player does, opponent can win. So yes, L(10).\n\nContinuing:\n\nn=11:\n\nCurrent player can take 1 \u2192 10 (L). So opponent is in L, so current player can win. Therefore W(11).\n\nAlternatively, take 4 \u2192 7 (L). So opponent is in L. Either way, current player can move to L, so W(11).\n\nn=12:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 11 (W). Opponent can win.\n\nTake 4 \u2192 8 (W). Opponent can win.\n\nHmm, so both moves leave opponent in a winning position. Therefore, n=12 is L(12)?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, n=12: taking 1 leaves 11 (W). Opponent can take 4 to get to 7 (L), so opponent can win.\n\nTaking 4 leaves 8 (W). Opponent can take 1 to get to 7 (L), so opponent can win.\n\nTherefore, yes, n=12 is L(12).\n\nWait, but let me check n=12 again. Hmm.\n\nWait, so n=12 is a losing position? So the losing positions so far are n=2,5,7,10,12?\n\nWait, let me tabulate the results so far:\n\nn : W/L\n\n1: W\n\n2: L\n\n3: W\n\n4: W\n\n5: L\n\n6: W\n\n7: L\n\n8: W\n\n9: W\n\n10:L\n\n11:W\n\n12:L\n\nHmm, trying to see a pattern here. Let me list them up to n=12:\n\nLosing positions at 2,5,7,10,12.\n\nLooking at the differences between them: 2 to 5 is +3, 5 to 7 is +2, 7 to 10 is +3, 10 to 12 is +2. Hmm, alternating between adding 3 and 2? Let's see if that continues.\n\nContinuing:\n\nn=13:\n\nCurrent player can take 1 \u2192 12 (L). So opponent is in L. Therefore, current player can win. So W(13).\n\nTake 4 \u2192 9 (W). Opponent can win from there, but since the first move is possible to L, so W(13).\n\nn=14:\n\nTake 1 \u219213 (W). Opponent can take 1 to 12 (L), so opponent can win.\n\nTake 4 \u219210 (L). So leaving opponent at L(10). Therefore, current player can choose to take 4, leaving L(10), so opponent cannot win. Therefore, n=14 is W(14)?\n\nWait, hold on. If current player takes 4 from 14, leaving 10 (L). Since L means opponent can't win, so current player can force a win by doing that. So n=14 is W(14).\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me verify again.\n\nWait, n=14:\n\nIf you take 4, leaving 10, which is a losing position. So opponent is in L(10), so they can't force a win. So current player can win. So n=14 is W(14).\n\nWait, so n=14 is a winning position. Hmm.\n\nWait, so n=14 is W, so the next losing position might be?\n\nn=15:\n\nTake 1 \u219214 (W). Opponent can win.\n\nTake 4 \u219211 (W). Opponent can win.\n\nTherefore, both moves leave opponent in W positions, so current player can't force a win. Therefore, n=15 is L(15).\n\nSo adding n=15 as a losing position. The previous losing positions were 2,5,7,10,12,15. The differences between them are 3,2,3,2,3. So the pattern seems to be every 2 and 3 alternately? Let me see.\n\nSo starting at 2, then adding 3 to get 5, then 2 to get 7, then 3 to get 10, then 2 to get 12, then 3 to get 15. So the pattern of differences is 3,2,3,2,3, etc. So the losing positions are at 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,... and so on?\n\nContinuing further:\n\nn=16:\n\nTake 1 \u219215 (L). So opponent is in L, so current player can win by moving to 15. Therefore, W(16).\n\nTake 4 \u219212 (L). Also a losing position. So either way, current player can win. W(16).\n\nn=17:\n\nTake 1 \u219216 (W). Opponent can take 1 to 15 (L). So opponent can win.\n\nTake 4 \u219213 (W). Opponent can take 4 to 9, then... Hmm, opponent can choose a move to L. Wait, opponent would have 13, which is a winning position. Let's see:\n\nIf current player takes 4 from 17 to get 13, opponent can take 1 to get to 12 (L). So opponent can win. So both moves from 17 lead to opponent winning. Therefore, n=17 is L(17). So that continues the pattern.\n\nContinuing, n=18:\n\nTake 1 \u219217 (L). So opponent is in L, so current player can win. Therefore, W(18).\n\nTake 4 \u219214 (W). Opponent can win from there, but since the first move is possible to L, so W(18).\n\nn=19:\n\nTake 1 \u219218 (W). Opponent can take 1 to 17 (L). So opponent can win.\n\nTake 4 \u219215 (L). So leaving opponent at L(15). Therefore, current player can choose to take 4 and win. Wait, so taking 4 from 19 leaves 15 (L). Therefore, opponent is in losing position, so current player can win. Therefore, n=19 is W(19).\n\nWait, that contradicts the previous pattern. Wait, according to the previous pattern, after 17 (L), adding 3 would get to 20 (L). But here n=19 is W. Hmm, maybe my previous thought about the pattern was wrong?\n\nWait, let's check n=19 again.\n\nIf n=19, current player can take 4, leaving 15 (which is L). So opponent cannot win from 15. Therefore, current player can force a win. So n=19 is W(19). Therefore, the next losing position would be n=20?\n\nWait let's check n=20:\n\nTake 1 \u219219 (W). Opponent can take 4 to 15 (L). So opponent can win.\n\nTake 4 \u219216 (W). Opponent can take 1 to 15 (L). So opponent can win.\n\nTherefore, both options lead to opponent winning, so n=20 is L(20). So the losing positions continue as 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nSo the pattern between losing positions is indeed +3, +2, +3, +2, etc. So every two steps, adding 3 and 2 alternately. So starting at 2:\n\n2 +3=5,\n\n5 +2=7,\n\n7 +3=10,\n\n10 +2=12,\n\n12 +3=15,\n\n15 +2=17,\n\n17 +3=20,\n\n20 +2=22,\n\n22 +3=25,\n\n25 +2=27,\n\nand so on.\n\nSo the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 or 5 mod something? Wait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the sequence: 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,...\n\nLooking at modulo 5:\n\n2 mod5=2,\n\n5 mod5=0,\n\n7 mod5=2,\n\n10 mod5=0,\n\n12 mod5=2,\n\n15 mod5=0,\n\n17 mod5=2,\n\n20 mod5=0,\n\n22 mod5=2,\n\n25 mod5=0,\n\n27 mod5=2,...\n\nHmm, so alternates between 2 mod5 and 0 mod5. So starting at 2, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5? Wait, but 5 is 0 mod5, 7 is 2 mod5, 10 is 0 mod5, 12 is 2 mod5, etc. So yes, the losing positions are numbers that are either 0 or 2 mod5. Wait, let's check n=2: 2 mod5=2, yes. n=5:5 mod5=0. n=7:7 mod5=2. n=10:0. n=12:2. n=15:0, etc. So that seems to hold.\n\nWait, but let me check n=22: 22 mod5 is 2. n=25 mod5 is 0. n=27 mod5 is 2. So that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the losing positions are numbers where n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5?\n\nWait, let me check n=17:17 mod5 is 2, which is in the losing positions. n=20 mod5 is 0. So yes. But let's check n=1:1 mod5=1, which is a winning position. n=3 mod5=3, which is winning. n=4 mod5=4, which is winning. So the losing positions are exactly numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5. If that's the case, then the losing positions are all n where n mod5 is 0 or 2.\n\nWait, but let me check n=20. 20 mod5 is 0, which is a losing position. n=22 mod5 is 2, which is a losing position. n=25 mod5 is 0, losing. So that seems to hold. But let me check n=1 mod5=1, which is a winning position, yes. n=3 mod5=3, which is W. n=4 mod5=4, which is W. So yeah, seems like the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5. Wait but let's check n=7 mod5=2, which is a losing position. n=12 mod5=2, yes. n=5 mod5=0, yes. So that seems to hold.\n\nWait, but let me check n=15 mod5=0, which is L. n=17 mod5=2, which is L. So the pattern seems to hold. Therefore, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5. Therefore, for any n, if n mod5 is 0 or 2, then it's a losing position. If not, it's a winning position. Wait, but let me confirm with another number, say n=27: 27 mod5=2, which should be a losing position. Let's see:\n\nn=27:\n\nTake 1 \u219226. 26 mod5 is 1 (since 25 is 0, so 26 is 1). 1 is a winning position, so opponent can win.\n\nTake4 \u219223. 23 mod5 is 3, which is a winning position. Opponent can move to 22 (L) by taking 1. So opponent can win. Therefore, n=27 is indeed a losing position. So that works.\n\nAnother test: n=6 mod5=1, which is a winning position, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5. Therefore, the answer is the number of integers \u22642024 that are congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nTherefore, we need to compute the count of numbers \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nTo compute this, let's compute the number of numbers \u22642024 congruent to 0 mod5, plus those congruent to 2 mod5.\n\nFirst, numbers congruent to 0 mod5: these are 5,10,..., up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nSimilarly, numbers congruent to 2 mod5: 2,7,12,..., up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nCompute each separately.\n\nFor numbers \u22610 mod5:\n\nThe first term is 5, the last term is the largest multiple of 5 \u22642024.\n\n2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so the last term is 5*404=2020.\n\nNumber of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1= 403 +1=404.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nThe formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last - first)/difference) +1.\n\nHere, first term a=5, last term l=2020, difference d=5.\n\nNumber of terms = (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1= 403 +1=404. Correct.\n\nFor numbers \u22612 mod5:\n\nFirst term is 2, then 7,12,..., up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nWhat's the last term? Let's compute 2024 divided by 5:\n\n2024 \u00f75 = 404.8, so 5*404=2020. 2020 +2=2022, which is 2 mod5. 2022 +5=2027 which is over. So the last term is 2022.\n\nSo first term a=2, last term l=2022, difference d=5.\n\nNumber of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1 =404 +1=405.\n\nWait, 2022-2=2020, divided by 5 is 404, plus 1 is 405. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, total losing positions up to 2024: 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5)= 809.\n\nBut wait, hold on, let me confirm the last term for 2 mod5 again.\n\nWait, 2022 is indeed 2 mod5 (2020 is 0 mod5, so 2020+2=2022). The next term would be 2027, which is beyond 2024, so yes, 2022 is the last term. So the count is indeed (2022-2)/5 +1= (2020)/5 +1=404+1=405.\n\nSimilarly for 0 mod5, last term 2020, so count is (2020-5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403+1=404.\n\nTotal is 404 +405=809.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 0 mod5 includes n=0? But the problem states positive integers n \u22642024, so starting from n=1. Therefore, 0 mod5 starts at 5, so that's correct. The count for 0 mod5 is numbers 5,10,...,2020, which is 404 numbers. Similarly, numbers congruent to 2 mod5 start at 2, so 2,7,...,2022, which is 405 numbers. So total 809.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller number to see if this holds.\n\nTake n=10. The losing positions up to 10 are 2,5,7,10. That's 4 numbers. Let's compute via formula.\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5 up to 10: 5,10 \u2192 2 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5 up to 10: 2,7 \u2192 2 numbers. Total 4, which matches. So that works.\n\nAnother check with n=12. Losing positions up to 12: 2,5,7,10,12 \u21925 numbers.\n\nUsing formula:\n\n0 mod5: up to 10 (since 12 isn't a multiple of 5). 5,10 \u21922 numbers.\n\n2 mod5: 2,7,12 (since 12 mod5 is 2). Wait 12 mod5 is 12-10=2, yes. So 2,7,12 \u21923 numbers. Total 2+3=5. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works here. So for n=2024, the total is 404+405=809. Therefore, the answer is 809.\n\nBut hold on, let me check another edge case. Let's say n=2. The count would be for n=2: numbers up to 2. The losing positions are 2, so count=1. Using formula:\n\n0 mod5: none (since 5>2). 2 mod5: 2 \u21921. So total 1. Correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=7. Losing positions up to 7: 2,5,7 \u21923 numbers.\n\nFormula:\n\n0 mod5 up to7:5 \u21921.\n\n2 mod5 up to7:2,7 \u21922. Total 3. Correct.\n\nOkay, so seems the formula works. Therefore, the answer should be 809. But let me confirm once again with the exact numbers.\n\nWait, let's recheck the count for 2 mod5 up to 2024.\n\nFirst term a=2, last term l=2022. The formula is (l - a)/d +1 = (2022 -2)/5 +1 = 2020/5 +1 =404 +1=405. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, 0 mod5: a=5, l=2020. (2020 -5)/5 +1=2015/5 +1=403 +1=404. Correct. So total 809.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 809. But wait, hold on. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.\"\n\nSince Bob is the second player, Bob can only force a win if the starting n is a losing position for the first player (Alice). Therefore, the losing positions are exactly the n where Bob can win with optimal play. So the count is indeed the number of losing positions up to 2024, which is 809. Therefore, the answer is 809.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check once again if my analysis of the losing positions is correct. Let me see n=15.\n\nn=15 is a losing position. Let me see:\n\nIf Alice starts with n=15, she can take 1, leaving 14 (W). Bob can then take 4 to leave 10 (L), putting Alice back into a losing position. Wait, but if Alice takes 1, leaving 14 (which is W for Bob), Bob can choose a move to L. So Bob can win. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4 from 15, leaving 11 (W). Bob can take 1 to leave 10 (L). Either way, Bob can force Alice into a losing position. Therefore, n=15 is indeed a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. That's correct.\n\nAnother check: n=2 mod5=2. For n=2, Alice takes 1, leaving 1, which Bob takes and wins. So Bob can win, so yes, n=2 is a losing position for Alice. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 809. Wait, but let me compute once again the numbers:\n\nNumbers congruent to 0 mod5 up to 2024:\n\nFirst term 5, last term 2020. The number of terms is (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1 =403+1=404. Correct.\n\nNumbers congruent to 2 mod5 up to 2024:\n\nFirst term 2, last term 2022. The number of terms is (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405. Correct.\n\nTotal 404 + 405 = 809. So yeah, that's solid. Therefore, the answer is 809.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{809}\n\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to identify the losing positions. A losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves. \n\nBy analyzing small values of \\( n \\), we observe a pattern in the losing positions. The losing positions are found to be numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5. \n\nTo verify this pattern:\n- For \\( n \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\) or \\( n \\equiv 2 \\mod 5 \\), the current player cannot force a win, making these losing positions.\n- For other values of \\( n \\), the current player can always move to a losing position, making them winning positions.\n\nNext, we count the numbers \\( \\leq 2024 \\) that are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.\n\n1. **Numbers congruent to 0 mod 5**:\n   - The sequence is 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020.\n   - The number of terms is \\(\\frac{2020 - 5}{5} + 1 = \\frac{2015}{5} + 1 = 403 + 1 = 404\\).\n\n2. **Numbers congruent to 2 mod 5**:\n   - The sequence is 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022.\n   - The number of terms is \\(\\frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = \\frac{2020}{5} + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405\\).\n\nSumming these counts gives the total number of losing positions:\n\\[ 404 + 405 = 809 \\]\n\nThus, the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) for which Bob has a winning strategy is \\(\\boxed{809}\\).",
