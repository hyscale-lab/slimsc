      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes in set B. The boxes have a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I need to find r squared, express it as a fraction p/q, and find p + q. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box must have a diameter at least as large as the space diagonal of the box. Because the sphere has to enclose the box completely, the diagonal of the box would be the longest distance between any two vertices, so the sphere's diameter must be at least that. Therefore, the radius would be half of the space diagonal. So, the minimal radius r is half the space diagonal of the box. Therefore, to minimize r, we need to minimize the space diagonal of the box given the constraints of surface area 54 and volume 23.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem says \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B\". So, actually, we need to find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, and then take half of that as the radius. Because the sphere has to contain all boxes in B, so the sphere must be large enough to contain the box with the largest space diagonal. Therefore, r would be half of the maximum space diagonal over all boxes in B, so r squared would be ( (max space diagonal)^2 ) / 4. Therefore, we need to find the maximum space diagonal of boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, then square it and divide by 4, then write as p/q, etc.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure. The problem says \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B\". So, the sphere must contain every box in B. Therefore, the sphere's radius must be at least as large as the maximum of the half-space diagonals of all boxes in B. Therefore, to find the minimal such sphere, we need to take the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B, divide by 2, and that's the minimal radius r. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum space diagonal of boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. So, first, I need to model this optimization problem.\n\nLet me denote the dimensions of the box as x, y, z. Then, the surface area is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23. The space diagonal is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). So, we need to maximize sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) given those constraints. Since sqrt is a monotonic function, this is equivalent to maximizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2. So, the problem reduces to maximizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 with the constraints 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.\n\nHmm, okay. So, we need to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.\n\nI need to find the maximum possible value of x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 under these constraints. Let me see how to approach this. Maybe using Lagrange multipliers, but since it's a problem with three variables, perhaps there's a way to express variables in terms of each other?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use some inequalities or symmetric expressions. Let me note that x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx). Since we know that 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, so (xy + yz + zx) = 27. Therefore, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 54. Therefore, to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, we need to maximize (x + y + z)^2. So, equivalently, we need to maximize x + y + z, given that 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.\n\nHmm, so maybe we can set variables such that we can write equations in terms of x + y + z, xy + yz + zx, and xyz. Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xyz = 23, and Q = xy + yz + zx = 27. Then, we can think in terms of these variables.\n\nBut perhaps we can consider that x, y, z are roots of a cubic equation. Let me think. If x, y, z are roots of the equation t\u00b3 - S t\u00b2 + Q t - P = 0, then S, Q, P are the coefficients. But I don't know if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using AM \u2265 GM or other inequalities? Let me see. Since we have the product fixed, and the sum of products fixed, but trying to maximize the sum. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe fix two variables and express the third in terms of them. Let's see.\n\nLet me suppose variables x, y, z are positive real numbers. Let me try to set variables such that two variables are equal. Maybe the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? That's a common scenario in optimization problems with symmetry. Let me suppose that y = z. Then, perhaps we can express in terms of x and y.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let me set y = z. Then, the volume becomes x y\u00b2 = 23. The surface area becomes 2(xy + y z + z x) = 2(xy + y\u00b2 + x y) = 2(2xy + y\u00b2) = 54. Therefore, 2(2xy + y\u00b2) = 54 \u21d2 2xy + y\u00b2 = 27.\n\nSo, with variables x and y, we can write:\n\nFrom volume: x = 23/(y\u00b2)\n\nSubstitute into the surface area equation:\n\n2*(23/(y\u00b2))*y + y\u00b2 = 27 \u21d2 (46/y) + y\u00b2 = 27.\n\nMultiply both sides by y:\n\n46 + y\u00b3 = 27y \u21d2 y\u00b3 - 27y + 46 = 0.\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me see if there is a real solution here. Let me try plugging in y = 2: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0. Wait, 2\u00b3 is 8, 8 - 27*2 + 46 = 8 - 54 +46 = 0. Oh! So y=2 is a root. Therefore, we can factor (y - 2)(y\u00b2 + 2y -23) = 0.\n\nLet me check: (y - 2)(y\u00b2 + 2y -23) = y\u00b3 + 2y\u00b2 -23y -2y\u00b2 -4y +46 = y\u00b3 -27y +46? Wait, no. Let me actually multiply (y - 2)(y\u00b2 + 2y -23):\n\nFirst term: y*(y\u00b2 + 2y -23) = y\u00b3 + 2y\u00b2 -23y,\n\nSecond term: -2*(y\u00b2 + 2y -23) = -2y\u00b2 -4y +46,\n\nAdding together: y\u00b3 + (2y\u00b2 -2y\u00b2) + (-23y -4y) +46 = y\u00b3 -27y +46. Yes, exactly. So the cubic factors as (y - 2)(y\u00b2 + 2y -23) = 0. Therefore, the roots are y = 2, and y = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 + 92)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 \u00b1 2\u221a6.\n\nSince y must be positive, the other roots are -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248 -1 + 4.898 \u2248 3.898, which is positive, and -1 -2\u221a6 which is negative, so discard. Therefore, possible y values are 2 and approximately 3.898.\n\nTherefore, when y = 2, then x = 23/(2\u00b2) = 23/4 = 5.75. So the dimensions would be x = 23/4, y = 2, z = 2.\n\nAlternatively, when y = -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248 3.898, then x = 23/(y\u00b2). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute y = -1 + 2\u221a6. Let me compute y\u00b2:\n\ny = 2\u221a6 -1, so y\u00b2 = (2\u221a6)^2 - 4\u221a6 +1 = 24 -4\u221a6 +1 = 25 -4\u221a6.\n\nTherefore, x = 23 / (25 -4\u221a6). To rationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4\u221a6):\n\nx = 23*(25 +4\u221a6) / [ (25)^2 - (4\u221a6)^2 ] = 23*(25 +4\u221a6) / [625 - 16*6] = 23*(25 +4\u221a6)/(625 -96) = 23*(25 +4\u221a6)/529.\n\nSimplify 23 and 529: 529 is 23\u00b2, so 23/529 = 1/23. Thus,\n\nx = (25 +4\u221a6)/23.\n\nSo, the dimensions would be x = (25 +4\u221a6)/23, y = z = 2\u221a6 -1.\n\nHmm, okay, so these are two possible solutions when we set y = z. But are these the only critical points? Maybe there are other possibilities where variables are not equal. But perhaps the maximum occurs at one of these?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum of x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 occurs when two variables are equal, so this is a candidate. Let me check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, when y = z = 2, then the dimensions are x = 23/4, y = z = 2. Let me compute the space diagonal squared:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (23/4)^2 + 2*(2)^2 = (529/16) + 8 = (529 + 128)/16 = 657/16 \u2248 41.0625.\n\nSecond, when y = z = -1 + 2\u221a6, which is approximately 3.898, then x is (25 +4\u221a6)/23. Let me compute x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nFirst, compute y = z = 2\u221a6 -1. Let me compute y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 = (2\u221a6 -1)^2 = 24 -4\u221a6 +1 = 25 -4\u221a6.\n\nTherefore, x\u00b2 + 2y\u00b2 = [ (25 +4\u221a6)/23 ]\u00b2 + 2*(25 -4\u221a6).\n\nFirst, compute [ (25 +4\u221a6)/23 ]\u00b2:\n\nLet me compute numerator: (25 +4\u221a6)^2 = 25\u00b2 + 2*25*4\u221a6 + (4\u221a6)^2 = 625 + 200\u221a6 + 16*6 = 625 + 200\u221a6 + 96 = 721 + 200\u221a6.\n\nTherefore, x\u00b2 = (721 + 200\u221a6)/(23\u00b2) = (721 +200\u221a6)/529.\n\nThen, 2y\u00b2 = 2*(25 -4\u221a6) = 50 -8\u221a6.\n\nTherefore, total x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (721 +200\u221a6)/529 + 50 -8\u221a6.\n\nHmm, that seems complicated. Let me convert everything to over 529 denominator.\n\nFirst, 50 is 50*529/529 = 26450/529,\n\nand -8\u221a6 is -8\u221a6 *529/529.\n\nSo total:\n\n[721 +200\u221a6 +26450 -8\u221a6*529 ] /529.\n\nWait, this might not be the best way. Maybe better to compute numerically?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute numerically to see which case gives a larger value.\n\nFirst case:\n\nx = 23/4 = 5.75, y = z = 2.\n\nSpace diagonal squared: (5.75)^2 + 2*(2)^2 = 33.0625 + 8 = 41.0625.\n\nSecond case:\n\nCompute y = 2\u221a6 -1 \u2248 2*2.449 -1 \u2248 4.898 -1 \u2248 3.898.\n\nThen x = (25 +4\u221a6)/23 \u2248 (25 +4*2.449)/23 \u2248 (25 +9.796)/23 \u2248 34.796 /23 \u2248 1.513.\n\nThen x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 \u2248 (1.513)^2 + 2*(3.898)^2 \u2248 2.289 + 2*(15.192) \u2248 2.289 +30.384 \u2248 32.673. Wait, that's less than 41.0625?\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, maybe my calculation is wrong.\n\nWait, if y and z are both approximately 3.898, so their squares are about 15.19 each, so two of them would be 30.384, plus x squared, which is (1.513)^2 \u2248 2.289, so total is around 32.673? That's actually smaller than the first case. Hmm. So the first case where y = z = 2 gives a larger space diagonal.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the maximum is in that first case? But wait, but when I set two variables equal, maybe there are other configurations where variables aren't equal that could give a larger space diagonal?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when all variables are equal? Let me check if that's possible.\n\nIf the box were a cube, then all sides equal, so x = y = z. Then, surface area would be 6x\u00b2 =54 \u21d2 x\u00b2=9 \u21d2 x=3. Volume would be x\u00b3=27. But the volume here is 23, which is less than 27, so a cube is not possible here. Therefore, the box is not a cube.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another symmetric case. But perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal. Since when we set y = z, the first case gives a larger space diagonal, maybe that's the maximum. But perhaps we can confirm.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of another approach. Let me consider that we have two equations: xyz=23 and 2(xy + yz + zx)=54. Let me denote variables as x, y, z. Let me think of x, y, z as variables with these constraints and try to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use Lagrange multipliers. Let me try that.\n\nLet me set up the Lagrangian function:\n\nL = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 - \u03bb(2(xy + yz + zx) -54) - \u03bc(xyz -23)\n\nTake partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, set to zero.\n\nPartial derivative w.r. to x:\n\n2x - \u03bb(2(y + z)) - \u03bc(y z) =0\n\nSimilarly, partial derivative w.r. to y:\n\n2y - \u03bb(2(x + z)) - \u03bc(x z) =0\n\nPartial derivative w.r. to z:\n\n2z - \u03bb(2(x + y)) - \u03bc(x y) =0\n\nAlso, the constraints:\n\n2(xy + yz + zx)=54,\n\nxyz=23.\n\nHmm, this gives a system of equations. Let me see if we can find some symmetry here.\n\nSuppose that two variables are equal, say y = z. Let me check if this satisfies the equations.\n\nAssume y = z. Let me denote y = z. Then, the first equation (for x):\n\n2x - \u03bb(2(y + y)) - \u03bc(y\u00b2) = 0 \u21d2 2x - 4\u03bb y - \u03bc y\u00b2 =0\n\nSecond equation (for y):\n\n2y - \u03bb(2(x + y)) - \u03bc(x y) =0 \u21d2 2y - 2\u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc x y =0\n\nThird equation (for z):\n\nSame as the second equation since z=y. So, the third equation is redundant.\n\nSo, with y = z, we have two equations:\n\n1) 2x -4\u03bb y - \u03bc y\u00b2 =0,\n\n2) 2y -2\u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc x y =0,\n\nplus the constraints:\n\n2(xy + y\u00b2 + x y) = 2(2xy + y\u00b2) =54,\n\nand x y\u00b2 =23.\n\nSo, this is exactly the same as the case we considered earlier where we set y = z. Therefore, the critical points when two variables are equal are valid critical points for the Lagrangian. Since when we found y =2 and y \u22483.898, perhaps those are the only critical points when variables are equal. Since in the first case, when y=2, we get a higher space diagonal, so that might be the maximum?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is another critical point where all variables are different. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that x, y, z are all different. Then, the equations from the Lagrangian must hold. Let me see if I can find a relationship between variables.\n\nLooking at the three partial derivatives:\n\n2x - 2\u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc y z =0,\n\n2y - 2\u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc x z =0,\n\n2z - 2\u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc x y =0.\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n[2y - 2\u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc x z] - [2x - 2\u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc y z] =0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n2y -2x -2\u03bb(x + z - y - z) - \u03bc(x z - y z) =0,\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n2(y -x) -2\u03bb(x - y) - \u03bc z (x - y) =0,\n\nFactor out (y -x):\n\n(y -x)[2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc z] =0.\n\nSimilarly, since variables can be different, (y -x) is not zero, so the term in brackets must be zero:\n\n2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc z =0,\n\nSimilarly, subtracting second equation from third equation:\n\n[2z -2\u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc x y] - [2y -2\u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc x z] =0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n2(z - y) -2\u03bb(y - z) - \u03bc x (y - z) =0,\n\nFactor out (z - y):\n\n(z - y)[2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc x] =0,\n\nAgain, since z \u2260 y (assuming all variables different), then:\n\n2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc x =0,\n\nSimilarly, subtract first and third equations:\n\n[2x -2\u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc y z] - [2z -2\u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc x y] =0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n2(x - z) -2\u03bb(y + z - x - y) - \u03bc(y z - x y) =0,\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n2(x - z) -2\u03bb(z -x) - \u03bc y (z -x) =0,\n\nFactor out (x - z):\n\n(x - z)[2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc y] =0,\n\nAgain, if variables are different, x \u2260 z, so:\n\n2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc y =0,\n\nTherefore, from the above three differences, we have:\n\n2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc z =0,\n\n2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc x =0,\n\n2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc y =0,\n\nTherefore, all three expressions must be equal to zero. Therefore,\n\n\u03bc z = \u03bc x = \u03bc y = -2 -2\u03bb,\n\nThus, unless \u03bc =0, which would require 2 +2\u03bb =0, but let's see.\n\nSuppose \u03bc \u22600. Then, from \u03bc z = \u03bc x \u21d2 z =x,\n\nSimilarly, \u03bc x = \u03bc y \u21d2 x = y,\n\nTherefore, all variables must be equal: x = y = z.\n\nBut in that case, as before, the volume would be x\u00b3 =23, but surface area would be 6x\u00b2 =54 \u21d2 x\u00b2=9 \u21d2 x=3, but 3\u00b3=27 \u226023. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, the case where variables are all different cannot satisfy the Lagrangian conditions unless \u03bc =0.\n\nIf \u03bc =0, then from the equations above, 2 +2\u03bb =0 \u21d2 \u03bb = -1.\n\nThen, going back to the partial derivatives:\n\n2x - 2\u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc y z = 2x -2*(-1)(y + z) -0 = 2x + 2(y + z)=0,\n\nSimilarly,\n\n2y + 2(x + z)=0,\n\n2z +2(x + y)=0,\n\nSo, 2x +2y +2z =0,\n\nBut since x, y, z are positive (dimensions), their sum cannot be zero. Therefore, \u03bc=0 is impossible.\n\nThus, the only critical points occur when two variables are equal, so the critical points we found earlier are the only possibilities. Therefore, the maximum occurs at one of those.\n\nSince when y = z =2, the space diagonal squared is 657/16 \u224841.0625, and when y = z \u22483.898, it is \u224832.67, so the first case is larger. Therefore, that's the maximum.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the second case, the space diagonal was smaller. Therefore, the maximum occurs at y = z =2, x =23/4. Therefore, the maximum space diagonal squared is (23/4)^2 + 2*(2)^2 = (529/16) + 8 = (529 + 128)/16 = 657/16. Therefore, the radius squared is (657/16)/4 = 657/(16*4)=657/64.\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, the space diagonal squared is 657/16, so the radius is half the diagonal, so radius squared is ( (sqrt(657/16)) / 2 )\u00b2 = (657/16)/4 = 657/64.\n\nBut let me check if 657 and 64 are coprime. 657 divided by 3 is 219, so 657 = 3*219 = 3*3*73. 64 is 2^6. So no common factors. So 657/64 is reduced, so p =657, q=64, so p+q=721. Wait, but before I jump to conclusion, let me confirm.\n\nWait, but is that the maximum?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe there are other critical points when variables are not equal. But according to the Lagrangian analysis, the only critical points are when two variables are equal, so the maximum must be at one of those. Since the other critical point gives a smaller space diagonal, then the maximum is at the first case, so the radius squared would be 657/64, so 657+64=721.\n\nBut let me check if there are other possibilities where two variables are equal but with different assignments. For example, maybe set x = z instead? But due to symmetry, it's the same as setting y = z. So, the result should be same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set x = y, but different from z. Let me try that as well to confirm.\n\nSuppose x = y. Then, volume is x\u00b2 z =23,\n\nSurface area: 2(x\u00b2 + 2x z) =54 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + 2x z =27.\n\nExpress z from volume: z =23/(x\u00b2). Substitute into surface area equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2x*(23/x\u00b2) =27 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + 46/x =27.\n\nMultiply by x: x\u00b3 +46 =27x \u21d2x\u00b3 -27x +46=0.\n\nLooking for real roots. Let me try x=2: 8 -54 +46=0. So x=2 is a root again. Then factor as (x-2)(x\u00b2 +2x -23)=0, same as before. So x=2, then z=23/(4). So dimensions are x=y=2, z=23/4. Which is the same as the first case, just swapping variables. So the space diagonal is the same. Therefore, same result.\n\nAlternatively, the other root x = -1 +2\u221a6, then z=23/(x\u00b2). Which would lead to the same as before but variables swapped. So that case gives the same lower value.\n\nTherefore, indeed the maximum occurs when two sides are 2 and the third is 23/4. So the space diagonal squared is (23/4)^2 + 2*(2)^2 = (529/16)+(8)= 529/16 +128/16= 657/16. So radius is half the diagonal, so radius squared is 657/(16*4)=657/64. Since 657 and 64 are coprime (since 657 is 3\u00d7219=3\u00d73\u00d773 and 64 is 2^6, no common factors), so p=657, q=64, so p+q=721.\n\nWait, but before I settle on this answer, I want to ensure that there are no other configurations where the space diagonal is larger. For example, maybe when variables are not set equal?\n\nSuppose, for instance, that the variables are all different. But according to the Lagrangian analysis, there are no such critical points. The only critical points are when two variables are equal, so the maximum must be at those points. Since the other critical point gives a smaller value, the first case is the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a case where variables are arranged such that one is very small and others compensate? Let me test with some numbers.\n\nSuppose, for example, that x approaches zero. Then, volume xyz=23 requires that y or z also approach infinity, but surface area 2(xy + yz + zx)=54. Let me see:\n\nSuppose x approaches zero, so y and z must satisfy y z \u224823/x (from volume), but as x approaches zero, y z must approach infinity. However, the surface area term 2(xy + y z + zx) \u2248 2(y z) must equal 54. So 2 y z \u224854 \u21d2 y z \u224827. But from the volume, y z \u224823/x. So 23/x \u224827 \u21d2 x\u224823/27. So x can't approach zero. Instead, if x is small, say x=1, then y z =23, and surface area:\n\n2( y + z + y z ) =54 \u21d2 2(y + z +23)=54 \u21d2 y + z +23=27 \u21d2 y + z =4. But with y z=23. So solving y + z =4 and y z=23. The quadratic equation t\u00b2 -4t +23=0. Discriminant 16 -92= -76 <0. So no real solutions. So x cannot be 1.\n\nIf x=1.5, then y z=23/(1.5)=15.333...\n\nSurface area: 2(1.5 y +1.5 z + y z)=54 \u21d2 3(y + z) + 2*(15.333)=54 \u21d2 3(y+z)=54 -30.666\u224823.333 \u21d2 y+z\u22487.777.\n\nSo y and z must satisfy y+z\u22487.777 and y z\u224815.333. Then quadratic equation t\u00b2 -7.777 t +15.333\u22480. Discriminant\u2248(7.777)^2 -4*15.333\u224860.48 -61.33\u2248-0.85. Still negative. Not possible.\n\nx=2, then we have the case we had earlier, which works.\n\nx=3: y z=23/9\u22482.555...\n\nSurface area: 2(3y +3 z + y z)=54 \u21d26(y+z) +2*2.555\u224854 \u21d26(y+z)\u224854 -5.111\u224848.889 \u21d2 y+z\u22488.148.\n\nThen quadratic equation t\u00b2 -8.148 t +2.555\u22480. Discriminant\u224866.39 -10.22\u224856.17, so roots are real. So possible. Let me compute exact:\n\nIf x=3, then volume: 3 y z=23 \u21d2 y z=23/3\u22487.6667 (Wait, wait, no, 23 divided by 3 is \u22487.6667, but above I thought 23/9. Wait, no, x=3, so volume xyz=3 y z =23 \u21d2 y z=23/3\u22487.6667.\n\nThen surface area:\n\n2(3y +3 z + y z)=54 \u21d26(y+z) +2*(23/3)=54 \u21d26(y+z)=54 - (46/3)= (162/3 -46/3)=116/3 \u21d2 y + z= (116/3)/6=116/18=58/9\u22486.4444.\n\nTherefore, quadratic equation t\u00b2 - (58/9) t +23/3=0.\n\nMultiply all terms by 9: 9t\u00b2 -58 t +69=0. Discriminant: 58\u00b2 -4*9*69 = 3364 - 2484= 880. sqrt(880)=sqrt(16*55)=4\u221a55\u224829.66.\n\nSolutions: [58 \u00b14\u221a55]/18. So real solutions. Therefore, there is a solution with x=3, but let's compute the space diagonal squared:\n\nx=3, y and z satisfy y + z=58/9\u22486.444, y z=23/3\u22487.6667.\n\nCompute y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (y + z)^2 - 2 y z = (58/9)^2 - 2*(23/3).\n\nCalculate (58/9)^2 = (3364)/81 \u224841.53,\n\n2*(23/3)=46/3\u224815.333,\n\nThus, y\u00b2 + z\u00b2\u224841.53 -15.33\u224826.2.\n\nTherefore, total x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=9 +26.2\u224835.2, which is less than 41.0625. So, indeed, smaller than the first case.\n\nTherefore, even when variables are different, the maximum seems to be when two variables are 2 and the third is 23/4.\n\nAlternatively, let me check another value. Suppose x=4, then y z=23/4\u22485.75.\n\nSurface area:\n\n2(4y +4 z + y z)=54 \u21d28(y + z) +2*(5.75)=54 \u21d28(y+z)=54 -11.5=42.5 \u21d2 y + z=5.3125.\n\nThus, quadratic equation t\u00b2 -5.3125 t +5.75=0.\n\nDiscriminant: 5.3125\u00b2 -4*5.75\u224828.22 -23\u22485.22. Real roots. Then, space diagonal squared:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 16 + (y + z)^2 -2 y z =16 + (5.3125)^2 -2*(5.75).\n\nCompute 5.3125 squared: approx 28.22, so 28.22 -11.5=16.72, plus 16 gives 32.72, which is still less than 41.\n\nTherefore, this case is worse.\n\nAlternatively, x=23/4=5.75, which was the first case, so that's the maximum.\n\nTherefore, it's safe to say that the maximum space diagonal squared is 657/16, so r squared is 657/64, so p+q=657+64=721.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. The problem states \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B\". So, we need to make sure that all boxes in B are contained in the sphere of radius r. So, the sphere must contain all boxes, so the sphere's radius must be at least as large as the maximum of (space diagonal)/2 over all boxes in B. So, if the maximum space diagonal is indeed 657/16 under the square root, then r squared is (657/16)/4 =657/64. So, yes.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other boxes in B with a larger space diagonal. Suppose, for example, if one dimension is very large and another very small. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nSuppose, for example, let me take x approaching infinity. Then, to keep volume fixed at 23, y z must approach zero. But then surface area 2(xy + y z + x z)=54. If x is very large, then terms xy and xz dominate. So, 2x(y + z) \u224854 \u21d2 y + z \u224827/x. But since x is large, y and z are approaching zero. But volume is x y z =23. If y and z are approaching zero, their product y z must approach 23/x. But with y + z \u224827/x, so maybe y and z are both ~ sqrt( (23/x) )? Not sure, but let me see.\n\nLet me set y = z for simplicity. Then, as x approaches infinity, y = z \u2248 sqrt(23/(x)). Then surface area:\n\n2(xy + y z + x z)=2(x y + y\u00b2 +x y)=2(2x y + y\u00b2). With y\u2248sqrt(23/x), so 2x y \u22482x*sqrt(23/x)=2 sqrt(23 x). The term y\u00b2 is 23/x. Therefore, total surface area \u22482*(2 sqrt(23x) + 23/x). For this to equal 54 as x approaches infinity, the sqrt(23x) term would dominate, leading to surface area approaching infinity, which contradicts the requirement of surface area being 54. Therefore, x can't approach infinity.\n\nSimilarly, if we try to make one side very large, it's not possible without violating the surface area constraint. Therefore, the maximum space diagonal is indeed achieved at the case when two sides are 2 and the third is 23/4. Hence, the answer should be 657 + 64 = 721.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the calculation of space diagonal squared again:\n\nx =23/4, y = z =2.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = (23/4)^2 = 529/16,\n\ny\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 4 +4=8,\n\nTotal x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =529/16 +8 =529/16 +128/16 =657/16. Correct.\n\nTherefore, radius squared is (sqrt(657/16)/2)^2 = (657/16)/4 =657/64. So yes, 657 and 64 are coprime? Let me check.\n\n657 divided by 3 is 219, 219 divided by 3 is 73. So prime factors of 657 are 3,3,73. 64 is 2^6. No common factors. So yes, reduced fraction. So p+q=657+64=721. So the answer is 721.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{721}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes in set B. The boxes have a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I need to find r squared, express it as a fraction p/q, and find p + q. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box must have a diameter at least as large as the space diagonal of the box. Because the sphere has to enclose the box completely, the diagonal of the box would be the longest distance between any two vertices, so the sphere's diameter must be at least that. Therefore, the radius would be half of the space diagonal. So, the minimal radius r is half the space diagonal of the box. Therefore, to minimize r, we need to minimize the space diagonal of the box given the constraints of surface area 54 and volume 23.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem says \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B\". So, actually, we need to find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, and then take half of that as the radius. Because the sphere has to contain all boxes in B, so the sphere must be large enough to contain the box with the largest space diagonal. Therefore, r would be half of the maximum space diagonal over all boxes in B, so r squared would be ( (max space diagonal)^2 ) / 4. Therefore, we need to find the maximum space diagonal of boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, then square it and divide by 4, then write as p/q, etc.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure. The problem says \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B\". So, the sphere must contain every box in B. Therefore, the sphere's radius must be at least as large as the maximum of the half-space diagonals of all boxes in B. Therefore, to find the minimal such sphere, we need to take the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B, divide by 2, and that's the minimal radius r. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum space diagonal of boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. So, first, I need to model this optimization problem.\n\nLet me denote the dimensions of the box as x, y, z. Then, the surface area is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23. The space diagonal is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). So, we need to maximize sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) given those constraints. Since sqrt is a monotonic function, this is equivalent to maximizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2. So, the problem reduces to maximizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 with the constraints 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.\n\nHmm, okay. So, we need to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.\n\nI need to find the maximum possible value of x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 under these constraints. Let me see how to approach this. Maybe using Lagrange multipliers, but since it's a problem with three variables, perhaps there's a way to express variables in terms of each other?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use some inequalities or symmetric expressions. Let me note that x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx). Since we know that 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, so (xy + yz + zx) = 27. Therefore, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 54. Therefore, to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, we need to maximize (x + y + z)^2. So, equivalently, we need to maximize x + y + z, given that 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.\n\nHmm, so maybe we can set variables such that we can write equations in terms of x + y + z, xy + yz + zx, and xyz. Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xyz = 23, and Q = xy + yz + zx = 27. Then, we can think in terms of these variables.\n\nBut perhaps we can consider that x, y, z are roots of a cubic equation. Let me think. If x, y, z are roots of the equation t\u00b3 - S t\u00b2 + Q t - P = 0, then S, Q, P are the coefficients. But I don't know if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using AM \u2265 GM or other inequalities? Let me see. Since we have the product fixed, and the sum of products fixed, but trying to maximize the sum. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe fix two variables and express the third in terms of them. Let's see.\n\nLet me suppose variables x, y, z are positive real numbers. Let me try to set variables such that two variables are equal. Maybe the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? That's a common scenario in optimization problems with symmetry. Let me suppose that y = z. Then, perhaps we can express in terms of x and y.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let me set y = z. Then, the volume becomes x y\u00b2 = 23. The surface area becomes 2(xy + y z + z x) = 2(xy + y\u00b2 + x y) = 2(2xy + y\u00b2) = 54. Therefore, 2(2xy + y\u00b2) = 54 \u21d2 2xy + y\u00b2 = 27.\n\nSo, with variables x and y, we can write:\n\nFrom volume: x = 23/(y\u00b2)\n\nSubstitute into the surface area equation:\n\n2*(23/(y\u00b2))*y + y\u00b2 = 27 \u21d2 (46/y) + y\u00b2 = 27.\n\nMultiply both sides by y:\n\n46 + y\u00b3 = 27y \u21d2 y\u00b3 - 27y + 46 = 0.\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me see if there is a real solution here. Let me try plugging in y = 2: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0. Wait, 2\u00b3 is 8, 8 - 27*2 + 46 = 8 - 54 +46 = 0. Oh! So y=2 is a root. Therefore, we can factor (y - 2)(y\u00b2 + 2y -23) = 0.\n\nLet me check: (y - 2)(y\u00b2 + 2y -23) = y\u00b3 + 2y\u00b2 -23y -2y\u00b2 -4y +46 = y\u00b3 -27y +46? Wait, no. Let me actually multiply (y - 2)(y\u00b2 + 2y -23):\n\nFirst term: y*(y\u00b2 + 2y -23) = y\u00b3 + 2y\u00b2 -23y,\n\nSecond term: -2*(y\u00b2 + 2y -23) = -2y\u00b2 -4y +46,\n\nAdding together: y\u00b3 + (2y\u00b2 -2y\u00b2) + (-23y -4y) +46 = y\u00b3 -27y +46. Yes, exactly. So the cubic factors as (y - 2)(y\u00b2 + 2y -23) = 0. Therefore, the roots are y = 2, and y = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 + 92)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 \u00b1 2\u221a6.\n\nSince y must be positive, the other roots are -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248 -1 + 4.898 \u2248 3.898, which is positive, and -1 -2\u221a6 which is negative, so discard. Therefore, possible y values are 2 and approximately 3.898.\n\nTherefore, when y = 2, then x = 23/(2\u00b2) = 23/4 = 5.75. So the dimensions would be x = 23/4, y = 2, z = 2.\n\nAlternatively, when y = -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248 3.898, then x = 23/(y\u00b2). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute y = -1 + 2\u221a6. Let me compute y\u00b2:\n\ny = 2\u221a6 -1, so y\u00b2 = (2\u221a6)^2 - 4\u221a6 +1 = 24 -4\u221a6 +1 = 25 -4\u221a6.\n\nTherefore, x = 23 / (25 -4\u221a6). To rationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4\u221a6):\n\nx = 23*(25 +4\u221a6) / [ (25)^2 - (4\u221a6)^2 ] = 23*(25 +4\u221a6) / [625 - 16*6] = 23*(25 +4\u221a6)/(625 -96) = 23*(25 +4\u221a6)/529.\n\nSimplify 23 and 529: 529 is 23\u00b2, so 23/529 = 1/23. Thus,\n\nx = (25 +4\u221a6)/23.\n\nSo, the dimensions would be x = (25 +4\u221a6)/23, y = z = 2\u221a6 -1.\n\nHmm, okay, so these are two possible solutions when we set y = z. But are these the only critical points? Maybe there are other possibilities where variables are not equal. But perhaps the maximum occurs at one of these?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum of x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 occurs when two variables are equal, so this is a candidate. Let me check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, when y = z = 2, then the dimensions are x = 23/4, y = z = 2. Let me compute the space diagonal squared:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (23/4)^2 + 2*(2)^2 = (529/16) + 8 = (529 + 128)/16 = 657/16 \u2248 41.0625.\n\nSecond, when y = z = -1 + 2\u221a6, which is approximately 3.898, then x is (25 +4\u221a6)/23. Let me compute x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nFirst, compute y = z = 2\u221a6 -1. Let me compute y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 = (2\u221a6 -1)^2 = 24 -4\u221a6 +1 = 25 -4\u221a6.\n\nTherefore, x\u00b2 + 2y\u00b2 = [ (25 +4\u221a6)/23 ]\u00b2 + 2*(25 -4\u221a6).\n\nFirst, compute [ (25 +4\u221a6)/23 ]\u00b2:\n\nLet me compute numerator: (25 +4\u221a6)^2 = 25\u00b2 + 2*25*4\u221a6 + (4\u221a6)^2 = 625 + 200\u221a6 + 16*6 = 625 + 200\u221a6 + 96 = 721 + 200\u221a6.\n\nTherefore, x\u00b2 = (721 + 200\u221a6)/(23\u00b2) = (721 +200\u221a6)/529.\n\nThen, 2y\u00b2 = 2*(25 -4\u221a6) = 50 -8\u221a6.\n\nTherefore, total x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (721 +200\u221a6)/529 + 50 -8\u221a6.\n\nHmm, that seems complicated. Let me convert everything to over 529 denominator.\n\nFirst, 50 is 50*529/529 = 26450/529,\n\nand -8\u221a6 is -8\u221a6 *529/529.\n\nSo total:\n\n[721 +200\u221a6 +26450 -8\u221a6*529 ] /529.\n\nWait, this might not be the best way. Maybe better to compute numerically?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute numerically to see which case gives a larger value.\n\nFirst case:\n\nx = 23/4 = 5.75, y = z = 2.\n\nSpace diagonal squared: (5.75)^2 + 2*(2)^2 = 33.0625 + 8 = 41.0625.\n\nSecond case:\n\nCompute y = 2\u221a6 -1 \u2248 2*2.449 -1 \u2248 4.898 -1 \u2248 3.898.\n\nThen x = (25 +4\u221a6)/23 \u2248 (25 +4*2.449)/23 \u2248 (25 +9.796)/23 \u2248 34.796 /23 \u2248 1.513.\n\nThen x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 \u2248 (1.513)^2 + 2*(3.898)^2 \u2248 2.289 + 2*(15.192) \u2248 2.289 +30.384 \u2248 32.673. Wait, that's less than 41.0625?\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, maybe my calculation is wrong.\n\nWait, if y and z are both approximately 3.898, so their squares are about 15.19 each, so two of them would be 30.384, plus x squared, which is (1.513)^2 \u2248 2.289, so total is around 32.673? That's actually smaller than the first case. Hmm. So the first case where y = z = 2 gives a larger space diagonal.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the maximum is in that first case? But wait, but when I set two variables equal, maybe there are other configurations where variables aren't equal that could give a larger space diagonal?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when all variables are equal? Let me check if that's possible.\n\nIf the box were a cube, then all sides equal, so x = y = z. Then, surface area would be 6x\u00b2 =54 \u21d2 x\u00b2=9 \u21d2 x=3. Volume would be x\u00b3=27. But the volume here is 23, which is less than 27, so a cube is not possible here. Therefore, the box is not a cube.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another symmetric case. But perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal. Since when we set y = z, the first case gives a larger space diagonal, maybe that's the maximum. But perhaps we can confirm.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of another approach. Let me consider that we have two equations: xyz=23 and 2(xy + yz + zx)=54. Let me denote variables as x, y, z. Let me think of x, y, z as variables with these constraints and try to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use Lagrange multipliers. Let me try that.\n\nLet me set up the Lagrangian function:\n\nL = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 - \u03bb(2(xy + yz + zx) -54) - \u03bc(xyz -23)\n\nTake partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, set to zero.\n\nPartial derivative w.r. to x:\n\n2x - \u03bb(2(y + z)) - \u03bc(y z) =0\n\nSimilarly, partial derivative w.r. to y:\n\n2y - \u03bb(2(x + z)) - \u03bc(x z) =0\n\nPartial derivative w.r. to z:\n\n2z - \u03bb(2(x + y)) - \u03bc(x y) =0\n\nAlso, the constraints:\n\n2(xy + yz + zx)=54,\n\nxyz=23.\n\nHmm, this gives a system of equations. Let me see if we can find some symmetry here.\n\nSuppose that two variables are equal, say y = z. Let me check if this satisfies the equations.\n\nAssume y = z. Let me denote y = z. Then, the first equation (for x):\n\n2x - \u03bb(2(y + y)) - \u03bc(y\u00b2) = 0 \u21d2 2x - 4\u03bb y - \u03bc y\u00b2 =0\n\nSecond equation (for y):\n\n2y - \u03bb(2(x + y)) - \u03bc(x y) =0 \u21d2 2y - 2\u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc x y =0\n\nThird equation (for z):\n\nSame as the second equation since z=y. So, the third equation is redundant.\n\nSo, with y = z, we have two equations:\n\n1) 2x -4\u03bb y - \u03bc y\u00b2 =0,\n\n2) 2y -2\u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc x y =0,\n\nplus the constraints:\n\n2(xy + y\u00b2 + x y) = 2(2xy + y\u00b2) =54,\n\nand x y\u00b2 =23.\n\nSo, this is exactly the same as the case we considered earlier where we set y = z. Therefore, the critical points when two variables are equal are valid critical points for the Lagrangian. Since when we found y =2 and y \u22483.898, perhaps those are the only critical points when variables are equal. Since in the first case, when y=2, we get a higher space diagonal, so that might be the maximum?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is another critical point where all variables are different. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that x, y, z are all different. Then, the equations from the Lagrangian must hold. Let me see if I can find a relationship between variables.\n\nLooking at the three partial derivatives:\n\n2x - 2\u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc y z =0,\n\n2y - 2\u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc x z =0,\n\n2z - 2\u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc x y =0.\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n[2y - 2\u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc x z] - [2x - 2\u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc y z] =0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n2y -2x -2\u03bb(x + z - y - z) - \u03bc(x z - y z) =0,\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n2(y -x) -2\u03bb(x - y) - \u03bc z (x - y) =0,\n\nFactor out (y -x):\n\n(y -x)[2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc z] =0.\n\nSimilarly, since variables can be different, (y -x) is not zero, so the term in brackets must be zero:\n\n2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc z =0,\n\nSimilarly, subtracting second equation from third equation:\n\n[2z -2\u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc x y] - [2y -2\u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc x z] =0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n2(z - y) -2\u03bb(y - z) - \u03bc x (y - z) =0,\n\nFactor out (z - y):\n\n(z - y)[2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc x] =0,\n\nAgain, since z \u2260 y (assuming all variables different), then:\n\n2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc x =0,\n\nSimilarly, subtract first and third equations:\n\n[2x -2\u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc y z] - [2z -2\u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc x y] =0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n2(x - z) -2\u03bb(y + z - x - y) - \u03bc(y z - x y) =0,\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n2(x - z) -2\u03bb(z -x) - \u03bc y (z -x) =0,\n\nFactor out (x - z):\n\n(x - z)[2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc y] =0,\n\nAgain, if variables are different, x \u2260 z, so:\n\n2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc y =0,\n\nTherefore, from the above three differences, we have:\n\n2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc z =0,\n\n2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc x =0,\n\n2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc y =0,\n\nTherefore, all three expressions must be equal to zero. Therefore,\n\n\u03bc z = \u03bc x = \u03bc y = -2 -2\u03bb,\n\nThus, unless \u03bc =0, which would require 2 +2\u03bb =0, but let's see.\n\nSuppose \u03bc \u22600. Then, from \u03bc z = \u03bc x \u21d2 z =x,\n\nSimilarly, \u03bc x = \u03bc y \u21d2 x = y,\n\nTherefore, all variables must be equal: x = y = z.\n\nBut in that case, as before, the volume would be x\u00b3 =23, but surface area would be 6x\u00b2 =54 \u21d2 x\u00b2=9 \u21d2 x=3, but 3\u00b3=27 \u226023. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, the case where variables are all different cannot satisfy the Lagrangian conditions unless \u03bc =0.\n\nIf \u03bc =0, then from the equations above, 2 +2\u03bb =0 \u21d2 \u03bb = -1.\n\nThen, going back to the partial derivatives:\n\n2x - 2\u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc y z = 2x -2*(-1)(y + z) -0 = 2x + 2(y + z)=0,\n\nSimilarly,\n\n2y + 2(x + z)=0,\n\n2z +2(x + y)=0,\n\nSo, 2x +2y +2z =0,\n\nBut since x, y, z are positive (dimensions), their sum cannot be zero. Therefore, \u03bc=0 is impossible.\n\nThus, the only critical points occur when two variables are equal, so the critical points we found earlier are the only possibilities. Therefore, the maximum occurs at one of those.\n\nSince when y = z =2, the space diagonal squared is 657/16 \u224841.0625, and when y = z \u22483.898, it is \u224832.67, so the first case is larger. Therefore, that's the maximum.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the second case, the space diagonal was smaller. Therefore, the maximum occurs at y = z =2, x =23/4. Therefore, the maximum space diagonal squared is (23/4)^2 + 2*(2)^2 = (529/16) + 8 = (529 + 128)/16 = 657/16. Therefore, the radius squared is (657/16)/4 = 657/(16*4)=657/64.\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, the space diagonal squared is 657/16, so the radius is half the diagonal, so radius squared is ( (sqrt(657/16)) / 2 )\u00b2 = (657/16)/4 = 657/64.\n\nBut let me check if 657 and 64 are coprime. 657 divided by 3 is 219, so 657 = 3*219 = 3*3*73. 64 is 2^6. So no common factors. So 657/64 is reduced, so p =657, q=64, so p+q=721. Wait, but before I jump to conclusion, let me confirm.\n\nWait, but is that the maximum?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe there are other critical points when variables are not equal. But according to the Lagrangian analysis, the only critical points are when two variables are equal, so the maximum must be at one of those. Since the other critical point gives a smaller space diagonal, then the maximum is at the first case, so the radius squared would be 657/64, so 657+64=721.\n\nBut let me check if there are other possibilities where two variables are equal but with different assignments. For example, maybe set x = z instead? But due to symmetry, it's the same as setting y = z. So, the result should be same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set x = y, but different from z. Let me try that as well to confirm.\n\nSuppose x = y. Then, volume is x\u00b2 z =23,\n\nSurface area: 2(x\u00b2 + 2x z) =54 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + 2x z =27.\n\nExpress z from volume: z =23/(x\u00b2). Substitute into surface area equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2x*(23/x\u00b2) =27 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + 46/x =27.\n\nMultiply by x: x\u00b3 +46 =27x \u21d2x\u00b3 -27x +46=0.\n\nLooking for real roots. Let me try x=2: 8 -54 +46=0. So x=2 is a root again. Then factor as (x-2)(x\u00b2 +2x -23)=0, same as before. So x=2, then z=23/(4). So dimensions are x=y=2, z=23/4. Which is the same as the first case, just swapping variables. So the space diagonal is the same. Therefore, same result.\n\nAlternatively, the other root x = -1 +2\u221a6, then z=23/(x\u00b2). Which would lead to the same as before but variables swapped. So that case gives the same lower value.\n\nTherefore, indeed the maximum occurs when two sides are 2 and the third is 23/4. So the space diagonal squared is (23/4)^2 + 2*(2)^2 = (529/16)+(8)= 529/16 +128/16= 657/16. So radius is half the diagonal, so radius squared is 657/(16*4)=657/64. Since 657 and 64 are coprime (since 657 is 3\u00d7219=3\u00d73\u00d773 and 64 is 2^6, no common factors), so p=657, q=64, so p+q=721.\n\nWait, but before I settle on this answer, I want to ensure that there are no other configurations where the space diagonal is larger. For example, maybe when variables are not set equal?\n\nSuppose, for instance, that the variables are all different. But according to the Lagrangian analysis, there are no such critical points. The only critical points are when two variables are equal, so the maximum must be at those points. Since the other critical point gives a smaller value, the first case is the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a case where variables are arranged such that one is very small and others compensate? Let me test with some numbers.\n\nSuppose, for example, that x approaches zero. Then, volume xyz=23 requires that y or z also approach infinity, but surface area 2(xy + yz + zx)=54. Let me see:\n\nSuppose x approaches zero, so y and z must satisfy y z \u224823/x (from volume), but as x approaches zero, y z must approach infinity. However, the surface area term 2(xy + y z + zx) \u2248 2(y z) must equal 54. So 2 y z \u224854 \u21d2 y z \u224827. But from the volume, y z \u224823/x. So 23/x \u224827 \u21d2 x\u224823/27. So x can't approach zero. Instead, if x is small, say x=1, then y z =23, and surface area:\n\n2( y + z + y z ) =54 \u21d2 2(y + z +23)=54 \u21d2 y + z +23=27 \u21d2 y + z =4. But with y z=23. So solving y + z =4 and y z=23. The quadratic equation t\u00b2 -4t +23=0. Discriminant 16 -92= -76 <0. So no real solutions. So x cannot be 1.\n\nIf x=1.5, then y z=23/(1.5)=15.333...\n\nSurface area: 2(1.5 y +1.5 z + y z)=54 \u21d2 3(y + z) + 2*(15.333)=54 \u21d2 3(y+z)=54 -30.666\u224823.333 \u21d2 y+z\u22487.777.\n\nSo y and z must satisfy y+z\u22487.777 and y z\u224815.333. Then quadratic equation t\u00b2 -7.777 t +15.333\u22480. Discriminant\u2248(7.777)^2 -4*15.333\u224860.48 -61.33\u2248-0.85. Still negative. Not possible.\n\nx=2, then we have the case we had earlier, which works.\n\nx=3: y z=23/9\u22482.555...\n\nSurface area: 2(3y +3 z + y z)=54 \u21d26(y+z) +2*2.555\u224854 \u21d26(y+z)\u224854 -5.111\u224848.889 \u21d2 y+z\u22488.148.\n\nThen quadratic equation t\u00b2 -8.148 t +2.555\u22480. Discriminant\u224866.39 -10.22\u224856.17, so roots are real. So possible. Let me compute exact:\n\nIf x=3, then volume: 3 y z=23 \u21d2 y z=23/3\u22487.6667 (Wait, wait, no, 23 divided by 3 is \u22487.6667, but above I thought 23/9. Wait, no, x=3, so volume xyz=3 y z =23 \u21d2 y z=23/3\u22487.6667.\n\nThen surface area:\n\n2(3y +3 z + y z)=54 \u21d26(y+z) +2*(23/3)=54 \u21d26(y+z)=54 - (46/3)= (162/3 -46/3)=116/3 \u21d2 y + z= (116/3)/6=116/18=58/9\u22486.4444.\n\nTherefore, quadratic equation t\u00b2 - (58/9) t +23/3=0.\n\nMultiply all terms by 9: 9t\u00b2 -58 t +69=0. Discriminant: 58\u00b2 -4*9*69 = 3364 - 2484= 880. sqrt(880)=sqrt(16*55)=4\u221a55\u224829.66.\n\nSolutions: [58 \u00b14\u221a55]/18. So real solutions. Therefore, there is a solution with x=3, but let's compute the space diagonal squared:\n\nx=3, y and z satisfy y + z=58/9\u22486.444, y z=23/3\u22487.6667.\n\nCompute y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (y + z)^2 - 2 y z = (58/9)^2 - 2*(23/3).\n\nCalculate (58/9)^2 = (3364)/81 \u224841.53,\n\n2*(23/3)=46/3\u224815.333,\n\nThus, y\u00b2 + z\u00b2\u224841.53 -15.33\u224826.2.\n\nTherefore, total x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=9 +26.2\u224835.2, which is less than 41.0625. So, indeed, smaller than the first case.\n\nTherefore, even when variables are different, the maximum seems to be when two variables are 2 and the third is 23/4.\n\nAlternatively, let me check another value. Suppose x=4, then y z=23/4\u22485.75.\n\nSurface area:\n\n2(4y +4 z + y z)=54 \u21d28(y + z) +2*(5.75)=54 \u21d28(y+z)=54 -11.5=42.5 \u21d2 y + z=5.3125.\n\nThus, quadratic equation t\u00b2 -5.3125 t +5.75=0.\n\nDiscriminant: 5.3125\u00b2 -4*5.75\u224828.22 -23\u22485.22. Real roots. Then, space diagonal squared:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 16 + (y + z)^2 -2 y z =16 + (5.3125)^2 -2*(5.75).\n\nCompute 5.3125 squared: approx 28.22, so 28.22 -11.5=16.72, plus 16 gives 32.72, which is still less than 41.\n\nTherefore, this case is worse.\n\nAlternatively, x=23/4=5.75, which was the first case, so that's the maximum.\n\nTherefore, it's safe to say that the maximum space diagonal squared is 657/16, so r squared is 657/64, so p+q=657+64=721.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. The problem states \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B\". So, we need to make sure that all boxes in B are contained in the sphere of radius r. So, the sphere must contain all boxes, so the sphere's radius must be at least as large as the maximum of (space diagonal)/2 over all boxes in B. So, if the maximum space diagonal is indeed 657/16 under the square root, then r squared is (657/16)/4 =657/64. So, yes.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other boxes in B with a larger space diagonal. Suppose, for example, if one dimension is very large and another very small. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nSuppose, for example, let me take x approaching infinity. Then, to keep volume fixed at 23, y z must approach zero. But then surface area 2(xy + y z + x z)=54. If x is very large, then terms xy and xz dominate. So, 2x(y + z) \u224854 \u21d2 y + z \u224827/x. But since x is large, y and z are approaching zero. But volume is x y z =23. If y and z are approaching zero, their product y z must approach 23/x. But with y + z \u224827/x, so maybe y and z are both ~ sqrt( (23/x) )? Not sure, but let me see.\n\nLet me set y = z for simplicity. Then, as x approaches infinity, y = z \u2248 sqrt(23/(x)). Then surface area:\n\n2(xy + y z + x z)=2(x y + y\u00b2 +x y)=2(2x y + y\u00b2). With y\u2248sqrt(23/x), so 2x y \u22482x*sqrt(23/x)=2 sqrt(23 x). The term y\u00b2 is 23/x. Therefore, total surface area \u22482*(2 sqrt(23x) + 23/x). For this to equal 54 as x approaches infinity, the sqrt(23x) term would dominate, leading to surface area approaching infinity, which contradicts the requirement of surface area being 54. Therefore, x can't approach infinity.\n\nSimilarly, if we try to make one side very large, it's not possible without violating the surface area constraint. Therefore, the maximum space diagonal is indeed achieved at the case when two sides are 2 and the third is 23/4. Hence, the answer should be 657 + 64 = 721.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the calculation of space diagonal squared again:\n\nx =23/4, y = z =2.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = (23/4)^2 = 529/16,\n\ny\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 4 +4=8,\n\nTotal x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =529/16 +8 =529/16 +128/16 =657/16. Correct.\n\nTherefore, radius squared is (sqrt(657/16)/2)^2 = (657/16)/4 =657/64. So yes, 657 and 64 are coprime? Let me check.\n\n657 divided by 3 is 219, 219 divided by 3 is 73. So prime factors of 657 are 3,3,73. 64 is 2^6. No common factors. So yes, reduced fraction. So p+q=657+64=721. So the answer is 721.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{721}\n\n\nGiven the problem of finding the smallest sphere that can contain each rectangular box in set \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) with surface area 54 and volume 23, we need to determine the radius \\(r\\) of such a sphere and express \\(r^2\\) as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are coprime positive integers. The goal is to find \\(p + q\\).\n\n1. **Constraints and Objective**:\n   - The surface area of the box is \\(2(xy + yz + zx) = 54\\), so \\(xy + yz + zx = 27\\).\n   - The volume of the box is \\(xyz = 23\\).\n   - The radius \\(r\\) of the sphere must be at least half the space diagonal of the box, so \\(r = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}{2}\\). Thus, \\(r^2 = \\frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{4}\\).\n\n2. **Maximizing the Space Diagonal**:\n   - We need to maximize \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\\) under the given constraints.\n   - Using the identity \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx)\\), we know \\(xy + yz + zx = 27\\), so \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 54\\). Maximizing this requires maximizing \\(x + y + z\\).\n\n3. **Critical Points Analysis**:\n   - By setting two variables equal (e.g., \\(y = z\\)), we derive the equations:\n     - \\(x = \\frac{23}{y^2}\\)\n     - \\(2(2xy + y^2) = 54\\)\n   - Solving these, we find critical points:\n     - \\(y = 2\\) leads to \\(x = \\frac{23}{4}\\), resulting in dimensions \\(x = \\frac{23}{4}\\), \\(y = 2\\), \\(z = 2\\).\n     - The other solution yields a smaller space diagonal.\n\n4. **Calculating the Space Diagonal**:\n   - For dimensions \\(x = \\frac{23}{4}\\), \\(y = 2\\), \\(z = 2\\):\n     - \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = \\left(\\frac{23}{4}\\right)^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = \\frac{529}{16} + 8 = \\frac{657}{16}\\).\n   - The radius squared is \\(\\frac{657}{16 \\times 4} = \\frac{657}{64}\\).\n\n5. **Result**:\n   - The fraction \\(\\frac{657}{64}\\) is in simplest form, so \\(p = 657\\) and \\(q = 64\\). Thus, \\(p + q = 657 + 64 = 721\\).\n\n\\boxed{721}",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. Hmm, so we have a set of rectangular boxes, each with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. We need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, and then compute r squared, which will be a fraction p/q, and then find p + q. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall that for a rectangular box with dimensions a, b, c, the surface area is 2(ab + bc + ac) and the volume is abc. The problem states that for all these boxes in set B, their surface area is fixed at 54 and volume fixed at 23. So, the constraints are:\n\n2(ab + bc + ac) = 54  \nabc = 23\n\nWe need to find the smallest sphere that can contain each such box. The sphere must contain the box regardless of its orientation, so the sphere's radius has to be at least half of the space diagonal of the box, because the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two vertices of the box, so the sphere must have a diameter equal to at least the space diagonal. Therefore, the minimal radius r would be half of the space diagonal. So, r = (sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2))/2. Therefore, we need to find the minimal possible value of sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)/2, but wait, actually, since we want the smallest sphere that can contain all boxes in B, we need to find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, and then take half of that as the radius. Wait, hold on, actually, the problem says \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B\". So, the sphere has to contain every box in B. Therefore, the sphere must be large enough to contain the box with the largest space diagonal in B. Therefore, the radius r must be at least half of the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B. Therefore, to find the minimal such r, we need to compute the maximum of sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)/2 over all boxes in B, and then that maximum will be the minimal r required. So our goal is to maximize the space diagonal sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2), given that 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to maximizing a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 given the constraints 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23. Once we find the maximum value of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2, then divide by 2 and take the square root, then divide by 2 again to get the radius? Wait, no. Wait, the space diagonal is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2), so the radius is half that. So, first, compute the maximum value of sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2), then divide by 2 to get r. Then r squared would be (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)/4 divided by 4? Wait, no. Wait, sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)/2 is r, so r squared is (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)/4. Wait, no, (sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)/2)^2 is (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)/4. Therefore, to find r squared, we need to compute (max(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2))/4. Therefore, our problem is to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 under the given constraints.\n\nSo, first, let's note that we have two equations:\n\n1. 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 \u21d2 ab + bc + ac = 27  \n2. abc = 23\n\nWe need to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2. Hmm. Let me recall that (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ac). Since we know ab + bc + ac = 27, so (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 54. Therefore, if we can express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 in terms of (a + b + c)^2, but not sure if that helps yet. Alternatively, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 given the constraints. Alternatively, maybe we can parametrize the variables.\n\nAlternatively, since we have three variables with two constraints, perhaps we can express two variables in terms of the third and then set up an equation. Let me think. Let me see if we can express variables in terms of each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using substitution. Let me denote variables as a, b, c. Let me consider that since abc = 23, perhaps we can let variables be in terms of x, y, z such that a = x, b = y, c = 23/(xy). Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe using symmetry or some substitution.\n\nAlternatively, since we need to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2, which is equivalent to minimizing the sum of squares? Wait, no, we need to maximize it. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that for given ab + bc + ac and abc, the variables a, b, c are related to the roots of a cubic equation. Let me recall that if a, b, c are roots of the equation t^3 - pt^2 + qt - r = 0, then p = a + b + c, q = ab + bc + ac, and r = abc. So here, q = 27, r = 23, so the cubic would be t^3 - pt^2 + 27t - 23 = 0. Then, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = p\u00b2 - 2q = p\u00b2 - 54. Therefore, to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2, we need to maximize p\u00b2, since q is fixed at 27. Therefore, maximizing a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 is equivalent to maximizing (a + b + c)^2. Therefore, we can instead focus on maximizing a + b + c given the constraints ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc =23.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers here. Let me try that.\n\nLet me set up the function to maximize f(a,b,c) = a + b + c, subject to the constraints g(a,b,c) = ab + bc + ac = 27 and h(a,b,c) = abc =23.\n\nWait, but Lagrange multipliers with two constraints. The gradients would have to satisfy grad f = \u03bb grad g + \u03bc grad h.\n\nSo, compute the gradients:\n\ngrad f = (1, 1, 1)\n\ngrad g = (b + c, a + c, a + b)\n\ngrad h = (bc, ac, ab)\n\nTherefore, setting up equations:\n\n1 = \u03bb(b + c) + \u03bc bc  \n1 = \u03bb(a + c) + \u03bc ac  \n1 = \u03bb(a + b) + \u03bc ab\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe assuming symmetry here? But since the constraints might not be symmetric, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Let me try that approach. Let me assume that two variables are equal, say a = b. Then, perhaps that gives us a critical point.\n\nLet me suppose a = b. Then, we have variables a, a, c.\n\nThen the constraints become:\n\nab + bc + ac = a\u00b2 + 2ac = 27  \nabc = a\u00b2 c =23\n\nWe can write equations:\n\nLet me denote a = b, so:\n\nFirst equation: a\u00b2 + 2ac =27  \nSecond equation: a\u00b2 c =23\n\nLet me solve for c from the second equation: c = 23/(a\u00b2). Substitute into first equation:\n\na\u00b2 + 2a*(23/(a\u00b2)) =27  \nSimplify: a\u00b2 + (46)/a =27  \nMultiply both sides by a: a\u00b3 +46 =27a  \nThus, a\u00b3 -27a +46 =0\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me see if there are integer roots. Let me try a=2: 8 -54 +46 =0. 8-54 is -46, -46 +46=0. So a=2 is a root. Therefore, we can factor (a-2)(a\u00b2 + 2a -23)=0. The quadratic equation a\u00b2 + 2a -23 =0 would have roots (-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92))/2 = (-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96))/2 = (-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6))/2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6). Since a must be positive, the roots are 2 and -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248 -1 + 4.898 \u2248 3.898, but negative root is -1 - 2\u221a6 which is negative. So possible a is 2 or approximately 3.898.\n\nTherefore, possible solutions when a = b =2, then c =23/(2\u00b2)=23/4=5.75. Let me check if this satisfies the first equation:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac = (4) + 2*(2)*(23/4) =4 + (46/2)=4 +23=27. Yes, that works.\n\nThe other solution is a = -1 + 2\u221a6 \u22483.898. Let me compute c:\n\nc=23/(a\u00b2). Let me compute a\u00b2: ( -1 + 2\u221a6 )\u00b2 =1 -4\u221a6 + 24 =25 -4\u221a6 \u224825 -9.798\u224815.202. Therefore, c\u224823/15.202\u22481.513.\n\nThen check the first equation: a\u00b2 +2ac \u2248 (25 -4\u221a6) +2*(-1 +2\u221a6)*(1.513). Hmm, this might be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps since we have a valid root at a=2, that's one critical point. Let me see if this gives a maximum or minimum?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when variables are unequal, so maybe assuming two variables equal is not the way to go. Alternatively, perhaps trying to use Lagrange multipliers with a = b.\n\nWait, but let's see. If a = b =2, c=23/4, then the space diagonal squared is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 4 +4 + (529/16) = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625. So the space diagonal squared is 41.0625. So r squared would be (41.0625)/4 \u224810.265625. But maybe there's a larger value?\n\nAlternatively, let's try the other solution where a \u22483.898. Let me compute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 when a = b \u22483.898 and c \u22481.513. So a squared is approx (3.898)^2\u224815.19, so two of them would be 30.38, plus c squared \u2248 (1.513)^2\u22482.29, so total a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2\u224832.67, which is actually less than the previous case. Wait, that's strange. So when a is 2, we get a higher value. Hmm, so perhaps the maximum occurs at a=2? But that might not be the case, because maybe when variables are all different, we can get a higher sum of squares?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to consider another case where all variables are different. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the constraints ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23, perhaps we can consider the variables as roots of a cubic equation. Let me denote the variables as a, b, c. Then, as I thought before, the cubic equation would be t^3 - pt^2 +27 t -23=0 where p = a + b + c.\n\nWe need to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = p\u00b2 - 2*27 = p\u00b2 -54. Therefore, to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2, we need to maximize p\u00b2, so maximize |p|. Since a, b, c are positive real numbers, p is positive, so we need to maximize p.\n\nTherefore, our problem reduces to maximizing p = a + b + c, given that ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23. So we need to maximize a + b + c given those two constraints.\n\nHmm, perhaps using AM \u2265 GM or other inequalities?\n\nAlternatively, since we have three variables with fixed product and sum of products, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers again for this two-constraint problem. Let me set up the Lagrangian.\n\nLet me define the function to maximize as f(a,b,c) = a + b + c, with constraints g(a,b,c) = ab + bc + ac -27 =0 and h(a,b,c)=abc -23=0.\n\nThe Lagrangian is L = a + b + c - \u03bb(ab + bc + ac -27) - \u03bc(abc -23).\n\nTaking partial derivatives:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202a = 1 - \u03bb(b + c) - \u03bc bc =0  \n\u2202L/\u2202b =1 - \u03bb(a + c) - \u03bc ac =0  \n\u2202L/\u2202c =1 - \u03bb(a + b) - \u03bc ab =0  \nAnd the constraints: ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23.\n\nSo, the first three equations:\n\n1) 1 = \u03bb(b + c) + \u03bc bc  \n2) 1 = \u03bb(a + c) + \u03bc ac  \n3) 1 = \u03bb(a + b) + \u03bc ab  \n\nHmm, these equations must hold. Let me try to subtract equations to find relations between variables. Let's subtract equation 1 and 2:\n\n[1 -1] = \u03bb[(b + c) - (a + c)] + \u03bc [bc - ac]  \n0 = \u03bb(b - a) + \u03bc c (b - a)  \nFactor (b - a)(\u03bb + \u03bc c) =0.\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 2 - 3:\n\n0 = \u03bb(a + c - a - b) + \u03bc(ac - ab)  \n= \u03bb(c - b) + \u03bc a(c - b)  \n= (c - b)(\u03bb + \u03bc a)=0\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 1 -3:\n\n0 = \u03bb(b + c - a - b) + \u03bc (bc - ab)  \n= \u03bb(c - a) + \u03bc b(c -a)  \n= (c -a)(\u03bb + \u03bc b)=0\n\nTherefore, from these equations, either variables are equal or the other factor is zero.\n\nCase 1: Suppose that two variables are equal, say a = b. Then, from the first difference (b -a)=0, so that holds. Similarly, in the second difference (c - b) must be zero or \u03bb + \u03bc a =0. But if a = b, then let me see.\n\nIf a = b, then from the second equation's difference (c - b)(\u03bb + \u03bc a)=0, so either c = b, making all variables equal, or \u03bb + \u03bc a=0.\n\nIf all variables are equal, then a = b = c. Let me check if that is possible. If a = b = c, then:\n\nab + bc + ac =3a\u00b2 =27 \u21d2a\u00b2=9 \u21d2a=3. Then abc =a\u00b3=27, but the problem states abc=23. So that's impossible, so variables can't all be equal. Therefore, the only possibility is that \u03bb + \u03bc a =0.\n\nSimilarly, if a = b, then from the first equation:\n\n1 = \u03bb(2c + a) + \u03bc a c (Wait, let me recheck the first equation. Wait, equation 1 is when a = b:\n\nWait, equation 1: 1 = \u03bb(b + c) + \u03bc bc. Since a = b, so equation 1 becomes 1 = \u03bb(a + c) + \u03bc a c.\n\nEquation 2: 1 = \u03bb(a + c) + \u03bc a c. So equations 1 and 2 are the same. So the other equations would have to hold.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to proceed step by step. Let me suppose that a = b. Then, variables a, a, c. Then, we can write the equations.\n\nFrom the first three equations, since a = b, let's see:\n\nFrom equation 1 and 2, they are the same. From equation 3:\n\n1 = \u03bb(2a) + \u03bc a\u00b2.\n\nSo equation 3 gives: 1 = 2\u03bb a + \u03bc a\u00b2.\n\nEquation 1: 1 = \u03bb(a + c) + \u03bc a c.\n\nAlso, we have the constraints:\n\nab + bc + ac = a\u00b2 + 2a c =27,\n\nand abc =a\u00b2 c =23.\n\nWe can proceed as before. Let me set up the equations again with a = b.\n\nWe can let\u2019s denote variables with a and c. From the constraints, c =23/(a\u00b2). Then, substitute into the first equation:\n\na\u00b2 + 2a*(23/(a\u00b2)) =27 \u21d2a\u00b2 +46/a =27. This is the same as before, leading to a\u00b3 -27a +46 =0, which factors as (a -2)(a\u00b2 +2a -23)=0. So the roots are a=2 and a= -1 \u00b1\u221a24. Since a must be positive, a=2 or a\u22483.899.\n\nSo, for a=2, c=23/4=5.75. Let's compute \u03bb and \u03bc here. Let me see if the Lagrangian equations hold.\n\nFirst, let me compute \u03bb and \u03bc. From equation 3:\n\n1 = 2\u03bb a + \u03bc a\u00b2. Here, a=2, so:\n\n1 = 4\u03bb + 4\u03bc.\n\nFrom equation 1: 1 = \u03bb(a + c) + \u03bc a c. Here, a=2, c=23/4:\n\n\u03bb*(2 + 23/4) + \u03bc*(2*(23/4)) = \u03bb*(31/4) + \u03bc*(23/2) =1.\n\nSo, two equations:\n\n1) 4\u03bb +4\u03bc =1  \n2) (31/4)\u03bb + (23/2)\u03bc =1\n\nLet me solve these equations. Let me denote equation 1 as:\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 4: 16\u03bb +16\u03bc =4.\n\nEquation 2 multiplied by 4: 31\u03bb +46\u03bc =4.\n\nSo, now:\n\nEquation1: 16\u03bb +16\u03bc =4  \nEquation2:31\u03bb +46\u03bc =4\n\nLet me subtract equation1 from equation2:\n\n(31\u03bb -16\u03bb) + (46\u03bc -16\u03bc)=0  \n15\u03bb +30\u03bc =0 \u21d2 \u03bb = -2\u03bc\n\nSubstitute back into equation1:\n\n16*(-2\u03bc) +16\u03bc =4  \n-32\u03bc +16\u03bc =4 \u21d2 -16\u03bc=4 \u21d2 \u03bc = -4/16 = -1/4.\n\nThen \u03bb = -2*(-1/4)=1/2.\n\nSo, \u03bb=1/2, \u03bc= -1/4. These satisfy both equations.\n\nTherefore, this is a valid critical point. Similarly, for the other root a\u22483.899, we can do similar steps, but perhaps it's a minimum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs at a=2, giving a higher p = a + b + c =2 +2 +5.75=9.75. Let me check the other critical point.\n\nTake a\u22483.899, which is sqrt( (27 + sqrt(27^2 -4*1*46 )) /2 )? Wait, actually the root was a = -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248-1 +4.899\u22483.899. Let me compute p = a +a +c. Since c =23/(a\u00b2). Let me compute a + a +23/a\u00b2.\n\nFirst, let me compute a\u00b2:\n\na = -1 + 2\u221a6 \u22483.89898\n\na\u00b2 = (-1 +2\u221a6)^2 =1 -4\u221a6 +24=25 -4\u221a6 \u224825 -9.798\u224815.202.\n\nThen c=23/a\u00b2\u224823/15.202\u22481.513.\n\nThus, p =2a +c \u22482*(3.89898) +1.513\u22487.798 +1.513\u22489.311.\n\nSo this p is less than 9.75. So indeed, the a=2 case gives a higher p. Therefore, that critical point is a maximum?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other critical points where variables are not equal. Let me think. Suppose all variables are different. Let me see if such a critical point exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs at a=2, so the maximum a +b +c is 9.75. Let me see if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's another approach. Let me consider that for fixed ab + bc + ac and abc, the maximum of a +b +c is achieved when two variables are equal, so that case we found is indeed the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the method of substitution. Let me suppose variables are a, b, c with ab + bc +ac =27 and abc=23. Let me let\u2019s consider that variables are positive real numbers.\n\nLet me consider that to maximize a +b +c, given the constraints. Maybe using the inequality that for fixed ab + bc + ac, the sum a +b +c is maximized when variables are as unequal as possible? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables as x, y, z. Let me fix two variables and see how the third behaves.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the cubic equation with roots a,b,c, the sum a +b +c is the coefficient p. To maximize p, given that the cubic equation t^3 - pt^2 +27 t -23 =0 has three real positive roots.\n\nThe cubic must have three real roots, so its discriminant must be non-negative.\n\nThe discriminant D of t^3 + at^2 + bt +c is D = 18abc -4a^3c +a^2b^2 -4b^3 -27c^2. Wait, perhaps better to recall the discriminant formula for cubic.\n\nWait, the discriminant of cubic equation t^3 + pt^2 + qt + r is [q^2 -3pr]^2 -4[ p q - 3 r]^3. Wait, actually, I might be misremembering. Let me check:\n\nActually, the discriminant D of cubic equation ax\u00b3 +bx\u00b2 +cx +d is D = 18abcd -4b\u00b3d + b\u00b2c\u00b2 - 4ac\u00b3 - 27a\u00b2d\u00b2.\n\nIn our case, the equation is t\u00b3 - p t\u00b2 +27 t -23 =0. So coefficients: a=1, b= -p, c=27, d= -23.\n\nThus discriminant D= 18*(1)*(-p)*(27)*(-23) -4*(-p)^3*(-23) + (-p)^2*(27)^2 -4*(1)*(27)^3 -27*(1)^2*(-23)^2.\n\nThis is going to be complicated, but perhaps we can note that for real roots, discriminant must be non-negative. But maybe this is not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that in order for the cubic to have three real roots, the function must have a local maximum above the x-axis and a local minimum below, or vice versa. Let me compute the derivative of the cubic:\n\nf(t)=t\u00b3 - pt\u00b2 +27t -23\n\nf\u2019(t)=3t\u00b2 -2pt +27.\n\nSetting to zero: 3t\u00b2 -2pt +27 =0.\n\nThe discriminant of this quadratic is (2p)^2 -4*3*27 =4p\u00b2 -324.\n\nFor real critical points, discriminant must be non-negative: 4p\u00b2 -324 \u22650 \u21d2 p\u00b2 \u226581 \u21d2 |p|\u22659. Since p is positive, p\u22659.\n\nTherefore, the cubic has two critical points only when p\u22659. Therefore, for p\u22659, the cubic has a local maximum and minimum. To have three real roots, the value of the cubic at the local maximum must be positive and at the local minimum must be negative, or vice versa.\n\nWait, let me compute the values at the critical points. Let me denote the critical points as t1 and t2, which are roots of 3t\u00b2 -2pt +27=0. Let me compute f(t1) and f(t2). But this might be too involved.\n\nAlternatively, since we found a case where p=9.75 (which is 39/4), which is greater than 9, so that works. The other critical point had p\u22489.31 which is also above 9. So perhaps the maximum p is indeed 39/4=9.75.\n\nSince when variables are a=2, b=2, c=23/4, then p = 2+2+23/4= (4 +4 +23)/4=31/4=7.75? Wait wait, hold on, no. Wait, 2 +2 +5.75 is 9.75, right? 2 +2=4, plus 5.75 is 9.75, yes. So 39/4 is 9.75, which is correct.\n\nWait, 39 divided by 4 is 9.75. So p =39/4. Therefore, the maximum p is 39/4. Then, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = p\u00b2 -54 = (39/4)^2 -54.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(39/4)^2 = (1521)/16\n\n54 is 864/16\n\nSo, 1521/16 - 864/16 = (1521 - 864)/16 = 657/16.\n\nTherefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =657/16. Therefore, r squared is (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2)/4 = (657/16)/4 =657/64.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the space diagonal squared is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2, so r is half of the space diagonal. So r squared is (space diagonal squared)/4, which is (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2)/4. So indeed, that's 657/64. Let me check the arithmetic again.\n\nWait 39/4 squared is (39)^2=1521, over 16. Then subtract 54, which is 54*(16/16)=864/16. So 1521-864 is 657. Therefore, 657/16. Then divided by 4 gives 657/64. So r squared is 657/64.\n\nBut we need to check if this is indeed the maximum. Since we found another critical point with p\u22489.31 which is less than 9.75, and the other critical point is at p=9.75. Since when p increases beyond 9.75, is that possible?\n\nWait, but according to the discriminant condition, p must be at least 9. So 9.75 is above that. But perhaps there are other critical points with higher p?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum p is indeed 39/4, so that gives us the maximum a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 of 657/16, leading to r squared 657/64. Then, 657 and 64: check if they can be reduced. 657 divided by 3 is 219, 64 is 2^6. 657 divided by 3 is 219, which divided by 3 is 73. So 657= 3*3*73. 64 is 2^6. No common factors, so 657/64 is reduced. So p=657, q=64, so p+q=721.\n\nWait, but before finalizing, let me check if there could be a higher value.\n\nSuppose we consider a different case where variables are not two equal. Let me try to see.\n\nSuppose a is very small, approaching zero. Then, since abc=23, if a approaches zero, then bc must approach infinity, but ab + bc +ac approaches bc. So bc must approach 27. But if a approaches zero, then bc=27, but abc=23, so a=23/(bc)=23/27, which is a contradiction as a approaches zero. So variables can't be too skewed.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there exists another critical point where variables are all different. Let me try to see.\n\nSuppose that all variables are different. Let me suppose that a \u2260 b \u2260 c. Then, from the Lagrangian equations:\n\nFrom the first three equations:\n\n1 = \u03bb(b + c) + \u03bc bc  \n1 = \u03bb(a + c) + \u03bc ac  \n1 = \u03bb(a + b) + \u03bc ab  \n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n0 = \u03bb(a - b) + \u03bc c(a - b)  \n= (a - b)(\u03bb + \u03bc c)\n\nSimilarly, subtract second from third:\n\n0 = \u03bb(b - a) + \u03bc a(b - a)  \n= (b - a)(\u03bb + \u03bc a)\n\nTherefore, either a = b or \u03bb + \u03bc c =0 and \u03bb + \u03bc a=0. If a \u2260 b, then we must have \u03bb + \u03bc c =0 and \u03bb + \u03bc a=0. Therefore, setting these equal:\n\n\u03bb + \u03bc c = \u03bb + \u03bc a \u21d2 \u03bc(c -a)=0. Since a\u2260c (assuming variables are all different), then \u03bc=0. But if \u03bc=0, then from the first equation, 1 = \u03bb(b +c). Similarly, second equation 1=\u03bb(a +c). Therefore, \u03bb(b +c)=\u03bb(a +c). Since \u03bb \u22600 (else 1=0), then b +c =a +c \u21d2 a =b. Contradiction. Therefore, the only possibility is a =b. So similar for other variables, so this suggests that in the case of all variables different, we reach a contradiction, so the only critical points occur when at least two variables are equal. Therefore, the maximum must occur at a=2, giving p=39/4, so that the maximum a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 is indeed 657/16, so r squared is 657/64. Therefore, the answer is 657 +64=721.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that the maximum of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 is 657/16. Let me compute the space diagonal squared, which is 657/16, so r squared would be (657/16)/4 =657/64\u224810.2656. Let me see if there is another combination where a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 is larger.\n\nSuppose we take a=1, then bc=23, and ab + bc +ac =1*(b +c) + bc= (b +c)+23=27 \u21d2 b +c=4. So with bc=23 and b +c=4. Then, solving for b and c, they are roots of x\u00b2 -4x +23=0. Discriminant 16 -92= -76 <0, so no real solutions. Thus, a cannot be 1.\n\nWhat if a=3, then bc=23/3\u22487.6667, and ab + bc +ac=3(b +c) + bc=3(b +c) +7.6667=27 \u21d23(b +c)=19.3333 \u21d2b +c\u22486.4444. Then, with bc\u22487.6667 and b +c\u22486.4444, the discriminant of x\u00b2 -6.4444x +7.6667\u22480 would be (6.4444)^2 -4*7.6667\u224841.53 -30.6668\u224810.86>0, so real roots. Thus, possible. Let me compute a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =9 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2. Since b +c\u22486.4444, so (b +c)^2\u224841.53, so b\u00b2 +c\u00b2\u224841.53 -2*7.6667\u224841.53 -15.333\u224826.197. Thus total a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2\u22489 +26.197\u224835.197, which is way less than 657/16\u224841.0625.\n\nHmm, so that's less. What about a=1.5?\n\nThen, bc=23/(1.5)^2\u224823/2.25\u224810.2222. Then ab + bc +ac=1.5(b +c)+10.2222=27 \u21d21.5(b +c)=16.7778 \u21d2b +c\u224811.185.\n\nThen, b and c satisfy x\u00b2 -11.185x +10.2222\u22480. Discriminant\u2248(11.185)^2 -4*10.2222\u2248125.1 -40.888\u224884.212>0. So real roots. Then, b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=(b +c)^2 -2bc\u2248(125.1) -2*10.2222\u2248125.1-20.444\u2248104.656. Wait, that can\u2019t be. Wait, wait, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, (b +c)^2 = (11.185)^2 \u2248125.1, so b\u00b2 +c\u00b2= (b +c)^2 -2bc =125.1 -2*(10.2222)=125.1 -20.444\u2248104.656. Then, total a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2\u2248 (1.5)^2 +104.656\u22482.25 +104.656\u2248106.906. Wait, that's way higher than previous values. Wait, hold on, that can't be right. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, hold on, if a=1.5, then bc=23/(1.5)^2\u224810.2222. Then, ab + bc + ac =1.5*(b +c) + bc=1.5*(b +c)+10.2222=27 \u21d21.5*(b +c)=16.7778 \u21d2b +c\u224811.185. Then, b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=(b +c)^2 -2bc\u2248125.1 -20.444\u2248104.656, so total a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2\u22482.25 +104.656\u2248106.906. Wait, but this is way larger than the previous case of ~41. So that contradicts my previous conclusion.\n\nWait, so maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, but that can't be. If that's the case, then my previous assumption that the maximum is at a=2 is wrong. Hmm, so perhaps I need to check my calculations here.\n\nWait, hold on, if a=1.5, then:\n\nSurface area is 2(ab + bc +ac)=54, so ab + bc +ac=27. If a=1.5, then:\n\nab + bc +ac =1.5b +1.5c + bc =27. Since bc=23/(1.5)^2\u224810.2222. Let me compute 1.5(b +c) +10.2222=27 \u21d21.5(b +c)=16.7778 \u21d2b +c\u224811.185. Then, b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=(b +c)^2 - 2bc\u2248(125.1) - 20.444\u2248104.656. Then, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2\u22482.25 +104.656\u2248106.906. Which is way bigger than the previous case. But then why did the Lagrangian method give a maximum of 657/16\u224841.06?\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the Lagrangian method, I considered the case where a =b, which gave a certain value, but perhaps there are other critical points where variables are not equal which give higher a +b +c.\n\nWait, but in the case where a=1.5, the variables are not equal, so maybe that is a valid case? Wait, but if a=1.5, then b and c would have to be roots of the equation x\u00b2 - (b +c)x + bc=0, which is x\u00b2 -11.185x +10.222\u22480. The roots would be [11.185 \u00b1 sqrt(125.1 -40.888)]/2\u2248[11.185 \u00b1 sqrt(84.2)]/2\u2248[11.185 \u00b19.18]/2. So approximately, (11.185 +9.18)/2\u224820.365/2\u224810.18, and the other root\u2248(11.185-9.18)/2\u22482.005/2\u22481.0025. So variables would be approximately a=1.5, b\u224810.18, c\u22481.0025. Let me check the product abc\u22481.5*10.18*1.0025\u224815.27*1.0025\u224815.3, but the required abc is 23. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, bc was supposed to be\u224810.2222, so 1.5*10.2222\u224815.333, but we need abc=23, so that is not matching. Wait, so my mistake here is in the calculation.\n\nWait, bc=23/(a^2)=23/(2.25)=10.2222, so abc= a* bc=1.5 *10.2222\u224815.333, which is not 23. Wait, so this is impossible. Therefore, my mistake was in the assumption that a=1.5 gives abc=23. Wait, no, if a=1.5, then bc must be 23/(1.5)^2\u224810.2222, so abc= a * bc =1.5*(10.2222)=15.333, which is not 23. Therefore, that case is impossible. Therefore, my mistake was in thinking that I could set a=1.5 and still have abc=23. Therefore, that case is not valid. Therefore, my initial calculation was correct. So that case is impossible.\n\nTherefore, when I set a=1.5, then bc would have to be 23/(1.5)^2\u224810.2222, but then ab + bc +ac=1.5(b +c) +10.2222=27 \u21d21.5(b +c)=16.7778 \u21d2b +c\u224811.185, but then the product bc=10.2222, so abc= a* bc=1.5*10.2222\u224815.333, which is not 23. Therefore, that is impossible. Therefore, my mistake was in miscalculating the product. Therefore, that case is invalid. Therefore, the previous result stands.\n\nTherefore, the maximum a + b +c occurs when two variables are equal at a=2, giving p=9.75=39/4. Therefore, the maximum a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 is (39/4)^2 -54= 1521/16 - 864/16=657/16. Therefore, r squared is 657/64, so p+q=657+64=721.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check another case where variables are different but satisfy the constraints.\n\nSuppose a=3, then bc=23/9\u22482.5556. Then ab + bc +ac=3(b +c) +2.5556=27 \u21d23(b +c)=24.4444 \u21d2b +c\u22488.1481. Then, bc\u22482.5556. Then, b and c must satisfy x\u00b2 -8.1481x +2.5556=0. The discriminant is (8.1481)^2 -10.222\u224866.39 -10.22\u224856.17>0. Thus roots exist. Then, b\u2248 [8.1481 \u00b1 sqrt(56.17)]/2. sqrt(56.17)=7.495. So roots\u2248(8.1481+7.495)/2\u224815.643/2\u22487.8215 and (8.1481-7.495)/2\u22480.653/2\u22480.3265. Thus, variables are a=3, b\u22487.8215, c\u22480.3265. Then, compute a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2\u22489 +61.17 +0.106\u224870.276. This is still less than 657/16\u224841.06? Wait no, 657/16 is 41.06, but 70 is higher. Wait, so this contradicts again.\n\nWait, hold on, 3 squared is 9, 7.8215 squared is approx 61.17, and 0.3265 squared is approx 0.106. So total is 9+61.17+0.106\u224870.276, which is higher than the previous 41.06. Wait, so now I'm really confused. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, hold on, if a=3, then bc=23/9\u22482.5556, then abc=3*(2.5556)=7.6668, but the required volume is 23. Therefore, this is impossible. Wait, so again, mistake here. Because if a=3, then bc must equal 23/3\u22487.6667, not 23/9. Wait, abc=23 \u21d2 bc=23/a. So if a=3, then bc=23/3\u22487.6667, so my previous calculation was wrong. I must have miscalculated bc as 23/(a^2). Wait, no, bc is 23/a, because abc=23 \u21d2 bc=23/a.\n\nWait, so my mistake was in the previous example where I set a=1.5, I incorrectly used bc=23/(a^2). Wait, actually, that was wrong. bc is equal to (23)/a, not 23/(a squared). Wait, abc=23 \u21d2 bc=23/a. So my previous mistake was in assuming bc=23/(a^2), which was incorrect. That was the mistake. So that invalidates all previous incorrect calculations.\n\nOh my goodness, this is a crucial mistake. Let me correct this.\n\nSo, in the case of a=1.5, bc=23/a\u224823/1.5\u224815.3333, not 23/(a squared). So then, ab + bc +ac =1.5(b +c) + bc=1.5(b +c)+15.3333=27 \u21d21.5(b +c)=11.6667 \u21d2b +c\u22487.7778. Then, bc\u224815.3333. Then, b and c are roots of x\u00b2 -7.7778x +15.3333\u22480. The discriminant would be (7.7778)^2 -4*15.3333\u224860.5 -61.333\u2248-0.833 <0. Thus, no real solutions. Therefore, a=1.5 is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, when I considered a=3, bc=23/3\u22487.6667, so ab + bc +ac=3(b +c) +7.6667=27 \u21d23(b +c)=19.3333 \u21d2b +c\u22486.4444. Then bc\u22487.6667. The quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -6.4444x +7.6667\u22480. Discriminant\u2248 (6.4444)^2 -4*7.6667\u224841.53 -30.6668\u224810.86>0, so roots exist. Therefore, variables would be a=3, and b and c\u2248[6.4444 \u00b1 sqrt(10.86)]/2. sqrt(10.86)=3.296. So roots\u2248(6.4444 \u00b13.296)/2. So the two roots are\u2248 (9.74)/2\u22484.87 and (3.148)/2\u22481.574. Therefore, variables a=3, b\u22484.87, c\u22481.574. Then compute a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2\u22489 +23.7 +2.475\u224835.175, which is less than 657/16\u224841.06. Therefore, okay, so this is consistent.\n\nTherefore, my previous mistake was in miscalculating bc as 23/a\u00b2 instead of 23/a. That was a critical error. So now, the earlier result holds.\n\nTherefore, the maximum a +b +c occurs at a = b =2, c=23/(2*2)=23/4, giving p=2+2+23/4= (8 +23)/4=31/4=7.75? Wait wait, hold on, 2+2 is 4, plus 23/4 is 4 +5.75=9.75, which is 39/4. Yes, so p=39/4. Therefore, a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2= p\u00b2 -2(ab + bc +ac)= (39/4)^2 -54= (1521/16) - (864/16)=657/16. So r squared is (657/16)/4=657/64. 657 and 64 are coprime? Let me check.\n\n657 divided by 3 is 219, which divided by 3 is 73. So 657=3\u00d73\u00d773. 64 is 2^6. So no common factors. Therefore, 657+64=721.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 721. But let me confirm once more.\n\nWait, let me compute 39/4 squared:\n\n39 divided by 4 is 9.75. Squared is 95.0625. 95.0625 minus 54 is 41.0625. Which is 657/16 (since 657 divided by16 is 41.0625). Then divided by4 gives 10.265625, which is 657/64.

      "full_content": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. Hmm, so we have a set of rectangular boxes, each with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. We need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, and then compute r squared, which will be a fraction p/q, and then find p + q. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall that for a rectangular box with dimensions a, b, c, the surface area is 2(ab + bc + ac) and the volume is abc. The problem states that for all these boxes in set B, their surface area is fixed at 54 and volume fixed at 23. So, the constraints are:\n\n2(ab + bc + ac) = 54  \nabc = 23\n\nWe need to find the smallest sphere that can contain each such box. The sphere must contain the box regardless of its orientation, so the sphere's radius has to be at least half of the space diagonal of the box, because the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two vertices of the box, so the sphere must have a diameter equal to at least the space diagonal. Therefore, the minimal radius r would be half of the space diagonal. So, r = (sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2))/2. Therefore, we need to find the minimal possible value of sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)/2, but wait, actually, since we want the smallest sphere that can contain all boxes in B, we need to find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, and then take half of that as the radius. Wait, hold on, actually, the problem says \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B\". So, the sphere has to contain every box in B. Therefore, the sphere must be large enough to contain the box with the largest space diagonal in B. Therefore, the radius r must be at least half of the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B. Therefore, to find the minimal such r, we need to compute the maximum of sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)/2 over all boxes in B, and then that maximum will be the minimal r required. So our goal is to maximize the space diagonal sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2), given that 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to maximizing a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 given the constraints 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23. Once we find the maximum value of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2, then divide by 2 and take the square root, then divide by 2 again to get the radius? Wait, no. Wait, the space diagonal is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2), so the radius is half that. So, first, compute the maximum value of sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2), then divide by 2 to get r. Then r squared would be (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)/4 divided by 4? Wait, no. Wait, sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)/2 is r, so r squared is (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)/4. Wait, no, (sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)/2)^2 is (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)/4. Therefore, to find r squared, we need to compute (max(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2))/4. Therefore, our problem is to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 under the given constraints.\n\nSo, first, let's note that we have two equations:\n\n1. 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 \u21d2 ab + bc + ac = 27  \n2. abc = 23\n\nWe need to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2. Hmm. Let me recall that (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ac). Since we know ab + bc + ac = 27, so (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 54. Therefore, if we can express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 in terms of (a + b + c)^2, but not sure if that helps yet. Alternatively, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 given the constraints. Alternatively, maybe we can parametrize the variables.\n\nAlternatively, since we have three variables with two constraints, perhaps we can express two variables in terms of the third and then set up an equation. Let me think. Let me see if we can express variables in terms of each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using substitution. Let me denote variables as a, b, c. Let me consider that since abc = 23, perhaps we can let variables be in terms of x, y, z such that a = x, b = y, c = 23/(xy). Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe using symmetry or some substitution.\n\nAlternatively, since we need to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2, which is equivalent to minimizing the sum of squares? Wait, no, we need to maximize it. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that for given ab + bc + ac and abc, the variables a, b, c are related to the roots of a cubic equation. Let me recall that if a, b, c are roots of the equation t^3 - pt^2 + qt - r = 0, then p = a + b + c, q = ab + bc + ac, and r = abc. So here, q = 27, r = 23, so the cubic would be t^3 - pt^2 + 27t - 23 = 0. Then, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = p\u00b2 - 2q = p\u00b2 - 54. Therefore, to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2, we need to maximize p\u00b2, since q is fixed at 27. Therefore, maximizing a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 is equivalent to maximizing (a + b + c)^2. Therefore, we can instead focus on maximizing a + b + c given the constraints ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc =23.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers here. Let me try that.\n\nLet me set up the function to maximize f(a,b,c) = a + b + c, subject to the constraints g(a,b,c) = ab + bc + ac = 27 and h(a,b,c) = abc =23.\n\nWait, but Lagrange multipliers with two constraints. The gradients would have to satisfy grad f = \u03bb grad g + \u03bc grad h.\n\nSo, compute the gradients:\n\ngrad f = (1, 1, 1)\n\ngrad g = (b + c, a + c, a + b)\n\ngrad h = (bc, ac, ab)\n\nTherefore, setting up equations:\n\n1 = \u03bb(b + c) + \u03bc bc  \n1 = \u03bb(a + c) + \u03bc ac  \n1 = \u03bb(a + b) + \u03bc ab\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe assuming symmetry here? But since the constraints might not be symmetric, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Let me try that approach. Let me assume that two variables are equal, say a = b. Then, perhaps that gives us a critical point.\n\nLet me suppose a = b. Then, we have variables a, a, c.\n\nThen the constraints become:\n\nab + bc + ac = a\u00b2 + 2ac = 27  \nabc = a\u00b2 c =23\n\nWe can write equations:\n\nLet me denote a = b, so:\n\nFirst equation: a\u00b2 + 2ac =27  \nSecond equation: a\u00b2 c =23\n\nLet me solve for c from the second equation: c = 23/(a\u00b2). Substitute into first equation:\n\na\u00b2 + 2a*(23/(a\u00b2)) =27  \nSimplify: a\u00b2 + (46)/a =27  \nMultiply both sides by a: a\u00b3 +46 =27a  \nThus, a\u00b3 -27a +46 =0\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me see if there are integer roots. Let me try a=2: 8 -54 +46 =0. 8-54 is -46, -46 +46=0. So a=2 is a root. Therefore, we can factor (a-2)(a\u00b2 + 2a -23)=0. The quadratic equation a\u00b2 + 2a -23 =0 would have roots (-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92))/2 = (-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96))/2 = (-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6))/2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6). Since a must be positive, the roots are 2 and -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248 -1 + 4.898 \u2248 3.898, but negative root is -1 - 2\u221a6 which is negative. So possible a is 2 or approximately 3.898.\n\nTherefore, possible solutions when a = b =2, then c =23/(2\u00b2)=23/4=5.75. Let me check if this satisfies the first equation:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac = (4) + 2*(2)*(23/4) =4 + (46/2)=4 +23=27. Yes, that works.\n\nThe other solution is a = -1 + 2\u221a6 \u22483.898. Let me compute c:\n\nc=23/(a\u00b2). Let me compute a\u00b2: ( -1 + 2\u221a6 )\u00b2 =1 -4\u221a6 + 24 =25 -4\u221a6 \u224825 -9.798\u224815.202. Therefore, c\u224823/15.202\u22481.513.\n\nThen check the first equation: a\u00b2 +2ac \u2248 (25 -4\u221a6) +2*(-1 +2\u221a6)*(1.513). Hmm, this might be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps since we have a valid root at a=2, that's one critical point. Let me see if this gives a maximum or minimum?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when variables are unequal, so maybe assuming two variables equal is not the way to go. Alternatively, perhaps trying to use Lagrange multipliers with a = b.\n\nWait, but let's see. If a = b =2, c=23/4, then the space diagonal squared is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 4 +4 + (529/16) = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625. So the space diagonal squared is 41.0625. So r squared would be (41.0625)/4 \u224810.265625. But maybe there's a larger value?\n\nAlternatively, let's try the other solution where a \u22483.898. Let me compute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 when a = b \u22483.898 and c \u22481.513. So a squared is approx (3.898)^2\u224815.19, so two of them would be 30.38, plus c squared \u2248 (1.513)^2\u22482.29, so total a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2\u224832.67, which is actually less than the previous case. Wait, that's strange. So when a is 2, we get a higher value. Hmm, so perhaps the maximum occurs at a=2? But that might not be the case, because maybe when variables are all different, we can get a higher sum of squares?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to consider another case where all variables are different. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the constraints ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23, perhaps we can consider the variables as roots of a cubic equation. Let me denote the variables as a, b, c. Then, as I thought before, the cubic equation would be t^3 - pt^2 +27 t -23=0 where p = a + b + c.\n\nWe need to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = p\u00b2 - 2*27 = p\u00b2 -54. Therefore, to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2, we need to maximize p\u00b2, so maximize |p|. Since a, b, c are positive real numbers, p is positive, so we need to maximize p.\n\nTherefore, our problem reduces to maximizing p = a + b + c, given that ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23. So we need to maximize a + b + c given those two constraints.\n\nHmm, perhaps using AM \u2265 GM or other inequalities?\n\nAlternatively, since we have three variables with fixed product and sum of products, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers again for this two-constraint problem. Let me set up the Lagrangian.\n\nLet me define the function to maximize as f(a,b,c) = a + b + c, with constraints g(a,b,c) = ab + bc + ac -27 =0 and h(a,b,c)=abc -23=0.\n\nThe Lagrangian is L = a + b + c - \u03bb(ab + bc + ac -27) - \u03bc(abc -23).\n\nTaking partial derivatives:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202a = 1 - \u03bb(b + c) - \u03bc bc =0  \n\u2202L/\u2202b =1 - \u03bb(a + c) - \u03bc ac =0  \n\u2202L/\u2202c =1 - \u03bb(a + b) - \u03bc ab =0  \nAnd the constraints: ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23.\n\nSo, the first three equations:\n\n1) 1 = \u03bb(b + c) + \u03bc bc  \n2) 1 = \u03bb(a + c) + \u03bc ac  \n3) 1 = \u03bb(a + b) + \u03bc ab  \n\nHmm, these equations must hold. Let me try to subtract equations to find relations between variables. Let's subtract equation 1 and 2:\n\n[1 -1] = \u03bb[(b + c) - (a + c)] + \u03bc [bc - ac]  \n0 = \u03bb(b - a) + \u03bc c (b - a)  \nFactor (b - a)(\u03bb + \u03bc c) =0.\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 2 - 3:\n\n0 = \u03bb(a + c - a - b) + \u03bc(ac - ab)  \n= \u03bb(c - b) + \u03bc a(c - b)  \n= (c - b)(\u03bb + \u03bc a)=0\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 1 -3:\n\n0 = \u03bb(b + c - a - b) + \u03bc (bc - ab)  \n= \u03bb(c - a) + \u03bc b(c -a)  \n= (c -a)(\u03bb + \u03bc b)=0\n\nTherefore, from these equations, either variables are equal or the other factor is zero.\n\nCase 1: Suppose that two variables are equal, say a = b. Then, from the first difference (b -a)=0, so that holds. Similarly, in the second difference (c - b) must be zero or \u03bb + \u03bc a =0. But if a = b, then let me see.\n\nIf a = b, then from the second equation's difference (c - b)(\u03bb + \u03bc a)=0, so either c = b, making all variables equal, or \u03bb + \u03bc a=0.\n\nIf all variables are equal, then a = b = c. Let me check if that is possible. If a = b = c, then:\n\nab + bc + ac =3a\u00b2 =27 \u21d2a\u00b2=9 \u21d2a=3. Then abc =a\u00b3=27, but the problem states abc=23. So that's impossible, so variables can't all be equal. Therefore, the only possibility is that \u03bb + \u03bc a =0.\n\nSimilarly, if a = b, then from the first equation:\n\n1 = \u03bb(2c + a) + \u03bc a c (Wait, let me recheck the first equation. Wait, equation 1 is when a = b:\n\nWait, equation 1: 1 = \u03bb(b + c) + \u03bc bc. Since a = b, so equation 1 becomes 1 = \u03bb(a + c) + \u03bc a c.\n\nEquation 2: 1 = \u03bb(a + c) + \u03bc a c. So equations 1 and 2 are the same. So the other equations would have to hold.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to proceed step by step. Let me suppose that a = b. Then, variables a, a, c. Then, we can write the equations.\n\nFrom the first three equations, since a = b, let's see:\n\nFrom equation 1 and 2, they are the same. From equation 3:\n\n1 = \u03bb(2a) + \u03bc a\u00b2.\n\nSo equation 3 gives: 1 = 2\u03bb a + \u03bc a\u00b2.\n\nEquation 1: 1 = \u03bb(a + c) + \u03bc a c.\n\nAlso, we have the constraints:\n\nab + bc + ac = a\u00b2 + 2a c =27,\n\nand abc =a\u00b2 c =23.\n\nWe can proceed as before. Let me set up the equations again with a = b.\n\nWe can let\u2019s denote variables with a and c. From the constraints, c =23/(a\u00b2). Then, substitute into the first equation:\n\na\u00b2 + 2a*(23/(a\u00b2)) =27 \u21d2a\u00b2 +46/a =27. This is the same as before, leading to a\u00b3 -27a +46 =0, which factors as (a -2)(a\u00b2 +2a -23)=0. So the roots are a=2 and a= -1 \u00b1\u221a24. Since a must be positive, a=2 or a\u22483.899.\n\nSo, for a=2, c=23/4=5.75. Let's compute \u03bb and \u03bc here. Let me see if the Lagrangian equations hold.\n\nFirst, let me compute \u03bb and \u03bc. From equation 3:\n\n1 = 2\u03bb a + \u03bc a\u00b2. Here, a=2, so:\n\n1 = 4\u03bb + 4\u03bc.\n\nFrom equation 1: 1 = \u03bb(a + c) + \u03bc a c. Here, a=2, c=23/4:\n\n\u03bb*(2 + 23/4) + \u03bc*(2*(23/4)) = \u03bb*(31/4) + \u03bc*(23/2) =1.\n\nSo, two equations:\n\n1) 4\u03bb +4\u03bc =1  \n2) (31/4)\u03bb + (23/2)\u03bc =1\n\nLet me solve these equations. Let me denote equation 1 as:\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 4: 16\u03bb +16\u03bc =4.\n\nEquation 2 multiplied by 4: 31\u03bb +46\u03bc =4.\n\nSo, now:\n\nEquation1: 16\u03bb +16\u03bc =4  \nEquation2:31\u03bb +46\u03bc =4\n\nLet me subtract equation1 from equation2:\n\n(31\u03bb -16\u03bb) + (46\u03bc -16\u03bc)=0  \n15\u03bb +30\u03bc =0 \u21d2 \u03bb = -2\u03bc\n\nSubstitute back into equation1:\n\n16*(-2\u03bc) +16\u03bc =4  \n-32\u03bc +16\u03bc =4 \u21d2 -16\u03bc=4 \u21d2 \u03bc = -4/16 = -1/4.\n\nThen \u03bb = -2*(-1/4)=1/2.\n\nSo, \u03bb=1/2, \u03bc= -1/4. These satisfy both equations.\n\nTherefore, this is a valid critical point. Similarly, for the other root a\u22483.899, we can do similar steps, but perhaps it's a minimum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs at a=2, giving a higher p = a + b + c =2 +2 +5.75=9.75. Let me check the other critical point.\n\nTake a\u22483.899, which is sqrt( (27 + sqrt(27^2 -4*1*46 )) /2 )? Wait, actually the root was a = -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248-1 +4.899\u22483.899. Let me compute p = a +a +c. Since c =23/(a\u00b2). Let me compute a + a +23/a\u00b2.\n\nFirst, let me compute a\u00b2:\n\na = -1 + 2\u221a6 \u22483.89898\n\na\u00b2 = (-1 +2\u221a6)^2 =1 -4\u221a6 +24=25 -4\u221a6 \u224825 -9.798\u224815.202.\n\nThen c=23/a\u00b2\u224823/15.202\u22481.513.\n\nThus, p =2a +c \u22482*(3.89898) +1.513\u22487.798 +1.513\u22489.311.\n\nSo this p is less than 9.75. So indeed, the a=2 case gives a higher p. Therefore, that critical point is a maximum?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other critical points where variables are not equal. Let me think. Suppose all variables are different. Let me see if such a critical point exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs at a=2, so the maximum a +b +c is 9.75. Let me see if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's another approach. Let me consider that for fixed ab + bc + ac and abc, the maximum of a +b +c is achieved when two variables are equal, so that case we found is indeed the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the method of substitution. Let me suppose variables are a, b, c with ab + bc +ac =27 and abc=23. Let me let\u2019s consider that variables are positive real numbers.\n\nLet me consider that to maximize a +b +c, given the constraints. Maybe using the inequality that for fixed ab + bc + ac, the sum a +b +c is maximized when variables are as unequal as possible? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables as x, y, z. Let me fix two variables and see how the third behaves.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the cubic equation with roots a,b,c, the sum a +b +c is the coefficient p. To maximize p, given that the cubic equation t^3 - pt^2 +27 t -23 =0 has three real positive roots.\n\nThe cubic must have three real roots, so its discriminant must be non-negative.\n\nThe discriminant D of t^3 + at^2 + bt +c is D = 18abc -4a^3c +a^2b^2 -4b^3 -27c^2. Wait, perhaps better to recall the discriminant formula for cubic.\n\nWait, the discriminant of cubic equation t^3 + pt^2 + qt + r is [q^2 -3pr]^2 -4[ p q - 3 r]^3. Wait, actually, I might be misremembering. Let me check:\n\nActually, the discriminant D of cubic equation ax\u00b3 +bx\u00b2 +cx +d is D = 18abcd -4b\u00b3d + b\u00b2c\u00b2 - 4ac\u00b3 - 27a\u00b2d\u00b2.\n\nIn our case, the equation is t\u00b3 - p t\u00b2 +27 t -23 =0. So coefficients: a=1, b= -p, c=27, d= -23.\n\nThus discriminant D= 18*(1)*(-p)*(27)*(-23) -4*(-p)^3*(-23) + (-p)^2*(27)^2 -4*(1)*(27)^3 -27*(1)^2*(-23)^2.\n\nThis is going to be complicated, but perhaps we can note that for real roots, discriminant must be non-negative. But maybe this is not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that in order for the cubic to have three real roots, the function must have a local maximum above the x-axis and a local minimum below, or vice versa. Let me compute the derivative of the cubic:\n\nf(t)=t\u00b3 - pt\u00b2 +27t -23\n\nf\u2019(t)=3t\u00b2 -2pt +27.\n\nSetting to zero: 3t\u00b2 -2pt +27 =0.\n\nThe discriminant of this quadratic is (2p)^2 -4*3*27 =4p\u00b2 -324.\n\nFor real critical points, discriminant must be non-negative: 4p\u00b2 -324 \u22650 \u21d2 p\u00b2 \u226581 \u21d2 |p|\u22659. Since p is positive, p\u22659.\n\nTherefore, the cubic has two critical points only when p\u22659. Therefore, for p\u22659, the cubic has a local maximum and minimum. To have three real roots, the value of the cubic at the local maximum must be positive and at the local minimum must be negative, or vice versa.\n\nWait, let me compute the values at the critical points. Let me denote the critical points as t1 and t2, which are roots of 3t\u00b2 -2pt +27=0. Let me compute f(t1) and f(t2). But this might be too involved.\n\nAlternatively, since we found a case where p=9.75 (which is 39/4), which is greater than 9, so that works. The other critical point had p\u22489.31 which is also above 9. So perhaps the maximum p is indeed 39/4=9.75.\n\nSince when variables are a=2, b=2, c=23/4, then p = 2+2+23/4= (4 +4 +23)/4=31/4=7.75? Wait wait, hold on, no. Wait, 2 +2 +5.75 is 9.75, right? 2 +2=4, plus 5.75 is 9.75, yes. So 39/4 is 9.75, which is correct.\n\nWait, 39 divided by 4 is 9.75. So p =39/4. Therefore, the maximum p is 39/4. Then, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = p\u00b2 -54 = (39/4)^2 -54.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(39/4)^2 = (1521)/16\n\n54 is 864/16\n\nSo, 1521/16 - 864/16 = (1521 - 864)/16 = 657/16.\n\nTherefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =657/16. Therefore, r squared is (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2)/4 = (657/16)/4 =657/64.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the space diagonal squared is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2, so r is half of the space diagonal. So r squared is (space diagonal squared)/4, which is (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2)/4. So indeed, that's 657/64. Let me check the arithmetic again.\n\nWait 39/4 squared is (39)^2=1521, over 16. Then subtract 54, which is 54*(16/16)=864/16. So 1521-864 is 657. Therefore, 657/16. Then divided by 4 gives 657/64. So r squared is 657/64.\n\nBut we need to check if this is indeed the maximum. Since we found another critical point with p\u22489.31 which is less than 9.75, and the other critical point is at p=9.75. Since when p increases beyond 9.75, is that possible?\n\nWait, but according to the discriminant condition, p must be at least 9. So 9.75 is above that. But perhaps there are other critical points with higher p?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum p is indeed 39/4, so that gives us the maximum a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 of 657/16, leading to r squared 657/64. Then, 657 and 64: check if they can be reduced. 657 divided by 3 is 219, 64 is 2^6. 657 divided by 3 is 219, which divided by 3 is 73. So 657= 3*3*73. 64 is 2^6. No common factors, so 657/64 is reduced. So p=657, q=64, so p+q=721.\n\nWait, but before finalizing, let me check if there could be a higher value.\n\nSuppose we consider a different case where variables are not two equal. Let me try to see.\n\nSuppose a is very small, approaching zero. Then, since abc=23, if a approaches zero, then bc must approach infinity, but ab + bc +ac approaches bc. So bc must approach 27. But if a approaches zero, then bc=27, but abc=23, so a=23/(bc)=23/27, which is a contradiction as a approaches zero. So variables can't be too skewed.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there exists another critical point where variables are all different. Let me try to see.\n\nSuppose that all variables are different. Let me suppose that a \u2260 b \u2260 c. Then, from the Lagrangian equations:\n\nFrom the first three equations:\n\n1 = \u03bb(b + c) + \u03bc bc  \n1 = \u03bb(a + c) + \u03bc ac  \n1 = \u03bb(a + b) + \u03bc ab  \n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n0 = \u03bb(a - b) + \u03bc c(a - b)  \n= (a - b)(\u03bb + \u03bc c)\n\nSimilarly, subtract second from third:\n\n0 = \u03bb(b - a) + \u03bc a(b - a)  \n= (b - a)(\u03bb + \u03bc a)\n\nTherefore, either a = b or \u03bb + \u03bc c =0 and \u03bb + \u03bc a=0. If a \u2260 b, then we must have \u03bb + \u03bc c =0 and \u03bb + \u03bc a=0. Therefore, setting these equal:\n\n\u03bb + \u03bc c = \u03bb + \u03bc a \u21d2 \u03bc(c -a)=0. Since a\u2260c (assuming variables are all different), then \u03bc=0. But if \u03bc=0, then from the first equation, 1 = \u03bb(b +c). Similarly, second equation 1=\u03bb(a +c). Therefore, \u03bb(b +c)=\u03bb(a +c). Since \u03bb \u22600 (else 1=0), then b +c =a +c \u21d2 a =b. Contradiction. Therefore, the only possibility is a =b. So similar for other variables, so this suggests that in the case of all variables different, we reach a contradiction, so the only critical points occur when at least two variables are equal. Therefore, the maximum must occur at a=2, giving p=39/4, so that the maximum a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 is indeed 657/16, so r squared is 657/64. Therefore, the answer is 657 +64=721.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that the maximum of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 is 657/16. Let me compute the space diagonal squared, which is 657/16, so r squared would be (657/16)/4 =657/64\u224810.2656. Let me see if there is another combination where a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 is larger.\n\nSuppose we take a=1, then bc=23, and ab + bc +ac =1*(b +c) + bc= (b +c)+23=27 \u21d2 b +c=4. So with bc=23 and b +c=4. Then, solving for b and c, they are roots of x\u00b2 -4x +23=0. Discriminant 16 -92= -76 <0, so no real solutions. Thus, a cannot be 1.\n\nWhat if a=3, then bc=23/3\u22487.6667, and ab + bc +ac=3(b +c) + bc=3(b +c) +7.6667=27 \u21d23(b +c)=19.3333 \u21d2b +c\u22486.4444. Then, with bc\u22487.6667 and b +c\u22486.4444, the discriminant of x\u00b2 -6.4444x +7.6667\u22480 would be (6.4444)^2 -4*7.6667\u224841.53 -30.6668\u224810.86>0, so real roots. Thus, possible. Let me compute a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =9 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2. Since b +c\u22486.4444, so (b +c)^2\u224841.53, so b\u00b2 +c\u00b2\u224841.53 -2*7.6667\u224841.53 -15.333\u224826.197. Thus total a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2\u22489 +26.197\u224835.197, which is way less than 657/16\u224841.0625.\n\nHmm, so that's less. What about a=1.5?\n\nThen, bc=23/(1.5)^2\u224823/2.25\u224810.2222. Then ab + bc +ac=1.5(b +c)+10.2222=27 \u21d21.5(b +c)=16.7778 \u21d2b +c\u224811.185.\n\nThen, b and c satisfy x\u00b2 -11.185x +10.2222\u22480. Discriminant\u2248(11.185)^2 -4*10.2222\u2248125.1 -40.888\u224884.212>0. So real roots. Then, b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=(b +c)^2 -2bc\u2248(125.1) -2*10.2222\u2248125.1-20.444\u2248104.656. Wait, that can\u2019t be. Wait, wait, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, (b +c)^2 = (11.185)^2 \u2248125.1, so b\u00b2 +c\u00b2= (b +c)^2 -2bc =125.1 -2*(10.2222)=125.1 -20.444\u2248104.656. Then, total a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2\u2248 (1.5)^2 +104.656\u22482.25 +104.656\u2248106.906. Wait, that's way higher than previous values. Wait, hold on, that can't be right. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, hold on, if a=1.5, then bc=23/(1.5)^2\u224810.2222. Then, ab + bc + ac =1.5*(b +c) + bc=1.5*(b +c)+10.2222=27 \u21d21.5*(b +c)=16.7778 \u21d2b +c\u224811.185. Then, b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=(b +c)^2 -2bc\u2248125.1 -20.444\u2248104.656, so total a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2\u22482.25 +104.656\u2248106.906. Wait, but this is way larger than the previous case of ~41. So that contradicts my previous conclusion.\n\nWait, so maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, but that can't be. If that's the case, then my previous assumption that the maximum is at a=2 is wrong. Hmm, so perhaps I need to check my calculations here.\n\nWait, hold on, if a=1.5, then:\n\nSurface area is 2(ab + bc +ac)=54, so ab + bc +ac=27. If a=1.5, then:\n\nab + bc +ac =1.5b +1.5c + bc =27. Since bc=23/(1.5)^2\u224810.2222. Let me compute 1.5(b +c) +10.2222=27 \u21d21.5(b +c)=16.7778 \u21d2b +c\u224811.185. Then, b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=(b +c)^2 - 2bc\u2248(125.1) - 20.444\u2248104.656. Then, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2\u22482.25 +104.656\u2248106.906. Which is way bigger than the previous case. But then why did the Lagrangian method give a maximum of 657/16\u224841.06?\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the Lagrangian method, I considered the case where a =b, which gave a certain value, but perhaps there are other critical points where variables are not equal which give higher a +b +c.\n\nWait, but in the case where a=1.5, the variables are not equal, so maybe that is a valid case? Wait, but if a=1.5, then b and c would have to be roots of the equation x\u00b2 - (b +c)x + bc=0, which is x\u00b2 -11.185x +10.222\u22480. The roots would be [11.185 \u00b1 sqrt(125.1 -40.888)]/2\u2248[11.185 \u00b1 sqrt(84.2)]/2\u2248[11.185 \u00b19.18]/2. So approximately, (11.185 +9.18)/2\u224820.365/2\u224810.18, and the other root\u2248(11.185-9.18)/2\u22482.005/2\u22481.0025. So variables would be approximately a=1.5, b\u224810.18, c\u22481.0025. Let me check the product abc\u22481.5*10.18*1.0025\u224815.27*1.0025\u224815.3, but the required abc is 23. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, bc was supposed to be\u224810.2222, so 1.5*10.2222\u224815.333, but we need abc=23, so that is not matching. Wait, so my mistake here is in the calculation.\n\nWait, bc=23/(a^2)=23/(2.25)=10.2222, so abc= a* bc=1.5 *10.2222\u224815.333, which is not 23. Wait, so this is impossible. Therefore, my mistake was in the assumption that a=1.5 gives abc=23. Wait, no, if a=1.5, then bc must be 23/(1.5)^2\u224810.2222, so abc= a * bc =1.5*(10.2222)=15.333, which is not 23. Therefore, that case is impossible. Therefore, my mistake was in thinking that I could set a=1.5 and still have abc=23. Therefore, that case is not valid. Therefore, my initial calculation was correct. So that case is impossible.\n\nTherefore, when I set a=1.5, then bc would have to be 23/(1.5)^2\u224810.2222, but then ab + bc +ac=1.5(b +c) +10.2222=27 \u21d21.5(b +c)=16.7778 \u21d2b +c\u224811.185, but then the product bc=10.2222, so abc= a* bc=1.5*10.2222\u224815.333, which is not 23. Therefore, that is impossible. Therefore, my mistake was in miscalculating the product. Therefore, that case is invalid. Therefore, the previous result stands.\n\nTherefore, the maximum a + b +c occurs when two variables are equal at a=2, giving p=9.75=39/4. Therefore, the maximum a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 is (39/4)^2 -54= 1521/16 - 864/16=657/16. Therefore, r squared is 657/64, so p+q=657+64=721.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check another case where variables are different but satisfy the constraints.\n\nSuppose a=3, then bc=23/9\u22482.5556. Then ab + bc +ac=3(b +c) +2.5556=27 \u21d23(b +c)=24.4444 \u21d2b +c\u22488.1481. Then, bc\u22482.5556. Then, b and c must satisfy x\u00b2 -8.1481x +2.5556=0. The discriminant is (8.1481)^2 -10.222\u224866.39 -10.22\u224856.17>0. Thus roots exist. Then, b\u2248 [8.1481 \u00b1 sqrt(56.17)]/2. sqrt(56.17)=7.495. So roots\u2248(8.1481+7.495)/2\u224815.643/2\u22487.8215 and (8.1481-7.495)/2\u22480.653/2\u22480.3265. Thus, variables are a=3, b\u22487.8215, c\u22480.3265. Then, compute a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2\u22489 +61.17 +0.106\u224870.276. This is still less than 657/16\u224841.06? Wait no, 657/16 is 41.06, but 70 is higher. Wait, so this contradicts again.\n\nWait, hold on, 3 squared is 9, 7.8215 squared is approx 61.17, and 0.3265 squared is approx 0.106. So total is 9+61.17+0.106\u224870.276, which is higher than the previous 41.06. Wait, so now I'm really confused. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, hold on, if a=3, then bc=23/9\u22482.5556, then abc=3*(2.5556)=7.6668, but the required volume is 23. Therefore, this is impossible. Wait, so again, mistake here. Because if a=3, then bc must equal 23/3\u22487.6667, not 23/9. Wait, abc=23 \u21d2 bc=23/a. So if a=3, then bc=23/3\u22487.6667, so my previous calculation was wrong. I must have miscalculated bc as 23/(a^2). Wait, no, bc is 23/a, because abc=23 \u21d2 bc=23/a.\n\nWait, so my mistake was in the previous example where I set a=1.5, I incorrectly used bc=23/(a^2). Wait, actually, that was wrong. bc is equal to (23)/a, not 23/(a squared). Wait, abc=23 \u21d2 bc=23/a. So my previous mistake was in assuming bc=23/(a^2), which was incorrect. That was the mistake. So that invalidates all previous incorrect calculations.\n\nOh my goodness, this is a crucial mistake. Let me correct this.\n\nSo, in the case of a=1.5, bc=23/a\u224823/1.5\u224815.3333, not 23/(a squared). So then, ab + bc +ac =1.5(b +c) + bc=1.5(b +c)+15.3333=27 \u21d21.5(b +c)=11.6667 \u21d2b +c\u22487.7778. Then, bc\u224815.3333. Then, b and c are roots of x\u00b2 -7.7778x +15.3333\u22480. The discriminant would be (7.7778)^2 -4*15.3333\u224860.5 -61.333\u2248-0.833 <0. Thus, no real solutions. Therefore, a=1.5 is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, when I considered a=3, bc=23/3\u22487.6667, so ab + bc +ac=3(b +c) +7.6667=27 \u21d23(b +c)=19.3333 \u21d2b +c\u22486.4444. Then bc\u22487.6667. The quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -6.4444x +7.6667\u22480. Discriminant\u2248 (6.4444)^2 -4*7.6667\u224841.53 -30.6668\u224810.86>0, so roots exist. Therefore, variables would be a=3, and b and c\u2248[6.4444 \u00b1 sqrt(10.86)]/2. sqrt(10.86)=3.296. So roots\u2248(6.4444 \u00b13.296)/2. So the two roots are\u2248 (9.74)/2\u22484.87 and (3.148)/2\u22481.574. Therefore, variables a=3, b\u22484.87, c\u22481.574. Then compute a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2\u22489 +23.7 +2.475\u224835.175, which is less than 657/16\u224841.06. Therefore, okay, so this is consistent.\n\nTherefore, my previous mistake was in miscalculating bc as 23/a\u00b2 instead of 23/a. That was a critical error. So now, the earlier result holds.\n\nTherefore, the maximum a +b +c occurs at a = b =2, c=23/(2*2)=23/4, giving p=2+2+23/4= (8 +23)/4=31/4=7.75? Wait wait, hold on, 2+2 is 4, plus 23/4 is 4 +5.75=9.75, which is 39/4. Yes, so p=39/4. Therefore, a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2= p\u00b2 -2(ab + bc +ac)= (39/4)^2 -54= (1521/16) - (864/16)=657/16. So r squared is (657/16)/4=657/64. 657 and 64 are coprime? Let me check.\n\n657 divided by 3 is 219, which divided by 3 is 73. So 657=3\u00d73\u00d773. 64 is 2^6. So no common factors. Therefore, 657+64=721.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 721. But let me confirm once more.\n\nWait, let me compute 39/4 squared:\n\n39 divided by 4 is 9.75. Squared is 95.0625. 95.0625 minus 54 is 41.0625. Which is 657/16 (since 657 divided by16 is 41.0625). Then divided by4 gives 10.265625, which is 657/64. So yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 657 +64=721.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{721}\n\n\nGiven a set of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, we need to find the radius \\( r \\) of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. The value of \\( r^2 \\) is required, expressed as a fraction \\( \\frac{p}{q} \\), and we need to find \\( p + q \\).\n\nFirst, we note that for a rectangular box with dimensions \\( a, b, c \\), the constraints are:\n\\[\n2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 \\implies ab + bc + ac = 27\n\\]\n\\[\nabc = 23\n\\]\n\nThe radius \\( r \\) of the smallest sphere containing the box is half the space diagonal of the box, given by:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}\n\\]\nThus, we need to maximize \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \\), which is equivalent to maximizing \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\).\n\nUsing the identity:\n\\[\n(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ac)\n\\]\nwe can express \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\) as:\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac)\n\\]\nGiven \\( ab + bc + ac = 27 \\), this becomes:\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 54\n\\]\n\nTo maximize \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\), we need to maximize \\( a + b + c \\). Using Lagrange multipliers and considering symmetry, we find that the maximum occurs when two variables are equal. Setting \\( a = b \\), we solve:\n\\[\na^2 + 2ac = 27 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a^2 c = 23\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( c = \\frac{23}{a^2} \\) into the first equation:\n\\[\na^2 + 2a \\left( \\frac{23}{a^2} \\right) = 27 \\implies a^3 - 27a + 46 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving this cubic equation, we find \\( a = 2 \\) is a root. Thus, \\( a = b = 2 \\) and \\( c = \\frac{23}{4} \\). Calculating \\( a + b + c \\):\n\\[\na + b + c = 2 + 2 + \\frac{23}{4} = \\frac{39}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\) is:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{39}{4} \\right)^2 - 54 = \\frac{1521}{16} - \\frac{864}{16} = \\frac{657}{16}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, \\( r^2 \\) is:\n\\[\nr^2 = \\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{4} = \\frac{657}{64}\n\\]\n\nThe fraction \\( \\frac{657}{64} \\) is in simplest form, so \\( p = 657 \\) and \\( q = 64 \\). Hence, \\( p + q = 657 + 64 = 721 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{721}\n\\]",
