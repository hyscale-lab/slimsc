      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, since z is a complex number with modulus 4, I can represent z in polar form. Let me recall that any complex number z with |z| = r can be written as z = r e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument. Here, r is 4, so z = 4 e^{i\u03b8}. That might make things easier because polar coordinates can simplify modulus-related conditions.\n\nSo, let me set z = 4 e^{i\u03b8}. Then, 1/z would be (1/(4 e^{i\u03b8})) = (1/4) e^{-i\u03b8}. That's because the modulus of 1/z is 1/4, and the argument is -\u03b8. \n\nNow, substituting z and 1/z into the expression:\n\n(75 + 117i) z + (96 + 144i)/z \n\nbecomes:\n\n(75 + 117i) * 4 e^{i\u03b8} + (96 + 144i) * (1/(4 e^{i\u03b8}))\n\nLet me compute each term separately. \n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i) * 4 e^{i\u03b8} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)/(4 e^{i\u03b8}) = (24 + 36i) * e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nWait, because 96 divided by 4 is 24 and 144 divided by 4 is 36. So the second term simplifies to (24 + 36i) e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nSo the entire expression is:\n\n4*(75 + 117i)*e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)*e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nHmm. Now, maybe I can write each of these terms in terms of their real and imaginary parts. But since we are interested in the real part of the entire expression, perhaps I can compute the real parts of each term and add them together.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to write everything in terms of cosine and sine. Let me see. Let me denote \u03b8 as the angle. Since e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8 and e^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8. \n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 4*(75 + 117i)*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)\n\nLet me compute that multiplication. Let's distribute:\n\n4*[75*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) + 117i*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)]\n\n= 4*[75 cos\u03b8 + 75i sin\u03b8 + 117i cos\u03b8 + 117i^2 sin\u03b8]\n\nSince i^2 = -1, so the last term becomes -117 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo combining terms:\n\n= 4*[75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8 + i (75 sin\u03b8 + 117 cos\u03b8)]\n\nTherefore, the real part of the first term is 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8) and the imaginary part is 4*(75 sin\u03b8 + 117 cos\u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, the second term is (24 + 36i)*(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8). Let's compute that:\n\n(24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) = 24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36i^2 sin\u03b8\n\nAgain, i^2 = -1, so the last term becomes +36 sin\u03b8. \n\nCombine terms:\n\nReal parts: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nImaginary parts: (-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8)i\n\nTherefore, the real part of the second term is 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8, and the imaginary part is (-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8).\n\nNow, the total expression's real part is the sum of the real parts of the two terms. The imaginary parts will cancel out or add up, but since we only care about the real part, let's focus on that.\n\nTotal real part = [4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8)] + [24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8]\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst term inside the brackets: 4*75 cos\u03b8 = 300 cos\u03b8\n\n4*(-117 sin\u03b8) = -468 sin\u03b8\n\nSecond term: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nAdding all together:\n\n300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8 + 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(300 cos\u03b8 + 24 cos\u03b8) + (-468 sin\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8)\n\n= 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8\n\nSo the real part of the entire expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of the expression 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. \n\nHmm, okay. To find the maximum of a function like A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, the standard approach is to write it in the form C cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) or C sin(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where C is the amplitude. The maximum value would then be C. \n\nWait, let me recall the formula: for an expression like a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8, the maximum value is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). \n\nYes, that's right. Because you can write it as R cos(\u03b8 - \u03b4), where R = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). Therefore, the maximum value is R. \n\nSo in this case, the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. Let me see, that's equivalent to a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8 where a = 324 and b = -432. \n\nTherefore, the maximum value is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2). Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, compute 324 squared: 324^2. Let me compute 300^2 = 90000, 24^2 = 576, and cross term 2*300*24 = 14400. So (300 +24)^2 = 300\u00b2 + 2*300*24 +24\u00b2 = 90000 +14400 +576 = 104, 976? Wait:\n\nWait, 300+24=324, so 324 squared:\n\n324 * 324:\n\nLet me compute 320\u00b2 = 102,400\n\nThen (320 +4)^2 = 320\u00b2 + 2*320*4 +4\u00b2 = 102,400 + 2560 + 16 = 104,976. So yes, 324\u00b2 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432 squared: 432^2. Let's compute 400\u00b2 = 160,000. 32\u00b2=1,024. The cross term is 2*400*32=25,600. So (400+32)^2 = 400\u00b2 + 2*400*32 +32\u00b2 = 160,000 +25,600 +1,024 = 186,624. \n\nTherefore, since b is -432, the square is still 432\u00b2 = 186,624.\n\nThus, the sum is 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600. \n\nSo sqrt(291,600). Let me compute sqrt(291600). Hmm, sqrt(291600) = sqrt(2916 * 100) = sqrt(2916) * 10. \n\nWhat's sqrt(2916)? Let's see: 54 squared is 2916 (since 50\u00b2=2500, 54\u00b2=2916). So sqrt(2916)=54. Therefore, sqrt(291600)=54*10=540. \n\nTherefore, the maximum value of the expression 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8 is 540. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me confirm that. The formula says that the maximum of a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8 is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). Since here the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 + (-432) sin\u03b8, so a = 324, b = -432. So sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2) which is indeed sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540. \n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me check if there are any mistakes in the steps. Let me go through again. \n\nStarting from the expression:\n\nReal part = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nThen, using the formula for maximum of a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8, which is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). \n\nYes, so sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) is correct. \n\nCalculations:\n\n324 squared is 104,976; 432 squared is 186,624. Adding them gives 291,600. Square root is 540. That's correct. \n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nWait, but let me just think again if there was any mistake in the earlier steps when expanding the terms. Let me double-check the real parts. \n\nOriginal expression after substituting z = 4e^{i\u03b8} and 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}:\n\nFirst term: (75 +117i)*4e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (96+144i)/4 * e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nExpanding the first term's real part:\n\n4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8). That's correct because when you multiply (75 +117i) by e^{i\u03b8}, the real part comes from 75*cos\u03b8 -117*sin\u03b8, then multiplied by 4.\n\nSecond term's real part is (24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8). Because (24 +36i)*(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8) gives real parts 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 (since the cross terms with i will be imaginary). \n\nAdding them gives 4*(75 cos\u03b8 -117 sin\u03b8) +24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, 4*(75 cos\u03b8) is 300 cos\u03b8, 4*(-117 sin\u03b8) is -468 sin\u03b8. Then adding 24 cos\u03b8 gives 300 +24 = 324 cos\u03b8. The sin terms: -468 sin\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 is -432 sin\u03b8. So yes, 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. That's correct.\n\nTherefore, the maximum is indeed 540. \n\nHmm, so then the answer should be 540? Let me see if there's any possible mistake here. \n\nWait, but let me check if maybe the problem requires z \u2260 0? Well, since |z|=4, z can't be zero, so that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach where I can parametrize z differently. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me see if taking derivative would give the same result. \n\nSuppose I consider the real part as a function of \u03b8: f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. \n\nTo find its maximum, take derivative f\u2019(\u03b8) = -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8. \n\nSet derivative to zero: -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8 =0 \u2192 324 sin\u03b8 +432 cos\u03b8 =0 \n\nDivide both sides by cos\u03b8 (assuming cos\u03b8 \u22600):\n\n324 tan\u03b8 +432 =0 \u2192 tan\u03b8 = -432/324 = -4/3 (since 432 divided by 324 is 4/3? Wait, 432/324 = 4/3, yes. So tan\u03b8 = -4/3. \n\nSo \u03b8 is in the second or fourth quadrant. \n\nThen, the critical points are at \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3). Let me compute the value of f(\u03b8) at that angle. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum value can be found via the amplitude as before. \n\nAlternatively, using the critical point: \n\nLet me let tan\u03b8 = -4/3. Let me set up a right triangle where opposite is -4 and adjacent is 3 (but since tan\u03b8 is negative, \u03b8 is in the second or fourth quadrant). Let me take \u03b8 in the fourth quadrant first. \n\nSo, cos\u03b8 = 3/5, sin\u03b8 = -4/5 (if in fourth quadrant). \n\nWait, if tan\u03b8 = -4/3, then the reference angle has opposite 4, adjacent 3, hypotenuse 5. So in fourth quadrant, sin\u03b8 = -4/5, cos\u03b8 = 3/5. \n\nThen f(\u03b8) = 324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (972 +1728)/5 = 2700/5 = 540. \n\nSimilarly, if \u03b8 is in second quadrant, cos\u03b8 = -3/5, sin\u03b8 =4/5. \n\nThen f(\u03b8)=324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5)= (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-2700)/5 = -540. \n\nTherefore, maximum is 540, minimum is -540. \n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is indeed 540. \n\nHmm, so that seems consistent. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 540. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there's any mistake in substituting z in polar form. \n\nWe set z =4 e^{i\u03b8}, which is correct since |z|=4. Then 1/z is (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}, so the second term (96+144i)/z becomes (96+144i)/(4 e^{i\u03b8}) which is (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}, correct. \n\nThen expanding the terms, the real parts computed correctly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an alternative approach using vectors or gradients, but I think this method is solid. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers? Let me see. \n\nLet me think of z as a complex number, so write z = x + yi, with x and y real numbers, and x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 16 (since |z|=4). Then, the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. Let me compute the real part of this. \n\nBut that might get more complicated, but let's try. \n\nLet me denote z = x + yi, so 1/z = (x - yi)/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = (x - yi)/16 since |z|\u00b2=16. \n\nSo (75+117i)z = (75+117i)(x + yi) = 75x +75 yi +117i x +117i\u00b2 y \n\n=75x +75 yi +117i x -117 y \n\nSo real part is 75x -117 y, and imaginary part is 75y +117x. \n\nThen (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(x - yi)/16 \n\n= [96x -96 yi +144i x -144i\u00b2 y]/16 \n\n= [96x -96 yi +144i x +144 y]/16 \n\nSeparate real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: (96x +144 y)/16 \n\nImaginary part: (-96 y +144x)/16 \n\nTherefore, the real part of the entire expression is:\n\n[75x -117 y] + [ (96x +144y)/16 ]\n\nLet me compute that. \n\nFirst term: 75x -117 y\n\nSecond term: (96x +144y)/16 = (96/16)x + (144/16)y = 6x +9y\n\nTherefore total real part:\n\n75x -117y +6x +9y = (75x +6x) + (-117y +9y) =81x -108y\n\nWait, hold on! This is conflicting with the previous result where I had 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nWait, so this is a problem. There is inconsistency here. \n\nWait, so in the first approach, using polar coordinates, I got the real part as 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nBut here, using Cartesian coordinates, I get 81x -108y. \n\nHmm, that must mean I made a mistake in one of the approaches. \n\nWait, let me check the Cartesian approach again. \n\nFirst, (75 +117i)z where z = x + yi:\n\nReal part is 75x -117y. Correct. \n\nThen (96+144i)/z. Since 1/z is (x - yi)/16, so multiplying (96 +144i)*(x - yi)/16. \n\nLet me recompute that:\n\n(96)(x) + (96)(-yi) + (144i)(x) + (144i)(-yi)\n\n=96x -96yi +144i x -144i\u00b2 y\n\n=96x -96yi +144i x +144 y (since i\u00b2 = -1, so -144i\u00b2 y = +144 y)\n\nTherefore, grouping real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal parts: 96x +144y\n\nImaginary parts: (-96y +144x)i\n\nTherefore, dividing by 16:\n\nReal part of (96+144i)/z is (96x +144y)/16 = (96/16)x + (144/16)y = 6x +9y. Correct. \n\nTherefore, total real part is 75x -117y +6x +9y = 81x -108y. \n\nHmm. So according to Cartesian coordinates, real part is 81x -108y. \n\nBut according to polar coordinates, it was 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nBut if z =4 e^{i\u03b8}, then x =4 cos\u03b8, y=4 sin\u03b8. So substituting into 81x -108y:\n\n81*(4 cos\u03b8) -108*(4 sin\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Which matches the previous result. \n\nTherefore, both approaches agree. So that's reassuring. \n\nTherefore, the real part is indeed 81x -108y, which is equal to 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nTherefore, the maximum value is sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2)=540, as before. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 540. \n\nWait, but let me see, perhaps I need to check if there is an error in the initial problem setup. \n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is (75 +117i)z + (96+144i)/z. \n\nIn the Cartesian approach, the real part is 81x -108y, but in the polar approach, it's 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nBut if I use Lagrange multipliers here, maybe that can confirm. \n\nWe need to maximize 81x -108y subject to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 16. \n\nThe maximum of a linear function over the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16 is equal to the norm of the coefficient vector times the radius. \n\nThe coefficient vector here is (81, -108). Its norm is sqrt(81\u00b2 + (-108)^2). \n\nCompute that: 81 squared is 6561, 108 squared is 11664. \n\nThus sqrt(6561 + 11664) = sqrt(18225). \n\nWhat's sqrt(18225)? Let me see: 135 squared is 18225, because 130\u00b2=16900, 135\u00b2 = (130 +5)^2 = 130\u00b2 + 2*130*5 +5\u00b2 = 16900 +1300 +25 = 18225. \n\nThus, the norm is 135. \n\nThen, the maximum value is 135 * 4 (since radius is 4). Wait, no. Wait, the formula is that the maximum of ax + by over x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2 is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)*r. \n\nWait, yes. Because the maximum of ax + by on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2 is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)*r. \n\nTherefore here, a =81, b = -108, so sqrt(81\u00b2 +108\u00b2) =135, so maximum is 135*4=540. \n\nExactly! So that's another way to get 540. \n\nTherefore, all methods converge to the same answer. \n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the maximum real part is 540. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 540. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{540}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, since z is a complex number with modulus 4, I can represent z in polar form. Let me recall that any complex number z with |z| = r can be written as z = r e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument. Here, r is 4, so z = 4 e^{i\u03b8}. That might make things easier because polar coordinates can simplify modulus-related conditions.\n\nSo, let me set z = 4 e^{i\u03b8}. Then, 1/z would be (1/(4 e^{i\u03b8})) = (1/4) e^{-i\u03b8}. That's because the modulus of 1/z is 1/4, and the argument is -\u03b8. \n\nNow, substituting z and 1/z into the expression:\n\n(75 + 117i) z + (96 + 144i)/z \n\nbecomes:\n\n(75 + 117i) * 4 e^{i\u03b8} + (96 + 144i) * (1/(4 e^{i\u03b8}))\n\nLet me compute each term separately. \n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i) * 4 e^{i\u03b8} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)/(4 e^{i\u03b8}) = (24 + 36i) * e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nWait, because 96 divided by 4 is 24 and 144 divided by 4 is 36. So the second term simplifies to (24 + 36i) e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nSo the entire expression is:\n\n4*(75 + 117i)*e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)*e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nHmm. Now, maybe I can write each of these terms in terms of their real and imaginary parts. But since we are interested in the real part of the entire expression, perhaps I can compute the real parts of each term and add them together.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to write everything in terms of cosine and sine. Let me see. Let me denote \u03b8 as the angle. Since e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8 and e^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8. \n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 4*(75 + 117i)*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)\n\nLet me compute that multiplication. Let's distribute:\n\n4*[75*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) + 117i*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)]\n\n= 4*[75 cos\u03b8 + 75i sin\u03b8 + 117i cos\u03b8 + 117i^2 sin\u03b8]\n\nSince i^2 = -1, so the last term becomes -117 sin\u03b8.\n\nSo combining terms:\n\n= 4*[75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8 + i (75 sin\u03b8 + 117 cos\u03b8)]\n\nTherefore, the real part of the first term is 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8) and the imaginary part is 4*(75 sin\u03b8 + 117 cos\u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, the second term is (24 + 36i)*(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8). Let's compute that:\n\n(24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) = 24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36i^2 sin\u03b8\n\nAgain, i^2 = -1, so the last term becomes +36 sin\u03b8. \n\nCombine terms:\n\nReal parts: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nImaginary parts: (-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8)i\n\nTherefore, the real part of the second term is 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8, and the imaginary part is (-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8).\n\nNow, the total expression's real part is the sum of the real parts of the two terms. The imaginary parts will cancel out or add up, but since we only care about the real part, let's focus on that.\n\nTotal real part = [4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8)] + [24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8]\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst term inside the brackets: 4*75 cos\u03b8 = 300 cos\u03b8\n\n4*(-117 sin\u03b8) = -468 sin\u03b8\n\nSecond term: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nAdding all together:\n\n300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8 + 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(300 cos\u03b8 + 24 cos\u03b8) + (-468 sin\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8)\n\n= 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8\n\nSo the real part of the entire expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of the expression 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. \n\nHmm, okay. To find the maximum of a function like A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, the standard approach is to write it in the form C cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) or C sin(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where C is the amplitude. The maximum value would then be C. \n\nWait, let me recall the formula: for an expression like a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8, the maximum value is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). \n\nYes, that's right. Because you can write it as R cos(\u03b8 - \u03b4), where R = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). Therefore, the maximum value is R. \n\nSo in this case, the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. Let me see, that's equivalent to a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8 where a = 324 and b = -432. \n\nTherefore, the maximum value is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2). Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, compute 324 squared: 324^2. Let me compute 300^2 = 90000, 24^2 = 576, and cross term 2*300*24 = 14400. So (300 +24)^2 = 300\u00b2 + 2*300*24 +24\u00b2 = 90000 +14400 +576 = 104, 976? Wait:\n\nWait, 300+24=324, so 324 squared:\n\n324 * 324:\n\nLet me compute 320\u00b2 = 102,400\n\nThen (320 +4)^2 = 320\u00b2 + 2*320*4 +4\u00b2 = 102,400 + 2560 + 16 = 104,976. So yes, 324\u00b2 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432 squared: 432^2. Let's compute 400\u00b2 = 160,000. 32\u00b2=1,024. The cross term is 2*400*32=25,600. So (400+32)^2 = 400\u00b2 + 2*400*32 +32\u00b2 = 160,000 +25,600 +1,024 = 186,624. \n\nTherefore, since b is -432, the square is still 432\u00b2 = 186,624.\n\nThus, the sum is 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600. \n\nSo sqrt(291,600). Let me compute sqrt(291600). Hmm, sqrt(291600) = sqrt(2916 * 100) = sqrt(2916) * 10. \n\nWhat's sqrt(2916)? Let's see: 54 squared is 2916 (since 50\u00b2=2500, 54\u00b2=2916). So sqrt(2916)=54. Therefore, sqrt(291600)=54*10=540. \n\nTherefore, the maximum value of the expression 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8 is 540. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me confirm that. The formula says that the maximum of a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8 is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). Since here the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 + (-432) sin\u03b8, so a = 324, b = -432. So sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2) which is indeed sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540. \n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me check if there are any mistakes in the steps. Let me go through again. \n\nStarting from the expression:\n\nReal part = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nThen, using the formula for maximum of a cos\u03b8 + b sin\u03b8, which is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). \n\nYes, so sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) is correct. \n\nCalculations:\n\n324 squared is 104,976; 432 squared is 186,624. Adding them gives 291,600. Square root is 540. That's correct. \n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nWait, but let me just think again if there was any mistake in the earlier steps when expanding the terms. Let me double-check the real parts. \n\nOriginal expression after substituting z = 4e^{i\u03b8} and 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}:\n\nFirst term: (75 +117i)*4e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (96+144i)/4 * e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nExpanding the first term's real part:\n\n4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8). That's correct because when you multiply (75 +117i) by e^{i\u03b8}, the real part comes from 75*cos\u03b8 -117*sin\u03b8, then multiplied by 4.\n\nSecond term's real part is (24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8). Because (24 +36i)*(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8) gives real parts 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 (since the cross terms with i will be imaginary). \n\nAdding them gives 4*(75 cos\u03b8 -117 sin\u03b8) +24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, 4*(75 cos\u03b8) is 300 cos\u03b8, 4*(-117 sin\u03b8) is -468 sin\u03b8. Then adding 24 cos\u03b8 gives 300 +24 = 324 cos\u03b8. The sin terms: -468 sin\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 is -432 sin\u03b8. So yes, 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. That's correct.\n\nTherefore, the maximum is indeed 540. \n\nHmm, so then the answer should be 540? Let me see if there's any possible mistake here. \n\nWait, but let me check if maybe the problem requires z \u2260 0? Well, since |z|=4, z can't be zero, so that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach where I can parametrize z differently. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me see if taking derivative would give the same result. \n\nSuppose I consider the real part as a function of \u03b8: f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. \n\nTo find its maximum, take derivative f\u2019(\u03b8) = -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8. \n\nSet derivative to zero: -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8 =0 \u2192 324 sin\u03b8 +432 cos\u03b8 =0 \n\nDivide both sides by cos\u03b8 (assuming cos\u03b8 \u22600):\n\n324 tan\u03b8 +432 =0 \u2192 tan\u03b8 = -432/324 = -4/3 (since 432 divided by 324 is 4/3? Wait, 432/324 = 4/3, yes. So tan\u03b8 = -4/3. \n\nSo \u03b8 is in the second or fourth quadrant. \n\nThen, the critical points are at \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3). Let me compute the value of f(\u03b8) at that angle. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum value can be found via the amplitude as before. \n\nAlternatively, using the critical point: \n\nLet me let tan\u03b8 = -4/3. Let me set up a right triangle where opposite is -4 and adjacent is 3 (but since tan\u03b8 is negative, \u03b8 is in the second or fourth quadrant). Let me take \u03b8 in the fourth quadrant first. \n\nSo, cos\u03b8 = 3/5, sin\u03b8 = -4/5 (if in fourth quadrant). \n\nWait, if tan\u03b8 = -4/3, then the reference angle has opposite 4, adjacent 3, hypotenuse 5. So in fourth quadrant, sin\u03b8 = -4/5, cos\u03b8 = 3/5. \n\nThen f(\u03b8) = 324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (972 +1728)/5 = 2700/5 = 540. \n\nSimilarly, if \u03b8 is in second quadrant, cos\u03b8 = -3/5, sin\u03b8 =4/5. \n\nThen f(\u03b8)=324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5)= (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-2700)/5 = -540. \n\nTherefore, maximum is 540, minimum is -540. \n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is indeed 540. \n\nHmm, so that seems consistent. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 540. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there's any mistake in substituting z in polar form. \n\nWe set z =4 e^{i\u03b8}, which is correct since |z|=4. Then 1/z is (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}, so the second term (96+144i)/z becomes (96+144i)/(4 e^{i\u03b8}) which is (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}, correct. \n\nThen expanding the terms, the real parts computed correctly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an alternative approach using vectors or gradients, but I think this method is solid. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers? Let me see. \n\nLet me think of z as a complex number, so write z = x + yi, with x and y real numbers, and x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 16 (since |z|=4). Then, the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. Let me compute the real part of this. \n\nBut that might get more complicated, but let's try. \n\nLet me denote z = x + yi, so 1/z = (x - yi)/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = (x - yi)/16 since |z|\u00b2=16. \n\nSo (75+117i)z = (75+117i)(x + yi) = 75x +75 yi +117i x +117i\u00b2 y \n\n=75x +75 yi +117i x -117 y \n\nSo real part is 75x -117 y, and imaginary part is 75y +117x. \n\nThen (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(x - yi)/16 \n\n= [96x -96 yi +144i x -144i\u00b2 y]/16 \n\n= [96x -96 yi +144i x +144 y]/16 \n\nSeparate real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: (96x +144 y)/16 \n\nImaginary part: (-96 y +144x)/16 \n\nTherefore, the real part of the entire expression is:\n\n[75x -117 y] + [ (96x +144y)/16 ]\n\nLet me compute that. \n\nFirst term: 75x -117 y\n\nSecond term: (96x +144y)/16 = (96/16)x + (144/16)y = 6x +9y\n\nTherefore total real part:\n\n75x -117y +6x +9y = (75x +6x) + (-117y +9y) =81x -108y\n\nWait, hold on! This is conflicting with the previous result where I had 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nWait, so this is a problem. There is inconsistency here. \n\nWait, so in the first approach, using polar coordinates, I got the real part as 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nBut here, using Cartesian coordinates, I get 81x -108y. \n\nHmm, that must mean I made a mistake in one of the approaches. \n\nWait, let me check the Cartesian approach again. \n\nFirst, (75 +117i)z where z = x + yi:\n\nReal part is 75x -117y. Correct. \n\nThen (96+144i)/z. Since 1/z is (x - yi)/16, so multiplying (96 +144i)*(x - yi)/16. \n\nLet me recompute that:\n\n(96)(x) + (96)(-yi) + (144i)(x) + (144i)(-yi)\n\n=96x -96yi +144i x -144i\u00b2 y\n\n=96x -96yi +144i x +144 y (since i\u00b2 = -1, so -144i\u00b2 y = +144 y)\n\nTherefore, grouping real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal parts: 96x +144y\n\nImaginary parts: (-96y +144x)i\n\nTherefore, dividing by 16:\n\nReal part of (96+144i)/z is (96x +144y)/16 = (96/16)x + (144/16)y = 6x +9y. Correct. \n\nTherefore, total real part is 75x -117y +6x +9y = 81x -108y. \n\nHmm. So according to Cartesian coordinates, real part is 81x -108y. \n\nBut according to polar coordinates, it was 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nBut if z =4 e^{i\u03b8}, then x =4 cos\u03b8, y=4 sin\u03b8. So substituting into 81x -108y:\n\n81*(4 cos\u03b8) -108*(4 sin\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Which matches the previous result. \n\nTherefore, both approaches agree. So that's reassuring. \n\nTherefore, the real part is indeed 81x -108y, which is equal to 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nTherefore, the maximum value is sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2)=540, as before. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 540. \n\nWait, but let me see, perhaps I need to check if there is an error in the initial problem setup. \n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is (75 +117i)z + (96+144i)/z. \n\nIn the Cartesian approach, the real part is 81x -108y, but in the polar approach, it's 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nBut if I use Lagrange multipliers here, maybe that can confirm. \n\nWe need to maximize 81x -108y subject to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 16. \n\nThe maximum of a linear function over the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16 is equal to the norm of the coefficient vector times the radius. \n\nThe coefficient vector here is (81, -108). Its norm is sqrt(81\u00b2 + (-108)^2). \n\nCompute that: 81 squared is 6561, 108 squared is 11664. \n\nThus sqrt(6561 + 11664) = sqrt(18225). \n\nWhat's sqrt(18225)? Let me see: 135 squared is 18225, because 130\u00b2=16900, 135\u00b2 = (130 +5)^2 = 130\u00b2 + 2*130*5 +5\u00b2 = 16900 +1300 +25 = 18225. \n\nThus, the norm is 135. \n\nThen, the maximum value is 135 * 4 (since radius is 4). Wait, no. Wait, the formula is that the maximum of ax + by over x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2 is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)*r. \n\nWait, yes. Because the maximum of ax + by on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2 is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)*r. \n\nTherefore here, a =81, b = -108, so sqrt(81\u00b2 +108\u00b2) =135, so maximum is 135*4=540. \n\nExactly! So that's another way to get 540. \n\nTherefore, all methods converge to the same answer. \n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the maximum real part is 540. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 540. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{540}\n\n\nTo find the largest possible real part of the expression \\((75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\) where \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), we start by representing \\(z\\) in polar form.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, complex numbers and their moduli... Let me start by recalling some properties.\n\nFirst, since |z| = 4, that means z is a complex number lying on a circle with radius 4 centered at the origin. Maybe I can represent z in polar form? Like z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. That might simplify things because then 1/z would be (1/(4e^{i\u03b8})) = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. Let me try that substitution.\n\nLet me denote z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. Then plug these into the expression:\n\n(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z = (75 + 117i)(4e^{i\u03b8}) + (96 + 144i)(1/(4e^{i\u03b8})).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} = 4*(75 + 117i)e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}) = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\n4*(75 + 117i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nHmm, okay. Let me write this as:\n\n[4*(75 + 117i)]e^{i\u03b8} + [24 + 36i]e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nMaybe I can combine these terms by expressing them in terms of sine and cosine? Since e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8 and e^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the real and imaginary parts separately. Since the problem asks for the largest possible real part, I can focus on the real components of the entire expression and maximize that.\n\nLet me compute the real part of the expression step by step.\n\nFirst, let me compute the real part of each term.\n\nStarting with the first term: 4*(75 + 117i)e^{i\u03b8}\n\nLet me denote A = 4*(75 + 117i). Let me compute A:\n\nA = 4*75 + 4*117i = 300 + 468i.\n\nSo, the first term is (300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). The real part of this term is:\n\n300*cos\u03b8 - 468*sin\u03b8. (Because when you multiply (a + ib)(c + id), the real part is ac - bd.)\n\nSimilarly, the second term is (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8). The real part of this term is:\n\n24*cos\u03b8 + 36*sin\u03b8. (Again, using the same multiplication rule.)\n\nTherefore, the total real part of the entire expression is:\n\n[300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8] + [24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8] = (300 + 24)cos\u03b8 + (-468 + 36) sin\u03b8\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n300 +24 = 324\n\n-468 +36 = -432\n\nSo the real part simplifies to 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nNow, the problem is to maximize this expression: 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nHmm, this is of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, but here it's A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 where A = 324 and B = -432. Wait, actually, it's 324 cos\u03b8 + (-432) sin\u03b8. So, to find the maximum of this expression, I can use the formula for the amplitude of a sinusoidal function. The maximum value of C cos\u03b8 + D sin\u03b8 is sqrt(C\u00b2 + D\u00b2). Wait, let me recall: yes, the maximum of a*cos\u03b8 + b*sin\u03b8 is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So in this case, the maximum would be sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 324 squared: 324^2. Let me see: 300\u00b2 is 90000, 24\u00b2 is 576, and cross term 2*300*24 = 14400. So (300 +24)^2 = 300\u00b2 + 2*300*24 +24\u00b2 = 90000 +14400 +576 = 90000+14400 is 104400 +576 is 104,976. So 324\u00b2 = 104,976.\n\nThen 432 squared: 432^2. Let's compute 400\u00b2=160,000, 32\u00b2=1,024, and cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600. So (400+32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 +1,024 = 160,000 +25,600 is 185,600 +1,024 is 186,624. But since the coefficient here is -432, the square is still 432\u00b2 = 186,624.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value is sqrt(104,976 + 186,624). Let me add those two numbers:\n\n104,976 + 186,624. Let's see: 100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000; 4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600. So total is 280,000 + 11,600 = 291,600. Therefore sqrt(291,600). Hmm, sqrt(291,600). Let me see: 540 squared is 291,600 because 500\u00b2=250,000, 40\u00b2=1,600, and cross term 2*500*40=40,000, so (500+40)^2=540\u00b2=291,600. Yes, so sqrt(291,600)=540. Therefore the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me verify that formula again. The maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is indeed sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). So here, A is 324, B is -432. So sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2) which is exactly what I did. So that gives 540. So the maximum real part is 540?\n\nBut wait, let me check the steps again because sometimes I might have made an error in the coefficients.\n\nStarting from the original expression:\n\nReal part is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. So the coefficients are A=324, B= -432. So the amplitude is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2). Which is indeed sqrt( (324)^2 + (432)^2 ). Let me confirm the addition again:\n\n324\u00b2 is 104,976 and 432\u00b2 is 186,624. Adding them gives 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600, whose square root is indeed 540. So that part seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible real part is 540. Hmm, but wait a second. Is there any constraint on \u03b8? Since z is any complex number with |z|=4, \u03b8 can be any angle between 0 and 2\u03c0, so the maximum over all \u03b8 is indeed 540. Therefore, the answer is 540?\n\nBut let me think again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the real parts earlier. Let me retrace.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i)z where z=4e^{i\u03b8}. So that's (75 +117i)*4*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). So expanding this:\n\nThe real part would be 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8). Wait, hold on, that's different from what I had before. Wait, wait a second. Wait, (a + ib)(c + id) has real part ac - bd. So here, (75 + 117i) multiplied by (4 cos\u03b8 + 4i sin\u03b8) (since z is 4e^{i\u03b8}), so actually, the first term is (75 + 117i) multiplied by 4e^{i\u03b8}, so that is 4*(75 + 117i)*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). Therefore, the real part is 4*[75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8]. Wait a second! Wait, that contradicts my previous step.\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps I made a mistake in the first step. Let me recalculate the real part of the first term properly.\n\nLet me do this again step by step:\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i) * z, where z = 4e^{i\u03b8}. So:\n\nFirst, (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8} = 4*(75 + 117i)*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8).\n\nMultiplying out:\n\nLet me denote the complex number as (a + ib)(c + id) where a =75, b=117, c =4 cos\u03b8, d=4 sin\u03b8. Wait no, actually, hold on. Wait, z is 4e^{i\u03b8} which is 4*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). So actually, when you multiply (75 + 117i) by z, you have:\n\n(75 + 117i)*(4 cos\u03b8 + 4i sin\u03b8). Wait, no, actually z is 4*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). Therefore, the entire first term is (75 + 117i)*4*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). So to compute the real part:\n\nFirst, let me write (75 + 117i)*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) first, then multiply by 4.\n\nMultiplying (75 + 117i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8):\n\nReal part: 75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part: 75 sin\u03b8 + 117 cos\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 4, the real part becomes 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, the second term is (96 +144i)/z. Since z is 4e^{i\u03b8}, then 1/z = (1/(4e^{i\u03b8})) = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8} = (1/4)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8). Therefore, (96 +144i)/z is (96 +144i)*(1/(4)) * (cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, (96 +144i)/4 = 24 + 36i. So the second term is (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8).\n\nCompute the real part of this:\n\n24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8. (Because (24)(cos\u03b8) + (36)(sin\u03b8), since the real part of (a + ib)(c - id) is a c + b d. Wait, let me verify:\n\n(24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) = 24 cos\u03b8 -24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36i\u00b2 sin\u03b8\n\n= 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8 + i(-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8). Since i\u00b2 = -1, so the last term becomes +36 sin\u03b8. Wait:\n\nWait, let's do it step by step:\n\nFirst term: 24*cos\u03b8\n\nSecond term: 24*(-i sin\u03b8) = -24i sin\u03b8\n\nThird term: 36i * cos\u03b8 = 36i cos\u03b8\n\nFourth term: 36i*(-i sin\u03b8) = -36i\u00b2 sin\u03b8 = +36 sin\u03b8 (since i\u00b2 = -1)\n\nSo combining real parts: 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8\n\nImaginary parts: (-24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8) i\n\nTherefore, the real part is indeed 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8. So that part was correct.\n\nTherefore, the total real part of the entire expression is:\n\nFirst term's real part: 4*(75 cos\u03b8 -117 sin\u03b8) = 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8\n\nSecond term's real part: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nAdding them together:\n\n(300 cos\u03b8 +24 cos\u03b8) + (-468 sin\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Okay, so that was correct. So the real part is indeed 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Therefore, the maximum value of this is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2)=540. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, is there a constraint that \u03b8 has to be such that z is a complex number? Since z is on the circle |z|=4, \u03b8 can be any angle, so the maximum of 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 is indeed the amplitude. So the maximum is 540. Therefore, the answer is 540?\n\nBut let me think again. Wait, sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, especially when you have terms like z and 1/z, there might be some additional constraints or maybe I need to check if the maximum is attainable. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that the maximum is indeed 540, then there exists some \u03b8 where 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 =540. Let me verify this.\n\nLet me suppose that 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 =540. Let me write this as:\n\nLet me denote this as A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 = C, where A=324, B=-432, C=540. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 =540.\n\nTo see if this equation has a solution, we can check if |C| <= sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Since sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2)=540, so |C|=540 equals sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), so equality occurs when the angle \u03b8 is such that the vector (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8) is in the same direction as (A,B). Wait, actually, the maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2) when \u03b8 is such that (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8) is in the direction of (A,B). Wait, but here the expression is A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8. So the maximum is achieved when the angle \u03b8 is such that cos\u03b8 = A / sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), sin\u03b8 = B / sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Wait, but in this case, A=324, B= -432.\n\nWait, let me recall that the maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), achieved when \u03b8 = arctan(B/A) or something like that? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, the phase angle \u03c6 is given by tan\u03c6 = B/A. Wait, actually, the expression can be written as R cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6), where R is the amplitude. Let me recall:\n\nA cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 = R cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6), where R = sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), and tan\u03c6 = B/A. Wait, actually, more precisely, \u03c6 is such that cos\u03c6 = A/R and sin\u03c6 = B/R. So in this case, cos\u03c6 = 324/540 and sin\u03c6 = -432/540.\n\nSimplify those fractions:\n\n324/540 = 324 \u00f7 54 = 6, 540 \u00f754=10, so 324/540 = 6/10 = 3/5. Similarly, -432/540 = -432 \u00f7 54 = -8, 540 \u00f754=10, so -8/10 = -4/5. Therefore, cos\u03c6 = 3/5, sin\u03c6 = -4/5. Therefore \u03c6 is in the fourth quadrant. So \u03c6 = arctan(-4/3). Hmm.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 is indeed 540, achieved when \u03b8 = \u03c6, so that cos\u03b8 = 3/5 and sin\u03b8 = -4/5. Therefore, such a \u03b8 exists. Therefore, the maximum real part is indeed 540. Therefore, the answer is 540. \n\nWait a second, but let me confirm once again. Let me plug \u03b8 such that cos\u03b8 = 3/5 and sin\u03b8 = -4/5 into the expression 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\nCompute:\n\n324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (972 + 1728)/5 = 2700/5 = 540. Yes, that works. So that checks out. Therefore, \u03b8 exists where the real part reaches 540. Therefore, the answer is 540. \n\nHmm, but let me think if there is any other step where I might have messed up. Let me go back through all steps again:\n\n1. Expressed z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. That's correct since |z|=4, so modulus of z is 4, modulus of 1/z is 1/4, and the argument is -\u03b8.\n\n2. Calculated (75+117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} as (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8}. Wait, hold on, hold on. Wait, 75*4 is 300, and 117*4 is 468, so that is correct. Then, when multiplying (300 +468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8), the real part is 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8. Yes, because the real part is (300)(cos\u03b8) - (468)(sin\u03b8). Correct.\n\n3. For the second term, (96 +144i)/z is (96+144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}) = (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}, so when multiplied out, real part is 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8. Correct.\n\n4. Summing the real parts gives 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Correct.\n\n5. Calculated the amplitude as sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt( (324)^2 + (432)^2 ) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540. Correct.\n\n6. Verified by plugging in \u03b8 where cos\u03b8=3/5 and sin\u03b8=-4/5, which gives exactly 540. So that's solid.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is indeed 540. Wait, but the problem says \"the largest possible real part\", so maybe I need to check if there are any other constraints? For example, in some optimization problems with complex numbers, sometimes you have to consider other terms or conditions, but here since we separated the real part and found its maximum independently, I think this should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using calculus. Let me try that as a check.\n\nLet me consider the real part function f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. To find its maximum, take derivative and set to zero.\n\nf\u2019(\u03b8) = -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8.\n\nSet to zero: -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8 =0 \u2192 324 sin\u03b8 +432 cos\u03b8 =0 \u2192 324 sin\u03b8 = -432 cos\u03b8 \u2192 tan\u03b8 = -432/324 = -4/3. So tan\u03b8 = -4/3. Therefore \u03b8 is in the second or fourth quadrant.\n\nCompute cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8:\n\nIf tan\u03b8 = -4/3, then we can think of a right triangle with opposite side -4, adjacent 3, hypotenuse 5. But depending on the quadrant.\n\nSince tan\u03b8 = -4/3, \u03b8 is in the second or fourth quadrant.\n\nIn the fourth quadrant, cos\u03b8 = 3/5, sin\u03b8 = -4/5. In the second quadrant, cos\u03b8 = -3/5, sin\u03b8=4/5.\n\nCompute f(\u03b8) at these points:\n\nFirst, fourth quadrant: cos\u03b8=3/5, sin\u03b8=-4/5.\n\nf(\u03b8) =324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5)+(1728/5)= (2700)/5=540.\n\nSecond quadrant: cos\u03b8= -3/5, sin\u03b8=4/5.\n\nf(\u03b8)= 324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5)= (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-2700)/5= -540. So that's the minimum. Therefore, the maximum is indeed 540. So that matches.\n\nTherefore, using calculus also leads to the same conclusion, so that's good.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use vectors. The expression 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 can be considered as the dot product of the vector (324, -432) with the unit vector (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8). The maximum value of the dot product is the magnitude of the vector (324, -432), which is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2)=540. So that's another way to see it. So that also confirms the answer.\n\nHmm, so all methods lead to 540. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{540}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, complex numbers and their moduli... Let me start by recalling some properties.\n\nFirst, since |z| = 4, that means z is a complex number lying on a circle with radius 4 centered at the origin. Maybe I can represent z in polar form? Like z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. That might simplify things because then 1/z would be (1/(4e^{i\u03b8})) = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. Let me try that substitution.\n\nLet me denote z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. Then plug these into the expression:\n\n(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z = (75 + 117i)(4e^{i\u03b8}) + (96 + 144i)(1/(4e^{i\u03b8})).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} = 4*(75 + 117i)e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}) = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\n4*(75 + 117i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nHmm, okay. Let me write this as:\n\n[4*(75 + 117i)]e^{i\u03b8} + [24 + 36i]e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nMaybe I can combine these terms by expressing them in terms of sine and cosine? Since e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8 and e^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the real and imaginary parts separately. Since the problem asks for the largest possible real part, I can focus on the real components of the entire expression and maximize that.\n\nLet me compute the real part of the expression step by step.\n\nFirst, let me compute the real part of each term.\n\nStarting with the first term: 4*(75 + 117i)e^{i\u03b8}\n\nLet me denote A = 4*(75 + 117i). Let me compute A:\n\nA = 4*75 + 4*117i = 300 + 468i.\n\nSo, the first term is (300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). The real part of this term is:\n\n300*cos\u03b8 - 468*sin\u03b8. (Because when you multiply (a + ib)(c + id), the real part is ac - bd.)\n\nSimilarly, the second term is (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8). The real part of this term is:\n\n24*cos\u03b8 + 36*sin\u03b8. (Again, using the same multiplication rule.)\n\nTherefore, the total real part of the entire expression is:\n\n[300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8] + [24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8] = (300 + 24)cos\u03b8 + (-468 + 36) sin\u03b8\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n300 +24 = 324\n\n-468 +36 = -432\n\nSo the real part simplifies to 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nNow, the problem is to maximize this expression: 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nHmm, this is of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, but here it's A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 where A = 324 and B = -432. Wait, actually, it's 324 cos\u03b8 + (-432) sin\u03b8. So, to find the maximum of this expression, I can use the formula for the amplitude of a sinusoidal function. The maximum value of C cos\u03b8 + D sin\u03b8 is sqrt(C\u00b2 + D\u00b2). Wait, let me recall: yes, the maximum of a*cos\u03b8 + b*sin\u03b8 is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So in this case, the maximum would be sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 324 squared: 324^2. Let me see: 300\u00b2 is 90000, 24\u00b2 is 576, and cross term 2*300*24 = 14400. So (300 +24)^2 = 300\u00b2 + 2*300*24 +24\u00b2 = 90000 +14400 +576 = 90000+14400 is 104400 +576 is 104,976. So 324\u00b2 = 104,976.\n\nThen 432 squared: 432^2. Let's compute 400\u00b2=160,000, 32\u00b2=1,024, and cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600. So (400+32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 +1,024 = 160,000 +25,600 is 185,600 +1,024 is 186,624. But since the coefficient here is -432, the square is still 432\u00b2 = 186,624.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value is sqrt(104,976 + 186,624). Let me add those two numbers:\n\n104,976 + 186,624. Let's see: 100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000; 4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600. So total is 280,000 + 11,600 = 291,600. Therefore sqrt(291,600). Hmm, sqrt(291,600). Let me see: 540 squared is 291,600 because 500\u00b2=250,000, 40\u00b2=1,600, and cross term 2*500*40=40,000, so (500+40)^2=540\u00b2=291,600. Yes, so sqrt(291,600)=540. Therefore the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me verify that formula again. The maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is indeed sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). So here, A is 324, B is -432. So sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2) which is exactly what I did. So that gives 540. So the maximum real part is 540?\n\nBut wait, let me check the steps again because sometimes I might have made an error in the coefficients.\n\nStarting from the original expression:\n\nReal part is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. So the coefficients are A=324, B= -432. So the amplitude is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2). Which is indeed sqrt( (324)^2 + (432)^2 ). Let me confirm the addition again:\n\n324\u00b2 is 104,976 and 432\u00b2 is 186,624. Adding them gives 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600, whose square root is indeed 540. So that part seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible real part is 540. Hmm, but wait a second. Is there any constraint on \u03b8? Since z is any complex number with |z|=4, \u03b8 can be any angle between 0 and 2\u03c0, so the maximum over all \u03b8 is indeed 540. Therefore, the answer is 540?\n\nBut let me think again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the real parts earlier. Let me retrace.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i)z where z=4e^{i\u03b8}. So that's (75 +117i)*4*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). So expanding this:\n\nThe real part would be 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8). Wait, hold on, that's different from what I had before. Wait, wait a second. Wait, (a + ib)(c + id) has real part ac - bd. So here, (75 + 117i) multiplied by (4 cos\u03b8 + 4i sin\u03b8) (since z is 4e^{i\u03b8}), so actually, the first term is (75 + 117i) multiplied by 4e^{i\u03b8}, so that is 4*(75 + 117i)*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). Therefore, the real part is 4*[75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8]. Wait a second! Wait, that contradicts my previous step.\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps I made a mistake in the first step. Let me recalculate the real part of the first term properly.\n\nLet me do this again step by step:\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i) * z, where z = 4e^{i\u03b8}. So:\n\nFirst, (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8} = 4*(75 + 117i)*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8).\n\nMultiplying out:\n\nLet me denote the complex number as (a + ib)(c + id) where a =75, b=117, c =4 cos\u03b8, d=4 sin\u03b8. Wait no, actually, hold on. Wait, z is 4e^{i\u03b8} which is 4*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). So actually, when you multiply (75 + 117i) by z, you have:\n\n(75 + 117i)*(4 cos\u03b8 + 4i sin\u03b8). Wait, no, actually z is 4*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). Therefore, the entire first term is (75 + 117i)*4*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). So to compute the real part:\n\nFirst, let me write (75 + 117i)*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) first, then multiply by 4.\n\nMultiplying (75 + 117i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8):\n\nReal part: 75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8.\n\nImaginary part: 75 sin\u03b8 + 117 cos\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 4, the real part becomes 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, the second term is (96 +144i)/z. Since z is 4e^{i\u03b8}, then 1/z = (1/(4e^{i\u03b8})) = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8} = (1/4)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8). Therefore, (96 +144i)/z is (96 +144i)*(1/(4)) * (cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, (96 +144i)/4 = 24 + 36i. So the second term is (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8).\n\nCompute the real part of this:\n\n24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8. (Because (24)(cos\u03b8) + (36)(sin\u03b8), since the real part of (a + ib)(c - id) is a c + b d. Wait, let me verify:\n\n(24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) = 24 cos\u03b8 -24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36i\u00b2 sin\u03b8\n\n= 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8 + i(-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8). Since i\u00b2 = -1, so the last term becomes +36 sin\u03b8. Wait:\n\nWait, let's do it step by step:\n\nFirst term: 24*cos\u03b8\n\nSecond term: 24*(-i sin\u03b8) = -24i sin\u03b8\n\nThird term: 36i * cos\u03b8 = 36i cos\u03b8\n\nFourth term: 36i*(-i sin\u03b8) = -36i\u00b2 sin\u03b8 = +36 sin\u03b8 (since i\u00b2 = -1)\n\nSo combining real parts: 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8\n\nImaginary parts: (-24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8) i\n\nTherefore, the real part is indeed 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8. So that part was correct.\n\nTherefore, the total real part of the entire expression is:\n\nFirst term's real part: 4*(75 cos\u03b8 -117 sin\u03b8) = 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8\n\nSecond term's real part: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nAdding them together:\n\n(300 cos\u03b8 +24 cos\u03b8) + (-468 sin\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Okay, so that was correct. So the real part is indeed 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Therefore, the maximum value of this is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2)=540. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, is there a constraint that \u03b8 has to be such that z is a complex number? Since z is on the circle |z|=4, \u03b8 can be any angle, so the maximum of 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 is indeed the amplitude. So the maximum is 540. Therefore, the answer is 540?\n\nBut let me think again. Wait, sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, especially when you have terms like z and 1/z, there might be some additional constraints or maybe I need to check if the maximum is attainable. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that the maximum is indeed 540, then there exists some \u03b8 where 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 =540. Let me verify this.\n\nLet me suppose that 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 =540. Let me write this as:\n\nLet me denote this as A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 = C, where A=324, B=-432, C=540. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 =540.\n\nTo see if this equation has a solution, we can check if |C| <= sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Since sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2)=540, so |C|=540 equals sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), so equality occurs when the angle \u03b8 is such that the vector (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8) is in the same direction as (A,B). Wait, actually, the maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2) when \u03b8 is such that (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8) is in the direction of (A,B). Wait, but here the expression is A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8. So the maximum is achieved when the angle \u03b8 is such that cos\u03b8 = A / sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), sin\u03b8 = B / sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Wait, but in this case, A=324, B= -432.\n\nWait, let me recall that the maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), achieved when \u03b8 = arctan(B/A) or something like that? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, the phase angle \u03c6 is given by tan\u03c6 = B/A. Wait, actually, the expression can be written as R cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6), where R is the amplitude. Let me recall:\n\nA cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 = R cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6), where R = sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), and tan\u03c6 = B/A. Wait, actually, more precisely, \u03c6 is such that cos\u03c6 = A/R and sin\u03c6 = B/R. So in this case, cos\u03c6 = 324/540 and sin\u03c6 = -432/540.\n\nSimplify those fractions:\n\n324/540 = 324 \u00f7 54 = 6, 540 \u00f754=10, so 324/540 = 6/10 = 3/5. Similarly, -432/540 = -432 \u00f7 54 = -8, 540 \u00f754=10, so -8/10 = -4/5. Therefore, cos\u03c6 = 3/5, sin\u03c6 = -4/5. Therefore \u03c6 is in the fourth quadrant. So \u03c6 = arctan(-4/3). Hmm.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 is indeed 540, achieved when \u03b8 = \u03c6, so that cos\u03b8 = 3/5 and sin\u03b8 = -4/5. Therefore, such a \u03b8 exists. Therefore, the maximum real part is indeed 540. Therefore, the answer is 540. \n\nWait a second, but let me confirm once again. Let me plug \u03b8 such that cos\u03b8 = 3/5 and sin\u03b8 = -4/5 into the expression 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\nCompute:\n\n324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (972 + 1728)/5 = 2700/5 = 540. Yes, that works. So that checks out. Therefore, \u03b8 exists where the real part reaches 540. Therefore, the answer is 540. \n\nHmm, but let me think if there is any other step where I might have messed up. Let me go back through all steps again:\n\n1. Expressed z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. That's correct since |z|=4, so modulus of z is 4, modulus of 1/z is 1/4, and the argument is -\u03b8.\n\n2. Calculated (75+117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} as (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8}. Wait, hold on, hold on. Wait, 75*4 is 300, and 117*4 is 468, so that is correct. Then, when multiplying (300 +468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8), the real part is 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8. Yes, because the real part is (300)(cos\u03b8) - (468)(sin\u03b8). Correct.\n\n3. For the second term, (96 +144i)/z is (96+144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}) = (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}, so when multiplied out, real part is 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8. Correct.\n\n4. Summing the real parts gives 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Correct.\n\n5. Calculated the amplitude as sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt( (324)^2 + (432)^2 ) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540. Correct.\n\n6. Verified by plugging in \u03b8 where cos\u03b8=3/5 and sin\u03b8=-4/5, which gives exactly 540. So that's solid.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is indeed 540. Wait, but the problem says \"the largest possible real part\", so maybe I need to check if there are any other constraints? For example, in some optimization problems with complex numbers, sometimes you have to consider other terms or conditions, but here since we separated the real part and found its maximum independently, I think this should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using calculus. Let me try that as a check.\n\nLet me consider the real part function f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. To find its maximum, take derivative and set to zero.\n\nf\u2019(\u03b8) = -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8.\n\nSet to zero: -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8 =0 \u2192 324 sin\u03b8 +432 cos\u03b8 =0 \u2192 324 sin\u03b8 = -432 cos\u03b8 \u2192 tan\u03b8 = -432/324 = -4/3. So tan\u03b8 = -4/3. Therefore \u03b8 is in the second or fourth quadrant.\n\nCompute cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8:\n\nIf tan\u03b8 = -4/3, then we can think of a right triangle with opposite side -4, adjacent 3, hypotenuse 5. But depending on the quadrant.\n\nSince tan\u03b8 = -4/3, \u03b8 is in the second or fourth quadrant.\n\nIn the fourth quadrant, cos\u03b8 = 3/5, sin\u03b8 = -4/5. In the second quadrant, cos\u03b8 = -3/5, sin\u03b8=4/5.\n\nCompute f(\u03b8) at these points:\n\nFirst, fourth quadrant: cos\u03b8=3/5, sin\u03b8=-4/5.\n\nf(\u03b8) =324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5)+(1728/5)= (2700)/5=540.\n\nSecond quadrant: cos\u03b8= -3/5, sin\u03b8=4/5.\n\nf(\u03b8)= 324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5)= (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-2700)/5= -540. So that's the minimum. Therefore, the maximum is indeed 540. So that matches.\n\nTherefore, using calculus also leads to the same conclusion, so that's good.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use vectors. The expression 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 can be considered as the dot product of the vector (324, -432) with the unit vector (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8). The maximum value of the dot product is the magnitude of the vector (324, -432), which is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2)=540. So that's another way to see it. So that also confirms the answer.\n\nHmm, so all methods lead to 540. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{540}\n\n\nTo find the largest possible real part of the expression \\((75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\) where \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), we start by representing \\(z\\) in polar form. Let \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\), so \\(\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta}\\).\n\nSubstituting these into the expression, we get:\n\\[\n(75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta} + (96 + 144i) \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term:\n1. The first term becomes \\(4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta}\\).\n2. The second term becomes \\(\\frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\\).\n\nNext, we compute the real parts of these terms:\n1. The real part of \\((300 + 468i)e^{i\\theta}\\) is \\(300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta\\).\n2. The real part of \\((24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\\) is \\(24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta\\).\n\nAdding these real parts together, we get:\n\\[\n(300\\cos\\theta - 468\\sin\\theta) + (24\\cos\\theta + 36\\sin\\theta) = 324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\n\\]\n\nTo maximize \\(324\\cos\\theta - 432\\sin\\theta\\), we use the fact that the maximum value of \\(A\\cos\\theta + B\\sin\\theta\\) is \\(\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\\). Here, \\(A = 324\\) and \\(B = -432\\), so the maximum value is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \\sqrt{324^2 + 432^2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the squares:\n- \\(324^2 = 104976\\)\n- \\(432^2 = 186624\\)\n\nAdding these gives:\n\\[\n104976 + 186624 = 291600\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{291600} = 540\n\\]\n\nThus, the largest possible real part of the given expression is \\(\\boxed{540}\\).",
