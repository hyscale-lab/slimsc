      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so we have 900 residents in Aimeville, and each owns a bag of candy hearts. So candy hearts are owned by everyone. The other items are diamond rings (195), golf clubs (367), and garden spades (562). Additionally, some people own exactly two of these things (437) and exactly three (234). We need to find how many own all four items.\n\nWait a second, since everyone owns the candy hearts, that means the candy hearts are part of every ownership combination. So when they mention owning exactly two, three, or all four items, the candy hearts are already included in those counts. Let me make sure I get that right.\n\nLet me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets. But maybe I can approach this with variables. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Let C be the set of people owning candy hearts. Since everyone owns it, |C| = 900.\n\n- Let D be diamond rings, G golf clubs, S garden spades. So |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562.\n\nWe need to find |D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C|. But since everyone is in C, this is the same as |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|. Wait, but the problem says \"own all four of these things\", which includes candy hearts. Since everyone has candy hearts, the number of people who own all four is exactly the number who own D, G, and S. So maybe that's the key here. Let me note that.\n\nThe problem states \"the number of residents who own all four of these things\" which includes the candy hearts. Since everyone owns the candy hearts, that's equivalent to the number of people who own D, G, and S. So we need to find |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe also know the number of people who own exactly two items is 437, and exactly three items is 234. Wait, but again, since everyone has the candy hearts, owning exactly two items would mean owning the candy hearts plus one other item. Similarly, exactly three would be candy hearts plus two others, and exactly four would be all four. Wait, maybe the counts of exactly two, three, four are in terms of the other three items? Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So when they say \"exactly two of these things,\" does that include the candy hearts or not? The wording is a bit ambiguous here. Let me read again:\n\n\"Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.\"\n\nHmm, so the four things are diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So when it says \"exactly two of these things\", that includes any two of the four, including or excluding candy hearts? But since everyone has candy hearts, you can't have someone who owns exactly two things without candy hearts. Wait, actually, since everyone has candy hearts, the \"exactly two\" must mean candy hearts plus one other item. Similarly, exactly three would be candy hearts plus two others, and exactly four is all four. Therefore, the counts of exactly two, three, and four are actually counts of the number of people with 1, 2, or 3 additional items beyond candy hearts.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as follows: Let's think of the candy hearts as a given, so effectively, the problem reduces to three sets (D, G, S) over the 900 people, but with the counts adjusted. However, the problem mentions \"exactly two of these things\" meaning two of the four items, which would include candy hearts. Wait, but since everyone has candy hearts, owning exactly two things would mean having candy hearts plus one other item. So the number of people who own exactly two items is the same as the number who own exactly one of D, G, S (since they must have candy hearts). Similarly, exactly three items would mean candy hearts plus two others, so exactly two of D, G, S. And exactly four items would be all three of D, G, S plus the candy hearts. \n\nTherefore, perhaps we can reframe the problem in terms of the three other items (D, G, S), considering that everyone has the candy hearts. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s think of the problem as dealing with three sets D, G, S over 900 people, where each person is in at least C (candy hearts). The counts given for exactly two items (437) would correspond to exactly one of D, G, S. The counts of exactly three items (234) would correspond to exactly two of D, G, S. The count of exactly four items would be exactly three of D, G, S. Plus, there might also be people who have none of D, G, S (but still have C). \n\nWait, that might be a good way to model it. Let me formalize this:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s define:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let a = number of people who own none of D, G, S (only C).\n\n- Let b = number owning exactly one of D, G, S (so exactly two items total, since they have C).\n\n- c = number owning exactly two of D, G, S (so exactly three items total).\n\n- d = number owning all three of D, G, S (so four items total).\n\nGiven that, the problem states that the number of people with exactly two items is 437, so that would be b = 437.\n\nThe number with exactly three items is 234, so that would be c = 234.\n\nThe number with all four is d, which is what we need to find.\n\nAlso, the total number of people is 900, so a + b + c + d = 900.\n\nWe also know the counts for each of D, G, S. Let me recall inclusion-exclusion for three sets.\n\nThe total number of people owning D is |D| = 195. This is equal to the number of people in exactly D only, plus those in D and G only, D and S only, and all three D, G, S.\n\nSimilarly for |G| and |S|. So:\n\n|D| = (number with D only) + (number with D and G only) + (number with D and S only) + (number with all three D, G, S).\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nBut in terms of our variables:\n\nThe number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S is b. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let:\n\n- x = number with exactly D only,\n\n- y = exactly G only,\n\n- z = exactly S only.\n\nThen, x + y + z = b = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number with exactly two of D, G, S is c = 234. Let me denote:\n\n- p = exactly D and G only,\n\n- q = exactly D and S only,\n\n- r = exactly G and S only.\n\nThen p + q + r = c = 234.\n\nAnd the number with all three is d.\n\nTherefore, the total people in D would be x + p + q + d.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n|D| = x + p + q + d = 195,\n\n|G| = y + p + r + d = 367,\n\n|S| = z + q + r + d = 562.\n\nWe also know that:\n\na + b + c + d = 900,\n\nand a = 900 - (b + c + d) = 900 - (437 + 234 + d) = 900 - 671 - d = 229 - d.\n\nBut I don't know if we need a for anything else.\n\nSo, let's see, we have three equations:\n\n1. x + p + q + d = 195,\n\n2. y + p + r + d = 367,\n\n3. z + q + r + d = 562,\n\nAnd we also have:\n\nx + y + z = 437,\n\np + q + r = 234.\n\nWe need to find d.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can add up the three equations for |D|, |G|, |S|.\n\nAdding equations 1,2,3:\n\n(x + y + z) + 2(p + q + r) + 3d = 195 + 367 + 562.\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n437 + 2*(234) + 3d = 195 + 367 + 562.\n\nLet me compute the left side and the right side.\n\nLeft side: 437 + 468 + 3d = 905 + 3d.\n\nRight side: 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 gives 1124? Wait, 195+367=562? Wait 195+300=495, +67=562, yes. Then 562 + 562 is 1124. Wait, no, wait, 195+367+562: Let me compute that again.\n\n195 + 367 = 562, then 562 + 562 = 1124. Wait, but 562 + 562 is indeed 1124. Hmm, so left side is 905 + 3d = 1124.\n\nSo 3d = 1124 - 905 = 219.\n\nTherefore, d = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nWait, so that would be 73? Let me check my steps again.\n\nFirst, adding equations 1,2,3:\n\nEach of x,y,z appears once in the sum (since x is in equation1, y in equation2, z in equation3). The terms p, q, r each appear twice: p is in equation1 and 2, q in 1 and 3, r in 2 and 3. Then d is in each equation, so three times.\n\nHence, indeed, (x+y+z) + 2(p+q+r) + 3d = total of |D|+|G|+|S|.\n\nThen substituting the known values:\n\nx+y+z = 437,\n\np+q+r = 234,\n\nso 437 + 2*234 + 3d = 195 + 367 + 562.\n\nCalculations:\n\nLeft side: 437 + 468 = 905; 905 + 3d.\n\nRight side: 195+367=562; 562+562=1124.\n\nSo 905 + 3d = 1124 => 3d = 219 => d=73.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who own all four items is 73. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me confirm once again.\n\nWait, but let me also check if that makes sense with the total population.\n\nIf d =73,\n\nThen the total people would be a + b + c + d = (229 - d) + 437 + 234 + d = 229 + 437 + 234 = 900, yes. So that checks out.\n\nAlso, let me check if the equations hold. Let me see, for instance:\n\nSuppose d=73,\n\nThen, equation1: x + p + q = 195 - d = 195 -73=122,\n\nequation2: y + p + r = 367 -73=294,\n\nequation3: z + q + r =562-73=489.\n\nAlso, p + q + r =234,\n\nand x + y + z=437.\n\nWe can see if these are consistent.\n\nLet me see, if we add equation1 (x+p+q=122), equation2 (y+p+r=294), and equation3 (z+q+r=489):\n\nAdding them: (x + y + z) + (p + p) + (q + q) + (r + r) + (terms?) Wait, perhaps better:\n\nWait, the equations:\n\nEquation1: x + p + q = 122,\n\nEquation2: y + p + r = 294,\n\nEquation3: z + q + r = 489,\n\nAdding all three equations:\n\n(x + y + z) + 2p + 2q + 2r = 122 + 294 + 489 = 905.\n\nBut x + y + z =437,\n\nand p + q + r=234,\n\nso LHS is 437 + 2*(234) = 437 + 468 = 905, which matches. So that's consistent. So the equations are okay.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 73? Hmm, but let me think again if there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, the problem says \"exactly two of these things\" and \"exactly three of these things\". Since all residents own the candy hearts, then \"exactly two things\" would mean they own candy hearts plus one other item. So exactly two items total, which would correspond to exactly one of the other three items. Similarly, \"exactly three things\" would be candy hearts plus two others, so exactly two of the other three. And \"all four\" is all three plus candy hearts.\n\nTherefore, our setup is correct. Therefore, the calculation seems right. So the answer is 73. Let me just confirm once again the arithmetic.\n\n195 + 367 + 562: 195+367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124? Wait, 195 + 367 = 562? Wait, 195+367:\n\n195 + 300 = 495,\n\n495 + 67 = 562. Yes, that's correct. Then 562 + 562 is indeed 1124. Then subtract 905 (437 + 468). 1124 -905 is 219, divided by 3 gives 73. Yep, all checks out. So I think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{73}\n",

Let me see, for instance:\n\nSuppose d=73,\n\nThen, equation1: x + p + q = 195 - d = 195 -73=122,\n\nequation2: y + p + r = 367 -73=294,\n\nequation3: z + q + r =562-73=489.\n\nAlso, p + q + r =234,\n\nand x + y + z=437.\n\nWe can see if these are consistent.\n\nLet me see, if we add equation1 (x+p+q=122), equation2 (y+p+r=294), and equation3 (z+q+r=489):\n\nAdding them: (x + y + z) + (p + p) + (q + q) + (r + r) + (terms?) Wait, perhaps better:\n\nWait, the equations:\n\nEquation1: x + p + q = 122,\n\nEquation2: y + p + r = 294,\n\nEquation3: z + q + r = 489,\n\nAdding all three equations:\n\n(x + y + z) + 2p + 2q + 2r = 122 + 294 + 489 = 905.\n\nBut x + y + z =437,\n\nand p + q + r=234,\n\nso LHS is 437 + 2*(234) = 437 + 468 = 905, which matches. So that's consistent. So the equations are okay.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 73? Hmm, but let me think again if there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, the problem says \"exactly two of these things\" and \"exactly three of these things\". Since all residents own the candy hearts, then \"exactly two things\" would mean they own candy hearts plus one other item. So exactly two items total, which would correspond to exactly one of the other three items. Similarly, \"exactly three things\" would be candy hearts plus two others, so exactly two of the other three. And \"all four\" is all three plus candy hearts.\n\nTherefore, our setup is correct. Therefore, the calculation seems right. So the answer is 73. Let me just confirm once again the arithmetic.\n\n195 + 367 + 562: 195+367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124? Wait, 195 + 367 = 562? Wait, 195+367:\n\n195 + 300 = 495,\n\n495 + 67 = 562. Yes, that's correct. Then 562 + 562 is indeed 1124. Then subtract 905 (437 + 468). 1124 -905 is 219, divided by 3 gives 73. Yep, all checks out. So I think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{73}\n\n\nGiven the 900 residents of Aimeville, each owns a bag of candy hearts. Additionally, 195 own a diamond ring (D), 367 own a set of golf clubs (G), and 562 own a garden spade (S). We need to find the number of residents who own all four items (D, G, S, and candy hearts).\n\nKey steps:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - \\( a \\): Residents owning only candy hearts (none of D, G, S).\n   - \\( b \\): Residents owning exactly one of D, G, S (total 2 items including candy hearts).\n   - \\( c \\): Residents owning exactly two of D, G, S (total 3 items including candy hearts).\n   - \\( d \\): Residents owning all three of D, G, S (total 4 items including candy hearts).\n\n2. **Given Values:**\n   - \\( b = 437 \\) (exactly two items: candy hearts + one other)\n   - \\( c = 234 \\) (exactly three items: candy hearts + two others)\n   - Total residents: \\( a + b + c + d = 900 \\)\n\n3. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle for D, G, S:**\n   - \\( |D| = x + p + q + d = 195 \\)\n   - \\( |G| = y + p + r + d = 367 \\)\n   - \\( |S| = z + q + r + d = 562 \\)\n   - Where \\( x, y, z \\) are those owning exactly one of D, G, S.\n   - \\( p, q, r \\) are those owning exactly two of D, G, S.\n\n4. **Summing Equations:**\n   - Adding the three set equations:\n     \\[\n     (x + y + z) + 2(p + q + r) + 3d = |D| + |G| + |S|\n     \\]\n   - Substituting known values:\n     \\[\n     437 + 2 \\times 234 + 3d = 195 + 367 + 562\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     905 + 3d = 1124 \\implies 3d = 219 \\implies d = 73\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Total residents check: \\( a + 437 + 234 + 73 = 900 \\) (valid as \\( a = 229 - 73 = 156 \\)).\n   - Equations for \\( |D|, |G|, |S| \\) are consistent with the derived values.\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is \\(\\boxed{73}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. Hmm, it's about the residents of Aimeville and the different items they own. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. \n\nFirst, let me list out what's given:\n\n- Total residents: 900\n- Diamond ring owners: 195\n- Golf clubs owners: 367\n- Garden spade owners: 562\n- Everyone owns candy hearts, so that's 900 people.\n- Number of people who own exactly two items: 437\n- Number of people who own exactly three items: 234\n\nWe need to find the number of people who own all four items. Let me denote the number of people who own all four as x.\n\nWait, since everyone owns candy hearts, that might simplify things. Because candy hearts are owned by everyone, so when considering overlaps with the other items, it's automatically included. Let me think about how to model this with set theory.\n\nThe standard inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets might be complicated here, but since everyone has candy hearts, maybe we can adjust the problem to consider the other three items along with the candy hearts. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since candy hearts are owned by everyone, the overlaps between the other items and candy hearts are just the same as the overlaps between the other items. So, perhaps we can treat the problem as if it's about three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) with the caveat that all subsets automatically include candy hearts. \n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider that the total number of people owning each item includes those who have candy hearts. Since everyone has candy hearts, the \"fourth item\" is universal. Therefore, any intersection with the candy hearts set is just the same as the intersection of the other items. Hmm, so maybe we can reframe the problem in terms of the three non-universal items?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets but take into account that the fourth set (candy hearts) is the entire population. Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets:\n\nThe total number of people owning at least one of the four items is equal to the sum of each set minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple intersections minus the four-way intersection. But since everyone owns at least the candy hearts, the total number owning at least one is exactly 900. \n\nSo, let me write that equation:\n\nTotal = (A + B + C + D) - (AB + AC + AD + BC + BD + CD) + (ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD) - ABCD = 900\n\nBut D is the set of candy hearts, which is everyone, so D = 900. Therefore, AD = A, BD = B, CD = C, and ABCD is the intersection of all four, which is what we want. Also, the pairwise intersections involving D would just be the original sets. Let me substitute D = 900 into the equation.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me denote:\n\nLet A = diamond ring owners (195)\n\nB = golf clubs (367)\n\nC = garden spade (562)\n\nD = candy hearts (900)\n\nWe need to compute the four-way intersection A\u2229B\u2229C\u2229D, which is just A\u2229B\u2229C, since D is everyone. Wait, actually, if everyone is in D, then the intersection of all four is just the intersection of A, B, and C. Wait, no, actually, A\u2229B\u2229C\u2229D is the same as A\u2229B\u2229C, because D is all of them. So, the four-way intersection is the same as the three-way intersection of A, B, C. But the problem states that 234 own exactly three of these things. Hmm, so I need to be careful here.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"exactly three of these things\" and \"exactly two of these things\". The \"these things\" include all four items. So, when someone owns exactly three items, that could be any combination of three out of the four. However, since everyone owns candy hearts, the only way to own exactly three items is to own candy hearts plus two of the other three. Similarly, owning exactly two items would mean candy hearts plus one other item, but since everyone has candy hearts, actually, wait a second.\n\nHold on, this is a critical point. Since everyone owns candy hearts, the \"exactly two of these things\" must mean exactly two items including candy hearts? Or is the candy hearts not counted in the \"exactly two\"? Wait, the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" Therefore, when they refer to owning exactly two of these things, they must be considering candy hearts as one of the items. Therefore, exactly two items would include the candy hearts plus one other. But since everyone has candy hearts, the only way to have exactly two items is to have candy hearts plus one other item, so the other item is either diamond ring, golf clubs, or garden spade. Similarly, exactly three of these things would be candy hearts plus two others, and exactly four is all four. \n\nTherefore, the problem is structured such that:\n\n- All residents have candy hearts, so the only variations are in the other three items. \n\nLet me denote variables for the different overlaps:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet a = number of people who own only candy hearts (so none of the other three items). \n\nThen, the remaining people (900 - a) own at least one of the other three items (diamond, golf, spade). \n\nBut the problem gives the total number of people who own exactly two items (including candy hearts), exactly three items (including candy hearts), and we need to find those who own all four. \n\nLet me see if I can model this using variables for the different overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to use inclusion-exclusion for the three items (diamond, golf, spade), since candy hearts are universal.\n\nWait, since all residents have candy hearts, the total number of people who own at least one of the other three items is 900 - a, where a is the number who only have candy hearts.\n\nBut the problem states that the total number owning exactly two items (including candy hearts) is 437. That would mean that for exactly two items, one of them is candy hearts and the other is one of the three. So, the number of people with exactly two items is equal to the number of people who have exactly one of the other three items plus candy hearts. Similarly, exactly three items would be exactly two of the other three plus candy hearts, and exactly four is all three plus candy hearts.\n\nTherefore, the counts for exactly two items (total 437) would be equal to the number of people who have exactly one of the other three items (diamond, golf, spade). Similarly, exactly three items (234) is the number of people with exactly two of the other three items. And exactly four items is the number of people with all three of the other items. \n\nTherefore, if we let:\n\nLet me define variables for the three items (excluding candy hearts):\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet x = number of people who own all three items (diamond, golf, spade). This is the same as the number who own all four, since everyone has candy hearts. So the answer we need is x.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s denote for the three items (A, B, C):\n\n- The number of people who own exactly one of them: let\u2019s call this E1.\n\n- The number who own exactly two of them: E2.\n\n- The number who own exactly three of them: E3 = x.\n\nThen, the total number owning at least one of the three items (A, B, C) is E1 + E2 + E3 = (number of people not in A, B, C) is a = 900 - (E1 + E2 + E3).\n\nBut according to the problem:\n\nThe number of people who own exactly two of the four items (including candy hearts) is 437. Since exactly two items must be one of the three plus candy hearts, this is exactly E1 (since E1 is exactly one of the three plus candy hearts). Therefore, E1 = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who own exactly three of the four items (including candy hearts) is 234. That would correspond to exactly two of the three items plus candy hearts, so E2 = 234. Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, let me clarify. \n\nIf someone owns exactly three items among all four, that means they have three items, which must include candy hearts and two of the other three. So that corresponds to exactly two of the non-candy items. Therefore, the number of people with exactly three items (among all four) is equal to the number of people who have exactly two of the three items (A, B, C). So that's E2 = 234.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who own exactly four items is those who have all three non-candy items plus candy hearts, which is E3 = x.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people who own at least one of the non-candy items is E1 + E2 + E3 = 437 + 234 + x.\n\nBut also, the total number of residents is 900, and those who don't own any of the non-candy items is a = 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 900 - (671 + x) = 229 - x.\n\nNow, we can also use the inclusion-exclusion principle on the three items (A, B, C) to relate their individual counts to the overlaps.\n\nThe total number of people who own at least one of A, B, C is equal to:\n\nTotal(A) + Total(B) + Total(C) - (AB + AC + BC) + (ABC) \n\nWait, no, the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nBut in our case, |A \u222a B \u222a C| is equal to E1 + E2 + E3 = 437 + 234 + x = 671 + x.\n\nWe know |A| = 195, |B| = 367, |C| = 562.\n\nSo plugging in:\n\n671 + x = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) + x\n\nWait, but the formula is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\n671 + x = (195 + 367 + 562) - (|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) + x\n\nWait, so the |A\u2229B\u2229C| is x, so that term is +x. \n\nTherefore, moving terms around:\n\n671 + x = (195 + 367 + 562) - (sum of pairwise intersections) + x\n\nSubtract x from both sides:\n\n671 = (195 + 367 + 562) - (sum of pairwise intersections)\n\nSo, compute 195 + 367 + 562 first:\n\n195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124. Wait, 195 + 367 is actually 195+367: 195+300=495, +67=562. Then 562 + 562 = 1124. So total is 1124.\n\nTherefore:\n\n671 = 1124 - (sum of pairwise intersections)\n\nThus, sum of pairwise intersections = 1124 - 671 = 453.\n\nSo, |A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C| = 453.\n\nNow, we need to relate this to E2 and E3. \n\nLet me recall that in three sets, the number of people in exactly two sets is equal to:\n\n(|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) - 3|A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nThe total number of people in exactly two sets is:\n\n(|A\u2229B| - 3x) + (|A\u2229C| - 3x) + (|B\u2229C| - 3x) ?\n\nWait, maybe better to recall that the count of exactly two is:\n\nFor each pair, the intersection minus three times the triple intersection. Wait, more precisely:\n\nThe number of people in exactly two of A, B, C is:\n\n(|A\u2229B| - |A\u2229B\u2229C|) + (|A\u2229C| - |A\u2229B\u2229C|) + (|B\u2229C| - |A\u2229B\u2229C|) \n\n= (|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) - 3|A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nWe know this is equal to E2, which is 234.\n\nSo,\n\n(|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) - 3x = 234\n\nWe already found that |A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C| = 453, so:\n\n453 - 3x = 234\n\nSolving for x:\n\n453 - 234 = 3x\n\n219 = 3x\n\nx = 73\n\nWait, so x is 73? Let me check that again.\n\n453 - 3x = 234 \u2192 3x = 453 - 234 = 219 \u2192 x = 73. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who own all three of A, B, C (and thus all four items since D is everyone) is 73. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me go through again.\n\nFirst step: Total residents 900, all have D (candy hearts). The problem gives exactly two items: 437, exactly three items: 234. We need all four.\n\nWe considered that exactly two items must mean exactly one of A, B, C plus D. So the count of exactly two is E1 (exactly one of A,B,C). Similarly, exactly three items is E2 (exactly two of A,B,C), and exactly four is E3 (all three of A,B,C). \n\nThen, the total number of people who have at least one of A,B,C is E1 + E2 + E3 = 437 + 234 + x.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion gives |A \u222a B \u222a C| = 671 + x = sum of individual sets minus pairwise intersections plus triple intersections.\n\nWait, actually, let me check the inclusion-exclusion formula again:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nSo substituting:\n\n671 + x = 195 + 367 + 562 - (sum of pairwise intersections) + x\n\nWait, here |A \u222a B \u222a C| is 671 + x, and |A\u2229B\u2229C| is x. So the equation becomes:\n\n671 + x = (195 + 367 + 562) - (sum pairwise) + x\n\nSubtract x from both sides:\n\n671 = 1124 - (sum pairwise intersections)\n\nHence sum pairwise intersections = 1124 - 671 = 453. Correct.\n\nThen, the number of people in exactly two of the three sets is (sum pairwise) - 3x = 453 - 3x = 234, so 3x = 453 - 234 = 219 \u2192 x = 73. \n\nSo that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 73. \n\nBut let me check if there's any other constraints. For instance, the number of people who own exactly one of A,B,C is E1 = 437, which is the same as exactly two items (since they have D plus that one). \n\nAlso, the total number of people with at least one of A,B,C is 437 + 234 + 73 = 744. Therefore, the number of people with none of A,B,C is 900 - 744 = 156. That would be the people who only have D (candy hearts). \n\nNow, let's check if the inclusion-exclusion numbers make sense. Let me see:\n\nTotal in A is 195. Let me think of how the counts break down for set A.\n\nThe people in A can be in:\n\n- Only A (so exactly one of A,B,C): part of E1 (437)\n\n- A and exactly one other (so part of E2)\n\n- A and all three (part of E3)\n\nSimilarly for B and C.\n\nBut perhaps another way to check is to compute the individual set counts.\n\nThe total number in A is the number of people who have A and only A, plus those who have A and one other, plus those who have A and two others (including E3). \n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor set A:\n\nNumber of people in only A: let's call this a1.\n\nNumber in A and exactly one other: a2 (so they are in exactly two items, so part of E2?)\n\nWait, actually, the total in A is:\n\na1 (only A) + a2 (A and one other) + a3 (A and two others, which is E3).\n\nSimilarly, the total |A| = a1 + (a2) + a3.\n\nBut:\n\nThe number of people in exactly one of A,B,C (E1) is a1 + b1 + c1, where b1 is only B, c1 only C.\n\nThe number in exactly two (E2) is (a2 + b2 + c2), where a2 is A and B only, etc., but actually, the exactly two would be (A&B only, A&C only, B&C only). Each of these is part of the pairwise intersections minus the triple.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Alternatively, since we have the formula already and the answer comes out consistent, maybe it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if the total number in A is 195.\n\nTotal in A = (number in only A) + (number in A and B only) + (number in A and C only) + (number in A and B and C). \n\nSimilarly, the number in only A is part of E1 (exactly one of A,B,C). Let me denote:\n\nE1 = a1 + b1 + c1 = 437\n\nE2 = (AB only + AC only + BC only) = 234\n\nE3 = ABC = x =73\n\nThen, the total in set A is:\n\na1 + (AB only + AC only) + ABC \n\nSimilarly:\n\n|A| = a1 + (AB only + AC only) + ABC \n\nSimilarly, AB only is part of the E2 count. Let me see:\n\nAB only = (number in A and B but not C) = (A\u2229B - ABC)\n\nSimilarly, AC only = A\u2229C - ABC, BC only = B\u2229C - ABC\n\nThus, the pairwise intersections:\n\n|A\u2229B| = AB only + ABC = (AB only) + x\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nTherefore, the total in A is:\n\na1 + (AB only + AC only) + x \n\nBut a1 is the only A, which is part of E1. \n\nAlso, AB only + AC only is part of the E2 terms. Specifically, AB only and AC only are two parts of the E2 total. \n\nBut let's see:\n\nThe total for |A| can be written as:\n\na1 + (AB only + AC only) + x \n\nSimilarly, the total |A| is equal to (only A) + (A and B only) + (A and C only) + (A and B and C).\n\nThus, |A| = (a1) + (AB only) + (AC only) + x \n\nSo, let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let:\n\nAB only = m,\n\nAC only = n,\n\nBC only = p,\n\nThen, E2 = m + n + p = 234,\n\nand the pairwise intersections:\n\n|A\u2229B| = m + x,\n\n|A\u2229C| = n + x,\n\n|B\u2229C| = p + x,\n\nTherefore, sum of pairwise intersections = (m + x) + (n + x) + (p + x) = (m + n + p) + 3x = 234 + 3x\n\nWait, but earlier we had that the sum of pairwise intersections is 453, so:\n\n234 + 3x = 453 \u2192 3x = 453 - 234 = 219 \u2192 x = 73, which is exactly the same result as before. So that checks out. \n\nTherefore, this seems consistent. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 73. \n\nWait, but let me just verify the total in set A.\n\nSuppose x =73,\n\nThen, sum pairwise intersections = 453,\n\nand m + n + p = 234,\n\nso (m + n + p) + 3x = 234 + 219 = 453.

      "full_content": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. Hmm, it's about the residents of Aimeville and the different items they own. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. \n\nFirst, let me list out what's given:\n\n- Total residents: 900\n- Diamond ring owners: 195\n- Golf clubs owners: 367\n- Garden spade owners: 562\n- Everyone owns candy hearts, so that's 900 people.\n- Number of people who own exactly two items: 437\n- Number of people who own exactly three items: 234\n\nWe need to find the number of people who own all four items. Let me denote the number of people who own all four as x.\n\nWait, since everyone owns candy hearts, that might simplify things. Because candy hearts are owned by everyone, so when considering overlaps with the other items, it's automatically included. Let me think about how to model this with set theory.\n\nThe standard inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets might be complicated here, but since everyone has candy hearts, maybe we can adjust the problem to consider the other three items along with the candy hearts. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since candy hearts are owned by everyone, the overlaps between the other items and candy hearts are just the same as the overlaps between the other items. So, perhaps we can treat the problem as if it's about three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) with the caveat that all subsets automatically include candy hearts. \n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider that the total number of people owning each item includes those who have candy hearts. Since everyone has candy hearts, the \"fourth item\" is universal. Therefore, any intersection with the candy hearts set is just the same as the intersection of the other items. Hmm, so maybe we can reframe the problem in terms of the three non-universal items?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets but take into account that the fourth set (candy hearts) is the entire population. Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets:\n\nThe total number of people owning at least one of the four items is equal to the sum of each set minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple intersections minus the four-way intersection. But since everyone owns at least the candy hearts, the total number owning at least one is exactly 900. \n\nSo, let me write that equation:\n\nTotal = (A + B + C + D) - (AB + AC + AD + BC + BD + CD) + (ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD) - ABCD = 900\n\nBut D is the set of candy hearts, which is everyone, so D = 900. Therefore, AD = A, BD = B, CD = C, and ABCD is the intersection of all four, which is what we want. Also, the pairwise intersections involving D would just be the original sets. Let me substitute D = 900 into the equation.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me denote:\n\nLet A = diamond ring owners (195)\n\nB = golf clubs (367)\n\nC = garden spade (562)\n\nD = candy hearts (900)\n\nWe need to compute the four-way intersection A\u2229B\u2229C\u2229D, which is just A\u2229B\u2229C, since D is everyone. Wait, actually, if everyone is in D, then the intersection of all four is just the intersection of A, B, and C. Wait, no, actually, A\u2229B\u2229C\u2229D is the same as A\u2229B\u2229C, because D is all of them. So, the four-way intersection is the same as the three-way intersection of A, B, C. But the problem states that 234 own exactly three of these things. Hmm, so I need to be careful here.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"exactly three of these things\" and \"exactly two of these things\". The \"these things\" include all four items. So, when someone owns exactly three items, that could be any combination of three out of the four. However, since everyone owns candy hearts, the only way to own exactly three items is to own candy hearts plus two of the other three. Similarly, owning exactly two items would mean candy hearts plus one other item, but since everyone has candy hearts, actually, wait a second.\n\nHold on, this is a critical point. Since everyone owns candy hearts, the \"exactly two of these things\" must mean exactly two items including candy hearts? Or is the candy hearts not counted in the \"exactly two\"? Wait, the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" Therefore, when they refer to owning exactly two of these things, they must be considering candy hearts as one of the items. Therefore, exactly two items would include the candy hearts plus one other. But since everyone has candy hearts, the only way to have exactly two items is to have candy hearts plus one other item, so the other item is either diamond ring, golf clubs, or garden spade. Similarly, exactly three of these things would be candy hearts plus two others, and exactly four is all four. \n\nTherefore, the problem is structured such that:\n\n- All residents have candy hearts, so the only variations are in the other three items. \n\nLet me denote variables for the different overlaps:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet a = number of people who own only candy hearts (so none of the other three items). \n\nThen, the remaining people (900 - a) own at least one of the other three items (diamond, golf, spade). \n\nBut the problem gives the total number of people who own exactly two items (including candy hearts), exactly three items (including candy hearts), and we need to find those who own all four. \n\nLet me see if I can model this using variables for the different overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to use inclusion-exclusion for the three items (diamond, golf, spade), since candy hearts are universal.\n\nWait, since all residents have candy hearts, the total number of people who own at least one of the other three items is 900 - a, where a is the number who only have candy hearts.\n\nBut the problem states that the total number owning exactly two items (including candy hearts) is 437. That would mean that for exactly two items, one of them is candy hearts and the other is one of the three. So, the number of people with exactly two items is equal to the number of people who have exactly one of the other three items plus candy hearts. Similarly, exactly three items would be exactly two of the other three plus candy hearts, and exactly four is all three plus candy hearts.\n\nTherefore, the counts for exactly two items (total 437) would be equal to the number of people who have exactly one of the other three items (diamond, golf, spade). Similarly, exactly three items (234) is the number of people with exactly two of the other three items. And exactly four items is the number of people with all three of the other items. \n\nTherefore, if we let:\n\nLet me define variables for the three items (excluding candy hearts):\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet x = number of people who own all three items (diamond, golf, spade). This is the same as the number who own all four, since everyone has candy hearts. So the answer we need is x.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s denote for the three items (A, B, C):\n\n- The number of people who own exactly one of them: let\u2019s call this E1.\n\n- The number who own exactly two of them: E2.\n\n- The number who own exactly three of them: E3 = x.\n\nThen, the total number owning at least one of the three items (A, B, C) is E1 + E2 + E3 = (number of people not in A, B, C) is a = 900 - (E1 + E2 + E3).\n\nBut according to the problem:\n\nThe number of people who own exactly two of the four items (including candy hearts) is 437. Since exactly two items must be one of the three plus candy hearts, this is exactly E1 (since E1 is exactly one of the three plus candy hearts). Therefore, E1 = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who own exactly three of the four items (including candy hearts) is 234. That would correspond to exactly two of the three items plus candy hearts, so E2 = 234. Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, let me clarify. \n\nIf someone owns exactly three items among all four, that means they have three items, which must include candy hearts and two of the other three. So that corresponds to exactly two of the non-candy items. Therefore, the number of people with exactly three items (among all four) is equal to the number of people who have exactly two of the three items (A, B, C). So that's E2 = 234.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who own exactly four items is those who have all three non-candy items plus candy hearts, which is E3 = x.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people who own at least one of the non-candy items is E1 + E2 + E3 = 437 + 234 + x.\n\nBut also, the total number of residents is 900, and those who don't own any of the non-candy items is a = 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 900 - (671 + x) = 229 - x.\n\nNow, we can also use the inclusion-exclusion principle on the three items (A, B, C) to relate their individual counts to the overlaps.\n\nThe total number of people who own at least one of A, B, C is equal to:\n\nTotal(A) + Total(B) + Total(C) - (AB + AC + BC) + (ABC) \n\nWait, no, the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nBut in our case, |A \u222a B \u222a C| is equal to E1 + E2 + E3 = 437 + 234 + x = 671 + x.\n\nWe know |A| = 195, |B| = 367, |C| = 562.\n\nSo plugging in:\n\n671 + x = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) + x\n\nWait, but the formula is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\n671 + x = (195 + 367 + 562) - (|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) + x\n\nWait, so the |A\u2229B\u2229C| is x, so that term is +x. \n\nTherefore, moving terms around:\n\n671 + x = (195 + 367 + 562) - (sum of pairwise intersections) + x\n\nSubtract x from both sides:\n\n671 = (195 + 367 + 562) - (sum of pairwise intersections)\n\nSo, compute 195 + 367 + 562 first:\n\n195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124. Wait, 195 + 367 is actually 195+367: 195+300=495, +67=562. Then 562 + 562 = 1124. So total is 1124.\n\nTherefore:\n\n671 = 1124 - (sum of pairwise intersections)\n\nThus, sum of pairwise intersections = 1124 - 671 = 453.\n\nSo, |A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C| = 453.\n\nNow, we need to relate this to E2 and E3. \n\nLet me recall that in three sets, the number of people in exactly two sets is equal to:\n\n(|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) - 3|A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nThe total number of people in exactly two sets is:\n\n(|A\u2229B| - 3x) + (|A\u2229C| - 3x) + (|B\u2229C| - 3x) ?\n\nWait, maybe better to recall that the count of exactly two is:\n\nFor each pair, the intersection minus three times the triple intersection. Wait, more precisely:\n\nThe number of people in exactly two of A, B, C is:\n\n(|A\u2229B| - |A\u2229B\u2229C|) + (|A\u2229C| - |A\u2229B\u2229C|) + (|B\u2229C| - |A\u2229B\u2229C|) \n\n= (|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) - 3|A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nWe know this is equal to E2, which is 234.\n\nSo,\n\n(|A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C|) - 3x = 234\n\nWe already found that |A\u2229B| + |A\u2229C| + |B\u2229C| = 453, so:\n\n453 - 3x = 234\n\nSolving for x:\n\n453 - 234 = 3x\n\n219 = 3x\n\nx = 73\n\nWait, so x is 73? Let me check that again.\n\n453 - 3x = 234 \u2192 3x = 453 - 234 = 219 \u2192 x = 73. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who own all three of A, B, C (and thus all four items since D is everyone) is 73. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me go through again.\n\nFirst step: Total residents 900, all have D (candy hearts). The problem gives exactly two items: 437, exactly three items: 234. We need all four.\n\nWe considered that exactly two items must mean exactly one of A, B, C plus D. So the count of exactly two is E1 (exactly one of A,B,C). Similarly, exactly three items is E2 (exactly two of A,B,C), and exactly four is E3 (all three of A,B,C). \n\nThen, the total number of people who have at least one of A,B,C is E1 + E2 + E3 = 437 + 234 + x.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion gives |A \u222a B \u222a C| = 671 + x = sum of individual sets minus pairwise intersections plus triple intersections.\n\nWait, actually, let me check the inclusion-exclusion formula again:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nSo substituting:\n\n671 + x = 195 + 367 + 562 - (sum of pairwise intersections) + x\n\nWait, here |A \u222a B \u222a C| is 671 + x, and |A\u2229B\u2229C| is x. So the equation becomes:\n\n671 + x = (195 + 367 + 562) - (sum pairwise) + x\n\nSubtract x from both sides:\n\n671 = 1124 - (sum pairwise intersections)\n\nHence sum pairwise intersections = 1124 - 671 = 453. Correct.\n\nThen, the number of people in exactly two of the three sets is (sum pairwise) - 3x = 453 - 3x = 234, so 3x = 453 - 234 = 219 \u2192 x = 73. \n\nSo that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 73. \n\nBut let me check if there's any other constraints. For instance, the number of people who own exactly one of A,B,C is E1 = 437, which is the same as exactly two items (since they have D plus that one). \n\nAlso, the total number of people with at least one of A,B,C is 437 + 234 + 73 = 744. Therefore, the number of people with none of A,B,C is 900 - 744 = 156. That would be the people who only have D (candy hearts). \n\nNow, let's check if the inclusion-exclusion numbers make sense. Let me see:\n\nTotal in A is 195. Let me think of how the counts break down for set A.\n\nThe people in A can be in:\n\n- Only A (so exactly one of A,B,C): part of E1 (437)\n\n- A and exactly one other (so part of E2)\n\n- A and all three (part of E3)\n\nSimilarly for B and C.\n\nBut perhaps another way to check is to compute the individual set counts.\n\nThe total number in A is the number of people who have A and only A, plus those who have A and one other, plus those who have A and two others (including E3). \n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor set A:\n\nNumber of people in only A: let's call this a1.\n\nNumber in A and exactly one other: a2 (so they are in exactly two items, so part of E2?)\n\nWait, actually, the total in A is:\n\na1 (only A) + a2 (A and one other) + a3 (A and two others, which is E3).\n\nSimilarly, the total |A| = a1 + (a2) + a3.\n\nBut:\n\nThe number of people in exactly one of A,B,C (E1) is a1 + b1 + c1, where b1 is only B, c1 only C.\n\nThe number in exactly two (E2) is (a2 + b2 + c2), where a2 is A and B only, etc., but actually, the exactly two would be (A&B only, A&C only, B&C only). Each of these is part of the pairwise intersections minus the triple.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Alternatively, since we have the formula already and the answer comes out consistent, maybe it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if the total number in A is 195.\n\nTotal in A = (number in only A) + (number in A and B only) + (number in A and C only) + (number in A and B and C). \n\nSimilarly, the number in only A is part of E1 (exactly one of A,B,C). Let me denote:\n\nE1 = a1 + b1 + c1 = 437\n\nE2 = (AB only + AC only + BC only) = 234\n\nE3 = ABC = x =73\n\nThen, the total in set A is:\n\na1 + (AB only + AC only) + ABC \n\nSimilarly:\n\n|A| = a1 + (AB only + AC only) + ABC \n\nSimilarly, AB only is part of the E2 count. Let me see:\n\nAB only = (number in A and B but not C) = (A\u2229B - ABC)\n\nSimilarly, AC only = A\u2229C - ABC, BC only = B\u2229C - ABC\n\nThus, the pairwise intersections:\n\n|A\u2229B| = AB only + ABC = (AB only) + x\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nTherefore, the total in A is:\n\na1 + (AB only + AC only) + x \n\nBut a1 is the only A, which is part of E1. \n\nAlso, AB only + AC only is part of the E2 terms. Specifically, AB only and AC only are two parts of the E2 total. \n\nBut let's see:\n\nThe total for |A| can be written as:\n\na1 + (AB only + AC only) + x \n\nSimilarly, the total |A| is equal to (only A) + (A and B only) + (A and C only) + (A and B and C).\n\nThus, |A| = (a1) + (AB only) + (AC only) + x \n\nSo, let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let:\n\nAB only = m,\n\nAC only = n,\n\nBC only = p,\n\nThen, E2 = m + n + p = 234,\n\nand the pairwise intersections:\n\n|A\u2229B| = m + x,\n\n|A\u2229C| = n + x,\n\n|B\u2229C| = p + x,\n\nTherefore, sum of pairwise intersections = (m + x) + (n + x) + (p + x) = (m + n + p) + 3x = 234 + 3x\n\nWait, but earlier we had that the sum of pairwise intersections is 453, so:\n\n234 + 3x = 453 \u2192 3x = 453 - 234 = 219 \u2192 x = 73, which is exactly the same result as before. So that checks out. \n\nTherefore, this seems consistent. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 73. \n\nWait, but let me just verify the total in set A.\n\nSuppose x =73,\n\nThen, sum pairwise intersections = 453,\n\nand m + n + p = 234,\n\nso (m + n + p) + 3x = 234 + 219 = 453. Correct.\n\nNow, let's compute |A| = a1 + m + n + x \n\nBut a1 is part of E1 = 437 = a1 + b1 + c1,\n\nSimilarly, the total for |A| is a1 + m + n + x = ?\n\nBut perhaps we can check with the given numbers:\n\nTotal |A| = 195,\n\nSo,\n\na1 + m + n + x = 195,\n\nBut m + n = (m + n + p) - p = 234 - p,\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too tangled. Alternatively, perhaps proceed with another check.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the total for |A| + |B| + |C|:\n\nWhich is 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124,\n\nAnd the pairwise intersections sum to 453,\n\nSo according to inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = 1124 - 453 + x = 1124 - 453 is 671, so 671 + x,\n\nWhich is exactly the same as E1 + E2 + E3 = 437 + 234 + x = 671 + x,\n\nSo that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, all the equations check out. Therefore, x =73 is correct.\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{73}\n\n\nGiven the problem of finding the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items (diamond ring, set of golf clubs, garden spade, and bag of candy hearts), we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given data to solve it step by step.\n\n1. **Total residents**: 900\n2. **Residents owning each item**:\n   - Diamond ring (A): 195\n   - Golf clubs (B): 367\n   - Garden spade (C): 562\n   - Candy hearts (D): 900 (everyone owns this)\n3. **Residents owning exactly two items**: 437\n4. **Residents owning exactly three items**: 234\n\nSince everyone owns candy hearts, the problem reduces to considering the overlaps of the other three items (A, B, C). Let \\( x \\) be the number of residents who own all three items (A, B, C), which is the same as the number owning all four items since everyone has candy hearts.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Define variables**:\n   - \\( E1 \\): Number of residents owning exactly one of A, B, C (corresponds to exactly two items including D) = 437\n   - \\( E2 \\): Number of residents owning exactly two of A, B, C (corresponds to exactly three items including D) = 234\n   - \\( E3 \\): Number of residents owning all three of A, B, C (corresponds to all four items) = \\( x \\)\n\n2. **Total residents owning at least one of A, B, C**:\n   \\[\n   E1 + E2 + E3 = 437 + 234 + x = 671 + x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle** for three sets (A, B, C):\n   \\[\n   |A \\cup B \\cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \\cap B| - |A \\cap C| - |B \\cap C| + |A \\cap B \\cap C|\n   \\]\n   Substituting known values:\n   \\[\n   671 + x = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|A \\cap B| + |A \\cap C| + |B \\cap C|) + x\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   671 = 1124 - (|A \\cap B| + |A \\cap C| + |B \\cap C|)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   |A \\cap B| + |A \\cap C| + |B \\cap C| = 1124 - 671 = 453\n   \\]\n\n4. **Relate pairwise intersections to \\( E2 \\)**:\n   The number of residents owning exactly two of A, B, C is:\n   \\[\n   (|A \\cap B| + |A \\cap C| + |B \\cap C| - 3x) = 234\n   \\]\n   Substituting the sum of pairwise intersections:\n   \\[\n   453 - 3x = 234\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   3x = 453 - 234 = 219\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{219}{3} = 73\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is \\(\\boxed{73}\\).",
