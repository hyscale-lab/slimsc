      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this system of logarithmic equations with three variables x, y, and z. The problem gives me three equations involving log base 2 of ratios of these variables, and I need to find the absolute value of another logarithm expression involving x, y, z. Then, express that as a reduced fraction m/n and find m + n. Alright, let's start by writing down the equations again to make sure I have them right:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nHmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but maybe if I convert them into exponential form, it might be easier to handle. Since all the logs are base 2, converting them would give me equations in terms of x, y, z. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\nlog\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2 implies that 2^(1/2) = x/(y z). So, x/(y z) = \u221a2. Let me note that as equation (a):\n\n(a) x = (\u221a2) * y z\n\nSecond equation:\n\nlog\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3 implies 2^(1/3) = y/(x z). So, y = 2^(1/3) * x z. Let's call this equation (b):\n\n(b) y = 2^(1/3) * x z\n\nThird equation:\n\nlog\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4 implies 2^(1/4) = z/(x y). So, z = 2^(1/4) * x y. Let me write that as equation (c):\n\n(c) z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nHmm, so now I have three equations with x, y, z in terms of each other. This seems like a system of equations that can be solved by substitution. Since each variable is expressed in terms of the others, maybe I can substitute them into each other.\n\nLet me see. Let's try to express all variables in terms of one variable. Let's pick x as the base variable. Wait, but each equation has x multiplied or divided by others. Alternatively, maybe I can express y and z in terms of x, then substitute back.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express all variables in terms of each other and then find a relationship.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can take the three equations and multiply them together in some way? Let me think. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, since all equations are in terms of logarithms, maybe adding or manipulating the equations could help. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since we have three equations with three variables, maybe substituting step by step would work.\n\nLet me try substituting equation (c) into equation (b). Let's see.\n\nFirst, equation (c): z = 2^(1/4) * x y. Let me substitute this into equation (b):\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * x z = 2^(1/3) * x * [2^(1/4) x y] = 2^(1/3 + 1/4) * x^2 y\n\nWait, so that would be:\n\ny = 2^(1/3 + 1/4) * x\u00b2 y\n\nHmm, let's compute 1/3 + 1/4. The common denominator is 12, so 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12. So, 2^(7/12).\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\ny = 2^(7/12) * x\u00b2 y\n\nHmm, if I divide both sides by y (since y is a positive real number, so y \u2260 0), then:\n\n1 = 2^(7/12) * x\u00b2\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 1 / 2^(7/12) = 2^(-7/12)\n\nTherefore, x = 2^(-7/24). Wait, because square root of 2^(-7/12) is 2^(-7/24). Since x is positive, we take the positive root.\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24). Let me note that as equation (d).\n\nOkay, so x is expressed in terms of 2 to some exponent. Now, maybe I can find y and z in terms of 2 as well.\n\nLet's proceed. Let's see if we can find y. Let me use equation (c) again. Wait, equation (c) is z = 2^(1/4)*x y. But perhaps I need another equation. Let me try substituting into equation (a).\n\nEquation (a) is x = \u221a2 * y z. Since I have x in terms of 2^(-7/24), and z can be expressed via equation (c) in terms of x and y, so substituting z into equation (a):\n\nx = \u221a2 * y * [2^(1/4) x y] = \u221a2 * 2^(1/4) * x y\u00b2\n\nLet me compute \u221a2 * 2^(1/4). Since \u221a2 is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/4) = 2^(3/4). So,\n\nx = 2^(3/4) * x y\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by x (since x \u2260 0):\n\n1 = 2^(3/4) * y\u00b2\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 1 / 2^(3/4) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTherefore, y = 2^(-3/8). Since y is positive, so that's the value. Let's note that as equation (e).\n\nNow, with y known, let's find z. Let's use equation (c):\n\nz = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nWe have x = 2^(-7/24) and y = 2^(-3/8). Let's substitute these:\n\nz = 2^(1/4) * [2^(-7/24)] * [2^(-3/8)]\n\nMultiplying the exponents, since 2^a * 2^b = 2^(a + b). Let's compute the exponents:\n\nFirst term: 1/4, second term: -7/24, third term: -3/8.\n\nSo, total exponent is 1/4 - 7/24 - 3/8.\n\nLet me convert all to 24 denominators:\n\n1/4 = 6/24,\n\n-7/24 remains,\n\n-3/8 = -9/24.\n\nAdding together: 6/24 -7/24 -9/24 = (6 -7 -9)/24 = (-10)/24 = -5/12.\n\nTherefore, z = 2^(-5/12). Let me note that as equation (f).\n\nSo now, we have expressions for x, y, z in terms of exponents of 2:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24),\n\ny = 2^(-3/8),\n\nz = 2^(-5/12).\n\nNow, the problem asks for | log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) |. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the expression inside the log: x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2. Since all variables are powers of 2, their product will also be a power of 2, so taking log base 2 will just be the exponent.\n\nLet me compute the exponents:\n\nx\u2074: [2^(-7/24)]\u2074 = 2^(-7/24 *4) = 2^(-7/6)\n\ny\u00b3: [2^(-3/8)]\u00b3 = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz\u00b2: [2^(-5/12)]\u00b2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiply them all together:\n\n2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)\n\nNow, let's compute the exponent:\n\nFirst, combine the terms with denominator 6:\n\n-7/6 -5/6 = -12/6 = -2\n\nThen subtract 9/8:\n\nTotal exponent: -2 - 9/8 = - (16/8 + 9/8) = -25/8\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, actually:\n\nWait, exponent is:\n\n(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nFirst, combine -7/6 and -5/6:\n\n-7/6 -5/6 = (-12)/6 = -2\n\nThen, adding -9/8:\n\n-2 + (-9/8) = - (2 + 9/8) = - (16/8 + 9/8) = -25/8. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the exponent is -25/8. Therefore, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8). Therefore, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) is log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nBut the problem asks for the absolute value of that, so | -25/8 | = 25/8. Therefore, the value is 25/8, so m =25, n=8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, m +n = 33.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all steps to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Because fractions can be tricky.\n\nStarting with the exponents for x\u2074, y\u00b3, z\u00b2:\n\nx is 2^(-7/24). So x\u2074 is exponent 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6. Correct.\n\ny is 2^(-3/8). So y\u00b3 is 3*(-3/8) = -9/8. Correct.\n\nz is 2^(-5/12). z squared is 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6. Correct.\n\nAdding exponents: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nLet me compute all in 24 denominators to see:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24,\n\n-9/8 = -27/24,\n\n-5/6 = -20/24,\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8. Yes, same as before. Because 75 divided by 3 is 25, 24 divided by 3 is 8. So that's correct.\n\nSo exponent is indeed -25/8, log is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. So m is 25, n is 8, which are coprime since 25 is 5\u00b2 and 8 is 2\u00b3, no common factors. Therefore, m +n is 33. So the answer is 33.\n\nBut let me just check if there was any step where I might have messed up the exponents. Let me go back through substitution steps again.\n\nStarting with equations (a), (b), (c). Then substituting equation (c) into (b):\n\nOriginal equations:\n\n(a) x = sqrt(2) * y z,\n\n(b) y = 2^(1/3) * x z,\n\n(c) z = 2^(1/4) * x y.\n\nSubstituting (c) into (b):\n\ny = 2^(1/3)*x*(2^(1/4)*x y) = 2^(1/3 +1/4) *x\u00b2 y.\n\n1/3 +1/4 is 7/12, so 2^(7/12). So equation becomes y = 2^(7/12)x\u00b2 y, divide both sides by y: 1=2^(7/12)x\u00b2. So x\u00b2 = 2^(-7/12), so x = 2^(-7/24). That seems correct.\n\nThen, equation (a): x = sqrt(2) * y z. Let me see if with x and z in terms of y, can we get another equation?\n\nAlternatively, proceeding to equation (a):\n\nWe can use equation (c) to express z in terms of x and y, so z = 2^(1/4) x y. Then plug that into equation (a):\n\nx = sqrt(2) * y * z = sqrt(2)*y*(2^(1/4)x y) = sqrt(2)*2^(1/4)*x y\u00b2.\n\nsqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/2 +1/4) is 2^(3/4). So x = 2^(3/4)*x y\u00b2. Then cancelling x gives 1 = 2^(3/4) y\u00b2 => y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4), so y = 2^(-3/8). That seems correct.\n\nThen z via equation (c):\n\nz =2^(1/4)*x y = 2^(1/4) * [2^(-7/24)] * [2^(-3/8)].\n\nAdding exponents:\n\n1/4 -7/24 -3/8.\n\nConvert to 24ths:\n\n1/4 =6/24,\n\n-7/24 = -7/24,\n\n-3/8 = -9/24,\n\nTotal:6 -7 -9 = -10 over 24, so exponent is -10/24 = -5/12. So z =2^(-5/12). Correct.\n\nThus, all exponents are correctly calculated, so the final exponent for the product x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2 is indeed -25/8, so absolute value is 25/8. So m +n is 33. Hmm, seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, another approach might be to set variables as exponents. Let me see if that approach would work too, just to confirm.\n\nLet me let log\u2082x = a, log\u2082y = b, log\u2082z = c. Then, since log\u2082(x/(y z)) = 1/2,\n\nlog\u2082x - log\u2082(y z) = 1/2,\n\nWhich is log\u2082x - (log\u2082y + log\u2082z) = 1/2,\n\nSo a - (b + c) = 1/2. Similarly for the other equations.\n\nSecond equation: log\u2082(y/(x z)) = 1/3,\n\nlog\u2082y - (log\u2082x + log\u2082z) = 1/3,\n\nSo b - (a + c) =1/3.\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z/(x y)) =1/4,\n\nlog\u2082z - (log\u2082x + log\u2082y) =1/4,\n\nThus, c - (a + b) =1/4.\n\nSo now, we have a system of three equations:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2,\n\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3,\n\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4.\n\nHmm, so variables a,b,c. Let me write this system as:\n\nEquation1: a - b - c = 1/2,\n\nEquation2: -a + b - c = 1/3,\n\nEquation3: -a - b + c = 1/4.\n\nHmm, perhaps adding equations might help here. Let me see.\n\nLet me add all three equations together:\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 +1/3 +1/4.\n\nLeft side:\n\na -a -a + (-b + b - b) + (-c -c +c) = (-a) + (-b) + (-c).\n\nSo, -a - b -c = sum of the right sides.\n\nCompute the right side:\n\n1/2 +1/3 +1/4. Let's get common denominator 12:\n\n6/12 +4/12 +3/12 =13/12.\n\nSo, - (a + b + c) =13/12,\n\nTherefore, a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Let me note that as equation (4).\n\nNow, maybe we can solve for each variable.\n\nLet me see equation1: a = 1/2 + b + c,\n\nEquation2: -a + b -c =1/3,\n\nEquation3: -a -b + c =1/4,\n\nAlternatively, let me try to express each variable in terms of others.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote S = a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nThen, from equation1: a - (b + c) =1/2,\n\nBut since b + c = S - a,\n\nSo, a - (S -a) =1/2,\n\nThus, 2a - S =1/2,\n\nSimilarly for equation2:\n\nequation2: -a + b -c =1/3,\n\nSimilarly, b -c =1/3 +a,\n\nBut b -c can be expressed in terms of S? Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, maybe use S and equations.\n\nAlternatively, let me try solving the equations step by step.\n\nLet me first write equations:\n\nEquation1: a - b -c =1/2,\n\nEquation2: -a + b -c =1/3,\n\nEquation3: -a -b +c =1/4,\n\nLet me try adding equation1 and equation2:\n\n(a - b -c) + (-a + b -c) =1/2 +1/3,\n\nThis gives:\n\n0a +0b -2c =5/6,\n\nTherefore, -2c =5/6 \u2192 c = -5/12.\n\nWait, that's a direct result. Let me check that again.\n\nYes, adding equation1 and equation2:\n\na - b - c -a + b - c = (a -a) + (-b + b) + (-c -c) = -2c,\n\nand the right side is 1/2 +1/3 = 5/6,\n\nSo, -2c =5/6 \u2192 c = -5/12. That's straightforward.\n\nSo c = -5/12. Okay, so that's one variable found.\n\nNow, let's use this to find other variables. Let's plug c = -5/12 into equation1 and equation2.\n\nFirst equation1: a - b - c =1/2,\n\nSubstituting c:\n\na - b - (-5/12) =1/2 \u2192 a - b +5/12 =1/2,\n\nThus, a -b =1/2 -5/12 =6/12 -5/12 =1/12. Let's call this equation (5).\n\nEquation2: -a + b -c =1/3,\n\nAgain, c is -5/12, so:\n\n- a + b - (-5/12) =1/3 \u2192 -a + b +5/12 =1/3,\n\nThus, -a +b =1/3 -5/12 =4/12 -5/12 =-1/12. Let's call this equation (6).\n\nNow, equations (5) and (6):\n\n(5): a - b =1/12,\n\n(6): -a + b = -1/12,\n\nThese are two equations:\n\nAdding them:\n\n(a - b) + (-a +b) =1/12 -1/12 \u21920=0. Hmm, which is consistent but gives no new information.\n\nAlternatively, solving equations (5) and (6):\n\nFrom (5): a = b +1/12,\n\nPlug into (6):\n\n- (b +1/12) +b = -1/12,\n\n- b -1/12 +b = -1/12,\n\n-1/12 = -1/12, which is true. So they are dependent equations.\n\nTherefore, need another equation to find a and b. Let's use equation3.\n\nEquation3: -a -b +c =1/4,\n\nWe know c =-5/12,\n\nSo:\n\n- a -b + (-5/12) =1/4,\n\n\u2192 -a -b =1/4 +5/12 =3/12 +5/12 =8/12 =2/3,\n\nThus,\n\n- a - b =2/3,\n\n\u2192 a + b = -2/3. Let me call this equation (7).\n\nNow, from equation (5): a -b =1/12,\n\nand equation (7): a + b = -2/3,\n\nWe can solve these two equations:\n\nAdding (5) and (7):\n\n(a -b) + (a +b) =1/12 + (-2/3),\n\n\u21922a =1/12 -8/12 = -7/12,\n\nThus, a = -7/24.\n\nThen, substitute back into equation (7):\n\na + b = -2/3 \u2192 (-7/24) + b = -16/24 (since -2/3 = -16/24),\n\nThus, b = -16/24 +7/24 = -9/24 = -3/8.\n\nSo, a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.\n\nTherefore, log\u2082x =a = -7/24 \u21d2 x =2^{-7/24},\n\nlog\u2082y =b = -3/8 \u21d2 y=2^{-3/8},\n\nlog\u2082z =c =-5/12 \u21d2 z=2^{-5/12},\n\nWhich matches exactly what I found earlier. So that confirms the values.\n\nTherefore, the exponents are correct. Therefore, the calculation for log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) is correct. So the absolute value is 25/8, so m + n =33.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{33}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to solve this system of logarithmic equations with three variables x, y, and z. The problem gives me three equations involving log base 2 of ratios of these variables, and I need to find the absolute value of another logarithm expression involving x, y, z. Then, express that as a reduced fraction m/n and find m + n. Alright, let's start by writing down the equations again to make sure I have them right:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nHmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but maybe if I convert them into exponential form, it might be easier to handle. Since all the logs are base 2, converting them would give me equations in terms of x, y, z. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\nlog\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2 implies that 2^(1/2) = x/(y z). So, x/(y z) = \u221a2. Let me note that as equation (a):\n\n(a) x = (\u221a2) * y z\n\nSecond equation:\n\nlog\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3 implies 2^(1/3) = y/(x z). So, y = 2^(1/3) * x z.

Let me write that as equation (c):\n\n(c) z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nHmm, so now I have three equations with x, y, z in terms of each other. This seems like a system of equations that can be solved by substitution. Since each variable is expressed in terms of the others, maybe I can substitute them into each other.\n\nLet me see. Let's try to express all variables in terms of one variable. Let's pick x as the base variable. Wait, but each equation has x multiplied or divided by others. Alternatively, maybe I can express y and z in terms of x, then substitute back.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express all variables in terms of each other and then find a relationship.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can take the three equations and multiply them together in some way? Let me think. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, since all equations are in terms of logarithms, maybe adding or manipulating the equations could help. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since we have three equations with three variables, maybe substituting step by step would work.\n\nLet me try substituting equation (c) into equation (b). Let's see.\n\nFirst, equation (c): z = 2^(1/4) * x y. Let me substitute this into equation (b):\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * x z = 2^(1/3) * x * [2^(1/4) x y] = 2^(1/3 + 1/4) * x^2 y\n\nWait, so that would be:\n\ny = 2^(1/3 + 1/4) * x\u00b2 y\n\nHmm, let's compute 1/3 + 1/4. The common denominator is 12, so 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12. So, 2^(7/12).\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\ny = 2^(7/12) * x\u00b2 y\n\nHmm, if I divide both sides by y (since y is a positive real number, so y \u2260 0), then:\n\n1 = 2^(7/12) * x\u00b2\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 1 / 2^(7/12) = 2^(-7/12)\n\nTherefore, x = 2^(-7/24). Wait, because square root of 2^(-7/12) is 2^(-7/24). Since x is positive, we take the positive root.\n\nSo, x = 2^(-7/24). Let me note that as equation (d).\n\nOkay, so x is expressed in terms of 2 to some exponent. Now, maybe I can find y and z in terms of 2 as well.\n\nLet's proceed. Let's see if we can find y. Let me use equation (c) again. Wait, equation (c) is z = 2^(1/4)*x y. But perhaps I need another equation. Let me try substituting into equation (a).\n\nEquation (a) is x = \u221a2 * y z. Since I have x in terms of 2^(-7/24), and z can be expressed via equation (c) in terms of x and y, so substituting z into equation (a):\n\nx = \u221a2 * y * [2^(1/4) x y] = \u221a2 * 2^(1/4) * x y\u00b2\n\nLet me compute \u221a2 * 2^(1/4). Since \u221a2 is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/4) = 2^(3/4). So,\n\nx = 2^(3/4) * x y\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by x (since x \u2260 0):\n\n1 = 2^(3/4) * y\u00b2\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 1 / 2^(3/4) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTherefore, y = 2^(-3/8). Since y is positive, so that's the value. Let's note that as equation (e).\n\nNow, with y known, let's find z. Let's use equation (c):\n\nz = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nWe have x = 2^(-7/24) and y = 2^(-3/8). Let's substitute these:\n\nz = 2^(1/4) * [2^(-7/24)] * [2^(-3/8)]\n\nMultiplying the exponents, since 2^a * 2^b = 2^(a + b). Let's compute the exponents:\n\nFirst term: 1/4, second term: -7/24, third term: -3/8.\n\nSo, total exponent is 1/4 - 7/24 - 3/8.\n\nLet me convert all to 24 denominators:\n\n1/4 = 6/24,\n\n-7/24 remains,\n\n-3/8 = -9/24.\n\nAdding together: 6/24 -7/24 -9/24 = (6 -7 -9)/24 = (-10)/24 = -5/12.\n\nTherefore, z = 2^(-5/12). Let me note that as equation (f).\n\nSo now, we have expressions for x, y, z in terms of exponents of 2:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24),\n\ny = 2^(-3/8),\n\nz = 2^(-5/12).\n\nNow, the problem asks for | log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) |. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the expression inside the log: x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2. Since all variables are powers of 2, their product will also be a power of 2, so taking log base 2 will just be the exponent.\n\nLet me compute the exponents:\n\nx\u2074: [2^(-7/24)]\u2074 = 2^(-7/24 *4) = 2^(-7/6)\n\ny\u00b3: [2^(-3/8)]\u00b3 = 2^(-9/8)\n\nz\u00b2: [2^(-5/12)]\u00b2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nMultiply them all together:\n\n2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)\n\nNow, let's compute the exponent:\n\nFirst, combine the terms with denominator 6:\n\n-7/6 -5/6 = -12/6 = -2\n\nThen subtract 9/8:\n\nTotal exponent: -2 - 9/8 = - (16/8 + 9/8) = -25/8\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, actually:\n\nWait, exponent is:\n\n(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nFirst, combine -7/6 and -5/6:\n\n-7/6 -5/6 = (-12)/6 = -2\n\nThen, adding -9/8:\n\n-2 + (-9/8) = - (2 + 9/8) = - (16/8 + 9/8) = -25/8. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the exponent is -25/8. Therefore, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-25/8). Therefore, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) is log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nBut the problem asks for the absolute value of that, so | -25/8 | = 25/8. Therefore, the value is 25/8, so m =25, n=8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, m +n = 33.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all steps to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Because fractions can be tricky.\n\nStarting with the exponents for x\u2074, y\u00b3, z\u00b2:\n\nx is 2^(-7/24). So x\u2074 is exponent 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6. Correct.\n\ny is 2^(-3/8). So y\u00b3 is 3*(-3/8) = -9/8. Correct.\n\nz is 2^(-5/12). z squared is 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6. Correct.\n\nAdding exponents: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nLet me compute all in 24 denominators to see:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24,\n\n-9/8 = -27/24,\n\n-5/6 = -20/24,\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8. Yes, same as before. Because 75 divided by 3 is 25, 24 divided by 3 is 8. So that's correct.\n\nSo exponent is indeed -25/8, log is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. So m is 25, n is 8, which are coprime since 25 is 5\u00b2 and 8 is 2\u00b3, no common factors. Therefore, m +n is 33. So the answer is 33.\n\nBut let me just check if there was any step where I might have messed up the exponents. Let me go back through substitution steps again.\n\nStarting with equations (a), (b), (c). Then substituting equation (c) into (b):\n\nOriginal equations:\n\n(a) x = sqrt(2) * y z,\n\n(b) y = 2^(1/3) * x z,\n\n(c) z = 2^(1/4) * x y.\n\nSubstituting (c) into (b):\n\ny = 2^(1/3)*x*(2^(1/4)*x y) = 2^(1/3 +1/4) *x\u00b2 y.\n\n1/3 +1/4 is 7/12, so 2^(7/12). So equation becomes y = 2^(7/12)x\u00b2 y, divide both sides by y: 1=2^(7/12)x\u00b2. So x\u00b2 = 2^(-7/12), so x = 2^(-7/24). That seems correct.\n\nThen, equation (a): x = sqrt(2) * y z. Let me see if with x and z in terms of y, can we get another equation?\n\nAlternatively, proceeding to equation (a):\n\nWe can use equation (c) to express z in terms of x and y, so z = 2^(1/4) x y. Then plug that into equation (a):\n\nx = sqrt(2) * y * z = sqrt(2)*y*(2^(1/4)x y) = sqrt(2)*2^(1/4)*x y\u00b2.\n\nsqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/2 +1/4) is 2^(3/4). So x = 2^(3/4)*x y\u00b2. Then cancelling x gives 1 = 2^(3/4) y\u00b2 => y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4), so y = 2^(-3/8). That seems correct.\n\nThen z via equation (c):\n\nz =2^(1/4)*x y = 2^(1/4) * [2^(-7/24)] * [2^(-3/8)].\n\nAdding exponents:\n\n1/4 -7/24 -3/8.\n\nConvert to 24ths:\n\n1/4 =6/24,\n\n-7/24 = -7/24,\n\n-3/8 = -9/24,\n\nTotal:6 -7 -9 = -10 over 24, so exponent is -10/24 = -5/12. So z =2^(-5/12). Correct.\n\nThus, all exponents are correctly calculated, so the final exponent for the product x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2 is indeed -25/8, so absolute value is 25/8. So m +n is 33. Hmm, seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, another approach might be to set variables as exponents. Let me see if that approach would work too, just to confirm.\n\nLet me let log\u2082x = a, log\u2082y = b, log\u2082z = c. Then, since log\u2082(x/(y z)) = 1/2,\n\nlog\u2082x - log\u2082(y z) = 1/2,\n\nWhich is log\u2082x - (log\u2082y + log\u2082z) = 1/2,\n\nSo a - (b + c) = 1/2. Similarly for the other equations.\n\nSecond equation: log\u2082(y/(x z)) = 1/3,\n\nlog\u2082y - (log\u2082x + log\u2082z) = 1/3,\n\nSo b - (a + c) =1/3.\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z/(x y)) =1/4,\n\nlog\u2082z - (log\u2082x + log\u2082y) =1/4,\n\nThus, c - (a + b) =1/4.\n\nSo now, we have a system of three equations:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2,\n\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3,\n\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4.\n\nHmm, so variables a,b,c. Let me write this system as:\n\nEquation1: a - b - c = 1/2,\n\nEquation2: -a + b - c = 1/3,\n\nEquation3: -a - b + c = 1/4.\n\nHmm, perhaps adding equations might help here. Let me see.\n\nLet me add all three equations together:\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 +1/3 +1/4.\n\nLeft side:\n\na -a -a + (-b + b - b) + (-c -c +c) = (-a) + (-b) + (-c).\n\nSo, -a - b -c = sum of the right sides.\n\nCompute the right side:\n\n1/2 +1/3 +1/4. Let's get common denominator 12:\n\n6/12 +4/12 +3/12 =13/12.\n\nSo, - (a + b + c) =13/12,\n\nTherefore, a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Let me note that as equation (4).\n\nNow, maybe we can solve for each variable.\n\nLet me see equation1: a = 1/2 + b + c,\n\nEquation2: -a + b -c =1/3,\n\nEquation3: -a -b + c =1/4,\n\nAlternatively, let me try to express each variable in terms of others.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote S = a + b + c = -13/12.\n\nThen, from equation1: a - (b + c) =1/2,\n\nBut since b + c = S - a,\n\nSo, a - (S -a) =1/2,\n\nThus, 2a - S =1/2,\n\nSimilarly for equation2:\n\nequation2: -a + b -c =1/3,\n\nSimilarly, b -c =1/3 +a,\n\nBut b -c can be expressed in terms of S? Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, maybe use S and equations.\n\nAlternatively, let me try solving the equations step by step.\n\nLet me first write equations:\n\nEquation1: a - b -c =1/2,\n\nEquation2: -a + b -c =1/3,\n\nEquation3: -a -b +c =1/4,\n\nLet me try adding equation1 and equation2:\n\n(a - b -c) + (-a + b -c) =1/2 +1/3,\n\nThis gives:\n\n0a +0b -2c =5/6,\n\nTherefore, -2c =5/6 \u2192 c = -5/12.\n\nWait, that's a direct result. Let me check that again.\n\nYes, adding equation1 and equation2:\n\na - b - c -a + b - c = (a -a) + (-b + b) + (-c -c) = -2c,\n\nand the right side is 1/2 +1/3 = 5/6,\n\nSo, -2c =5/6 \u2192 c = -5/12. That's straightforward.\n\nSo c = -5/12. Okay, so that's one variable found.\n\nNow, let's use this to find other variables. Let's plug c = -5/12 into equation1 and equation2.\n\nFirst equation1: a - b - c =1/2,\n\nSubstituting c:\n\na - b - (-5/12) =1/2 \u2192 a - b +5/12 =1/2,\n\nThus, a -b =1/2 -5/12 =6/12 -5/12 =1/12. Let's call this equation (5).\n\nEquation2: -a + b -c =1/3,\n\nAgain, c is -5/12, so:\n\n- a + b - (-5/12) =1/3 \u2192 -a + b +5/12 =1/3,\n\nThus, -a +b =1/3 -5/12 =4/12 -5/12 =-1/12. Let's call this equation (6).\n\nNow, equations (5) and (6):\n\n(5): a - b =1/12,\n\n(6): -a + b = -1/12,\n\nThese are two equations:\n\nAdding them:\n\n(a - b) + (-a +b) =1/12 -1/12 \u21920=0. Hmm, which is consistent but gives no new information.\n\nAlternatively, solving equations (5) and (6):\n\nFrom (5): a = b +1/12,\n\nPlug into (6):\n\n- (b +1/12) +b = -1/12,\n\n- b -1/12 +b = -1/12,\n\n-1/12 = -1/12, which is true. So they are dependent equations.\n\nTherefore, need another equation to find a and b. Let's use equation3.\n\nEquation3: -a -b +c =1/4,\n\nWe know c =-5/12,\n\nSo:\n\n- a -b + (-5/12) =1/4,\n\n\u2192 -a -b =1/4 +5/12 =3/12 +5/12 =8/12 =2/3,\n\nThus,\n\n- a - b =2/3,\n\n\u2192 a + b = -2/3. Let me call this equation (7).\n\nNow, from equation (5): a -b =1/12,\n\nand equation (7): a + b = -2/3,\n\nWe can solve these two equations:\n\nAdding (5) and (7):\n\n(a -b) + (a +b) =1/12 + (-2/3),\n\n\u21922a =1/12 -8/12 = -7/12,\n\nThus, a = -7/24.\n\nThen, substitute back into equation (7):\n\na + b = -2/3 \u2192 (-7/24) + b = -16/24 (since -2/3 = -16/24),\n\nThus, b = -16/24 +7/24 = -9/24 = -3/8.\n\nSo, a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.\n\nTherefore, log\u2082x =a = -7/24 \u21d2 x =2^{-7/24},\n\nlog\u2082y =b = -3/8 \u21d2 y=2^{-3/8},\n\nlog\u2082z =c =-5/12 \u21d2 z=2^{-5/12},\n\nWhich matches exactly what I found earlier. So that confirms the values.\n\nTherefore, the exponents are correct. Therefore, the calculation for log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) is correct. So the absolute value is 25/8, so m + n =33.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{33}\n\n\nGiven the system of equations involving logarithms:\n\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nwe convert these logarithmic equations to their exponential forms:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} \\implies x = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot yz \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3} \\implies y = 2^{1/3} \\cdot xz \\)\n3. \\( \\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4} \\implies z = 2^{1/4} \\cdot xy \\)\n\nNext, we substitute these expressions into each other to solve for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| given three logarithmic equations with variables x, y, and z. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Hmm, alright. Let me start by writing down the equations again so I can see them clearly.\n\nThe equations are:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nHmm, logarithms with base 2. Maybe I can convert these equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle? Let me recall that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So applying that here:\n\n1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)\n2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)\n3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)\n\nSo now I have three equations:\n\nEquation 1: x = 2^(1/2) * y z\n\nEquation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * x z\n\nEquation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nHmm, these are all expressions relating x, y, and z. Since they are all in terms of each other, maybe I can substitute them into each other to find expressions for each variable in terms of one variable?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it would be better to take the logarithm equations and express them in terms of log x, log y, log z. Since logarithms can sometimes be combined. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote log\u2082x = a, log\u2082y = b, log\u2082z = c. Then the equations become:\n\nFirst equation: log\u2082(x/(y z)) = (1/2). Using logarithm properties, that's log\u2082x - log\u2082(y z) = 1/2. Then log\u2082x - (log\u2082y + log\u2082z) = 1/2. So in terms of a, b, c:\n\na - (b + c) = 1/2. Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, second equation: log\u2082(y/(x z)) = 1/3. Which becomes log\u2082y - (log\u2082x + log\u2082z) = 1/3. So b - (a + c) = 1/3. Equation 2: b - a - c = 1/3.\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z/(x y)) = 1/4. So log\u2082z - (log\u2082x + log\u2082y) = 1/4. Thus c - (a + b) = 1/4. Equation 3: c - a - b = 1/4.\n\nSo now I have a system of three linear equations in variables a, b, c:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n\n2. -a + b - c = - (a + c - b) Wait, let me recheck. Wait, equation 2 is b - a - c = 1/3, so rearranged as -a + b - c = 1/3. Yeah.\n\nEquation 3: c - a - b = 1/4 \u2192 -a - b + c = 1/4.\n\nSo the three equations are:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nHmm, so we can write this as a linear system:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nHmm. Let me write this in matrix form to see if I can solve it. Alternatively, maybe adding equations to eliminate variables.\n\nLet me try adding all three equations together. Let's see:\n\nAdding equations 1, 2, 3:\n\n( a - b - c ) + ( -a + b - c ) + ( -a - b + c ) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4\n\nLeft side:\n\na - b - c -a + b - c -a - b + c\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na -a -a = -a\n\n-b + b - b = -b\n\n-c -c + c = -c\n\nSo total left side is -a - b - c.\n\nRight side: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Let me compute that. Common denominator is 12.\n\n1/2 = 6/12, 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12. So total is 6 +4 +3 =13, so 13/12.\n\nSo -a - b - c = 13/12 \u2192 a + b + c = -13/12. Hmm. Interesting.\n\nBut we need to find |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|. Since log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z = 4a + 3b + 2c. Then take absolute value of that. So if I can find 4a +3b +2c, then take absolute value, and express as m/n.\n\nSo perhaps I can find a, b, c first?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find 4a + 3b + 2c in terms of the equations. Hmm, but maybe solving for a, b, c is the way to go.\n\nWe have three equations:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2 --> equation (1)\n\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3 --> equation (2)\n\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4 --> equation (3)\n\nAnd also the sum of equations gives - (a + b + c) = 13/12 \u2192 a + b + c = -13/12. Let me note that as equation (4).\n\nMaybe using equation (4) to substitute into the others.\n\nAlternatively, let me try solving equations step by step.\n\nLet me first try to solve for variables.\n\nLet me consider equations 1,2,3:\n\nEquation 1: a = b + c + 1/2. Let me express a in terms of b and c.\n\nThen plug this into equations 2 and 3.\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3. Substituting a:\n\n- (b + c + 1/2) + b - c = 1/3\n\nSimplify:\n\n- b - c -1/2 + b - c = (-c - c) + (-b + b) + (-1/2) = -2c -1/2 =1/3\n\nSo: -2c = 1/3 +1/2 = (2 + 3)/6 =5/6 \u2192 -2c =5/6 \u2192 c= -5/12.\n\nHmm, so c is -5/12?\n\nWait, let's check that step again.\n\nStarting with equation 2 substitution:\n\nAfter substituting a = b + c + 1/2 into equation 2:\n\nLeft side: - (b + c + 1/2) + b - c\n\n= -b - c -1/2 + b - c\n\n= (-b + b) + (-c - c) + (-1/2)\n\n= 0 -2c -1/2\n\nSo that equals -2c -1/2 = 1/3 (from equation 2)\n\nThus:\n\n-2c -1/2 = 1/3\n\n\u2192 -2c = 1/3 +1/2\n\nConvert to sixths: 1/3 is 2/6, 1/2 is 3/6, so total 5/6.\n\nHence, -2c = 5/6 \u2192 c = -5/(12). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo c = -5/12.\n\nNow, let's plug this into equation 3. Let's see equation 3:\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c =1/4.\n\nWe can express a from equation 1 as a = b + c +1/2. So substitute a and c into equation 3.\n\nFirst, let me note that c is known now as -5/12.\n\nSo equation 3:\n\n- (a) - b + c =1/4\n\nSubstitute a = b + c +1/2 and c = -5/12:\n\n- [ b + c + 1/2 ] - b + c = 1/4\n\nLet me plug in c = -5/12:\n\nFirst, compute a = b + (-5/12) +1/2 = b + ( (-5/12) +6/12 ) = b + 1/12.\n\nSo substituting into equation 3:\n\n- [ (b + 1/12) ] - b + (-5/12) =1/4\n\nWait, let me go step by step:\n\n- [ a ] - b + c =1/4 \u2192 -a - b + c =1/4.\n\nBut substituting a = b + c +1/2, so:\n\n- (b + c +1/2 ) - b + c =1/4\n\nExpand:\n\n- b - c -1/2 -b + c = (-b -b) + (-c +c ) + (-1/2 )\n\n= -2b -1/2 =1/4\n\nSo:\n\n-2b =1/4 +1/2 = 3/4 \u2192 -2b = 3/4 \u2192 b= -3/8.\n\nSo b is -3/8.\n\nNow, since we have c = -5/12 and b = -3/8, we can find a from equation 1:\n\na = b + c +1/2.\n\nSo plug in:\n\na = (-3/8) + (-5/12) +1/2.\n\nFirst, convert all to 24 denominators maybe? Let's see:\n\n-3/8 = -9/24,\n\n-5/12 = -10/24,\n\n1/2 =12/24.\n\nAdding them: (-9 -10 +12)/24 = (-7)/24. So a = -7/24.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait, -3/8 is -9/24,\n\n-5/12 is -10/24,\n\nplus 1/2 is 12/24.\n\nTotal: (-9 -10 +12)= (-19 +12)= -7, so yes, -7/24. So a = -7/24.\n\nSo now we have a = log\u2082x = -7/24,\n\nb = log\u2082y = -3/8,\n\nc = log\u2082z = -5/12.\n\nWait, but let me confirm these values in the equations.\n\nLet me check equation 1: a - b - c = ?\n\na - b - c = (-7/24) - (-3/8) - (-5/12)\n\nConvert to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/24 + (9/24) + (10/24) = (-7 +9 +10)/24 =12/24=1/2. Which matches equation 1. Good.\n\nEquation 2: -a +b -c = ?\n\n-(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12) =\n\n7/24 - 9/24 +10/24 = (7 -9 +10)/24 =8/24=1/3. Which matches equation 2. Good.\n\nEquation3: -a -b +c = ?\n\n-(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12) =\n\n7/24 + 9/24 -10/24 = (7+9-10)/24 =6/24=1/4. Correct. So all equations are satisfied. Great.\n\nSo now, we need to compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4a +3b +2c.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n4a =4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6,\n\n3b =3*(-3/8)= -9/8,\n\n2c =2*(-5/12)= -10/12 = -5/6.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nLet me convert all to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24,\n\n-9/8 = -27/24,\n\n-5/6 = -20/24,\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nWait, 7/6 is 28/24, so negative is -28/24,\n\n-9/8 is -27/24,\n\n-5/6 is -20/24,\n\nTotal sum: (-28 -27 -20) = -75, so -75/24. Then simplifying, 75 and 24 have a common factor of 3: 75 \u00f73=25, 24 \u00f73=8. So -25/8. So the total is -25/8.\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = -25/8. The absolute value is 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, m=25, n=8. Thus m +n =33.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the calculation again because fractions can be tricky.\n\nLet me recompute 4a +3b +2c:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6,\n\n3b =3*(-3/8) = -9/8,\n\n2c =2*(-5/12)= -10/12 = -5/6,\n\nSo adding those:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nCombine the terms with denominator 6 first: (-7/6 -5/6) = (-12/6) = -2,\n\nThen subtract 9/8: -2 -9/8 = - (16/8 +9/8) = -25/8. Yes, same as before. So absolute value is 25/8. So m +n is 25 +8 =33. So the answer should be 33.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that all steps were correct. Let me see:\n\nWe converted the logs into variables a,b,c, solved the linear system correctly. The key steps were solving for c first by substituting a from equation 1 into equation 2, then found c, then found b from equation 3, then a. Then computed 4a +3b +2c. Seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is symmetric, perhaps multiplying the original equations. Let me see:\n\nOriginal equations in exponential form:\n\nEquation1: x = 2^(1/2) y z,\n\nEquation2: y = 2^(1/3) x z,\n\nEquation3: z = 2^(1/4) x y.\n\nIf I multiply all three equations together, left side is x*y*z, right side is 2^(1/2 +1/3 +1/4) * y z * x z * x y.\n\nWait, let me do that step by step.\n\nMultiplying the three equations:\n\nLeft side: x * y * z.\n\nRight side: [2^(1/2) y z] * [2^(1/3) x z] * [2^(1/4) x y]\n\nMultiply the constants first: 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4) = 2^(1/2 +1/3 +1/4).\n\nThen the variables:\n\n(y z) * (x z) * (x y) = x^2 y^2 z^2.\n\nSo altogether, right side is 2^( (6/12 +4/12 +3/12 )) * x\u00b2 y\u00b2 z\u00b2 = 2^(13/12) * (x y z)^2.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nx y z = 2^(13/12) * (x y z)^2.\n\nThen, divide both sides by (x y z)^2 (assuming x y z \u22600, which they are positive reals):\n\n1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12)\n\nTherefore, x y z = 2^(-13/12).\n\nHmm, so xyz = 2^{-13/12}. Interesting, that's another relation. Maybe this can help us compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2).\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\nWe need log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4 log x +3 log y +2 log z. Since log is base 2, so in terms of a,b,c it's 4a+3b+2c, which we already found as -25/8. But perhaps there's another way using xyz?\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can express x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 in terms of xyz and other terms. Let's see:\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = x^3 * y^2 * z * x y z. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe express variables in terms of each other.\n\nAlternatively, since we have xyz =2^{-13/12}, maybe express x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 as x^3 y^2 z * (x y z). Wait, perhaps not straightforward. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express variables in terms of each other. Let me see:\n\nFrom equation1: x =2^{1/2} y z,\n\nFrom equation2: y=2^{1/3} x z,\n\nFrom equation3: z=2^{1/4} x y.\n\nLet me try to express x, y, z in terms of one variable. For example, let's express everything in terms of x.\n\nFrom equation1: x =2^{1/2} y z \u2192 y z = x /2^{1/2}\n\nFrom equation2: y =2^{1/3} x z \u2192 substitute z from equation3? Hmm, this might get complicated, but let's try.\n\nFrom equation3: z =2^{1/4} x y. So substitute into equation2's expression for y:\n\ny =2^{1/3} x * z =2^{1/3} x*(2^{1/4} x y) =2^{1/3 +1/4} x\u00b2 y.\n\nThus, y =2^{7/12} x\u00b2 y \u2192 divide both sides by y (since y \u22600):\n\n1=2^{7/12} x\u00b2 \u2192 x\u00b2=2^{-7/12} \u2192 x=2^{-7/24}\n\nSimilarly, then we can find y and z.\n\nWait, this might be another path. Let me see.\n\nSo, starting with equation2 and 3 substitution:\n\ny =2^{1/3} x z,\n\nbut z =2^{1/4} x y,\n\nso substitute z into equation2:\n\ny =2^{1/3} x*(2^{1/4} x y) =2^{1/3 +1/4} x\u00b2 y,\n\nthen as above, 1=2^{7/12} x\u00b2 \u2192 x=2^{-7/24}\n\nSimilarly, then z=2^{1/4} x y. Let me see if we can find y.\n\nFrom equation1: x =2^{1/2} y z \u2192 plug in z=2^{1/4} x y,\n\nso x =2^{1/2} y*(2^{1/4} x y)=2^{1/2 +1/4} x y\u00b2,\n\nSimplify exponents: 1/2 +1/4 = 3/4,\n\nso x =2^{3/4} x y\u00b2,\n\nDivide both sides by x (x\u22600):\n\n1=2^{3/4} y\u00b2 \u2192 y\u00b2 =2^{-3/4} \u2192 y=2^{-3/8}\n\nSimilarly, then z can be found from equation3: z=2^{1/4} x y.\n\nSubstituting x=2^{-7/24} and y=2^{-3/8}:\n\nz=2^{1/4}*(2^{-7/24})*(2^{-3/8})\n\nAdd exponents:\n\n1/4 -7/24 -3/8.\n\nConvert all to 24 denominators:\n\n1/4 =6/24,\n\n-7/24 stays,\n\n-3/8 = -9/24,\n\nTotal exponent:6 -7 -9= -10, so -10/24 = -5/12,\n\nThus z=2^{-5/12}\n\nSo, x=2^{-7/24}, y=2^{-3/8}, z=2^{-5/12}\n\nTherefore, log\u2082x = -7/24, log\u2082y= -3/8, log\u2082z= -5/12. Which matches what we had earlier. So that's consistent.\n\nThus, log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)=4*(-7/24)+3*(-3/8)+2*(-5/12)\n\nCalculates as:\n\n4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6,\n\n3*(-3/8)= -9/8,\n\n2*(-5/12)= -10/12 = -5/6.\n\nAdding these: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6,\n\nCombine the -7/6 and -5/6 first: -12/6 = -2,\n\nThen -2 -9/8 = -25/8. Absolute value is 25/8, so 25 +8=33.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 33. Seems solid.\n\nI think that's thorough. I considered two methods: one converting to linear equations with logs, another substituting variables directly. Both lead to the same result, so I can be confident.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{33}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| given three logarithmic equations with variables x, y, and z. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Hmm, alright. Let me start by writing down the equations again so I can see them clearly.\n\nThe equations are:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nHmm, logarithms with base 2. Maybe I can convert these equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle? Let me recall that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So applying that here:\n\n1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)\n2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)\n3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)\n\nSo now I have three equations:\n\nEquation 1: x = 2^(1/2) * y z\n\nEquation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * x z\n\nEquation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nHmm, these are all expressions relating x, y, and z. Since they are all in terms of each other, maybe I can substitute them into each other to find expressions for each variable in terms of one variable?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it would be better to take the logarithm equations and express them in terms of log x, log y, log z. Since logarithms can sometimes be combined. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote log\u2082x = a, log\u2082y = b, log\u2082z = c. Then the equations become:\n\nFirst equation: log\u2082(x/(y z)) = (1/2). Using logarithm properties, that's log\u2082x - log\u2082(y z) = 1/2. Then log\u2082x - (log\u2082y + log\u2082z) = 1/2. So in terms of a, b, c:\n\na - (b + c) = 1/2. Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, second equation: log\u2082(y/(x z)) = 1/3. Which becomes log\u2082y - (log\u2082x + log\u2082z) = 1/3. So b - (a + c) = 1/3. Equation 2: b - a - c = 1/3.\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z/(x y)) = 1/4. So log\u2082z - (log\u2082x + log\u2082y) = 1/4. Thus c - (a + b) = 1/4. Equation 3: c - a - b = 1/4.\n\nSo now I have a system of three linear equations in variables a, b, c:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n\n2. -a + b - c = - (a + c - b) Wait, let me recheck. Wait, equation 2 is b - a - c = 1/3, so rearranged as -a + b - c = 1/3. Yeah.\n\nEquation 3: c - a - b = 1/4 \u2192 -a - b + c = 1/4.\n\nSo the three equations are:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nHmm, so we can write this as a linear system:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nHmm. Let me write this in matrix form to see if I can solve it. Alternatively, maybe adding equations to eliminate variables.\n\nLet me try adding all three equations together. Let's see:\n\nAdding equations 1, 2, 3:\n\n( a - b - c ) + ( -a + b - c ) + ( -a - b + c ) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4\n\nLeft side:\n\na - b - c -a + b - c -a - b + c\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na -a -a = -a\n\n-b + b - b = -b\n\n-c -c + c = -c\n\nSo total left side is -a - b - c.\n\nRight side: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Let me compute that. Common denominator is 12.\n\n1/2 = 6/12, 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12. So total is 6 +4 +3 =13, so 13/12.\n\nSo -a - b - c = 13/12 \u2192 a + b + c = -13/12. Hmm. Interesting.\n\nBut we need to find |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|. Since log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z = 4a + 3b + 2c. Then take absolute value of that. So if I can find 4a +3b +2c, then take absolute value, and express as m/n.\n\nSo perhaps I can find a, b, c first?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find 4a + 3b + 2c in terms of the equations. Hmm, but maybe solving for a, b, c is the way to go.\n\nWe have three equations:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2 --> equation (1)\n\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3 --> equation (2)\n\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4 --> equation (3)\n\nAnd also the sum of equations gives - (a + b + c) = 13/12 \u2192 a + b + c = -13/12. Let me note that as equation (4).\n\nMaybe using equation (4) to substitute into the others.\n\nAlternatively, let me try solving equations step by step.\n\nLet me first try to solve for variables.\n\nLet me consider equations 1,2,3:\n\nEquation 1: a = b + c + 1/2. Let me express a in terms of b and c.\n\nThen plug this into equations 2 and 3.\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3. Substituting a:\n\n- (b + c + 1/2) + b - c = 1/3\n\nSimplify:\n\n- b - c -1/2 + b - c = (-c - c) + (-b + b) + (-1/2) = -2c -1/2 =1/3\n\nSo: -2c = 1/3 +1/2 = (2 + 3)/6 =5/6 \u2192 -2c =5/6 \u2192 c= -5/12.\n\nHmm, so c is -5/12?\n\nWait, let's check that step again.\n\nStarting with equation 2 substitution:\n\nAfter substituting a = b + c + 1/2 into equation 2:\n\nLeft side: - (b + c + 1/2) + b - c\n\n= -b - c -1/2 + b - c\n\n= (-b + b) + (-c - c) + (-1/2)\n\n= 0 -2c -1/2\n\nSo that equals -2c -1/2 = 1/3 (from equation 2)\n\nThus:\n\n-2c -1/2 = 1/3\n\n\u2192 -2c = 1/3 +1/2\n\nConvert to sixths: 1/3 is 2/6, 1/2 is 3/6, so total 5/6.\n\nHence, -2c = 5/6 \u2192 c = -5/(12). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo c = -5/12.\n\nNow, let's plug this into equation 3. Let's see equation 3:\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c =1/4.\n\nWe can express a from equation 1 as a = b + c +1/2. So substitute a and c into equation 3.\n\nFirst, let me note that c is known now as -5/12.\n\nSo equation 3:\n\n- (a) - b + c =1/4\n\nSubstitute a = b + c +1/2 and c = -5/12:\n\n- [ b + c + 1/2 ] - b + c = 1/4\n\nLet me plug in c = -5/12:\n\nFirst, compute a = b + (-5/12) +1/2 = b + ( (-5/12) +6/12 ) = b + 1/12.\n\nSo substituting into equation 3:\n\n- [ (b + 1/12) ] - b + (-5/12) =1/4\n\nWait, let me go step by step:\n\n- [ a ] - b + c =1/4 \u2192 -a - b + c =1/4.\n\nBut substituting a = b + c +1/2, so:\n\n- (b + c +1/2 ) - b + c =1/4\n\nExpand:\n\n- b - c -1/2 -b + c = (-b -b) + (-c +c ) + (-1/2 )\n\n= -2b -1/2 =1/4\n\nSo:\n\n-2b =1/4 +1/2 = 3/4 \u2192 -2b = 3/4 \u2192 b= -3/8.\n\nSo b is -3/8.\n\nNow, since we have c = -5/12 and b = -3/8, we can find a from equation 1:\n\na = b + c +1/2.\n\nSo plug in:\n\na = (-3/8) + (-5/12) +1/2.\n\nFirst, convert all to 24 denominators maybe? Let's see:\n\n-3/8 = -9/24,\n\n-5/12 = -10/24,\n\n1/2 =12/24.\n\nAdding them: (-9 -10 +12)/24 = (-7)/24. So a = -7/24.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait, -3/8 is -9/24,\n\n-5/12 is -10/24,\n\nplus 1/2 is 12/24.\n\nTotal: (-9 -10 +12)= (-19 +12)= -7, so yes, -7/24. So a = -7/24.\n\nSo now we have a = log\u2082x = -7/24,\n\nb = log\u2082y = -3/8,\n\nc = log\u2082z = -5/12.\n\nWait, but let me confirm these values in the equations.\n\nLet me check equation 1: a - b - c = ?\n\na - b - c = (-7/24) - (-3/8) - (-5/12)\n\nConvert to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/24 + (9/24) + (10/24) = (-7 +9 +10)/24 =12/24=1/2. Which matches equation 1. Good.\n\nEquation 2: -a +b -c = ?\n\n-(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12) =\n\n7/24 - 9/24 +10/24 = (7 -9 +10)/24 =8/24=1/3. Which matches equation 2. Good.\n\nEquation3: -a -b +c = ?\n\n-(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12) =\n\n7/24 + 9/24 -10/24 = (7+9-10)/24 =6/24=1/4. Correct. So all equations are satisfied. Great.\n\nSo now, we need to compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4a +3b +2c.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n4a =4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6,\n\n3b =3*(-3/8)= -9/8,\n\n2c =2*(-5/12)= -10/12 = -5/6.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nLet me convert all to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24,\n\n-9/8 = -27/24,\n\n-5/6 = -20/24,\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nWait, 7/6 is 28/24, so negative is -28/24,\n\n-9/8 is -27/24,\n\n-5/6 is -20/24,\n\nTotal sum: (-28 -27 -20) = -75, so -75/24. Then simplifying, 75 and 24 have a common factor of 3: 75 \u00f73=25, 24 \u00f73=8. So -25/8. So the total is -25/8.\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = -25/8. The absolute value is 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, m=25, n=8. Thus m +n =33.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the calculation again because fractions can be tricky.\n\nLet me recompute 4a +3b +2c:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6,\n\n3b =3*(-3/8) = -9/8,\n\n2c =2*(-5/12)= -10/12 = -5/6,\n\nSo adding those:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nCombine the terms with denominator 6 first: (-7/6 -5/6) = (-12/6) = -2,\n\nThen subtract 9/8: -2 -9/8 = - (16/8 +9/8) = -25/8. Yes, same as before. So absolute value is 25/8. So m +n is 25 +8 =33. So the answer should be 33.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that all steps were correct. Let me see:\n\nWe converted the logs into variables a,b,c, solved the linear system correctly. The key steps were solving for c first by substituting a from equation 1 into equation 2, then found c, then found b from equation 3, then a. Then computed 4a +3b +2c. Seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is symmetric, perhaps multiplying the original equations. Let me see:\n\nOriginal equations in exponential form:\n\nEquation1: x = 2^(1/2) y z,\n\nEquation2: y = 2^(1/3) x z,\n\nEquation3: z = 2^(1/4) x y.\n\nIf I multiply all three equations together, left side is x*y*z, right side is 2^(1/2 +1/3 +1/4) * y z * x z * x y.\n\nWait, let me do that step by step.\n\nMultiplying the three equations:\n\nLeft side: x * y * z.\n\nRight side: [2^(1/2) y z] * [2^(1/3) x z] * [2^(1/4) x y]\n\nMultiply the constants first: 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4) = 2^(1/2 +1/3 +1/4).\n\nThen the variables:\n\n(y z) * (x z) * (x y) = x^2 y^2 z^2.\n\nSo altogether, right side is 2^( (6/12 +4/12 +3/12 )) * x\u00b2 y\u00b2 z\u00b2 = 2^(13/12) * (x y z)^2.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nx y z = 2^(13/12) * (x y z)^2.\n\nThen, divide both sides by (x y z)^2 (assuming x y z \u22600, which they are positive reals):\n\n1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12)\n\nTherefore, x y z = 2^(-13/12).\n\nHmm, so xyz = 2^{-13/12}. Interesting, that's another relation. Maybe this can help us compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2).\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\nWe need log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4 log x +3 log y +2 log z. Since log is base 2, so in terms of a,b,c it's 4a+3b+2c, which we already found as -25/8. But perhaps there's another way using xyz?\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can express x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 in terms of xyz and other terms. Let's see:\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = x^3 * y^2 * z * x y z. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe express variables in terms of each other.\n\nAlternatively, since we have xyz =2^{-13/12}, maybe express x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 as x^3 y^2 z * (x y z). Wait, perhaps not straightforward. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express variables in terms of each other. Let me see:\n\nFrom equation1: x =2^{1/2} y z,\n\nFrom equation2: y=2^{1/3} x z,\n\nFrom equation3: z=2^{1/4} x y.\n\nLet me try to express x, y, z in terms of one variable. For example, let's express everything in terms of x.\n\nFrom equation1: x =2^{1/2} y z \u2192 y z = x /2^{1/2}\n\nFrom equation2: y =2^{1/3} x z \u2192 substitute z from equation3? Hmm, this might get complicated, but let's try.\n\nFrom equation3: z =2^{1/4} x y. So substitute into equation2's expression for y:\n\ny =2^{1/3} x * z =2^{1/3} x*(2^{1/4} x y) =2^{1/3 +1/4} x\u00b2 y.\n\nThus, y =2^{7/12} x\u00b2 y \u2192 divide both sides by y (since y \u22600):\n\n1=2^{7/12} x\u00b2 \u2192 x\u00b2=2^{-7/12} \u2192 x=2^{-7/24}\n\nSimilarly, then we can find y and z.\n\nWait, this might be another path. Let me see.\n\nSo, starting with equation2 and 3 substitution:\n\ny =2^{1/3} x z,\n\nbut z =2^{1/4} x y,\n\nso substitute z into equation2:\n\ny =2^{1/3} x*(2^{1/4} x y) =2^{1/3 +1/4} x\u00b2 y,\n\nthen as above, 1=2^{7/12} x\u00b2 \u2192 x=2^{-7/24}\n\nSimilarly, then z=2^{1/4} x y. Let me see if we can find y.\n\nFrom equation1: x =2^{1/2} y z \u2192 plug in z=2^{1/4} x y,\n\nso x =2^{1/2} y*(2^{1/4} x y)=2^{1/2 +1/4} x y\u00b2,\n\nSimplify exponents: 1/2 +1/4 = 3/4,\n\nso x =2^{3/4} x y\u00b2,\n\nDivide both sides by x (x\u22600):\n\n1=2^{3/4} y\u00b2 \u2192 y\u00b2 =2^{-3/4} \u2192 y=2^{-3/8}\n\nSimilarly, then z can be found from equation3: z=2^{1/4} x y.\n\nSubstituting x=2^{-7/24} and y=2^{-3/8}:\n\nz=2^{1/4}*(2^{-7/24})*(2^{-3/8})\n\nAdd exponents:\n\n1/4 -7/24 -3/8.\n\nConvert all to 24 denominators:\n\n1/4 =6/24,\n\n-7/24 stays,\n\n-3/8 = -9/24,\n\nTotal exponent:6 -7 -9= -10, so -10/24 = -5/12,\n\nThus z=2^{-5/12}\n\nSo, x=2^{-7/24}, y=2^{-3/8}, z=2^{-5/12}\n\nTherefore, log\u2082x = -7/24, log\u2082y= -3/8, log\u2082z= -5/12. Which matches what we had earlier. So that's consistent.\n\nThus, log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)=4*(-7/24)+3*(-3/8)+2*(-5/12)\n\nCalculates as:\n\n4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6,\n\n3*(-3/8)= -9/8,\n\n2*(-5/12)= -10/12 = -5/6.\n\nAdding these: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6,\n\nCombine the -7/6 and -5/6 first: -12/6 = -2,\n\nThen -2 -9/8 = -25/8. Absolute value is 25/8, so 25 +8=33.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 33. Seems solid.\n\nI think that's thorough. I considered two methods: one converting to linear equations with logs, another substituting variables directly. Both lead to the same result, so I can be confident.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{33}\n\n\nGiven the system of equations involving logarithms:\n\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nWe convert these equations into exponential form:\n\n1. \\( x = 2^{1/2} \\cdot yz \\)\n2. \\( y = 2^{1/3} \\cdot xz \\)\n3. \\( z = 2^{1/4} \\cdot xy \\)\n\nWe introduce variables \\( a = \\log_2 x \\), \\( b = \\log_2 y \\), and \\( c = \\log_2 z \\).
