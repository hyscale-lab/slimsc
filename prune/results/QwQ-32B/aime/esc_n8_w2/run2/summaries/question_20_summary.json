      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. Hmm, so we have a 5x5 grid, and we need to place some white and black chips such that each cell has at most one chip. The conditions are:\n\n1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.\n2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.\n3. The placement must be maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips without violating the first two conditions.\n4. We have 25 white and 25 black chips available, but we can use some of them.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The first thing I notice is that each row must be entirely one color or empty. Similarly, each column must be entirely one color or empty. But since the placement has to be maximal, that means that for every row and column, if you could add a chip without breaking the color condition, you must have already placed it. Wait, actually, the maximality condition here is that adding any chip would violate either the row or column color condition. So, for a row, if it's not completely filled with chips of one color, then adding a chip to that row would require that the entire row is already of that color. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me think: To satisfy the first two conditions, each row must be either entirely white, entirely black, or empty. Similarly, each column must be entirely white, entirely black, or empty. But the combination of rows and columns has to be such that their intersection also satisfies the color condition. For instance, if a row is white, then every column that intersects this row must either be white or have the cell in that row already occupied by white. Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nLet me consider the grid's rows and columns. Since each row must be a single color or empty, and each column must also be a single color or empty, the colors of the rows and columns must be compatible. Let me think of the grid as a matrix where each row is either white, black, or empty, and each column is also white, black, or empty. However, whenever a cell is occupied, its row's color and column's color must agree. So, for example, if a cell is in a white row and a white column, that's okay. But if a cell is in a white row and a black column, that can't happen because the cell can't be both colors. Therefore, the rows and columns must be colored in such a way that for any row and column, their intersection is only allowed if their colors are the same. Wait, actually, more precisely, the color of the row and the color of the column must be the same for every cell where they intersect. So if a row is white, then all columns that intersect with this row must either also be white or have that cell not occupied. Hmm, but since the placement is maximal, if a row is white, then every column that intersects it must already have their cells in that row as white. Wait, maybe I need to formalize this.\n\nLet me denote for each row, its color as either W, B, or E (empty). Similarly, each column has a color W, B, or E. The constraints are that for every cell (i,j), if row i is colored (not E) and column j is colored (not E), then they must have the same color. Moreover, if a row is colored, then all cells in that row must be filled with that color. Similarly, if a column is colored, all cells in that column must be filled with that color. Wait, actually, maybe that's the case. Because if the row is colored white, then all cells in that row must be white chips. Similarly, if a column is colored black, all cells in that column must be black. But then, the color assignments for rows and columns have to be compatible so that their intersections don't conflict.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to model this as follows: Let me consider that each row can be in one of three states: white, black, or empty. Similarly, each column can be in one of three states. However, whenever a row is colored (not empty), all its cells must be of that color, and similarly for the columns. But the key is that for any cell (i,j), if both row i and column j are non-empty, they must be the same color. Additionally, the placement is maximal, so that you can't add any more chips. That would mean that for any cell that is empty, either its row is empty, or its column is empty, or the row and column are of different colors (so you can't place a chip there without conflicting). Wait, actually, let me think again.\n\nThe maximality condition implies that for every empty cell, there is no way to add a chip there without violating the color constraints. So, if a cell is empty, then either its row is already non-empty (so the row's color is fixed, so you can't put a different color there), or its column is already non-empty (same logic), or both the row and column are non-empty but of different colors (so you can't put a chip there without conflicting), or both row and column are empty, but then you could add a chip of any color, so in that case, the cell must actually be filled? Wait, no. Wait, if both the row and column are empty, then you can add a chip there, so to satisfy maximality, that cell must already be filled. Hmm, so perhaps the only way for a cell to be empty is that either the row is non-empty (so the row's color is set, so you can't put a different color in the cell) or the column is non-empty (same), or both are non-empty but conflicting. But if the row and column are both empty, then you could add a chip there, so to be maximal, you must have filled it. Therefore, in such a case, the cell must be filled with any color, but since the row and column are empty, you could choose a color, but then that would set the row and column's color. Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal condition requires that for every empty cell, at least one of its row or column is already non-empty (and of some color). Because otherwise, if both row and column are empty, you could place a chip there, so you must have already placed one. Therefore, every empty cell must have its row or column already colored (so that you can't add a chip there without conflicting). Therefore, the only empty cells are those where either the row is colored (so you can't put a different color there) or the column is colored (same) or both are colored but of different colors (so you can't put any color there). \n\nTherefore, to model this, let me think of the grid as being determined by the colors of each row and column, with the constraints that whenever a row and column are both colored, they must be the same color in their intersection. Wait, actually, if a row is colored white, then all the columns that intersect it must either be white or not colored (but then the columns could be colored later, but not in the same cell). Hmm, maybe this is getting too convoluted. Maybe a better approach is to consider that the grid must be partitioned into regions where rows and columns are colored, and their intersections must agree. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a matrix where each row is either white, black, or empty, and each column is similarly, such that whenever a row and column are both non-empty, their colors must agree. Moreover, the placement is maximal, so that every cell that is not filled must be blocked by either its row or column already being set to a color different from what could be placed there. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key idea is that the set of rows and columns that are colored must form a \"monochromatic\" configuration where their colors agree on overlaps, and all other cells are blocked by either their row or column being set. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to model this problem as choosing for each row a color (W, B, or E) and for each column a color (W, B, or E) such that for every cell (i,j), if row i is not E and column j is not E, then they must have the same color. Additionally, the arrangement must be maximal, meaning that you cannot add any more chips. The maximality condition would require that for any cell not colored, either its row is colored (so you can't put a different color there) or its column is colored (same) or both are colored but conflicting (so you can't put anything there). But if a cell is uncolored (i.e., its row and column are both E), then you could put a chip there, so the arrangement isn't maximal. Therefore, the only way to have a maximal arrangement is that there are no cells where both the row and column are E. Therefore, every cell must have either its row or column (or both) colored. Therefore, the set of rows and columns colored must form a covering of the grid in the sense that every cell is in at least one colored row or column.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing a set of rows and columns to color (with colors W or B), such that:\n\n1. For any row colored W or B, all its cells are set to that color.\n2. For any column colored W or B, all its cells are set to that color.\n3. For any cell (i,j), if row i is colored and column j is colored, they must agree in color.\n4. Additionally, every cell must be in at least one colored row or column (to satisfy maximality).\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to selecting a subset of rows and columns, each assigned a color (or unassigned, i.e., E), such that:\n\n- For every row, if it's colored (W/B), all its cells are that color.\n- For every column, if it's colored (W/B), all its cells are that color.\n- For any row i and column j, if both are colored, their colors must match at cell (i,j).\n- Every cell (i,j) is in at least one colored row or column.\n\nMoreover, since we have a finite number of chips (25 white and 25 black), we have to ensure that the total number of white chips used does not exceed 25 and similarly for black chips.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"some of these chips\" so we can use any number up to 25 of each, but the arrangement must be maximal. However, maybe the color assignments will automatically not exceed the available chips because of the maximality? Hmm, perhaps not necessarily, but we need to count all such maximal arrangements where the number of white chips used is at most 25 and black chips similarly, but since the chips are indistinct, as long as the count is within the limit, it's okay. Wait, actually, the problem says \"place some of these chips\", so we can use any number up to 25 of each, but the arrangement must be maximal. But the problem is asking for the number of ways, so perhaps the counts of white and black chips in the arrangement must be exactly some numbers, but since the chips are indistinct, the count is determined by the configuration. Therefore, perhaps we need to count all such maximal arrangements (regardless of the counts) but ensuring that we don't use more than 25 of each color. Wait, but the problem states \"any additional chip placed on the grid would violate...\", so the arrangement is maximal, so you can't add any more chips. Therefore, the counts are automatically at most 25? Because if you could add more, then it's not maximal. Wait, no. The problem says \"some of these chips\", so maybe you can use any number, but since you can't add any more, the counts are such that you can't add another chip without violating the row or column constraints. So the counts can be anything as long as the arrangement is maximal, but the problem also specifies that you have 25 white and 25 black chips available. Therefore, the total white chips used must be \u226425 and black chips used \u226425. However, since the grid has 25 cells, the total number of chips used can be up to 25. Wait, but in a maximal arrangement, the number of chips must be exactly equal to the number of cells that are covered by at least one colored row or column. Wait, actually, in a maximal arrangement, every empty cell must be blocked by either its row or column being colored (so you can't put a chip there). But if a cell is not in any colored row or column, then you can put a chip there, which would violate maximality. Therefore, in a maximal arrangement, every cell must be in at least one colored row or column, so the entire grid is covered by the colored rows and columns. Wait, but actually, if a cell is in a colored row or column, then it's either filled with the color of the row or column. But if both the row and column are colored, they must agree, so the cell is filled with that color. If only the row is colored, then the cell is filled with the row's color. Similarly, if only the column is colored, it's filled with the column's color. Therefore, in a maximal arrangement, all cells are filled with either the row's color or the column's color, provided that whenever both are colored, they agree. Therefore, actually, the entire grid is filled except possibly where both the row and column are uncolored? Wait no, no. Wait, in a maximal arrangement, every cell must be in at least one colored row or column. Because otherwise, if a cell is not in any colored row or column, then you could place a chip there of any color, which would not violate the constraints (since the row and column are uncolored, so they can be set to that color). Therefore, to be maximal, there can be no such cells. Therefore, every cell must be in at least one colored row or column. Therefore, all cells are in at least one colored row or column, so the union of all colored rows and columns must cover the entire grid. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to selecting a set of rows and columns, each assigned a color (W/B or unassigned, but if assigned, must be W/B), such that:\n\n1. For each row, if it is colored (W or B), all its cells are that color.\n2. For each column, if it is colored (W or B), all its cells are that color.\n3. For any cell (i,j), if both row i and column j are colored, they must have the same color.\n4. Every cell is in at least one colored row or column.\n\nMoreover, the total number of white chips used (which is the number of cells in white rows plus the number of cells in white columns not already covered by white rows) must be \u226425, and similarly for black. But since the grid is 5x5, the total cells are 25, so actually, the counts must exactly sum to 25. Wait, but the chips are placed in the cells, so each cell has at most one chip. Therefore, the total number of chips is exactly the number of cells that are covered by at least one colored row or column. Wait, but actually, every cell is covered by at least one colored row or column, so all 25 cells are filled? Wait no, hold on. Wait, if a cell is in a colored row and a colored column, then it is filled with the color of the row (and column, since they must agree). If a cell is only in a colored row, it is filled with the row's color. Similarly, if only in a colored column, it's filled with column's color. Therefore, every cell is filled, because every cell is in at least one colored row or column. Therefore, in a maximal arrangement, the grid is completely filled with chips, with the constraints on the rows and columns. Therefore, the total number of chips used is exactly 25. Therefore, the problem's condition of having at most one chip per cell is satisfied because the grid is filled, and we have exactly 25 chips (so using all cells). However, the problem says \"some of these chips\", so maybe it's allowed to have fewer? Wait, but if you don't fill all cells, then there exists a cell not in any colored row or column, which would allow adding a chip there, so it wouldn't be maximal. Therefore, the maximal arrangements must fill all cells. Therefore, the counts of white and black chips must sum to 25, and each must be \u226425, which is naturally satisfied since each is between 0 and 25. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of such colorings (assigning colors to rows and columns with the constraints above), and since the chips are indistinct, each such coloring corresponds to exactly one way (since the colors are fixed once rows and columns are assigned, and the counts are determined by that). However, we have to consider that rows and columns can be unassigned (E), but in such a way that every cell is in a colored row or column. Wait, but if a row is unassigned (E), then all its cells must be covered by their respective columns. Similarly, if a column is unassigned, all its cells must be covered by their respective rows. \n\nThis seems quite complex. Maybe an alternative approach is to model this as a matrix where each row is either W, B, or E, and each column similarly, with the constraints that for all i,j: if row i is not E and column j is not E, then row i's color = column j's color. Additionally, every cell is in at least one non-E row or column. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps all the colored rows must agree on a single color, and all colored columns must also agree on that same color? Wait, that might not necessarily be the case. Let me think of an example. Suppose we color row 1 white, column 1 white. That's okay. If we color row 2 black, then column 1 (already white) can't intersect with row 2's black. Therefore, column 1 and row 2 can't both be colored. Therefore, if a column is colored white, then any row that is colored and intersects it must also be white. Similarly, if a row is colored black, any column that is colored and intersects it must also be black. \n\nThis suggests that all non-E rows and non-E columns must be of the same color. Wait, is that true?\n\nSuppose there are two rows colored differently. Let's say row 1 is white and row 2 is black. Then, any column that is colored must be the same as every row it intersects. So, for column 1, if it's colored, it must be white (because row 1 is white) and black (because row 2 is black), which is impossible. Therefore, if there are two rows of different colors, then any column that is colored must be in conflict, so columns can't be colored except those that don't intersect both rows? Wait, but columns must cover all cells. This is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all colored rows must be of the same color, and all colored columns must also be of that color. Let me see:\n\nSuppose that there is at least one colored row. Let the color of that row be C. Then any column that is colored must also be C, because wherever they intersect with that row, they must agree. Similarly, any other colored row must also be C, since they intersect with the columns which are C. So, in other words, if there is any colored row or column, they must all be the same color. \n\nTherefore, the possible colorings are:\n\n1. All colored rows and columns are white.\n\n2. All colored rows and columns are black.\n\n3. No rows or columns are colored (but this can't be, since then the grid is empty and not maximal).\n\nWait, but if you have some rows and columns colored, they must all agree on a single color. Therefore, the only possibilities are:\n\nEither all colored rows and columns are white, or all are black, or there are no colored rows and columns (which is invalid because then the grid is empty and you could add chips, so it's not maximal). Therefore, the maximal arrangements are either:\n\n- All rows and columns are colored white, but that would mean every cell is white, so that's one possibility.\n\n- All rows and columns are colored black, similarly all cells black.\n\n- Or, perhaps a mix where some rows and columns are colored white, and the rest are uncolored, but all colored ones are white. Similarly for black.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the previous logic suggests that if you have any colored rows or columns, they must all be the same color. So, for instance, you could have some rows colored white, some columns colored white, and the rest uncolored. The uncolored rows and columns must be covered by the colored ones. Wait, but let me think through an example.\n\nSuppose we have two rows colored white, and three columns colored white. Then all intersections of white rows and columns are white. The cells in the white rows but outside the white columns must be white (since the row is white). The cells in the white columns but outside the white rows must also be white (since the column is white). The remaining cells (not in any white row or column) would have to be covered by other colored rows or columns, but since we can't have other colors, those cells must be covered by... Wait, but since we can't have other colors, those cells would be uncovered, which violates the maximality. Therefore, in such a case, all cells must be in at least one white row or column. Therefore, the union of white rows and columns must cover the entire grid.\n\nAlternatively, if we have some rows and columns colored white, and the rest uncolored, but the union of those rows and columns must cover all cells. Similarly for black. \n\nTherefore, the possible maximal arrangements are:\n\nEither:\n\n- The entire grid is white (all rows and columns colored white).\n\n- The entire grid is black (all rows and columns colored black).\n\nOr,\n\n- There is a subset of rows and columns colored white such that their union covers the entire grid, and no columns or rows are colored black. Similarly, for black, but we can't mix colors.\n\nWait, but actually, if we have some rows colored white and some columns colored white, their union must cover the grid. The color is white throughout. Similarly for black. So, the problem reduces to choosing a set of rows and columns (any number) colored white, such that their union covers the grid, plus the same for black. However, since we can't have both white and black in the same arrangement (because otherwise their intersections would conflict), the total number of arrangements would be the number of white-covered arrangements plus the number of black-covered arrangements.\n\nWait, but the problem allows for some cells to be white and others black as long as the row and column constraints are met. Wait, no! Wait, according to the earlier conclusion, if you have any colored rows or columns, they must all be the same color, so the entire arrangement is monochromatic. Therefore, the only possible maximal arrangements are either all white, all black, or a mixture where some rows and columns are colored white (covering the grid), or some rows and columns are colored black (covering the grid). Therefore, the total number of arrangements is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of rows and columns (for white) that cover the grid, plus the same for black, but since the color is either white or black, we have to double the count (except for the case where the entire grid is covered by both, but that's already counted). Wait, actually, no. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet me denote that for each color C (either white or black), the number of maximal arrangements of that color is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of rows and columns (each can be chosen or not) such that:\n\n1. The union of the chosen rows and columns covers the entire grid.\n\n2. The chosen rows and columns can be any subset, but their union must cover the grid.\n\nWait, actually, if we are assigning a color to some rows and columns, but all of them must be the same color. So for white arrangements, the number is the number of subsets of rows and columns (each can be selected or not) such that every cell is in at least one selected row or column. Similarly for black. Since the problem counts arrangements where all the colored rows and columns are white, and the rest are uncolored but covered by the selected rows/columns, but actually, the uncolored rows and columns must be covered by the selected ones. Therefore, for each color, the number is the number of hitting sets: the number of subsets of rows and columns that hit every cell. Since each cell must be in at least one selected row or column. \n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is 2 multiplied by the number of such subsets (for white and black). But wait, actually, for each such subset (of rows and columns covering the grid), you can choose to color them white or black, so that's 2 possibilities. However, the case where no rows or columns are selected (the empty set) does not cover the grid, so it's excluded. The case where all rows and columns are selected (the full set) is included. So the total number would be 2*(N - 1), where N is the number of subsets of rows and columns that cover the grid. Wait, no, actually, the number is 2*(number of valid subsets). Wait, actually, the empty subset doesn't count, so if the number of valid subsets (those that cover the grid) is S, then total arrangements are 2*S. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to computing S, the number of subsets of rows and columns (each can be chosen independently) such that every cell is in at least one chosen row or column. Then multiply by 2 (for white or black). However, there is an exception: the case where all rows are chosen or all columns are chosen, but they are already counted in S. \n\nWait, actually, let me clarify: Each such subset (rows and columns) defines a monochromatic arrangement (either white or black). Therefore, each subset corresponds to two arrangements (one white, one black) except for the case where the subset is empty, but the empty subset isn't counted because it doesn't cover the grid. So total arrangements are 2*(number of covering subsets). \n\nTherefore, the key is to compute S, the number of subsets of rows and columns (each can be chosen or not) such that every cell is in at least one chosen row or column. \n\nSo, how do we compute S?\n\nThis is equivalent to the number of ways to choose a subset of rows and columns such that their union covers all 25 cells. \n\nLet me denote that there are 5 rows and 5 columns. Each cell (i,j) is covered if row i is chosen or column j is chosen. \n\nWe need to count all subsets of rows and columns (each can be included or not) such that for every i,j, row i is included OR column j is included. \n\nAlternatively, the complement: the subsets that do NOT cover all cells are those where there exists at least one cell (i,j) not covered, i.e., row i not chosen AND column j not chosen. \n\nTherefore, using inclusion-exclusion, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, it's similar to the problem of covering a grid with rows and columns. Let me recall that the number of subsets of rows and columns that cover all cells is equal to the sum over k and l of (-1)^{something}, but perhaps inclusion-exclusion might get complicated here.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as each cell must be covered by at least one row or column. So for each cell (i,j), at least one of row i or column j is chosen. \n\nThis is equivalent to saying that for every pair (i,j), the row i or column j is selected. \n\nTherefore, the problem is similar to a hitting set problem where the universe is the 5x5 grid, and the sets are the rows and columns. Each row corresponds to the set of its 5 cells, each column corresponds to its 5 cells. We need the number of subsets of these row and column sets that cover the entire grid. \n\nThis is a classic problem in combinatorics. The number of such subsets can be calculated using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. \n\nAlternatively, since each cell (i,j) must be covered by at least one row or column, we can model this as the union of the selected rows and columns must equal the entire grid. \n\nLet me consider that each cell (i,j) imposes the condition that row i is selected OR column j is selected. \n\nTherefore, the total number of subsets is the product over all cells of (row i or column j must be selected). But this is not straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, think of it as follows: Let me denote the set of rows as R = {r1, r2, r3, r4, r5}, and columns as C = {c1, c2, c3, c4, c5}. Each subset is a pair (A,B) where A \u2286 R and B \u2286 C, such that for every i,j, either ri \u2208 A or cj \u2208 B. \n\nTherefore, the condition is equivalent to: For all i, if ri is not in A, then all columns cj must be in B for every j (since otherwise, if some cj is not in B, then cell (i,j) is not covered). Wait, no, that's not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose a particular row ri is not in A. Then, in order for all cells in row ri to be covered, every column cj must be in B, because otherwise, the cell (i,j) would not be covered (since row ri isn't selected and column cj isn't selected). Therefore, if a row is not selected, then all columns must be selected. Similarly, if a column is not selected, then all rows must be selected. \n\nThis is a crucial observation. Let me formalize:\n\nSuppose we have a subset of rows A and subset of columns B. The condition that every cell (i,j) is in A or B (i.e., row i \u2208 A or column j \u2208 B) is equivalent to:\n\nFor every row i not in A, all columns must be in B. Because otherwise, if there's a row i not in A and a column j not in B, then cell (i,j) is uncovered.\n\nSimilarly, for every column j not in B, all rows must be in A.\n\nTherefore, the subsets (A,B) must satisfy that:\n\nEither:\n\n1. All rows not in A have all columns in B, and all columns not in B have all rows in A. \n\nAlternatively, this can be rephrased as:\n\nEither:\n\n- All rows not in A must have B = C (all columns selected), or\n\n- All columns not in B must have A = R (all rows selected).\n\nTherefore, the only possible cases are:\n\nCase 1: All rows are selected (A = R). Then, B can be any subset of columns. Because even if some columns are not in B, since all rows are in A, every cell is covered by its row.\n\nCase 2: All columns are selected (B = C). Then, A can be any subset of rows.\n\nCase 3: Neither all rows nor all columns are selected. Then, the condition is that any row not in A must have all columns in B, and any column not in B must have all rows in A. However, since neither A = R nor B = C, there exists at least one row not in A and at least one column not in B. Let me see what this implies.\n\nSuppose there is a row i not in A and a column j not in B. But then cell (i,j) is not covered, which violates the condition. Therefore, in this case (neither A = R nor B = C), we cannot have both a row not in A and a column not in B. Therefore, either all rows not in A must have B = C (but since B is not C, this is impossible unless there are no rows not in A, which would mean A=R, contradicting the case). Alternatively, the only way this can hold is if either all rows not in A have B=C (which can't happen if B\u2260C) or all columns not in B have A=R (also can't happen if A\u2260R). Therefore, actually, there are no such subsets in this third case. Therefore, the only valid subsets are those in case 1 or case 2.\n\nWait, this is a key point. Let me rephrase:\n\nIf neither all rows are selected nor all columns are selected, then there exists at least one row not in A and at least one column not in B. But then the cell at their intersection would be uncovered, which is invalid. Therefore, such subsets cannot exist. Therefore, the only valid subsets are those where either all rows are selected (A=R) or all columns are selected (B=C). \n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me test with an example. Suppose I select all rows except row 1, and all columns except column 1. Then, the cell (1,1) would not be covered, so that's invalid. But what if I select all columns except column 1, but include row 1? Let's see: Suppose A = all rows, and B is missing column 1. Then, since all rows are included, even though column 1 isn't, all cells in column 1 are covered by their rows. So that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, suppose A is missing row 1, but B includes all columns. Then, since all columns are selected, even though row 1 is missing, all cells in row 1 are covered by their columns. \n\nBut if neither A is all rows nor B is all columns, but for example, A includes all except row 1, and B includes all except column 1, then cell (1,1) is not covered. Therefore, such a subset is invalid. \n\nTherefore, the only valid subsets are those where either A = R or B = C. \n\nWait, but in the first case, A=R, then B can be any subset of columns, since all rows are selected, so all cells are covered regardless of B. Similarly, in the second case, B=C, then A can be any subset of rows. \n\nHowever, there is an overlap when both A=R and B=C. In that case, it's counted in both cases, so we have to subtract the overlap. \n\nTherefore, by the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal subsets S = (number of subsets with A=R) + (number of subsets with B=C) - (number of subsets with both A=R and B=C)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n- Number of subsets with A=R: A is fixed as all rows. Then B can be any subset of columns (including none or all). Since there are 5 columns, there are 2^5 = 32 subsets.\n\n- Number of subsets with B=C: Similarly, B is fixed as all columns, so A can be any subset of rows. There are 2^5 = 32 subsets.\n\n- Number of subsets with both A=R and B=C: This is just 1 subset (both all rows and all columns selected).\n\nTherefore, S = 32 + 32 - 1 = 63.\n\nWait, that seems surprisingly low. Let me confirm:\n\nIf A=R (all rows selected), then B can be any subset of columns. Since the rows cover everything, the columns can be anything. So 2^5 =32.\n\nSimilarly for B=C. The overlap when both are selected is counted twice, so subtract 1. \n\nThus S=63. Therefore, the total number of maximal arrangements would be 2*S = 126? But wait, hold on. Wait, no, actually, in each of these subsets, when you choose a subset with A=R and some B, the color is either white or black. Similarly for the others. However, actually, when you choose a subset (A,B), the color is assigned to all the selected rows and columns. But since in the case where A=R, the selected rows are all, so the entire grid is covered by rows, so the color of the rows is chosen, and the columns can be any subset but their color is the same. Wait a second, actually in the problem's terms, when we choose a subset of rows and columns to color (with a single color), then the color is fixed for all those rows and columns. So each such subset corresponds to an arrangement where the selected rows and columns are colored with a chosen color (either white or black), and the rest are uncolored but their cells are covered by the selected ones. \n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is 2*(number of such subsets). Since S is 63, the total would be 126. But wait, but let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the color is chosen for the entire arrangement. For each subset (A,B) which is a covering subset (either A=R or B=C), you can choose to color them white or black. So each subset corresponds to two arrangements (white and black), except when the subset is both A=R and B=C. In that case, coloring it white or black would produce different arrangements, so it's still counted twice. \n\nTherefore, yes, the total is 2*63 = 126. But wait, but the problem states \"some of these chips\", so when A=R and B is empty, that would mean all rows are colored (so all cells are filled with the chosen color), and B is empty. So the total number of chips is 25, which is okay. Similarly, if B=C and A is empty, all columns are colored, so again all cells are filled. \n\nHowever, there's an overcounting here. Wait, let me think: For example, the case where A=R and B is all columns. That is, both all rows and all columns are selected. This is counted once in the A=R term and once in the B=C term, so when we subtracted 1 for overlap, but in terms of subsets, the subset where A=R and B=C is a single subset, but when we compute S as 32 +32 -1=63, that's correct. Then when we multiply by 2, it's 126. \n\nBut let me check with small examples. Let's consider a 1x1 grid. Then, the problem would be similar. Let's see:\n\nFor a 1x1 grid, the number of maximal arrangements should be: either color the single cell white or black, so 2. \n\nUsing the formula above:\n\nS would be the number of subsets (A,B) where A is rows (either selected or not), B is columns (same). The covering subsets must cover the single cell. The cell is covered if row is selected or column is selected. So the subsets that cover are:\n\n- A selected (row selected), B can be anything (since row covers it)\n\n- B selected (column selected), A can be anything\n\n- both selected.\n\nThus total subsets S = (2^1 for B when A is selected) + (2^1 for A when B is selected) -1 (overlap) = 2 +2 -1 =3. Then total arrangements would be 2*3=6, but actual answer is 2. So clearly my approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, so my reasoning must be flawed. Let me see where.\n\nIn the 1x1 case, according to the problem's conditions, the maximal arrangements must have the single cell filled (since otherwise you could add a chip). So there are two possibilities: white or black. But according to my previous logic, the formula gives 6, which is wrong. So my mistake must be in interpreting the subsets.\n\nWait, in the 1x1 grid:\n\nEach subset (A,B) where A is a subset of rows (either select row 1 or not), and B subset of columns (select column 1 or not). The condition is that the single cell is covered, so row selected OR column selected. The subsets that satisfy this are:\n\nAll except the subset where neither row nor column is selected. So total subsets S = total subsets -1 = 3 (since there are 2 rows and 2 columns, total subsets are 2*2=4, subtract 1 gives 3). Then multiply by 2 gives 6, but the correct answer is 2. \n\nTherefore, my approach is incorrect. The problem is that in the problem's terms, when you choose a subset of rows and columns to color (with a single color), the color must be consistent. However, in the formula above, I considered that any subset (A,B) can be colored white or black, but actually, the color assignments must be such that all selected rows and columns are the same color. Wait, but in the problem's constraints, when you choose a subset of rows and columns to color, they must all be the same color. \n\nWait, in the previous analysis, I assumed that when you choose a subset (A,B), you can assign them a color (either white or black), and the rest are uncolored. However, the uncolored rows and columns must not have any chips in their cells except those covered by the colored rows and columns. \n\nWait, actually, the problem requires that all the selected rows and columns must be colored with the same color. So for a subset (A,B), you have to choose a color (W or B), and then all selected rows and columns are assigned that color. The rest are uncolored, but their cells are covered by the colored rows or columns. \n\nTherefore, in the 1x1 case, the subsets (A,B) that cover the cell are:\n\n1. A={row1}, B any. Choosing color W: the cell is white. Choosing color B: the cell is black.\n\n2. B={col1}, A any. Choosing color W: the cell is white. Choosing color B: the cell is black.\n\n3. A={row1}, B={col1}. Choosing color W: white, color B: black.\n\nTherefore, each of the 3 subsets corresponds to two color choices (except when A and B are both selected, but even then, it's still two choices). However, when you count this way, the total is indeed 3 subsets \u00d72 colors =6, but the actual correct answer is 2. \n\nThis discrepancy arises because when both A and B are selected (the full subset), the color is determined by both the row and column, but since they must agree, there's no conflict, but in reality, choosing that subset with color W is the same as choosing the subset with just the row selected (since the cell is covered by the row). Wait, no. Actually, in the 1x1 case, selecting A={row1} and B={col1} and coloring them white is the same as just selecting A={row1} and coloring it white. Because the cell is already covered by the row. Similarly for the column. Therefore, these subsets are overcounted because different subsets can lead to the same arrangement. \n\nAh, here's the problem: different subsets can result in the same coloring. For example, in the 1x1 case:\n\n- Choosing A={row1}, B=\u2205 and coloring white gives the cell white.\n\n- Choosing A=\u2205, B={col1} and coloring white also gives the cell white.\n\n- Choosing A={row1}, B={col1} and coloring white also gives the cell white.\n\nTherefore, these three subsets all result in the same white arrangement, but in my count, they are counted as three separate subsets each contributing to white and black, leading to overcounting.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach is incorrect because different subsets can lead to the same arrangement. Hence, the problem requires counting distinct arrangements, not the number of subsets times two. \n\nTherefore, I need a different approach.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nLet me think of the colorings as follows. Since all colored rows and columns must be of the same color, let's consider the possible colorings as either all white or all black. Let's focus on white first.\n\nTo create a white arrangement, we need to choose a set of rows and columns (some or all) such that every cell is in at least one chosen row or column. Similarly for black. The total number of arrangements is then 2*(number of such subsets for white). But we must ensure that subsets that are equivalent (e.g., choosing rows or columns that cover the same cells) are not overcounted. Wait, but the subsets themselves are different even if they cover the same cells, but the resulting colorings would be the same. Wait no, actually, the subsets define the set of rows and columns that are colored white. The actual arrangement is determined by which rows and columns are chosen. For example, if I choose row 1 and column 1 for white, versus just row 1, the resulting colorings are different only if the coverage differs. Wait no, in terms of the grid's final state, if you choose row 1 and column 1, then the entire row 1 is white, and the entire column 1 is white. The intersection is already white, so the total cells colored white are row 1 (5 cells) plus column 1 excluding the intersection (4 more cells), totaling 9. Whereas if you just choose row 1, you have 5 cells. So different subsets lead to different colorings. \n\nWait, actually, each subset (A,B) where A is rows and B is columns selected for white, with the condition that their union covers the grid. Each such subset corresponds to a unique arrangement where exactly the cells in A or B are white (since any cell in a selected row or column is white). Wait, no, actually, if a cell is in both a selected row and column, it's still just white. The total white cells are the union of the selected rows and columns. So the actual coloring is the set of all cells in any selected row or column, all colored white. Similarly for black.\n\nTherefore, different subsets can lead to different colorings. For example, choosing rows 1 and columns 1 gives a different set of white cells than choosing just row 1. Therefore, the number of distinct white arrangements is exactly the number of such subsets S (as computed before 63 for 5x5), and similarly for black. Thus the total number is 2*S = 126. However, in the 1x1 case, this would give 2*(3)=6, but the correct answer is 2. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait in the 1x1 case, the subsets that cover the cell are:\n\n1. A={row}, B anything (so 2 subsets: B can be {} or {col}).\n\n2. B={col}, A anything (another 2 subsets: A can be {} or {row}).\n\n3. Subtract the overlap where A={row} and B={col}, counted twice, so total subsets S= 2+2-1=3.\n\nBut the distinct colorings for white would be:\n\n- Choosing A={row}, B={}: the cell is in row, so white.\n\n- Choosing A={}, B={col}: the cell is in column, so white.\n\n- Choosing A={row}, B={col}: the cell is in both, still white.\n\nThese are all the same in terms of the final grid (the single cell is white). Similarly, choosing any combination that covers the cell results in the cell being white. So all subsets that cover the cell correspond to the same arrangement when colored white. Therefore, the number of distinct white arrangements is 1, not 3. \n\nAh, here's the key: different subsets can lead to the same arrangement. In this case, any subset that covers the cell results in the entire cell being white, so there's only one white arrangement and one black arrangement, totaling 2. But according to the subset count, it's 3 subsets \u00d72=6, which is wrong. \n\nTherefore, my mistake was assuming that each subset corresponds to a unique arrangement, but in reality, different subsets can lead to the same arrangement. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach must account for the fact that two different subsets (A,B) and (A',B') can result in the same set of white cells if their unions are the same. \n\nHence, the problem reduces to counting the number of distinct subsets of cells that can be formed by the union of some rows and columns, and then multiplying by 2 (for white and black). But this is equivalent to counting the number of distinct unions of rows and columns, then multiplying by 2.\n\nThe question now becomes: How many distinct subsets of the 5x5 grid can be formed by the union of some subset of rows and columns?\n\nThis is a different problem. Let me think about this.\n\nIn the 1x1 case, the possible unions are:\n\n- The empty set (not covering, so invalid).\n\n- The single cell (by choosing the row, the column, or both). \n\nThus only one non-empty subset, so total arrangements 2.\n\nFor a 2x2 grid, it might be more complex. Let me see:\n\nBut perhaps there's a formula for the number of distinct unions of rows and columns in an n x n grid. \n\nI recall that this is related to the number of closed sets in a certain closure system, but I might need to think combinatorially.\n\nAlternatively, note that any union of rows and columns can be represented as the set of all cells in any of the chosen rows or columns. The distinct such sets can be characterized by specifying which rows and columns are chosen, but different choices can lead to the same set. \n\nHowever, for the purpose of counting distinct unions, note that a union is determined uniquely by the set of rows and columns chosen. Wait, no, actually different combinations can lead to the same union. For example, choosing row 1 and column 1 versus choosing row 1 and column 2 and then another combination might not, but in general it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each union corresponds uniquely to a pair (R,C) where R is the set of rows and C the set of columns, but the union is the same as R \u00d7 any column unioned with any row \u00d7 C. The problem is that different pairs (R,C) can give the same union.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of distinct unions is equal to the number of possible row and column selections where the rows and columns are chosen such that the union is exactly the set of cells in those rows or columns. \n\nBut I might need to find another way. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the problem, since we have to cover the entire grid (because of maximality), the union must be the entire grid. Wait a second! Wait a minute, no. Wait, the maximality requires that every cell is in at least one colored row or column, so the union of the chosen rows and columns must be the entire grid. Therefore, the subsets we are counting are exactly those subsets of rows and columns whose union is the entire grid. Therefore, the distinct arrangements for a single color are exactly the number of such subsets (A,B) where the union covers the grid, but considering that two different (A,B) pairs can result in the same coverage. \n\nHowever, in terms of the final arrangement, the set of white cells is exactly the union of the selected rows and columns. Therefore, two different subsets (A,B) and (A',B') will result in the same white arrangement if and only if the union of A's rows and B's columns is equal to the union of A' rows and B' columns. \n\nTherefore, the number of distinct white arrangements is equal to the number of distinct unions of rows and columns that cover the entire grid. \n\nSimilarly for black, so total arrangements would be twice that number. \n\nTherefore, the key is to compute the number of distinct subsets of the grid cells that can be formed as the union of some rows and columns, and which cover the entire grid. \n\nThis seems challenging. Let me see if there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only way to cover the grid is by choosing all rows, or all columns, or a combination where the selected rows and columns together cover everything. But how many distinct such combinations are there?\n\nWait, going back to the earlier analysis where if neither all rows nor all columns are selected, then there must be at least one row not in A and one column not in B, leading to an uncovered cell. Wait, but earlier that led us to the conclusion that only subsets where all rows are chosen or all columns are chosen are valid. But that can't be because in the 1x1 case, choosing just the row or just the column both cover the grid, so they are valid. \n\nWait in the 1x1 case, the subsets that cover are:\n\n- All rows (the single row) with any columns.\n\n- All columns (the single column) with any rows.\n\n- Both all rows and columns.\n\nBut in terms of the unions:\n\n- If you choose the row (and any columns, but columns don't matter because the row already covers it), the union is the single cell.\n\n- Similarly for the column.\n\n- Choosing both also gives the single cell.\n\nTherefore, all these subsets result in the same union (the entire grid), so they are considered the same in terms of the arrangement. Therefore, the number of distinct unions that cover the grid is 1 for 1x1.\n\nSimilarly, in the 5x5 case, perhaps the number of distinct unions that cover the grid is equal to the number of possible ways to choose between covering via rows, columns, or both? No, that can't be. \n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose in a 2x2 grid:\n\nTo cover the grid, you can choose:\n\n- All rows (2 rows), any columns.\n\n- All columns (2 columns), any rows.\n\n- Or a combination where, say, row1 and column1 and column2. That would cover everything except row2, so no. Wait, no, if you choose row1 and columns 1 and 2, then you cover row1 entirely and columns 1 and 2. So the cell (2,1) and (2,2) are covered by the columns. Thus all cells are covered. So that's a valid subset (row1 and columns 1,2). Similarly, row1 and row2 would also cover everything. \n\nTherefore, there are more subsets than just the all-rows or all-columns. \n\nTherefore, my previous conclusion was wrong. The earlier logic was flawed because it considered that if you don't choose all rows, then any missing row requires all columns to be chosen, but that's not the case. Let me re-examine that.\n\nThe condition that every cell (i,j) is in A or B (row i in A or column j in B) can be rephrased as:\n\nFor every row i not in A, every column j must be in B.\n\nSimilarly, for every column j not in B, every row i must be in A.\n\nThis means that if there is a row not in A, then all columns must be in B. Similarly, if there's a column not in B, all rows must be in A. \n\nTherefore, the possible cases are:\n\nEither:\n\n1. All rows are in A (so B can be anything).\n\n2. All columns are in B (so A can be anything).\n\n3. Neither 1 nor 2, but then there exists a row not in A and a column not in B. But according to the above condition, if there is a row not in A, then all columns must be in B. Similarly, if there is a column not in B, all rows must be in A. Therefore, the only way to have neither 1 nor 2 is if there are no rows not in A and no columns not in B, which would mean all rows are in A and all columns are in B, which is case 1 and 2 together. \n\nTherefore, the only valid subsets are those in case 1 or case 2. \n\nWait, this brings us back to the original conclusion that the only covering subsets are those where either all rows are selected or all columns are selected. \n\nBut in the 2x2 example, choosing row1 and columns 1 and 2 would satisfy the condition:\n\n- Rows not in A: row2.\n\n- Since row2 is not in A, all columns must be in B. But in this case, columns 1 and 2 are in B, so that's okay. Wait, but there are only 2 columns, so if columns 1 and 2 are in B, then all columns are in B. So this is actually case 2 (all columns are selected), since B includes all columns. \n\nAh! So in this case, choosing columns 1 and 2 (all columns) and row1 is actually case 2 (all columns selected), so B is all columns, and A can be any subset. \n\nTherefore, the example I thought of where you choose row1 and columns 1 and 2 is actually part of case 2 (since all columns are selected), so it's allowed. \n\nTherefore, my initial conclusion holds: the only valid subsets are those where either all rows are selected (so A=R, B can be anything), or all columns are selected (B=C, A can be anything). \n\nTherefore, in the 2x2 case, the number of subsets S would be:\n\n- A=R: 2^2=4 (since B can be any subset of columns).\n\n- B=C: 2^2=4 (A can be any subset of rows).\n\n- Subtract overlap (A=R and B=C):1.\n\nTotal S=4+4-1=7.\n\nThus, the number of distinct unions would be S=7? But let's see:\n\nThe distinct unions when A=R (all rows selected) can have any B. The union is all rows (so the entire grid), regardless of B. So choosing A=R and any B gives the entire grid.\n\nSimilarly, when B=C (all columns selected), any A also gives the entire grid. \n\nTherefore, all subsets in cases 1 and 2 result in the entire grid being covered. Thus, the union is always the entire grid. Therefore, the number of distinct unions that cover the grid is 1. \n\nWait a contradiction! Because according to the subset count S=7, but all those subsets correspond to the same union (the entire grid). \n\nTherefore, my earlier analysis is correct in terms of the subsets, but the unions they produce are all the entire grid. Thus, the number of distinct unions that cover the grid is 1. Hence, the number of arrangements would be 2*1=2 for the 1x1 grid, which matches. For the 2x2 grid, it would also give 2 arrangements (all white or all black), but that's not correct because in the 2x2 grid, you can have different configurations. \n\nWait, hold on. Let's think of the 2x2 grid. If I choose to color all rows (A=R), then the entire grid is white. Similarly, choosing all columns (B=C) also gives the entire grid white. Therefore, regardless of how you choose the subsets (as long as they cover the grid), the resulting arrangement is the entire grid filled with the chosen color. \n\nTherefore, for any n x n grid, the number of distinct maximal arrangements is 2: all white or all black. But that can't be right. \n\nWait, but in the problem's original conditions, the maximal arrangement requires that you can't add any more chips. If the entire grid is filled with white chips, then you can't add any more, which is maximal. Similarly for black. But what if you have a partial coverage?\n\nWait, according to the maximality condition, every empty cell must be blocked by its row or column already being colored. But if the grid is not fully covered, then there exists a cell not in any colored row or column, so you could add a chip there, which violates maximality. Therefore, the only maximal arrangements are those where the entire grid is filled with chips of a single color. \n\nWait, this seems to be the case! Because any other arrangement would leave some cells uncovered, allowing you to add a chip, hence not maximal. \n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose in a 2x2 grid, I choose to color row 1 white and column 1 white. Then the union covers:\n\n- All of row 1 (cells (1,1), (1,2))\n\n- All of column 1 (cells (1,1), (2,1))\n\nThus the covered cells are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). The cell (2,2) is not covered. Therefore, to satisfy maximality, this arrangement is invalid because you can place a chip in (2,2). Therefore, such a subset is not allowed because it doesn't cover the entire grid. \n\nTherefore, the only valid maximal arrangements are those where the union of selected rows and columns covers the entire grid, which as per the earlier analysis, requires that either all rows are selected or all columns are selected. \n\nTherefore, when all rows are selected, the union is the entire grid. Similarly, when all columns are selected, the union is also the entire grid. Any other subset that covers the grid must include all rows or all columns. \n\nTherefore, the only maximal arrangements are those where the entire grid is filled with one color. Therefore, there are only two maximal arrangements: all white or all black. \n\nBut this contradicts my initial thought that there could be other configurations. Wait, but according to the maximality condition, you must fill the entire grid. Because otherwise, there exists a cell not covered by any colored row or column, so you could add a chip there. \n\nTherefore, the only maximal arrangements are the two monochromatic colorings. \n\nBut the problem states \"some of these chips\", so perhaps using all 25 chips is allowed, which is what the monochromatic colorings do. \n\nWait, but then why did we get S=63 earlier? Because S counts all subsets where either all rows are selected or all columns are selected, but those subsets correspond to the same union (the entire grid). Therefore, the number of distinct unions is 1, leading to two arrangements. \n\nThis suggests that the answer is 2. But that seems too simple, and the problem is from a competition likely expecting a more complex answer. So I must have made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement:\n\n\"all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\"\n\nAh! Wait a second, this might not require that the entire row or column is filled, but rather that any chips in the row are the same color, and similarly for columns. \n\nOh! This is a crucial misunderstanding. \n\nPreviously, I assumed that if a row is colored, all its cells must be filled with that color. But the problem says \"all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\". \n\nThis means that in any given row, any chips present must be the same color, but the row doesn't have to be completely filled. Similarly for columns. \n\nThis changes everything. \n\nSo let me start over with this correct interpretation.\n\nThe problem allows rows and columns to be partially filled, but with all chips in a row being the same color, and all chips in a column being the same color. Additionally, the placement is maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips without violating the color conditions. \n\nThis is different from my previous interpretation where rows and columns had to be completely filled or not. \n\nOkay, let's re-analyze with this correct understanding.\n\nEach row can have 0 to 5 chips, all of the same color (or none). Similarly for each column. The placement is maximal, so for every empty cell, adding a chip of either color would violate the row or column's color constraint. \n\nTherefore, for any empty cell (i,j), either:\n\n- The row i has chips of some color, so you can't add a different color there, and you can't add the same color because the row is already that color (but maybe the row isn't full yet? Wait, no, if the row has chips of a color, you can still add more of the same color unless the row is full.\n\nWait, the maximality condition says that any additional chip would violate the conditions. So if a row has some white chips, you can add more white chips until it's full, unless that would violate the column's color constraints. \n\nThis is more complex. Let me think carefully.\n\nFor the placement to be maximal, it must be that for every empty cell (i,j), you cannot place a chip there of either color without violating the row or column constraints. \n\nTherefore, for cell (i,j):\n\n- If you try to place a white chip, then either row i already has black chips (so can't place white), or column j already has black chips (can't place white), or row i has white chips but adding another white would be allowed, but since it's maximal, that must not be possible. Wait, but adding a white chip to a row that already has white chips doesn't violate the row's color condition. Similarly for the column. \n\nTherefore, the only way you cannot place a white chip in (i,j) is if:\n\n- The row i has black chips (so can't place white),\n\n- The column j has black chips (so can't place white),\n\n- Or the row i has white chips and the column j has white chips, but the cell (i,j) is already filled (but it's empty, so that's not the case).\n\nWait, no. If row i has white chips and column j has white chips, you can place a white chip there, but since the cell is empty, you could. Therefore, to prevent that, the row or column must already have a different color, or the cell is already filled. \n\nWait, this is getting tangled. Let me think of the conditions for maximality:\n\nFor cell (i,j) to be empty, the following must hold:\n\n- If you try to place a white chip there, it must violate either the row's color or column's color. \n\n- Similarly for a black chip.\n\nTherefore, for the white chip:\n\nEither:\n\n- The row i has black chips (so can't place white),\n\n- Or the column j has black chips (can't place white),\n\n- Or the row i has white chips and the column j has white chips, but the cell is already filled (but it's empty, so this isn't the case),\n\nWait, no. If the row has white chips and the column has white chips, you can place a white chip there. Therefore, to prevent that, the cell must already have a chip, or the row or column has a conflicting color. \n\nThus, the only way to prevent placing a white chip is if either the row has black or the column has black. Similarly, to prevent placing a black chip, either the row has white or the column has white.\n\nTherefore, for the cell to be empty, both:\n\n- The row i has a color different from white (either black or empty),\n\n- And the column j has a color different from white,\n\nOR\n\n- The row i has a color different from black,\n\n- And the column j has a color different from black.\n\nWait, this seems too vague. Let me formalize:\n\nTo block placing a white chip in (i,j):\n\nEither row i has a non-white color (black or empty), or column j has a non-white color (black or empty). But if the row is empty and the column is empty, then you can place a white chip, which would violate maximality. Therefore, to block white placement, the row or column must have a color that conflicts (black), or one of them is non-empty with a different color.\n\nWait, this is complicated. Perhaps a better way is:\n\nFor cell (i,j) to be empty, it must be that:\n\n- The row i has chips of color C1 (could be W or B), and the column j has chips of color C2 (could be W or B), and C1 \u2260 C2. Because if they are the same, then you could place a chip of that color there. \n\nAlternatively, if the row has no chips and the column has no chips, then you could place any color there, so to be maximal, the cell must be filled. \n\nTherefore, the only way a cell can be empty is if its row and column are both non-empty but of different colors. \n\nAdditionally, any row or column that is non-empty must have all its chips of the same color. \n\nTherefore, the entire grid must be partitioned into regions where:\n\n- Each row is either empty or has a single color.\n\n- Each column is either empty or has a single color.\n\n- Any cell where both row and column are non-empty must have the same color as both.\n\n- All other cells (where at least one of row or column is empty) can be filled or not, but in the maximal case, they must be filled if possible. Wait, no, in the maximal case, every empty cell must be blocked by the row or column having conflicting colors. \n\nWait, let me rephrase the conditions for maximality:\n\nThe placement is maximal if:\n\n1. Every cell that is empty must have its row and column both non-empty and of different colors. Because if either the row or column is empty, you could place a chip of any color there (since the row/column can then be set to that color), which would violate maximality. \n\n2. Every cell that is filled has the same color as its row and column (if they are non-empty).\n\nTherefore, the entire grid must satisfy:\n\n- For every row: either empty, or all its filled cells are the same color (W or B).\n\n- For every column: similarly.\n\n- For any cell (i,j):\n\n   - If both row i and column j are non-empty, then they must have the same color.\n\n   - If either row i or column j is empty, then the cell (i,j) must be filled (otherwise you could add a chip there, since the empty row/column could be assigned the chip's color).\n\nWait, yes! Because if a cell is empty and, say, its row is empty, then you could place a chip there of any color, setting the row to that color. Hence, to be maximal, such a cell must be filled. \n\nTherefore, the conditions are:\n\n1. Each row is either:\n\n   a. Empty (no chips),\n\n   b. All chips in the row are the same color (W or B),\n\n2. Each column is similarly either empty or all chips same color.\n\n3. For any cell (i,j):\n\n   a. If row i and column j are both non-empty, then their colors must match.\n\n   b. If row i is empty or column j is empty, then the cell (i,j) must be filled with the color of the non-empty row/column (if one is non-empty), or must be filled with any color (but since it must be maximal, but both are empty, it must be filled? Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, if both the row and column are empty, then the cell can be filled with any color, but to make the arrangement maximal, it must be filled. Because otherwise, you could add a chip there. Hence, such cells must be filled. \n\nTherefore, in summary:\n\nThe grid must be filled completely, with the following properties:\n\n- Each row is either empty or monochromatic.\n\n- Each column is either empty or monochromatic.\n\n- For any cell (i,j):\n\n   - If row i and column j are both non-empty, their colors must match.\n\n   - If exactly one of row i or column j is non-empty, the cell must be filled with the color of the non-empty one.\n\n   - If both are empty, the cell must be filled with any color, but since it's part of the grid, but the color must be consistent with some assignment? Wait, this is getting too tangled.\n\nPerhaps the only way this works is that the entire grid is partitioned into rows and columns with colors such that wherever a row and column intersect, their colors agree, and all cells are filled. \n\nLet me consider that the grid is colored such that:\n\n- Each row is assigned a color (W, B, or E).\n\n- Each column is assigned a color (W, B, or E).\n\n- For any cell (i,j), if the row color is C1 and column color is C2, then:\n\n   - If C1 and C2 are both non-E, they must be equal.\n\n   - The cell's color is C1 if C1 is non-E, else C2 if C2 is non-E, else arbitrary? Wait, but must be filled.\n\nActually, the cell must be filled with the color of the row if the row is non-E, else the column's color if the column is non-E, else it can be any color but must be filled. However, since we have to choose chips, and the colors must be consistent, perhaps the only way is that all non-E rows and columns must agree on their colors where they intersect.\n\nThis is similar to the earlier analysis, but now allowing rows and columns to be partially filled, but in reality, to satisfy the maximality, every cell must be filled. Because if a row is non-E, then all its cells must be filled with its color (since otherwise, you could add a chip of that color to an empty cell in the row, but the row is already colored, so you can add more). Wait, no.\n\nWait, if a row is colored W, but has some empty cells, then you can add more W chips to those cells, which would not violate the color condition. Therefore, to be maximal, the row must be completely filled with W. Similarly for columns. \n\nAh! This is the key point. \n\nIf a row is non-empty (i.e., has at least one chip), then it must be completely filled with chips of a single color. Otherwise, you could add more chips of that color, violating maximality. \n\nSimilarly, a column that has at least one chip must be completely filled with that color. \n\nTherefore, the conditions are:\n\n- Each row is either empty or completely filled with a single color (W or B).\n\n- Each column is either empty or completely filled with a single color (W or B).\n\n- Additionally, for any cell (i,j), if both row i and column j are non-empty, their colors must be the same.\n\n- The arrangement is maximal, so every cell is filled (since otherwise, if a cell is empty, either its row or column must be empty, but then you could fill it with the row/column's color if one is non-empty, or any color if both are empty, contradicting maximality).\n\nTherefore, the entire grid must be filled, with each row and column either entirely W, entirely B, or empty, but with the constraint that whenever a row and column are both non-empty, they must share the same color. \n\nFurthermore, since the grid is entirely filled, every cell is in at least one non-empty row or column. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to color the rows and columns with colors W, B, or E (empty), such that:\n\n1. For every row and column, if they are non-empty, they are colored W or B.\n\n2. For any cell (i,j), if row i and column j are both non-empty, their colors must be equal.\n\n3. Every cell is in at least one non-empty row or column (since the grid is filled).\n\n4. The total number of W chips (the number of W rows plus W columns minus overlaps) must be \u226425, and similarly for B. But since the grid has 25 cells and all are filled, the total W chips plus B chips equals 25. Since W and B are each \u226425, this is automatically satisfied as long as the counts are non-negative.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of such colorings of rows and columns with the above constraints, where each row and column is assigned a color (W, B, or E), such that:\n\n- For any row i and column j, if both are non-E, then their colors are equal.\n\n- Every cell (i,j) is in at least one non-E row or column.\n\nAdditionally, the assignments must use the chips: each W row contributes 5 W chips, each B row similarly, and similarly for columns. However, overlaps where a cell is in both a W row and W column don't add extra chips, since it's already counted.\n\nWait, actually, the total number of W chips is equal to the number of rows colored W multiplied by 5 plus the number of columns colored W multiplied by (5 - number of rows colored W). Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nEach cell (i,j) is in a row and column. If the row is colored W and the column is colored W, then the cell is W. If the row is W and the column is E, then the cell is W (since the column is empty, so the row's color determines it). Similarly, if the column is W and the row is E, the cell is W. If both are W, still W. If one is B and the other E, etc.\n\nActually, the color of each cell is determined by the following:\n\n- If the row is non-E, the cell's color is the row's color.\n\n- Else if the column is non-E, the cell's color is the column's color.\n\n- Else, the cell can be colored arbitrarily, but since the grid must be filled, but both row and column are E, so the cell must be filled with some color. However, in our constraints, this case cannot occur because every cell must be in at least one non-E row or column. \n\nTherefore, every cell's color is determined by its row's color if non-E, else by its column's color. Additionally, whenever both row and column are non-E, their colors must be equal.\n\nTherefore, the coloring is consistent if and only if for any two non-E rows and columns, their colors agree wherever they intersect. \n\nThis is equivalent to the following: \n\nAll non-E rows must have the same color.\n\nAll non-E columns must have the same color.\n\nMoreover, if there are both non-E rows and non-E columns, their colors must be the same.\n\nTherefore, the possible colorings are as follows:\n\nCase 1: All non-E rows are W, and all non-E columns are W.\n\nCase 2: All non-E rows are W, and all non-E columns are E (columns can be E).\n\nCase 3: All non-E rows are E, and all non-E columns are W.\n\nCase 4: All non-E rows are B, and all non-E columns are B.\n\nCase 5: All non-E rows are B, and all non-E columns are E.\n\nCase 6: All non-E rows are E, and all non-E columns are B.\n\nAdditionally, there are cases where both rows and columns are E, but that would leave the grid unfilled (since every cell would require at least one non-E row or column), so those are invalid.\n\nWait, let's structure it better.\n\nLet me consider the possible color assignments:\n\nLet R be the set of non-E rows, and C the set of non-E columns.\n\nThe colors of the rows in R must all be the same, say color X (W or B).\n\nThe colors of the columns in C must all be the same, say color Y (W or B).\n\nAdditionally, if both R and C are non-empty, then X must equal Y.\n\nTherefore, the possible scenarios are:\n\n1. All non-E rows are color X (W or B), and all non-E columns are color X (if any).\n\n2. All non-E rows are color X, and all non-E columns are E.\n\n3. All non-E columns are color Y, and all non-E rows are E.\n\n4. All non-E rows and columns are E, but this is invalid since then every cell would be in an E row and E column, so they must be filled, but there's no color assigned, so this is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the valid colorings are the first three cases.\n\nCase 1: Rows and columns (non-E ones) are all color X (W or B).\n\nCase 2: Rows are color X, columns are E.\n\nCase 3: Columns are color Y, rows are E.\n\nNow, we need to count the number of such colorings.\n\nFirst, note that in each case, the choice of which rows and columns are non-E must satisfy that every cell is in at least one non-E row or column.\n\nLet's handle each case separately.\n\nCase 1: All non-E rows are color X, and all non-E columns are color X (if any). \n\nAdditionally, every cell must be in a non-E row or column.\n\nLet me denote that in this case, the non-E rows and columns can be any subset, but they must cover the grid. Also, the rows and columns must be colored X.\n\nThe color X can be W or B, so we have two possibilities here.\n\nFirst, choose X (W or B).\n\nThen choose a subset of rows R and a subset of columns C such that:\n\n- All rows in R are color X.\n\n- All columns in C are color X.\n\n- For any cell (i,j), if row i is not in R and column j is not in C, then the cell would have to be covered by either a row or column, but since both are E, this is invalid. Therefore, the union of R and C must cover all cells, i.e., for every (i,j), row i \u2208 R or column j \u2208 C.\n\nAdditionally, the colors of rows not in R are E, columns not in C are E.\n\nTherefore, the number of such colorings for a fixed X is equal to the number of pairs (R,C) where R is a subset of rows, C is a subset of columns, and R \u00d7 columns \u222a rows \u00d7 C covers the grid (i.e., for every cell (i,j), row i \u2208 R or column j \u2208 C).\n\nThis is the same as the earlier problem of covering the grid with rows and columns, which we determined has S subsets for each color. Wait, but in this case, the count for each X is S, where S is the number of covering subsets (R,C). As before, S = 32 +32 -1 =63 for each color.\n\nBut since we have two choices for X (W or B), this case contributes 2\u00d763 =126.\n\nCase 2: Rows are color X (W or B), columns are all E.\n\nHere, all non-E rows are color X, and all columns are E.\n\nThe rows must form a subset R, and the columns are all E (so C=\u2205).\n\nAdditionally, the union of rows R must cover the grid (since columns are all E, so every cell must be in a row from R).\n\nTherefore, R must be a subset of rows such that every column has at least one row in R (since for any column j, every cell (i,j) must be in a row in R or column j in C (but C is empty), so must be in R).\n\nWait, no. For column j to be covered, every cell in column j must be in a row of R. Since column j is E, the requirement is that every cell in column j must be in a row from R. Therefore, the rows in R must cover all columns. \n\nWait, more precisely, for every column j and row i not in R, the cell (i,j) must be covered by a column in C, but C is empty. Therefore, row i must be in R. Wait no:\n\nWait, in this case, columns are all E, so to cover every cell (i,j), since the column is E, the row i must be in R (non-E), otherwise, the cell would be in an E row and E column, which is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the rows R must include all rows except possibly some, but every row not in R would leave their cells uncovered (since columns are E). Therefore, R must be all rows. \n\nWait, no, let me think again:\n\nIf we choose rows R (non-E) colored X, and columns are all E (C=\u2205).\n\nThen, for every cell (i,j), since the column j is E, the cell must be covered by row i \u2208 R. Therefore, every row must be in R; otherwise, any row not in R would have all its cells uncovered (since columns are E). \n\nTherefore, in this case, R must be all rows. \n\nTherefore, the only possibility here is R = all rows, and C=\u2205, with color X (W or B). \n\nTherefore, there are 2 colorings here (W or B).\n\nSimilarly for Case 3:\n\nCase 3: Columns are color Y (W or B), rows are all E.\n\nSimilarly, the columns must form a subset C such that every row is covered by C.\n\nThat is, for every row i, there must be at least one column in C to cover the cells in that row. Since rows are all E (R=\u2205), every cell (i,j) must be covered by column j \u2208 C. Therefore, the columns C must cover all rows, meaning every row has at least one column in C. \n\nWait, more precisely, for every row i and column j not in C, the cell (i,j) must be covered by row i \u2208 R (but R is empty), so must be in column j \u2208 C. Therefore, for every row i, every cell in that row must be in a column of C. Therefore, the columns C must include at least one column from each row? No, actually, the columns must cover all the rows in the sense that for any cell (i,j), if column j is not in C, then row i must be in R (which is empty). Therefore, every column not in C would leave the entire column uncovered, so all columns must be in C. \n\nWait, similar to the previous case:\n\nIf columns are non-E (color Y) and rows are all E (R=\u2205), then every cell must be in a column of C. Therefore, every column must be in C, so C must be all columns. \n\nTherefore, the only possibility is C=all columns, R=\u2205, with color Y (W or B). \n\nThus, 2 colorings here.\n\nTherefore, total for all cases:\n\nCase1: 126\n\nCase2:2\n\nCase3:2\n\nTotal:126+2+2=130.\n\nBut wait, let me verify:\n\nIn Case1, when we have both rows and columns colored X, we have S=63 subsets for each color, so 2\u00d763=126.\n\nCase2 and Case3 each contribute 2, so total 130.\n\nBut we must ensure that there is no overlap between the cases. \n\nFor example, if R=all rows and C=all columns with the same color, this is counted in Case1. It is also part of the subsets where R=all rows and C=all columns, which is included in S for that color.\n\nTherefore, no overlap.\n\nAdditionally, check the 1x1 case with this method:\n\nFor a 1x1 grid:\n\nCase1: X can be W or B. The subsets (R,C) must cover the cell. As before, S=3 for each color. So 2\u00d73=6.\n\nCase2: R=all rows (only 1 row), C=\u2205. So 2 colorings.\n\nCase3: C=all columns (only 1 column), R=\u2205. 2 colorings.\n\nTotal:6+2+2=10. But the correct answer should be 2. Clearly, something is wrong.\n\nHmm, this suggests my analysis is still incorrect.\n\nWait in the 1x1 case:\n\nThe possible valid colorings must be:\n\nEither:\n\n- All cells (the single cell) is W or B (Case1 with R=all rows and C=all columns, or R=all rows or C=all columns).\n\n- Or, according to Case2 and Case3:\n\nCase2: R=all rows (so the cell is W or B), and C=\u2205. This is the same as coloring the cell via the row.\n\nCase3: C=all columns (same cell via column). \n\nTherefore, in total:\n\nCase1 includes:\n\n- Choosing R and C such that they cover the cell. The subsets are:\n\n   a. R={row}, any C (including \u2205). So for each color, 2 subsets (C can be \u2205 or {col}).\n\n   b. C={col}, any R (including \u2205). So another 2 subsets.\n\n   c. Subtract overlap where R and C are both {row} and {col}, counted twice.\n\nThus for each color, S=2+2-1=3. So Case1 gives 3\u00d72=6.\n\nCase2 and Case3 each give 2, so total 10. But the correct answer is 2.\n\nThis indicates the approach is still flawed.\n\nThe problem is that different subsets in Case1 can lead to the same coloring. For example, in Case1 for W:\n\n- Choosing R={row}, C={col} (both selected) results in the cell being W.\n\n- Choosing R={row}, C=\u2205 also results in the cell being W (since the row is W).\n\n- Choosing R=\u2205, C={col} also results in W.\n\nThese are all the same coloring. Thus, in the count for Case1, each color has S=3 subsets but they all result in the same coloring for that color. So instead of 3\u00d72=6, it should be 2 (one for W, one for B).\n\nTherefore, my mistake is that in Case1, the number of colorings per color is not S but 1. Because any subset (R,C) that covers the grid with color X results in the entire grid being X, since wherever you have a row or column in R/C, they are X, and their union covers everything, so every cell is X.\n\nWait, yes! If in Case1, all non-E rows and columns are color X, and their union covers the grid, then every cell is in at least one non-E row or column, so each cell's color is X. Hence, the entire grid is monochromatic X. Therefore, for each color X, there is only one such coloring (all cells X). The subsets (R,C) that cover the grid in Case1 all result in the same monochromatic grid. Therefore, for each color, Case1 contributes 1 coloring.\n\nSimilarly, in the 1x1 case, Case1 for W contributes 1 coloring (all W), and similarly for B.\n\nCase2 and Case3 in the 1x1 case:\n\nCase2 requires R=all rows (so the cell is W or B) and C=\u2205. This results in the cell being W or B, same as the monochromatic colorings. But these are already counted in Case1.\n\nAh! Here's the overlap. Case2 and Case3 are subsets of Case1.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Case2 (all rows colored X, columns E) is a subset of Case1 where C=\u2205. But in this scenario, since R=all rows (to cover the grid), this results in the entire grid being X, same as Case1.\n\nSimilarly, Case3 is the same as choosing C=all columns and R=\u2205, which also results in the entire grid being Y.\n\nTherefore, the cases overlap, and we are overcounting.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is:\n\nThe only valid colorings are:\n\n1. The entire grid is monochromatic (all W or all B).\n\n2. Some rows are colored W and the rest are E, with no columns colored, provided the rows cover the grid. But this requires all rows are colored (since otherwise, the columns are E, so uncovered rows would leave cells uncovered). Thus this is the same as monochromatic.\n\n3. Similarly for columns.\n\nTherefore, the only valid maximal arrangements are the two monochromatic colorings. \n\nThis brings us back to the initial conclusion of 2, but that contradicts the problem's complexity. \n\nHowever, in the problem statement, it says \"any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions\". \n\nWait, if the grid is not fully filled, then you can add a chip, but in our analysis, the maximality requires that every cell is filled. \n\nTherefore, the only maximal arrangements are the two monochromatic colorings. \n\nBut this seems too simple, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's consider an example of a non-monochromatic maximal arrangement.\n\nSuppose in a 2x2 grid:\n\n- Color the first row white and the first column black.\n\nBut this would conflict at cell (1,1), since the row is white and column is black. Hence invalid.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- Color the first row white and the second column black. Then:\n\nRow1 is white (cells (1,1), (1,2) are white).\n\nColumn2 is black (cells (1,2), (2,2) are black).\n\nConflict at (1,2): must be both white and black. Invalid.\n\nAnother try:\n\nColor row1 white and column2 white. Then:\n\nRow1: cells (1,1), (1,2) white.\n\nColumn2: cells (1,2), (2,2) white.\n\nThe cell (2,1) must be covered by row2 or column1. If row2 and column1 are empty, then cell (2,1) must be filled, but its row and column are empty, so you could choose any color. To be maximal, it must be filled. Suppose we color it white. Then the entire grid is white. \n\nAlternatively, if row2 is empty and column1 is empty, then cell (2,1) must be filled with any color, but choosing a different color would violate the maximality because you could change it. Wait, no. The color must be consistent with row and column. Since row2 and column1 are empty, the cell can be colored arbitrarily, but once colored, it must not allow further additions. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Perhaps the only way to satisfy all conditions is to have the entire grid monochromatic. \n\nGiven the problem's requirement that any chip addition would violate the conditions, and that each row and column must be monochromatic or empty, the only way to prevent adding any chips is to have every row and column fully filled with a single color, and all rows and columns agree on that color. \n\nTherefore, the only maximal arrangements are the two monochromatic colorings. \n\nHence, the answer would be 2. But this seems unlikely for a problem that specifies a 5x5 grid and gives a large number of chips. \n\nWait, perhaps there's another way. Suppose some rows are white and some columns are black, but arranged so that their intersections are empty. \n\nFor example, suppose we have two white rows and three black columns arranged such that their intersections are empty. \n\nLet me try with a 2x2 grid:\n\nLet rows 1 be white, column 2 be black. \n\nThen:\n\n- Row1 must be entirely white: cells (1,1) and (1,2) white.\n\n- Column2 must be entirely black: cells (1,2) and (2,2) black.\n\nConflict at (1,2). Not possible.\n\nAnother idea: have some rows white and some columns black, but their intersections are not part of the grid. Not possible in a square grid.\n\nAlternatively, have some rows white and some columns empty, and some columns black and some rows empty, such that the non-overlapping parts are filled appropriately.\n\nWait, suppose in a 2x2 grid:\n\n- Row1 is white, column1 is black.\n\n- The intersection (1,1) would have to be both white and black, impossible.\n\nAlternatively, have row1 white, column2 empty.\n\nThen:\n\n- Row1: cells (1,1), (1,2) white.\n\n- Column2 is empty, so cells (2,2) must be covered by row2. If row2 is empty, then cell (2,2) must be filled, but row2 and column2 are empty, so it can be any color. To be maximal, it must be filled, but choosing white or black would allow adding another color?\n\nWait, this is too convoluted. Given the time I've spent and the risk of further confusion, perhaps the correct answer is 2, but I recall that in similar problems, the answer often involves 2^(n+1) -2 or something similar. \n\nWait, let's think differently. Suppose that the rows and columns can be independently chosen to be white, black, or empty, with the constraints that whenever a row and column are both non-empty, they agree. Also, every cell must be covered by at least one non-empty row or column.\n\nThis is equivalent to choosing a color for each row and column (including E), such that for all i,j:\n\n- If row i and column j are non-E, then row i's color = column j's color.\n\n- Every cell (i,j) is covered by at least one non-E row or column.\n\nLet me denote that all non-E rows and columns must have the same color, say X (W or B). \n\nTherefore, the possible scenarios are:\n\n1. All non-E rows and columns are white.\n\n2. All non-E rows and columns are black.\n\n3. All non-E rows are white and all non-E columns are E (so columns are E).\n\n4. All non-E columns are white and all non-E rows are E.\n\nSimilarly for black.\n\nAdditionally, the non-E rows and columns must cover the grid.\n\nCase1 and 2 are when there are non-E rows and columns of the same color.\n\nCases3 and 4 are when only rows or only columns are non-E.\n\nLet me count each case:\n\nCase1: All non-E rows and columns are white.\n\nChoose a subset R of rows and subset C of columns, all colored white, such that every cell is in R or C.\n\nThe number of such pairs (R,C) is S=32+32-1=63 (as before), but each corresponds to the same coloring where all covered cells are white. However, the actual distinct colorings are determined by the regions:\n\nWait no, the coloring is such that all cells in R or C are white, and the rest must be filled by the other direction? No, no. Since the non-E rows and columns are white, every cell in a white row or white column is white. Since they cover the grid, all cells are white. Therefore, this case contributes only 1 coloring (all white).\n\nSimilarly, Case2 contributes 1 (all black).\n\nCase3: All non-E rows are white, columns are E.\n\nHere, the rows must form a subset R such that every column is covered by R (since columns are E, so every cell must be in a row of R). Therefore R must cover all columns, which requires R to be all rows. \n\nTherefore, this case contributes 1 coloring (all white).\n\nSimilarly, Case4 contributes 1 (all black).\n\nSimilarly for the analogous cases with black rows and E columns, etc.\n\nWait, so total:\n\n- All white: can be achieved via Case1 (any R,C covering) or Case3 (R=all rows).\n\nBut in reality, both Case1 and Case3 result in all white. Therefore, they are overlapping.\n\nSimilarly for black.\n\nTherefore, the total distinct colorings are:\n\n- All white (1 way).\n\n- All black (1 way).\n\n- Additionally, arrangements where only rows are non-E (but not all) but this would require that the rows cover the grid, which requires all rows to be chosen (as in Case3).\n\nSimilarly for columns.\n\nHence, only two colorings.\n\nTherefore, the answer must be 2. But the problem mentions \"some of the chips\", implying that not all must be used. But according to maximality, all must be used.\n\nHence, the answer is 2.\n\nBut I'm unsure because the problem might have other solutions. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another possibility: suppose some rows are white and some columns are white, but not all, such that their union covers the grid. For example, in a 5x5 grid, choose rows 1-3 as white and columns 4-5 as white. Their union covers the grid. The color of all cells in these rows or columns is white. The remaining cells (rows 4-5 and columns 1-3) are not in any non-E row or column, which violates maximality because those cells must be filled. Since their rows and columns are empty, they must be filled with any color, but to be maximal, they must be filled with white or black such that no further chips can be added.\n\nWait, but if the remaining cells are in rows 4-5 and columns 1-3, which are empty, you could choose to fill them with black. Then the rows 4-5 would be non-E (black) and columns 1-3 would be non-E (black). However, this would require that all non-E rows (4-5) and columns (1-3) are black, and their intersection must agree. The intersection of rows4-5 and columns1-3 would be black, which is okay. \n\nThis way, the entire grid is partitioned into white rows 1-3 and white columns 4-5, and black rows4-5 and columns1-3. But the overlapping region at rows4-5 and columns4-5 must be black (due to rows) and white (due to columns), which is a conflict. \n\nTherefore, this is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, if you set the remaining cells to white, then rows4-5 and columns1-3 would be non-E but their cells are white, so their color must be white. But then rows4-5 are non-E (since they have white chips), so their color must be white, and columns1-3's non-E must also be white. Therefore, all non-E rows and columns are white, which means the entire grid is white. \n\nThus, any such attempt results in the entire grid being monochromatic.\n\nTherefore, I think the only maximal arrangements are the two monochromatic colorings. Hence, the answer is 2.\n\nBut the problem states \"some of these chips\" implying that not all chips need to be used. However, in a maximal arrangement, all cells must be filled (as otherwise you could add a chip), so all 25 chips must be used. Since there are 25 white and 25 black chips available, this is possible for both colors. Hence, the answer is 2.\n\nBut the problem might be expecting more, perhaps considering that rows and columns can be partially filled but with the maximality condition. But based on the analysis, it's only two ways.\n\nWait, let me think of another possibility:\n\nSuppose we have some rows colored white and some columns colored black, arranged so that their intersections are empty. For example, in a 5x5 grid:\n\n- Color the first 3 rows white.\n\n- Color the last 3 columns black.\n\nThe intersection of the first 3 rows and last 3 columns is a 3x3 grid where the rows want white and columns want black\u2014conflict. So that's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, color rows 1-2 white and columns 4-5 black. Their intersection is rows1-2, columns4-5 which must be both white and black\u2014conflict.\n\nAnother idea: color some rows white and some columns black, but ensure that their intersections are covered by other rows or columns.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Rows 1-2 white.\n\n- Columns 3-5 black.\n\n- Rows 3-5 and columns 1-2 must be empty, but then the cells in rows3-5, columns1-2 must be filled since their rows and columns are empty. But those cells can be colored arbitrarily, but choosing white or black would create a conflict.\n\nSuppose you color those cells white:\n\n- Then rows3-5 have white chips (so they must be colored white), conflicting with their columns1-2 which are empty.\n\nWait, this is too confusing. I think the only possible solutions are the two monochromatic colorings. Therefore, the answer is 2.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. The problem might allow for a checkerboard pattern? Let me see.\n\nSuppose alternating colors in rows and columns such that every row and column is monochromatic but alternating colors. However, this would require that adjacent rows and columns have different colors, leading to conflicts at intersections. For example, row1 white, row2 black, etc. Then column1 white, column2 black, etc. The cell (1,1) would be white (row1) and white (column1), okay. Cell (1,2) white (row1) vs column2 black\u2014conflict.\n\nThus impossible.\n\nTherefore, I think the only valid maximal arrangements are the two monochromatic colorings. Hence, the answer is 2. \n\nBut the problem might have a different answer. Alternatively, perhaps the rows and columns can be set to E in a way that allows partial filling without conflicts.\n\nWait, another approach:\n\nThe problem requires that all chips in the same row/column have the same color, but doesn't require the entire row/column to be filled. Maximality requires that you can't add any more chips without violating the color condition.\n\nSuppose we have some rows colored white and some columns colored black, such that their intersections are empty. For example:\n\n- Rows 1-2 are white (so all their cells are white).\n\n- Columns 4-5 are black (so all their cells are black).\n\n- The remaining cells (rows3-5, columns1-3) must be filled with some color, but since their rows and columns are empty, they can be colored arbitrarily, but must be filled.\n\nTo maintain maximality, these remaining cells must be filled in such a way that you can't add any more chips.\n\nSuppose we color those cells white. Then rows3-5 have white chips, so they must be colored white. Thus rows3-5 are white. The columns1-3 have white chips, so they must be colored white. Thus columns1-3 are white. \n\nNow, the columns4-5 are black, which conflicts with rows1-2 at columns4-5 (which should be white due to rows, but black due to columns). \n\nConflict at cells (1,4), (1,5), etc.\n\nTherefore, this is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, color the remaining cells black:\n\nThen rows3-5 have black chips (so must be black), columns1-3 have black chips (so must be black). Now columns1-3 are black and columns4-5 are black. Rows1-2 are white and rows3-5 are black. \n\nThe intersections between rows1-2 and columns1-3 must be white (due to rows) but black (due to columns)\u2014conflict.\n\nThus, impossible.\n\nTherefore, no such arrangement is possible.\n\nHence, the only maximal arrangements are the two monochromatic colorings.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{2}.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem requires finding the number of ways to place chips on a 5x5 grid such that each row and column is monochromatic or empty, and the placement is maximal (no additional chips can be placed without violating the conditions). \n\nKey steps:\n1. **Maximality Condition**: Every cell must be filled because an empty cell could otherwise have a chip placed, violating maximality.\n2. **Color Consistency**: If a row and column intersect, their colors must agree if both are non-empty.\n3. **Monochromatic Requirement**: The only way to satisfy all conditions is if the entire grid is filled with a single color (white or black).

      "full_content": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. Hmm, so we have a 5x5 grid, and we need to place some white and black chips such that each cell has at most one chip. The conditions are:\n\n1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.\n2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.\n3. The placement must be maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips without violating the first two conditions.\n4. We have 25 white and 25 black chips available, but we can use some of them.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The first thing I notice is that each row must be entirely one color or empty. Similarly, each column must be entirely one color or empty. But since the placement has to be maximal, that means that for every row and column, if you could add a chip without breaking the color condition, you must have already placed it. Wait, actually, the maximality condition here is that adding any chip would violate either the row or column color condition. So, for a row, if it's not completely filled with chips of one color, then adding a chip to that row would require that the entire row is already of that color. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me think: To satisfy the first two conditions, each row must be either entirely white, entirely black, or empty. Similarly, each column must be entirely white, entirely black, or empty. But the combination of rows and columns has to be such that their intersection also satisfies the color condition. For instance, if a row is white, then every column that intersects this row must either be white or have the cell in that row already occupied by white. Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nLet me consider the grid's rows and columns. Since each row must be a single color or empty, and each column must also be a single color or empty, the colors of the rows and columns must be compatible. Let me think of the grid as a matrix where each row is either white, black, or empty, and each column is also white, black, or empty. However, whenever a cell is occupied, its row's color and column's color must agree. So, for example, if a cell is in a white row and a white column, that's okay. But if a cell is in a white row and a black column, that can't happen because the cell can't be both colors. Therefore, the rows and columns must be colored in such a way that for any row and column, their intersection is only allowed if their colors are the same. Wait, actually, more precisely, the color of the row and the color of the column must be the same for every cell where they intersect. So if a row is white, then all columns that intersect with this row must either also be white or have that cell not occupied. Hmm, but since the placement is maximal, if a row is white, then every column that intersects it must already have their cells in that row as white. Wait, maybe I need to formalize this.\n\nLet me denote for each row, its color as either W, B, or E (empty). Similarly, each column has a color W, B, or E. The constraints are that for every cell (i,j), if row i is colored (not E) and column j is colored (not E), then they must have the same color. Moreover, if a row is colored, then all cells in that row must be filled with that color. Similarly, if a column is colored, all cells in that column must be filled with that color. Wait, actually, maybe that's the case. Because if the row is colored white, then all cells in that row must be white chips. Similarly, if a column is colored black, all cells in that column must be black. But then, the color assignments for rows and columns have to be compatible so that their intersections don't conflict.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to model this as follows: Let me consider that each row can be in one of three states: white, black, or empty. Similarly, each column can be in one of three states. However, whenever a row is colored (not empty), all its cells must be of that color, and similarly for the columns. But the key is that for any cell (i,j), if both row i and column j are non-empty, they must be the same color. Additionally, the placement is maximal, so that you can't add any more chips. That would mean that for any cell that is empty, either its row is empty, or its column is empty, or the row and column are of different colors (so you can't place a chip there without conflicting). Wait, actually, let me think again.\n\nThe maximality condition implies that for every empty cell, there is no way to add a chip there without violating the color constraints. So, if a cell is empty, then either its row is already non-empty (so the row's color is fixed, so you can't put a different color there), or its column is already non-empty (same logic), or both the row and column are non-empty but of different colors (so you can't put a chip there without conflicting), or both row and column are empty, but then you could add a chip of any color, so in that case, the cell must actually be filled? Wait, no. Wait, if both the row and column are empty, then you can add a chip there, so to satisfy maximality, that cell must already be filled. Hmm, so perhaps the only way for a cell to be empty is that either the row is non-empty (so the row's color is set, so you can't put a different color in the cell) or the column is non-empty (same), or both are non-empty but conflicting. But if the row and column are both empty, then you could add a chip there, so to be maximal, you must have filled it. Therefore, in such a case, the cell must be filled with any color, but since the row and column are empty, you could choose a color, but then that would set the row and column's color. Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal condition requires that for every empty cell, at least one of its row or column is already non-empty (and of some color). Because otherwise, if both row and column are empty, you could place a chip there, so you must have already placed one. Therefore, every empty cell must have its row or column already colored (so that you can't add a chip there without conflicting). Therefore, the only empty cells are those where either the row is colored (so you can't put a different color there) or the column is colored (same) or both are colored but of different colors (so you can't put any color there). \n\nTherefore, to model this, let me think of the grid as being determined by the colors of each row and column, with the constraints that whenever a row and column are both colored, they must be the same color in their intersection. Wait, actually, if a row is colored white, then all the columns that intersect it must either be white or not colored (but then the columns could be colored later, but not in the same cell). Hmm, maybe this is getting too convoluted. Maybe a better approach is to consider that the grid must be partitioned into regions where rows and columns are colored, and their intersections must agree. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a matrix where each row is either white, black, or empty, and each column is similarly, such that whenever a row and column are both non-empty, their colors must agree. Moreover, the placement is maximal, so that every cell that is not filled must be blocked by either its row or column already being set to a color different from what could be placed there. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key idea is that the set of rows and columns that are colored must form a \"monochromatic\" configuration where their colors agree on overlaps, and all other cells are blocked by either their row or column being set. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to model this problem as choosing for each row a color (W, B, or E) and for each column a color (W, B, or E) such that for every cell (i,j), if row i is not E and column j is not E, then they must have the same color. Additionally, the arrangement must be maximal, meaning that you cannot add any more chips. The maximality condition would require that for any cell not colored, either its row is colored (so you can't put a different color there) or its column is colored (same) or both are colored but conflicting (so you can't put anything there). But if a cell is uncolored (i.e., its row and column are both E), then you could put a chip there, so the arrangement isn't maximal. Therefore, the only way to have a maximal arrangement is that there are no cells where both the row and column are E. Therefore, every cell must have either its row or column (or both) colored. Therefore, the set of rows and columns colored must form a covering of the grid in the sense that every cell is in at least one colored row or column.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing a set of rows and columns to color (with colors W or B), such that:\n\n1. For any row colored W or B, all its cells are set to that color.\n2. For any column colored W or B, all its cells are set to that color.\n3. For any cell (i,j), if row i is colored and column j is colored, they must agree in color.\n4. Additionally, every cell must be in at least one colored row or column (to satisfy maximality).\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to selecting a subset of rows and columns, each assigned a color (or unassigned, i.e., E), such that:\n\n- For every row, if it's colored (W/B), all its cells are that color.\n- For every column, if it's colored (W/B), all its cells are that color.\n- For any row i and column j, if both are colored, their colors must match at cell (i,j).\n- Every cell (i,j) is in at least one colored row or column.\n\nMoreover, since we have a finite number of chips (25 white and 25 black), we have to ensure that the total number of white chips used does not exceed 25 and similarly for black chips.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"some of these chips\" so we can use any number up to 25 of each, but the arrangement must be maximal. However, maybe the color assignments will automatically not exceed the available chips because of the maximality? Hmm, perhaps not necessarily, but we need to count all such maximal arrangements where the number of white chips used is at most 25 and black chips similarly, but since the chips are indistinct, as long as the count is within the limit, it's okay. Wait, actually, the problem says \"place some of these chips\", so we can use any number up to 25 of each, but the arrangement must be maximal. But the problem is asking for the number of ways, so perhaps the counts of white and black chips in the arrangement must be exactly some numbers, but since the chips are indistinct, the count is determined by the configuration. Therefore, perhaps we need to count all such maximal arrangements (regardless of the counts) but ensuring that we don't use more than 25 of each color. Wait, but the problem states \"any additional chip placed on the grid would violate...\", so the arrangement is maximal, so you can't add any more chips. Therefore, the counts are automatically at most 25? Because if you could add more, then it's not maximal. Wait, no. The problem says \"some of these chips\", so maybe you can use any number, but since you can't add any more, the counts are such that you can't add another chip without violating the row or column constraints. So the counts can be anything as long as the arrangement is maximal, but the problem also specifies that you have 25 white and 25 black chips available. Therefore, the total white chips used must be \u226425 and black chips used \u226425. However, since the grid has 25 cells, the total number of chips used can be up to 25. Wait, but in a maximal arrangement, the number of chips must be exactly equal to the number of cells that are covered by at least one colored row or column. Wait, actually, in a maximal arrangement, every empty cell must be blocked by either its row or column being colored (so you can't put a chip there). But if a cell is not in any colored row or column, then you can put a chip there, which would violate maximality. Therefore, in a maximal arrangement, every cell must be in at least one colored row or column, so the entire grid is covered by the colored rows and columns. Wait, but actually, if a cell is in a colored row or column, then it's either filled with the color of the row or column. But if both the row and column are colored, they must agree, so the cell is filled with that color. If only the row is colored, then the cell is filled with the row's color. Similarly, if only the column is colored, it's filled with the column's color. Therefore, in a maximal arrangement, all cells are filled with either the row's color or the column's color, provided that whenever both are colored, they agree. Therefore, actually, the entire grid is filled except possibly where both the row and column are uncolored? Wait no, no. Wait, in a maximal arrangement, every cell must be in at least one colored row or column. Because otherwise, if a cell is not in any colored row or column, then you could place a chip there of any color, which would not violate the constraints (since the row and column are uncolored, so they can be set to that color). Therefore, to be maximal, there can be no such cells. Therefore, every cell must be in at least one colored row or column. Therefore, all cells are in at least one colored row or column, so the union of all colored rows and columns must cover the entire grid. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to selecting a set of rows and columns, each assigned a color (W/B or unassigned, but if assigned, must be W/B), such that:\n\n1. For each row, if it is colored (W or B), all its cells are that color.\n2. For each column, if it is colored (W or B), all its cells are that color.\n3. For any cell (i,j), if both row i and column j are colored, they must have the same color.\n4. Every cell is in at least one colored row or column.\n\nMoreover, the total number of white chips used (which is the number of cells in white rows plus the number of cells in white columns not already covered by white rows) must be \u226425, and similarly for black. But since the grid is 5x5, the total cells are 25, so actually, the counts must exactly sum to 25. Wait, but the chips are placed in the cells, so each cell has at most one chip. Therefore, the total number of chips is exactly the number of cells that are covered by at least one colored row or column. Wait, but actually, every cell is covered by at least one colored row or column, so all 25 cells are filled? Wait no, hold on. Wait, if a cell is in a colored row and a colored column, then it is filled with the color of the row (and column, since they must agree). If a cell is only in a colored row, it is filled with the row's color. Similarly, if only in a colored column, it's filled with column's color. Therefore, every cell is filled, because every cell is in at least one colored row or column. Therefore, in a maximal arrangement, the grid is completely filled with chips, with the constraints on the rows and columns. Therefore, the total number of chips used is exactly 25. Therefore, the problem's condition of having at most one chip per cell is satisfied because the grid is filled, and we have exactly 25 chips (so using all cells). However, the problem says \"some of these chips\", so maybe it's allowed to have fewer? Wait, but if you don't fill all cells, then there exists a cell not in any colored row or column, which would allow adding a chip there, so it wouldn't be maximal. Therefore, the maximal arrangements must fill all cells. Therefore, the counts of white and black chips must sum to 25, and each must be \u226425, which is naturally satisfied since each is between 0 and 25. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of such colorings (assigning colors to rows and columns with the constraints above), and since the chips are indistinct, each such coloring corresponds to exactly one way (since the colors are fixed once rows and columns are assigned, and the counts are determined by that). However, we have to consider that rows and columns can be unassigned (E), but in such a way that every cell is in a colored row or column. Wait, but if a row is unassigned (E), then all its cells must be covered by their respective columns. Similarly, if a column is unassigned, all its cells must be covered by their respective rows. \n\nThis seems quite complex. Maybe an alternative approach is to model this as a matrix where each row is either W, B, or E, and each column similarly, with the constraints that for all i,j: if row i is not E and column j is not E, then row i's color = column j's color. Additionally, every cell is in at least one non-E row or column. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps all the colored rows must agree on a single color, and all colored columns must also agree on that same color? Wait, that might not necessarily be the case. Let me think of an example. Suppose we color row 1 white, column 1 white. That's okay. If we color row 2 black, then column 1 (already white) can't intersect with row 2's black. Therefore, column 1 and row 2 can't both be colored. Therefore, if a column is colored white, then any row that is colored and intersects it must also be white. Similarly, if a row is colored black, any column that is colored and intersects it must also be black. \n\nThis suggests that all non-E rows and non-E columns must be of the same color. Wait, is that true?\n\nSuppose there are two rows colored differently. Let's say row 1 is white and row 2 is black. Then, any column that is colored must be the same as every row it intersects. So, for column 1, if it's colored, it must be white (because row 1 is white) and black (because row 2 is black), which is impossible. Therefore, if there are two rows of different colors, then any column that is colored must be in conflict, so columns can't be colored except those that don't intersect both rows? Wait, but columns must cover all cells. This is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all colored rows must be of the same color, and all colored columns must also be of that color. Let me see:\n\nSuppose that there is at least one colored row. Let the color of that row be C. Then any column that is colored must also be C, because wherever they intersect with that row, they must agree. Similarly, any other colored row must also be C, since they intersect with the columns which are C. So, in other words, if there is any colored row or column, they must all be the same color. \n\nTherefore, the possible colorings are:\n\n1. All colored rows and columns are white.\n\n2. All colored rows and columns are black.\n\n3. No rows or columns are colored (but this can't be, since then the grid is empty and not maximal).\n\nWait, but if you have some rows and columns colored, they must all agree on a single color. Therefore, the only possibilities are:\n\nEither all colored rows and columns are white, or all are black, or there are no colored rows and columns (which is invalid because then the grid is empty and you could add chips, so it's not maximal). Therefore, the maximal arrangements are either:\n\n- All rows and columns are colored white, but that would mean every cell is white, so that's one possibility.\n\n- All rows and columns are colored black, similarly all cells black.\n\n- Or, perhaps a mix where some rows and columns are colored white, and the rest are uncolored, but all colored ones are white. Similarly for black.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the previous logic suggests that if you have any colored rows or columns, they must all be the same color. So, for instance, you could have some rows colored white, some columns colored white, and the rest uncolored. The uncolored rows and columns must be covered by the colored ones. Wait, but let me think through an example.\n\nSuppose we have two rows colored white, and three columns colored white. Then all intersections of white rows and columns are white. The cells in the white rows but outside the white columns must be white (since the row is white). The cells in the white columns but outside the white rows must also be white (since the column is white). The remaining cells (not in any white row or column) would have to be covered by other colored rows or columns, but since we can't have other colors, those cells must be covered by... Wait, but since we can't have other colors, those cells would be uncovered, which violates the maximality. Therefore, in such a case, all cells must be in at least one white row or column. Therefore, the union of white rows and columns must cover the entire grid.\n\nAlternatively, if we have some rows and columns colored white, and the rest uncolored, but the union of those rows and columns must cover all cells. Similarly for black. \n\nTherefore, the possible maximal arrangements are:\n\nEither:\n\n- The entire grid is white (all rows and columns colored white).\n\n- The entire grid is black (all rows and columns colored black).\n\nOr,\n\n- There is a subset of rows and columns colored white such that their union covers the entire grid, and no columns or rows are colored black. Similarly, for black, but we can't mix colors.\n\nWait, but actually, if we have some rows colored white and some columns colored white, their union must cover the grid. The color is white throughout. Similarly for black. So, the problem reduces to choosing a set of rows and columns (any number) colored white, such that their union covers the grid, plus the same for black. However, since we can't have both white and black in the same arrangement (because otherwise their intersections would conflict), the total number of arrangements would be the number of white-covered arrangements plus the number of black-covered arrangements.\n\nWait, but the problem allows for some cells to be white and others black as long as the row and column constraints are met. Wait, no! Wait, according to the earlier conclusion, if you have any colored rows or columns, they must all be the same color, so the entire arrangement is monochromatic. Therefore, the only possible maximal arrangements are either all white, all black, or a mixture where some rows and columns are colored white (covering the grid), or some rows and columns are colored black (covering the grid). Therefore, the total number of arrangements is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of rows and columns (for white) that cover the grid, plus the same for black, but since the color is either white or black, we have to double the count (except for the case where the entire grid is covered by both, but that's already counted). Wait, actually, no. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet me denote that for each color C (either white or black), the number of maximal arrangements of that color is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of rows and columns (each can be chosen or not) such that:\n\n1. The union of the chosen rows and columns covers the entire grid.\n\n2. The chosen rows and columns can be any subset, but their union must cover the grid.\n\nWait, actually, if we are assigning a color to some rows and columns, but all of them must be the same color. So for white arrangements, the number is the number of subsets of rows and columns (each can be selected or not) such that every cell is in at least one selected row or column. Similarly for black. Since the problem counts arrangements where all the colored rows and columns are white, and the rest are uncolored but covered by the selected rows/columns, but actually, the uncolored rows and columns must be covered by the selected ones. Therefore, for each color, the number is the number of hitting sets: the number of subsets of rows and columns that hit every cell. Since each cell must be in at least one selected row or column. \n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is 2 multiplied by the number of such subsets (for white and black). But wait, actually, for each such subset (of rows and columns covering the grid), you can choose to color them white or black, so that's 2 possibilities. However, the case where no rows or columns are selected (the empty set) does not cover the grid, so it's excluded. The case where all rows and columns are selected (the full set) is included. So the total number would be 2*(N - 1), where N is the number of subsets of rows and columns that cover the grid. Wait, no, actually, the number is 2*(number of valid subsets). Wait, actually, the empty subset doesn't count, so if the number of valid subsets (those that cover the grid) is S, then total arrangements are 2*S. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to computing S, the number of subsets of rows and columns (each can be chosen independently) such that every cell is in at least one chosen row or column. Then multiply by 2 (for white or black). However, there is an exception: the case where all rows are chosen or all columns are chosen, but they are already counted in S. \n\nWait, actually, let me clarify: Each such subset (rows and columns) defines a monochromatic arrangement (either white or black). Therefore, each subset corresponds to two arrangements (one white, one black) except for the case where the subset is empty, but the empty subset isn't counted because it doesn't cover the grid. So total arrangements are 2*(number of covering subsets). \n\nTherefore, the key is to compute S, the number of subsets of rows and columns (each can be chosen or not) such that every cell is in at least one chosen row or column. \n\nSo, how do we compute S?\n\nThis is equivalent to the number of ways to choose a subset of rows and columns such that their union covers all 25 cells. \n\nLet me denote that there are 5 rows and 5 columns. Each cell (i,j) is covered if row i is chosen or column j is chosen. \n\nWe need to count all subsets of rows and columns (each can be included or not) such that for every i,j, row i is included OR column j is included. \n\nAlternatively, the complement: the subsets that do NOT cover all cells are those where there exists at least one cell (i,j) not covered, i.e., row i not chosen AND column j not chosen. \n\nTherefore, using inclusion-exclusion, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, it's similar to the problem of covering a grid with rows and columns. Let me recall that the number of subsets of rows and columns that cover all cells is equal to the sum over k and l of (-1)^{something}, but perhaps inclusion-exclusion might get complicated here.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as each cell must be covered by at least one row or column. So for each cell (i,j), at least one of row i or column j is chosen. \n\nThis is equivalent to saying that for every pair (i,j), the row i or column j is selected. \n\nTherefore, the problem is similar to a hitting set problem where the universe is the 5x5 grid, and the sets are the rows and columns. Each row corresponds to the set of its 5 cells, each column corresponds to its 5 cells. We need the number of subsets of these row and column sets that cover the entire grid. \n\nThis is a classic problem in combinatorics. The number of such subsets can be calculated using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. \n\nAlternatively, since each cell (i,j) must be covered by at least one row or column, we can model this as the union of the selected rows and columns must equal the entire grid. \n\nLet me consider that each cell (i,j) imposes the condition that row i is selected OR column j is selected. \n\nTherefore, the total number of subsets is the product over all cells of (row i or column j must be selected). But this is not straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, think of it as follows: Let me denote the set of rows as R = {r1, r2, r3, r4, r5}, and columns as C = {c1, c2, c3, c4, c5}. Each subset is a pair (A,B) where A \u2286 R and B \u2286 C, such that for every i,j, either ri \u2208 A or cj \u2208 B. \n\nTherefore, the condition is equivalent to: For all i, if ri is not in A, then all columns cj must be in B for every j (since otherwise, if some cj is not in B, then cell (i,j) is not covered). Wait, no, that's not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose a particular row ri is not in A. Then, in order for all cells in row ri to be covered, every column cj must be in B, because otherwise, the cell (i,j) would not be covered (since row ri isn't selected and column cj isn't selected). Therefore, if a row is not selected, then all columns must be selected. Similarly, if a column is not selected, then all rows must be selected. \n\nThis is a crucial observation. Let me formalize:\n\nSuppose we have a subset of rows A and subset of columns B. The condition that every cell (i,j) is in A or B (i.e., row i \u2208 A or column j \u2208 B) is equivalent to:\n\nFor every row i not in A, all columns must be in B. Because otherwise, if there's a row i not in A and a column j not in B, then cell (i,j) is uncovered.\n\nSimilarly, for every column j not in B, all rows must be in A.\n\nTherefore, the subsets (A,B) must satisfy that:\n\nEither:\n\n1. All rows not in A have all columns in B, and all columns not in B have all rows in A. \n\nAlternatively, this can be rephrased as:\n\nEither:\n\n- All rows not in A must have B = C (all columns selected), or\n\n- All columns not in B must have A = R (all rows selected).\n\nTherefore, the only possible cases are:\n\nCase 1: All rows are selected (A = R). Then, B can be any subset of columns. Because even if some columns are not in B, since all rows are in A, every cell is covered by its row.\n\nCase 2: All columns are selected (B = C). Then, A can be any subset of rows.\n\nCase 3: Neither all rows nor all columns are selected. Then, the condition is that any row not in A must have all columns in B, and any column not in B must have all rows in A. However, since neither A = R nor B = C, there exists at least one row not in A and at least one column not in B. Let me see what this implies.\n\nSuppose there is a row i not in A and a column j not in B. But then cell (i,j) is not covered, which violates the condition. Therefore, in this case (neither A = R nor B = C), we cannot have both a row not in A and a column not in B. Therefore, either all rows not in A must have B = C (but since B is not C, this is impossible unless there are no rows not in A, which would mean A=R, contradicting the case). Alternatively, the only way this can hold is if either all rows not in A have B=C (which can't happen if B\u2260C) or all columns not in B have A=R (also can't happen if A\u2260R). Therefore, actually, there are no such subsets in this third case. Therefore, the only valid subsets are those in case 1 or case 2.\n\nWait, this is a key point. Let me rephrase:\n\nIf neither all rows are selected nor all columns are selected, then there exists at least one row not in A and at least one column not in B. But then the cell at their intersection would be uncovered, which is invalid. Therefore, such subsets cannot exist. Therefore, the only valid subsets are those where either all rows are selected (A=R) or all columns are selected (B=C). \n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me test with an example. Suppose I select all rows except row 1, and all columns except column 1. Then, the cell (1,1) would not be covered, so that's invalid. But what if I select all columns except column 1, but include row 1? Let's see: Suppose A = all rows, and B is missing column 1. Then, since all rows are included, even though column 1 isn't, all cells in column 1 are covered by their rows. So that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, suppose A is missing row 1, but B includes all columns. Then, since all columns are selected, even though row 1 is missing, all cells in row 1 are covered by their columns. \n\nBut if neither A is all rows nor B is all columns, but for example, A includes all except row 1, and B includes all except column 1, then cell (1,1) is not covered. Therefore, such a subset is invalid. \n\nTherefore, the only valid subsets are those where either A = R or B = C. \n\nWait, but in the first case, A=R, then B can be any subset of columns, since all rows are selected, so all cells are covered regardless of B. Similarly, in the second case, B=C, then A can be any subset of rows. \n\nHowever, there is an overlap when both A=R and B=C. In that case, it's counted in both cases, so we have to subtract the overlap. \n\nTherefore, by the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal subsets S = (number of subsets with A=R) + (number of subsets with B=C) - (number of subsets with both A=R and B=C)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n- Number of subsets with A=R: A is fixed as all rows. Then B can be any subset of columns (including none or all). Since there are 5 columns, there are 2^5 = 32 subsets.\n\n- Number of subsets with B=C: Similarly, B is fixed as all columns, so A can be any subset of rows. There are 2^5 = 32 subsets.\n\n- Number of subsets with both A=R and B=C: This is just 1 subset (both all rows and all columns selected).\n\nTherefore, S = 32 + 32 - 1 = 63.\n\nWait, that seems surprisingly low. Let me confirm:\n\nIf A=R (all rows selected), then B can be any subset of columns. Since the rows cover everything, the columns can be anything. So 2^5 =32.\n\nSimilarly for B=C. The overlap when both are selected is counted twice, so subtract 1. \n\nThus S=63. Therefore, the total number of maximal arrangements would be 2*S = 126? But wait, hold on. Wait, no, actually, in each of these subsets, when you choose a subset with A=R and some B, the color is either white or black. Similarly for the others. However, actually, when you choose a subset (A,B), the color is assigned to all the selected rows and columns. But since in the case where A=R, the selected rows are all, so the entire grid is covered by rows, so the color of the rows is chosen, and the columns can be any subset but their color is the same. Wait a second, actually in the problem's terms, when we choose a subset of rows and columns to color (with a single color), then the color is fixed for all those rows and columns. So each such subset corresponds to an arrangement where the selected rows and columns are colored with a chosen color (either white or black), and the rest are uncolored but their cells are covered by the selected ones. \n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is 2*(number of such subsets). Since S is 63, the total would be 126. But wait, but let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the color is chosen for the entire arrangement. For each subset (A,B) which is a covering subset (either A=R or B=C), you can choose to color them white or black. So each subset corresponds to two arrangements (white and black), except when the subset is both A=R and B=C. In that case, coloring it white or black would produce different arrangements, so it's still counted twice. \n\nTherefore, yes, the total is 2*63 = 126. But wait, but the problem states \"some of these chips\", so when A=R and B is empty, that would mean all rows are colored (so all cells are filled with the chosen color), and B is empty. So the total number of chips is 25, which is okay. Similarly, if B=C and A is empty, all columns are colored, so again all cells are filled. \n\nHowever, there's an overcounting here. Wait, let me think: For example, the case where A=R and B is all columns. That is, both all rows and all columns are selected. This is counted once in the A=R term and once in the B=C term, so when we subtracted 1 for overlap, but in terms of subsets, the subset where A=R and B=C is a single subset, but when we compute S as 32 +32 -1=63, that's correct. Then when we multiply by 2, it's 126. \n\nBut let me check with small examples. Let's consider a 1x1 grid. Then, the problem would be similar. Let's see:\n\nFor a 1x1 grid, the number of maximal arrangements should be: either color the single cell white or black, so 2. \n\nUsing the formula above:\n\nS would be the number of subsets (A,B) where A is rows (either selected or not), B is columns (same). The covering subsets must cover the single cell. The cell is covered if row is selected or column is selected. So the subsets that cover are:\n\n- A selected (row selected), B can be anything (since row covers it)\n\n- B selected (column selected), A can be anything\n\n- both selected.\n\nThus total subsets S = (2^1 for B when A is selected) + (2^1 for A when B is selected) -1 (overlap) = 2 +2 -1 =3. Then total arrangements would be 2*3=6, but actual answer is 2. So clearly my approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, so my reasoning must be flawed. Let me see where.\n\nIn the 1x1 case, according to the problem's conditions, the maximal arrangements must have the single cell filled (since otherwise you could add a chip). So there are two possibilities: white or black. But according to my previous logic, the formula gives 6, which is wrong. So my mistake must be in interpreting the subsets.\n\nWait, in the 1x1 grid:\n\nEach subset (A,B) where A is a subset of rows (either select row 1 or not), and B subset of columns (select column 1 or not). The condition is that the single cell is covered, so row selected OR column selected. The subsets that satisfy this are:\n\nAll except the subset where neither row nor column is selected. So total subsets S = total subsets -1 = 3 (since there are 2 rows and 2 columns, total subsets are 2*2=4, subtract 1 gives 3). Then multiply by 2 gives 6, but the correct answer is 2. \n\nTherefore, my approach is incorrect. The problem is that in the problem's terms, when you choose a subset of rows and columns to color (with a single color), the color must be consistent. However, in the formula above, I considered that any subset (A,B) can be colored white or black, but actually, the color assignments must be such that all selected rows and columns are the same color. Wait, but in the problem's constraints, when you choose a subset of rows and columns to color, they must all be the same color. \n\nWait, in the previous analysis, I assumed that when you choose a subset (A,B), you can assign them a color (either white or black), and the rest are uncolored. However, the uncolored rows and columns must not have any chips in their cells except those covered by the colored rows and columns. \n\nWait, actually, the problem requires that all the selected rows and columns must be colored with the same color. So for a subset (A,B), you have to choose a color (W or B), and then all selected rows and columns are assigned that color. The rest are uncolored, but their cells are covered by the colored rows or columns. \n\nTherefore, in the 1x1 case, the subsets (A,B) that cover the cell are:\n\n1. A={row1}, B any. Choosing color W: the cell is white. Choosing color B: the cell is black.\n\n2. B={col1}, A any. Choosing color W: the cell is white. Choosing color B: the cell is black.\n\n3. A={row1}, B={col1}. Choosing color W: white, color B: black.\n\nTherefore, each of the 3 subsets corresponds to two color choices (except when A and B are both selected, but even then, it's still two choices). However, when you count this way, the total is indeed 3 subsets \u00d72 colors =6, but the actual correct answer is 2. \n\nThis discrepancy arises because when both A and B are selected (the full subset), the color is determined by both the row and column, but since they must agree, there's no conflict, but in reality, choosing that subset with color W is the same as choosing the subset with just the row selected (since the cell is covered by the row). Wait, no. Actually, in the 1x1 case, selecting A={row1} and B={col1} and coloring them white is the same as just selecting A={row1} and coloring it white. Because the cell is already covered by the row. Similarly for the column. Therefore, these subsets are overcounted because different subsets can lead to the same arrangement. \n\nAh, here's the problem: different subsets can result in the same coloring. For example, in the 1x1 case:\n\n- Choosing A={row1}, B=\u2205 and coloring white gives the cell white.\n\n- Choosing A=\u2205, B={col1} and coloring white also gives the cell white.\n\n- Choosing A={row1}, B={col1} and coloring white also gives the cell white.\n\nTherefore, these three subsets all result in the same white arrangement, but in my count, they are counted as three separate subsets each contributing to white and black, leading to overcounting.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach is incorrect because different subsets can lead to the same arrangement. Hence, the problem requires counting distinct arrangements, not the number of subsets times two. \n\nTherefore, I need a different approach.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nLet me think of the colorings as follows. Since all colored rows and columns must be of the same color, let's consider the possible colorings as either all white or all black. Let's focus on white first.\n\nTo create a white arrangement, we need to choose a set of rows and columns (some or all) such that every cell is in at least one chosen row or column. Similarly for black. The total number of arrangements is then 2*(number of such subsets for white). But we must ensure that subsets that are equivalent (e.g., choosing rows or columns that cover the same cells) are not overcounted. Wait, but the subsets themselves are different even if they cover the same cells, but the resulting colorings would be the same. Wait no, actually, the subsets define the set of rows and columns that are colored white. The actual arrangement is determined by which rows and columns are chosen. For example, if I choose row 1 and column 1 for white, versus just row 1, the resulting colorings are different only if the coverage differs. Wait no, in terms of the grid's final state, if you choose row 1 and column 1, then the entire row 1 is white, and the entire column 1 is white. The intersection is already white, so the total cells colored white are row 1 (5 cells) plus column 1 excluding the intersection (4 more cells), totaling 9. Whereas if you just choose row 1, you have 5 cells. So different subsets lead to different colorings. \n\nWait, actually, each subset (A,B) where A is rows and B is columns selected for white, with the condition that their union covers the grid. Each such subset corresponds to a unique arrangement where exactly the cells in A or B are white (since any cell in a selected row or column is white). Wait, no, actually, if a cell is in both a selected row and column, it's still just white. The total white cells are the union of the selected rows and columns. So the actual coloring is the set of all cells in any selected row or column, all colored white. Similarly for black.\n\nTherefore, different subsets can lead to different colorings. For example, choosing rows 1 and columns 1 gives a different set of white cells than choosing just row 1. Therefore, the number of distinct white arrangements is exactly the number of such subsets S (as computed before 63 for 5x5), and similarly for black. Thus the total number is 2*S = 126. However, in the 1x1 case, this would give 2*(3)=6, but the correct answer is 2. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait in the 1x1 case, the subsets that cover the cell are:\n\n1. A={row}, B anything (so 2 subsets: B can be {} or {col}).\n\n2. B={col}, A anything (another 2 subsets: A can be {} or {row}).\n\n3. Subtract the overlap where A={row} and B={col}, counted twice, so total subsets S= 2+2-1=3.\n\nBut the distinct colorings for white would be:\n\n- Choosing A={row}, B={}: the cell is in row, so white.\n\n- Choosing A={}, B={col}: the cell is in column, so white.\n\n- Choosing A={row}, B={col}: the cell is in both, still white.\n\nThese are all the same in terms of the final grid (the single cell is white). Similarly, choosing any combination that covers the cell results in the cell being white. So all subsets that cover the cell correspond to the same arrangement when colored white. Therefore, the number of distinct white arrangements is 1, not 3. \n\nAh, here's the key: different subsets can lead to the same arrangement. In this case, any subset that covers the cell results in the entire cell being white, so there's only one white arrangement and one black arrangement, totaling 2. But according to the subset count, it's 3 subsets \u00d72=6, which is wrong. \n\nTherefore, my mistake was assuming that each subset corresponds to a unique arrangement, but in reality, different subsets can lead to the same arrangement. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach must account for the fact that two different subsets (A,B) and (A',B') can result in the same set of white cells if their unions are the same. \n\nHence, the problem reduces to counting the number of distinct subsets of cells that can be formed by the union of some rows and columns, and then multiplying by 2 (for white and black). But this is equivalent to counting the number of distinct unions of rows and columns, then multiplying by 2.\n\nThe question now becomes: How many distinct subsets of the 5x5 grid can be formed by the union of some subset of rows and columns?\n\nThis is a different problem. Let me think about this.\n\nIn the 1x1 case, the possible unions are:\n\n- The empty set (not covering, so invalid).\n\n- The single cell (by choosing the row, the column, or both). \n\nThus only one non-empty subset, so total arrangements 2.\n\nFor a 2x2 grid, it might be more complex. Let me see:\n\nBut perhaps there's a formula for the number of distinct unions of rows and columns in an n x n grid. \n\nI recall that this is related to the number of closed sets in a certain closure system, but I might need to think combinatorially.\n\nAlternatively, note that any union of rows and columns can be represented as the set of all cells in any of the chosen rows or columns. The distinct such sets can be characterized by specifying which rows and columns are chosen, but different choices can lead to the same set. \n\nHowever, for the purpose of counting distinct unions, note that a union is determined uniquely by the set of rows and columns chosen. Wait, no, actually different combinations can lead to the same union. For example, choosing row 1 and column 1 versus choosing row 1 and column 2 and then another combination might not, but in general it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each union corresponds uniquely to a pair (R,C) where R is the set of rows and C the set of columns, but the union is the same as R \u00d7 any column unioned with any row \u00d7 C. The problem is that different pairs (R,C) can give the same union.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of distinct unions is equal to the number of possible row and column selections where the rows and columns are chosen such that the union is exactly the set of cells in those rows or columns. \n\nBut I might need to find another way. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the problem, since we have to cover the entire grid (because of maximality), the union must be the entire grid. Wait a second! Wait a minute, no. Wait, the maximality requires that every cell is in at least one colored row or column, so the union of the chosen rows and columns must be the entire grid. Therefore, the subsets we are counting are exactly those subsets of rows and columns whose union is the entire grid. Therefore, the distinct arrangements for a single color are exactly the number of such subsets (A,B) where the union covers the grid, but considering that two different (A,B) pairs can result in the same coverage. \n\nHowever, in terms of the final arrangement, the set of white cells is exactly the union of the selected rows and columns. Therefore, two different subsets (A,B) and (A',B') will result in the same white arrangement if and only if the union of A's rows and B's columns is equal to the union of A' rows and B' columns. \n\nTherefore, the number of distinct white arrangements is equal to the number of distinct unions of rows and columns that cover the entire grid. \n\nSimilarly for black, so total arrangements would be twice that number. \n\nTherefore, the key is to compute the number of distinct subsets of the grid cells that can be formed as the union of some rows and columns, and which cover the entire grid. \n\nThis seems challenging. Let me see if there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only way to cover the grid is by choosing all rows, or all columns, or a combination where the selected rows and columns together cover everything. But how many distinct such combinations are there?\n\nWait, going back to the earlier analysis where if neither all rows nor all columns are selected, then there must be at least one row not in A and one column not in B, leading to an uncovered cell. Wait, but earlier that led us to the conclusion that only subsets where all rows are chosen or all columns are chosen are valid. But that can't be because in the 1x1 case, choosing just the row or just the column both cover the grid, so they are valid. \n\nWait in the 1x1 case, the subsets that cover are:\n\n- All rows (the single row) with any columns.\n\n- All columns (the single column) with any rows.\n\n- Both all rows and columns.\n\nBut in terms of the unions:\n\n- If you choose the row (and any columns, but columns don't matter because the row already covers it), the union is the single cell.\n\n- Similarly for the column.\n\n- Choosing both also gives the single cell.\n\nTherefore, all these subsets result in the same union (the entire grid), so they are considered the same in terms of the arrangement. Therefore, the number of distinct unions that cover the grid is 1 for 1x1.\n\nSimilarly, in the 5x5 case, perhaps the number of distinct unions that cover the grid is equal to the number of possible ways to choose between covering via rows, columns, or both? No, that can't be. \n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose in a 2x2 grid:\n\nTo cover the grid, you can choose:\n\n- All rows (2 rows), any columns.\n\n- All columns (2 columns), any rows.\n\n- Or a combination where, say, row1 and column1 and column2. That would cover everything except row2, so no. Wait, no, if you choose row1 and columns 1 and 2, then you cover row1 entirely and columns 1 and 2. So the cell (2,1) and (2,2) are covered by the columns. Thus all cells are covered. So that's a valid subset (row1 and columns 1,2). Similarly, row1 and row2 would also cover everything. \n\nTherefore, there are more subsets than just the all-rows or all-columns. \n\nTherefore, my previous conclusion was wrong. The earlier logic was flawed because it considered that if you don't choose all rows, then any missing row requires all columns to be chosen, but that's not the case. Let me re-examine that.\n\nThe condition that every cell (i,j) is in A or B (row i in A or column j in B) can be rephrased as:\n\nFor every row i not in A, every column j must be in B.\n\nSimilarly, for every column j not in B, every row i must be in A.\n\nThis means that if there is a row not in A, then all columns must be in B. Similarly, if there's a column not in B, all rows must be in A. \n\nTherefore, the possible cases are:\n\nEither:\n\n1. All rows are in A (so B can be anything).\n\n2. All columns are in B (so A can be anything).\n\n3. Neither 1 nor 2, but then there exists a row not in A and a column not in B. But according to the above condition, if there is a row not in A, then all columns must be in B. Similarly, if there is a column not in B, all rows must be in A. Therefore, the only way to have neither 1 nor 2 is if there are no rows not in A and no columns not in B, which would mean all rows are in A and all columns are in B, which is case 1 and 2 together. \n\nTherefore, the only valid subsets are those in case 1 or case 2. \n\nWait, this brings us back to the original conclusion that the only covering subsets are those where either all rows are selected or all columns are selected. \n\nBut in the 2x2 example, choosing row1 and columns 1 and 2 would satisfy the condition:\n\n- Rows not in A: row2.\n\n- Since row2 is not in A, all columns must be in B. But in this case, columns 1 and 2 are in B, so that's okay. Wait, but there are only 2 columns, so if columns 1 and 2 are in B, then all columns are in B. So this is actually case 2 (all columns are selected), since B includes all columns. \n\nAh! So in this case, choosing columns 1 and 2 (all columns) and row1 is actually case 2 (all columns selected), so B is all columns, and A can be any subset. \n\nTherefore, the example I thought of where you choose row1 and columns 1 and 2 is actually part of case 2 (since all columns are selected), so it's allowed. \n\nTherefore, my initial conclusion holds: the only valid subsets are those where either all rows are selected (so A=R, B can be anything), or all columns are selected (B=C, A can be anything). \n\nTherefore, in the 2x2 case, the number of subsets S would be:\n\n- A=R: 2^2=4 (since B can be any subset of columns).\n\n- B=C: 2^2=4 (A can be any subset of rows).\n\n- Subtract overlap (A=R and B=C):1.\n\nTotal S=4+4-1=7.\n\nThus, the number of distinct unions would be S=7? But let's see:\n\nThe distinct unions when A=R (all rows selected) can have any B. The union is all rows (so the entire grid), regardless of B. So choosing A=R and any B gives the entire grid.\n\nSimilarly, when B=C (all columns selected), any A also gives the entire grid. \n\nTherefore, all subsets in cases 1 and 2 result in the entire grid being covered. Thus, the union is always the entire grid. Therefore, the number of distinct unions that cover the grid is 1. \n\nWait a contradiction! Because according to the subset count S=7, but all those subsets correspond to the same union (the entire grid). \n\nTherefore, my earlier analysis is correct in terms of the subsets, but the unions they produce are all the entire grid. Thus, the number of distinct unions that cover the grid is 1. Hence, the number of arrangements would be 2*1=2 for the 1x1 grid, which matches. For the 2x2 grid, it would also give 2 arrangements (all white or all black), but that's not correct because in the 2x2 grid, you can have different configurations. \n\nWait, hold on. Let's think of the 2x2 grid. If I choose to color all rows (A=R), then the entire grid is white. Similarly, choosing all columns (B=C) also gives the entire grid white. Therefore, regardless of how you choose the subsets (as long as they cover the grid), the resulting arrangement is the entire grid filled with the chosen color. \n\nTherefore, for any n x n grid, the number of distinct maximal arrangements is 2: all white or all black. But that can't be right. \n\nWait, but in the problem's original conditions, the maximal arrangement requires that you can't add any more chips. If the entire grid is filled with white chips, then you can't add any more, which is maximal. Similarly for black. But what if you have a partial coverage?\n\nWait, according to the maximality condition, every empty cell must be blocked by its row or column already being colored. But if the grid is not fully covered, then there exists a cell not in any colored row or column, so you could add a chip there, which violates maximality. Therefore, the only maximal arrangements are those where the entire grid is filled with chips of a single color. \n\nWait, this seems to be the case! Because any other arrangement would leave some cells uncovered, allowing you to add a chip, hence not maximal. \n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose in a 2x2 grid, I choose to color row 1 white and column 1 white. Then the union covers:\n\n- All of row 1 (cells (1,1), (1,2))\n\n- All of column 1 (cells (1,1), (2,1))\n\nThus the covered cells are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). The cell (2,2) is not covered. Therefore, to satisfy maximality, this arrangement is invalid because you can place a chip in (2,2). Therefore, such a subset is not allowed because it doesn't cover the entire grid. \n\nTherefore, the only valid maximal arrangements are those where the union of selected rows and columns covers the entire grid, which as per the earlier analysis, requires that either all rows are selected or all columns are selected. \n\nTherefore, when all rows are selected, the union is the entire grid. Similarly, when all columns are selected, the union is also the entire grid. Any other subset that covers the grid must include all rows or all columns. \n\nTherefore, the only maximal arrangements are those where the entire grid is filled with one color. Therefore, there are only two maximal arrangements: all white or all black. \n\nBut this contradicts my initial thought that there could be other configurations. Wait, but according to the maximality condition, you must fill the entire grid. Because otherwise, there exists a cell not covered by any colored row or column, so you could add a chip there. \n\nTherefore, the only maximal arrangements are the two monochromatic colorings. \n\nBut the problem states \"some of these chips\", so perhaps using all 25 chips is allowed, which is what the monochromatic colorings do. \n\nWait, but then why did we get S=63 earlier? Because S counts all subsets where either all rows are selected or all columns are selected, but those subsets correspond to the same union (the entire grid). Therefore, the number of distinct unions is 1, leading to two arrangements. \n\nThis suggests that the answer is 2. But that seems too simple, and the problem is from a competition likely expecting a more complex answer. So I must have made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement:\n\n\"all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\"\n\nAh! Wait a second, this might not require that the entire row or column is filled, but rather that any chips in the row are the same color, and similarly for columns. \n\nOh! This is a crucial misunderstanding. \n\nPreviously, I assumed that if a row is colored, all its cells must be filled with that color. But the problem says \"all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\". \n\nThis means that in any given row, any chips present must be the same color, but the row doesn't have to be completely filled. Similarly for columns. \n\nThis changes everything. \n\nSo let me start over with this correct interpretation.\n\nThe problem allows rows and columns to be partially filled, but with all chips in a row being the same color, and all chips in a column being the same color. Additionally, the placement is maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips without violating the color conditions. \n\nThis is different from my previous interpretation where rows and columns had to be completely filled or not. \n\nOkay, let's re-analyze with this correct understanding.\n\nEach row can have 0 to 5 chips, all of the same color (or none). Similarly for each column. The placement is maximal, so for every empty cell, adding a chip of either color would violate the row or column's color constraint. \n\nTherefore, for any empty cell (i,j), either:\n\n- The row i has chips of some color, so you can't add a different color there, and you can't add the same color because the row is already that color (but maybe the row isn't full yet? Wait, no, if the row has chips of a color, you can still add more of the same color unless the row is full.\n\nWait, the maximality condition says that any additional chip would violate the conditions. So if a row has some white chips, you can add more white chips until it's full, unless that would violate the column's color constraints. \n\nThis is more complex. Let me think carefully.\n\nFor the placement to be maximal, it must be that for every empty cell (i,j), you cannot place a chip there of either color without violating the row or column constraints. \n\nTherefore, for cell (i,j):\n\n- If you try to place a white chip, then either row i already has black chips (so can't place white), or column j already has black chips (can't place white), or row i has white chips but adding another white would be allowed, but since it's maximal, that must not be possible. Wait, but adding a white chip to a row that already has white chips doesn't violate the row's color condition. Similarly for the column. \n\nTherefore, the only way you cannot place a white chip in (i,j) is if:\n\n- The row i has black chips (so can't place white),\n\n- The column j has black chips (so can't place white),\n\n- Or the row i has white chips and the column j has white chips, but the cell (i,j) is already filled (but it's empty, so that's not the case).\n\nWait, no. If row i has white chips and column j has white chips, you can place a white chip there, but since the cell is empty, you could. Therefore, to prevent that, the row or column must already have a different color, or the cell is already filled. \n\nWait, this is getting tangled. Let me think of the conditions for maximality:\n\nFor cell (i,j) to be empty, the following must hold:\n\n- If you try to place a white chip there, it must violate either the row's color or column's color. \n\n- Similarly for a black chip.\n\nTherefore, for the white chip:\n\nEither:\n\n- The row i has black chips (so can't place white),\n\n- Or the column j has black chips (can't place white),\n\n- Or the row i has white chips and the column j has white chips, but the cell is already filled (but it's empty, so this isn't the case),\n\nWait, no. If the row has white chips and the column has white chips, you can place a white chip there. Therefore, to prevent that, the cell must already have a chip, or the row or column has a conflicting color. \n\nThus, the only way to prevent placing a white chip is if either the row has black or the column has black. Similarly, to prevent placing a black chip, either the row has white or the column has white.\n\nTherefore, for the cell to be empty, both:\n\n- The row i has a color different from white (either black or empty),\n\n- And the column j has a color different from white,\n\nOR\n\n- The row i has a color different from black,\n\n- And the column j has a color different from black.\n\nWait, this seems too vague. Let me formalize:\n\nTo block placing a white chip in (i,j):\n\nEither row i has a non-white color (black or empty), or column j has a non-white color (black or empty). But if the row is empty and the column is empty, then you can place a white chip, which would violate maximality. Therefore, to block white placement, the row or column must have a color that conflicts (black), or one of them is non-empty with a different color.\n\nWait, this is complicated. Perhaps a better way is:\n\nFor cell (i,j) to be empty, it must be that:\n\n- The row i has chips of color C1 (could be W or B), and the column j has chips of color C2 (could be W or B), and C1 \u2260 C2. Because if they are the same, then you could place a chip of that color there. \n\nAlternatively, if the row has no chips and the column has no chips, then you could place any color there, so to be maximal, the cell must be filled. \n\nTherefore, the only way a cell can be empty is if its row and column are both non-empty but of different colors. \n\nAdditionally, any row or column that is non-empty must have all its chips of the same color. \n\nTherefore, the entire grid must be partitioned into regions where:\n\n- Each row is either empty or has a single color.\n\n- Each column is either empty or has a single color.\n\n- Any cell where both row and column are non-empty must have the same color as both.\n\n- All other cells (where at least one of row or column is empty) can be filled or not, but in the maximal case, they must be filled if possible. Wait, no, in the maximal case, every empty cell must be blocked by the row or column having conflicting colors. \n\nWait, let me rephrase the conditions for maximality:\n\nThe placement is maximal if:\n\n1. Every cell that is empty must have its row and column both non-empty and of different colors. Because if either the row or column is empty, you could place a chip of any color there (since the row/column can then be set to that color), which would violate maximality. \n\n2. Every cell that is filled has the same color as its row and column (if they are non-empty).\n\nTherefore, the entire grid must satisfy:\n\n- For every row: either empty, or all its filled cells are the same color (W or B).\n\n- For every column: similarly.\n\n- For any cell (i,j):\n\n   - If both row i and column j are non-empty, then they must have the same color.\n\n   - If either row i or column j is empty, then the cell (i,j) must be filled (otherwise you could add a chip there, since the empty row/column could be assigned the chip's color).\n\nWait, yes! Because if a cell is empty and, say, its row is empty, then you could place a chip there of any color, setting the row to that color. Hence, to be maximal, such a cell must be filled. \n\nTherefore, the conditions are:\n\n1. Each row is either:\n\n   a. Empty (no chips),\n\n   b. All chips in the row are the same color (W or B),\n\n2. Each column is similarly either empty or all chips same color.\n\n3. For any cell (i,j):\n\n   a. If row i and column j are both non-empty, then their colors must match.\n\n   b. If row i is empty or column j is empty, then the cell (i,j) must be filled with the color of the non-empty row/column (if one is non-empty), or must be filled with any color (but since it must be maximal, but both are empty, it must be filled? Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, if both the row and column are empty, then the cell can be filled with any color, but to make the arrangement maximal, it must be filled. Because otherwise, you could add a chip there. Hence, such cells must be filled. \n\nTherefore, in summary:\n\nThe grid must be filled completely, with the following properties:\n\n- Each row is either empty or monochromatic.\n\n- Each column is either empty or monochromatic.\n\n- For any cell (i,j):\n\n   - If row i and column j are both non-empty, their colors must match.\n\n   - If exactly one of row i or column j is non-empty, the cell must be filled with the color of the non-empty one.\n\n   - If both are empty, the cell must be filled with any color, but since it's part of the grid, but the color must be consistent with some assignment? Wait, this is getting too tangled.\n\nPerhaps the only way this works is that the entire grid is partitioned into rows and columns with colors such that wherever a row and column intersect, their colors agree, and all cells are filled. \n\nLet me consider that the grid is colored such that:\n\n- Each row is assigned a color (W, B, or E).\n\n- Each column is assigned a color (W, B, or E).\n\n- For any cell (i,j), if the row color is C1 and column color is C2, then:\n\n   - If C1 and C2 are both non-E, they must be equal.\n\n   - The cell's color is C1 if C1 is non-E, else C2 if C2 is non-E, else arbitrary? Wait, but must be filled.\n\nActually, the cell must be filled with the color of the row if the row is non-E, else the column's color if the column is non-E, else it can be any color but must be filled. However, since we have to choose chips, and the colors must be consistent, perhaps the only way is that all non-E rows and columns must agree on their colors where they intersect.\n\nThis is similar to the earlier analysis, but now allowing rows and columns to be partially filled, but in reality, to satisfy the maximality, every cell must be filled. Because if a row is non-E, then all its cells must be filled with its color (since otherwise, you could add a chip of that color to an empty cell in the row, but the row is already colored, so you can add more). Wait, no.\n\nWait, if a row is colored W, but has some empty cells, then you can add more W chips to those cells, which would not violate the color condition. Therefore, to be maximal, the row must be completely filled with W. Similarly for columns. \n\nAh! This is the key point. \n\nIf a row is non-empty (i.e., has at least one chip), then it must be completely filled with chips of a single color. Otherwise, you could add more chips of that color, violating maximality. \n\nSimilarly, a column that has at least one chip must be completely filled with that color. \n\nTherefore, the conditions are:\n\n- Each row is either empty or completely filled with a single color (W or B).\n\n- Each column is either empty or completely filled with a single color (W or B).\n\n- Additionally, for any cell (i,j), if both row i and column j are non-empty, their colors must be the same.\n\n- The arrangement is maximal, so every cell is filled (since otherwise, if a cell is empty, either its row or column must be empty, but then you could fill it with the row/column's color if one is non-empty, or any color if both are empty, contradicting maximality).\n\nTherefore, the entire grid must be filled, with each row and column either entirely W, entirely B, or empty, but with the constraint that whenever a row and column are both non-empty, they must share the same color. \n\nFurthermore, since the grid is entirely filled, every cell is in at least one non-empty row or column. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to color the rows and columns with colors W, B, or E (empty), such that:\n\n1. For every row and column, if they are non-empty, they are colored W or B.\n\n2. For any cell (i,j), if row i and column j are both non-empty, their colors must be equal.\n\n3. Every cell is in at least one non-empty row or column (since the grid is filled).\n\n4. The total number of W chips (the number of W rows plus W columns minus overlaps) must be \u226425, and similarly for B. But since the grid has 25 cells and all are filled, the total W chips plus B chips equals 25. Since W and B are each \u226425, this is automatically satisfied as long as the counts are non-negative.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of such colorings of rows and columns with the above constraints, where each row and column is assigned a color (W, B, or E), such that:\n\n- For any row i and column j, if both are non-E, then their colors are equal.\n\n- Every cell (i,j) is in at least one non-E row or column.\n\nAdditionally, the assignments must use the chips: each W row contributes 5 W chips, each B row similarly, and similarly for columns. However, overlaps where a cell is in both a W row and W column don't add extra chips, since it's already counted.\n\nWait, actually, the total number of W chips is equal to the number of rows colored W multiplied by 5 plus the number of columns colored W multiplied by (5 - number of rows colored W). Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nEach cell (i,j) is in a row and column. If the row is colored W and the column is colored W, then the cell is W. If the row is W and the column is E, then the cell is W (since the column is empty, so the row's color determines it). Similarly, if the column is W and the row is E, the cell is W. If both are W, still W. If one is B and the other E, etc.\n\nActually, the color of each cell is determined by the following:\n\n- If the row is non-E, the cell's color is the row's color.\n\n- Else if the column is non-E, the cell's color is the column's color.\n\n- Else, the cell can be colored arbitrarily, but since the grid must be filled, but both row and column are E, so the cell must be filled with some color. However, in our constraints, this case cannot occur because every cell must be in at least one non-E row or column. \n\nTherefore, every cell's color is determined by its row's color if non-E, else by its column's color. Additionally, whenever both row and column are non-E, their colors must be equal.\n\nTherefore, the coloring is consistent if and only if for any two non-E rows and columns, their colors agree wherever they intersect. \n\nThis is equivalent to the following: \n\nAll non-E rows must have the same color.\n\nAll non-E columns must have the same color.\n\nMoreover, if there are both non-E rows and non-E columns, their colors must be the same.\n\nTherefore, the possible colorings are as follows:\n\nCase 1: All non-E rows are W, and all non-E columns are W.\n\nCase 2: All non-E rows are W, and all non-E columns are E (columns can be E).\n\nCase 3: All non-E rows are E, and all non-E columns are W.\n\nCase 4: All non-E rows are B, and all non-E columns are B.\n\nCase 5: All non-E rows are B, and all non-E columns are E.\n\nCase 6: All non-E rows are E, and all non-E columns are B.\n\nAdditionally, there are cases where both rows and columns are E, but that would leave the grid unfilled (since every cell would require at least one non-E row or column), so those are invalid.\n\nWait, let's structure it better.\n\nLet me consider the possible color assignments:\n\nLet R be the set of non-E rows, and C the set of non-E columns.\n\nThe colors of the rows in R must all be the same, say color X (W or B).\n\nThe colors of the columns in C must all be the same, say color Y (W or B).\n\nAdditionally, if both R and C are non-empty, then X must equal Y.\n\nTherefore, the possible scenarios are:\n\n1. All non-E rows are color X (W or B), and all non-E columns are color X (if any).\n\n2. All non-E rows are color X, and all non-E columns are E.\n\n3. All non-E columns are color Y, and all non-E rows are E.\n\n4. All non-E rows and columns are E, but this is invalid since then every cell would be in an E row and E column, so they must be filled, but there's no color assigned, so this is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the valid colorings are the first three cases.\n\nCase 1: Rows and columns (non-E ones) are all color X (W or B).\n\nCase 2: Rows are color X, columns are E.\n\nCase 3: Columns are color Y, rows are E.\n\nNow, we need to count the number of such colorings.\n\nFirst, note that in each case, the choice of which rows and columns are non-E must satisfy that every cell is in at least one non-E row or column.\n\nLet's handle each case separately.\n\nCase 1: All non-E rows are color X, and all non-E columns are color X (if any). \n\nAdditionally, every cell must be in a non-E row or column.\n\nLet me denote that in this case, the non-E rows and columns can be any subset, but they must cover the grid. Also, the rows and columns must be colored X.\n\nThe color X can be W or B, so we have two possibilities here.\n\nFirst, choose X (W or B).\n\nThen choose a subset of rows R and a subset of columns C such that:\n\n- All rows in R are color X.\n\n- All columns in C are color X.\n\n- For any cell (i,j), if row i is not in R and column j is not in C, then the cell would have to be covered by either a row or column, but since both are E, this is invalid. Therefore, the union of R and C must cover all cells, i.e., for every (i,j), row i \u2208 R or column j \u2208 C.\n\nAdditionally, the colors of rows not in R are E, columns not in C are E.\n\nTherefore, the number of such colorings for a fixed X is equal to the number of pairs (R,C) where R is a subset of rows, C is a subset of columns, and R \u00d7 columns \u222a rows \u00d7 C covers the grid (i.e., for every cell (i,j), row i \u2208 R or column j \u2208 C).\n\nThis is the same as the earlier problem of covering the grid with rows and columns, which we determined has S subsets for each color. Wait, but in this case, the count for each X is S, where S is the number of covering subsets (R,C). As before, S = 32 +32 -1 =63 for each color.\n\nBut since we have two choices for X (W or B), this case contributes 2\u00d763 =126.\n\nCase 2: Rows are color X (W or B), columns are all E.\n\nHere, all non-E rows are color X, and all columns are E.\n\nThe rows must form a subset R, and the columns are all E (so C=\u2205).\n\nAdditionally, the union of rows R must cover the grid (since columns are all E, so every cell must be in a row from R).\n\nTherefore, R must be a subset of rows such that every column has at least one row in R (since for any column j, every cell (i,j) must be in a row in R or column j in C (but C is empty), so must be in R).\n\nWait, no. For column j to be covered, every cell in column j must be in a row of R. Since column j is E, the requirement is that every cell in column j must be in a row from R. Therefore, the rows in R must cover all columns. \n\nWait, more precisely, for every column j and row i not in R, the cell (i,j) must be covered by a column in C, but C is empty. Therefore, row i must be in R. Wait no:\n\nWait, in this case, columns are all E, so to cover every cell (i,j), since the column is E, the row i must be in R (non-E), otherwise, the cell would be in an E row and E column, which is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the rows R must include all rows except possibly some, but every row not in R would leave their cells uncovered (since columns are E). Therefore, R must be all rows. \n\nWait, no, let me think again:\n\nIf we choose rows R (non-E) colored X, and columns are all E (C=\u2205).\n\nThen, for every cell (i,j), since the column j is E, the cell must be covered by row i \u2208 R. Therefore, every row must be in R; otherwise, any row not in R would have all its cells uncovered (since columns are E). \n\nTherefore, in this case, R must be all rows. \n\nTherefore, the only possibility here is R = all rows, and C=\u2205, with color X (W or B). \n\nTherefore, there are 2 colorings here (W or B).\n\nSimilarly for Case 3:\n\nCase 3: Columns are color Y (W or B), rows are all E.\n\nSimilarly, the columns must form a subset C such that every row is covered by C.\n\nThat is, for every row i, there must be at least one column in C to cover the cells in that row. Since rows are all E (R=\u2205), every cell (i,j) must be covered by column j \u2208 C. Therefore, the columns C must cover all rows, meaning every row has at least one column in C. \n\nWait, more precisely, for every row i and column j not in C, the cell (i,j) must be covered by row i \u2208 R (but R is empty), so must be in column j \u2208 C. Therefore, for every row i, every cell in that row must be in a column of C. Therefore, the columns C must include at least one column from each row? No, actually, the columns must cover all the rows in the sense that for any cell (i,j), if column j is not in C, then row i must be in R (which is empty). Therefore, every column not in C would leave the entire column uncovered, so all columns must be in C. \n\nWait, similar to the previous case:\n\nIf columns are non-E (color Y) and rows are all E (R=\u2205), then every cell must be in a column of C. Therefore, every column must be in C, so C must be all columns. \n\nTherefore, the only possibility is C=all columns, R=\u2205, with color Y (W or B). \n\nThus, 2 colorings here.\n\nTherefore, total for all cases:\n\nCase1: 126\n\nCase2:2\n\nCase3:2\n\nTotal:126+2+2=130.\n\nBut wait, let me verify:\n\nIn Case1, when we have both rows and columns colored X, we have S=63 subsets for each color, so 2\u00d763=126.\n\nCase2 and Case3 each contribute 2, so total 130.\n\nBut we must ensure that there is no overlap between the cases. \n\nFor example, if R=all rows and C=all columns with the same color, this is counted in Case1. It is also part of the subsets where R=all rows and C=all columns, which is included in S for that color.\n\nTherefore, no overlap.\n\nAdditionally, check the 1x1 case with this method:\n\nFor a 1x1 grid:\n\nCase1: X can be W or B. The subsets (R,C) must cover the cell. As before, S=3 for each color. So 2\u00d73=6.\n\nCase2: R=all rows (only 1 row), C=\u2205. So 2 colorings.\n\nCase3: C=all columns (only 1 column), R=\u2205. 2 colorings.\n\nTotal:6+2+2=10. But the correct answer should be 2. Clearly, something is wrong.\n\nHmm, this suggests my analysis is still incorrect.\n\nWait in the 1x1 case:\n\nThe possible valid colorings must be:\n\nEither:\n\n- All cells (the single cell) is W or B (Case1 with R=all rows and C=all columns, or R=all rows or C=all columns).\n\n- Or, according to Case2 and Case3:\n\nCase2: R=all rows (so the cell is W or B), and C=\u2205. This is the same as coloring the cell via the row.\n\nCase3: C=all columns (same cell via column). \n\nTherefore, in total:\n\nCase1 includes:\n\n- Choosing R and C such that they cover the cell. The subsets are:\n\n   a. R={row}, any C (including \u2205). So for each color, 2 subsets (C can be \u2205 or {col}).\n\n   b. C={col}, any R (including \u2205). So another 2 subsets.\n\n   c. Subtract overlap where R and C are both {row} and {col}, counted twice.\n\nThus for each color, S=2+2-1=3. So Case1 gives 3\u00d72=6.\n\nCase2 and Case3 each give 2, so total 10. But the correct answer is 2.\n\nThis indicates the approach is still flawed.\n\nThe problem is that different subsets in Case1 can lead to the same coloring. For example, in Case1 for W:\n\n- Choosing R={row}, C={col} (both selected) results in the cell being W.\n\n- Choosing R={row}, C=\u2205 also results in the cell being W (since the row is W).\n\n- Choosing R=\u2205, C={col} also results in W.\n\nThese are all the same coloring. Thus, in the count for Case1, each color has S=3 subsets but they all result in the same coloring for that color. So instead of 3\u00d72=6, it should be 2 (one for W, one for B).\n\nTherefore, my mistake is that in Case1, the number of colorings per color is not S but 1. Because any subset (R,C) that covers the grid with color X results in the entire grid being X, since wherever you have a row or column in R/C, they are X, and their union covers everything, so every cell is X.\n\nWait, yes! If in Case1, all non-E rows and columns are color X, and their union covers the grid, then every cell is in at least one non-E row or column, so each cell's color is X. Hence, the entire grid is monochromatic X. Therefore, for each color X, there is only one such coloring (all cells X). The subsets (R,C) that cover the grid in Case1 all result in the same monochromatic grid. Therefore, for each color, Case1 contributes 1 coloring.\n\nSimilarly, in the 1x1 case, Case1 for W contributes 1 coloring (all W), and similarly for B.\n\nCase2 and Case3 in the 1x1 case:\n\nCase2 requires R=all rows (so the cell is W or B) and C=\u2205. This results in the cell being W or B, same as the monochromatic colorings. But these are already counted in Case1.\n\nAh! Here's the overlap. Case2 and Case3 are subsets of Case1.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Case2 (all rows colored X, columns E) is a subset of Case1 where C=\u2205. But in this scenario, since R=all rows (to cover the grid), this results in the entire grid being X, same as Case1.\n\nSimilarly, Case3 is the same as choosing C=all columns and R=\u2205, which also results in the entire grid being Y.\n\nTherefore, the cases overlap, and we are overcounting.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is:\n\nThe only valid colorings are:\n\n1. The entire grid is monochromatic (all W or all B).\n\n2. Some rows are colored W and the rest are E, with no columns colored, provided the rows cover the grid. But this requires all rows are colored (since otherwise, the columns are E, so uncovered rows would leave cells uncovered). Thus this is the same as monochromatic.\n\n3. Similarly for columns.\n\nTherefore, the only valid maximal arrangements are the two monochromatic colorings. \n\nThis brings us back to the initial conclusion of 2, but that contradicts the problem's complexity. \n\nHowever, in the problem statement, it says \"any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions\". \n\nWait, if the grid is not fully filled, then you can add a chip, but in our analysis, the maximality requires that every cell is filled. \n\nTherefore, the only maximal arrangements are the two monochromatic colorings. \n\nBut this seems too simple, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's consider an example of a non-monochromatic maximal arrangement.\n\nSuppose in a 2x2 grid:\n\n- Color the first row white and the first column black.\n\nBut this would conflict at cell (1,1), since the row is white and column is black. Hence invalid.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- Color the first row white and the second column black. Then:\n\nRow1 is white (cells (1,1), (1,2) are white).\n\nColumn2 is black (cells (1,2), (2,2) are black).\n\nConflict at (1,2): must be both white and black. Invalid.\n\nAnother try:\n\nColor row1 white and column2 white. Then:\n\nRow1: cells (1,1), (1,2) white.\n\nColumn2: cells (1,2), (2,2) white.\n\nThe cell (2,1) must be covered by row2 or column1. If row2 and column1 are empty, then cell (2,1) must be filled, but its row and column are empty, so you could choose any color. To be maximal, it must be filled. Suppose we color it white. Then the entire grid is white. \n\nAlternatively, if row2 is empty and column1 is empty, then cell (2,1) must be filled with any color, but choosing a different color would violate the maximality because you could change it. Wait, no. The color must be consistent with row and column. Since row2 and column1 are empty, the cell can be colored arbitrarily, but once colored, it must not allow further additions. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Perhaps the only way to satisfy all conditions is to have the entire grid monochromatic. \n\nGiven the problem's requirement that any chip addition would violate the conditions, and that each row and column must be monochromatic or empty, the only way to prevent adding any chips is to have every row and column fully filled with a single color, and all rows and columns agree on that color. \n\nTherefore, the only maximal arrangements are the two monochromatic colorings. \n\nHence, the answer would be 2. But this seems unlikely for a problem that specifies a 5x5 grid and gives a large number of chips. \n\nWait, perhaps there's another way. Suppose some rows are white and some columns are black, but arranged so that their intersections are empty. \n\nFor example, suppose we have two white rows and three black columns arranged such that their intersections are empty. \n\nLet me try with a 2x2 grid:\n\nLet rows 1 be white, column 2 be black. \n\nThen:\n\n- Row1 must be entirely white: cells (1,1) and (1,2) white.\n\n- Column2 must be entirely black: cells (1,2) and (2,2) black.\n\nConflict at (1,2). Not possible.\n\nAnother idea: have some rows white and some columns black, but their intersections are not part of the grid. Not possible in a square grid.\n\nAlternatively, have some rows white and some columns empty, and some columns black and some rows empty, such that the non-overlapping parts are filled appropriately.\n\nWait, suppose in a 2x2 grid:\n\n- Row1 is white, column1 is black.\n\n- The intersection (1,1) would have to be both white and black, impossible.\n\nAlternatively, have row1 white, column2 empty.\n\nThen:\n\n- Row1: cells (1,1), (1,2) white.\n\n- Column2 is empty, so cells (2,2) must be covered by row2. If row2 is empty, then cell (2,2) must be filled, but row2 and column2 are empty, so it can be any color. To be maximal, it must be filled, but choosing white or black would allow adding another color?\n\nWait, this is too convoluted. Given the time I've spent and the risk of further confusion, perhaps the correct answer is 2, but I recall that in similar problems, the answer often involves 2^(n+1) -2 or something similar. \n\nWait, let's think differently. Suppose that the rows and columns can be independently chosen to be white, black, or empty, with the constraints that whenever a row and column are both non-empty, they agree. Also, every cell must be covered by at least one non-empty row or column.\n\nThis is equivalent to choosing a color for each row and column (including E), such that for all i,j:\n\n- If row i and column j are non-E, then row i's color = column j's color.\n\n- Every cell (i,j) is covered by at least one non-E row or column.\n\nLet me denote that all non-E rows and columns must have the same color, say X (W or B). \n\nTherefore, the possible scenarios are:\n\n1. All non-E rows and columns are white.\n\n2. All non-E rows and columns are black.\n\n3. All non-E rows are white and all non-E columns are E (so columns are E).\n\n4. All non-E columns are white and all non-E rows are E.\n\nSimilarly for black.\n\nAdditionally, the non-E rows and columns must cover the grid.\n\nCase1 and 2 are when there are non-E rows and columns of the same color.\n\nCases3 and 4 are when only rows or only columns are non-E.\n\nLet me count each case:\n\nCase1: All non-E rows and columns are white.\n\nChoose a subset R of rows and subset C of columns, all colored white, such that every cell is in R or C.\n\nThe number of such pairs (R,C) is S=32+32-1=63 (as before), but each corresponds to the same coloring where all covered cells are white. However, the actual distinct colorings are determined by the regions:\n\nWait no, the coloring is such that all cells in R or C are white, and the rest must be filled by the other direction? No, no. Since the non-E rows and columns are white, every cell in a white row or white column is white. Since they cover the grid, all cells are white. Therefore, this case contributes only 1 coloring (all white).\n\nSimilarly, Case2 contributes 1 (all black).\n\nCase3: All non-E rows are white, columns are E.\n\nHere, the rows must form a subset R such that every column is covered by R (since columns are E, so every cell must be in a row of R). Therefore R must cover all columns, which requires R to be all rows. \n\nTherefore, this case contributes 1 coloring (all white).\n\nSimilarly, Case4 contributes 1 (all black).\n\nSimilarly for the analogous cases with black rows and E columns, etc.\n\nWait, so total:\n\n- All white: can be achieved via Case1 (any R,C covering) or Case3 (R=all rows).\n\nBut in reality, both Case1 and Case3 result in all white. Therefore, they are overlapping.\n\nSimilarly for black.\n\nTherefore, the total distinct colorings are:\n\n- All white (1 way).\n\n- All black (1 way).\n\n- Additionally, arrangements where only rows are non-E (but not all) but this would require that the rows cover the grid, which requires all rows to be chosen (as in Case3).\n\nSimilarly for columns.\n\nHence, only two colorings.\n\nTherefore, the answer must be 2. But the problem mentions \"some of the chips\", implying that not all must be used. But according to maximality, all must be used.\n\nHence, the answer is 2.\n\nBut I'm unsure because the problem might have other solutions. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another possibility: suppose some rows are white and some columns are white, but not all, such that their union covers the grid. For example, in a 5x5 grid, choose rows 1-3 as white and columns 4-5 as white. Their union covers the grid. The color of all cells in these rows or columns is white. The remaining cells (rows 4-5 and columns 1-3) are not in any non-E row or column, which violates maximality because those cells must be filled. Since their rows and columns are empty, they must be filled with any color, but to be maximal, they must be filled with white or black such that no further chips can be added.\n\nWait, but if the remaining cells are in rows 4-5 and columns 1-3, which are empty, you could choose to fill them with black. Then the rows 4-5 would be non-E (black) and columns 1-3 would be non-E (black). However, this would require that all non-E rows (4-5) and columns (1-3) are black, and their intersection must agree. The intersection of rows4-5 and columns1-3 would be black, which is okay. \n\nThis way, the entire grid is partitioned into white rows 1-3 and white columns 4-5, and black rows4-5 and columns1-3. But the overlapping region at rows4-5 and columns4-5 must be black (due to rows) and white (due to columns), which is a conflict. \n\nTherefore, this is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, if you set the remaining cells to white, then rows4-5 and columns1-3 would be non-E but their cells are white, so their color must be white. But then rows4-5 are non-E (since they have white chips), so their color must be white, and columns1-3's non-E must also be white. Therefore, all non-E rows and columns are white, which means the entire grid is white. \n\nThus, any such attempt results in the entire grid being monochromatic.\n\nTherefore, I think the only maximal arrangements are the two monochromatic colorings. Hence, the answer is 2.\n\nBut the problem states \"some of these chips\" implying that not all chips need to be used. However, in a maximal arrangement, all cells must be filled (as otherwise you could add a chip), so all 25 chips must be used. Since there are 25 white and 25 black chips available, this is possible for both colors. Hence, the answer is 2.\n\nBut the problem might be expecting more, perhaps considering that rows and columns can be partially filled but with the maximality condition. But based on the analysis, it's only two ways.\n\nWait, let me think of another possibility:\n\nSuppose we have some rows colored white and some columns colored black, arranged so that their intersections are empty. For example, in a 5x5 grid:\n\n- Color the first 3 rows white.\n\n- Color the last 3 columns black.\n\nThe intersection of the first 3 rows and last 3 columns is a 3x3 grid where the rows want white and columns want black\u2014conflict. So that's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, color rows 1-2 white and columns 4-5 black. Their intersection is rows1-2, columns4-5 which must be both white and black\u2014conflict.\n\nAnother idea: color some rows white and some columns black, but ensure that their intersections are covered by other rows or columns.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Rows 1-2 white.\n\n- Columns 3-5 black.\n\n- Rows 3-5 and columns 1-2 must be empty, but then the cells in rows3-5, columns1-2 must be filled since their rows and columns are empty. But those cells can be colored arbitrarily, but choosing white or black would create a conflict.\n\nSuppose you color those cells white:\n\n- Then rows3-5 have white chips (so they must be colored white), conflicting with their columns1-2 which are empty.\n\nWait, this is too confusing. I think the only possible solutions are the two monochromatic colorings. Therefore, the answer is 2.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. The problem might allow for a checkerboard pattern? Let me see.\n\nSuppose alternating colors in rows and columns such that every row and column is monochromatic but alternating colors. However, this would require that adjacent rows and columns have different colors, leading to conflicts at intersections. For example, row1 white, row2 black, etc. Then column1 white, column2 black, etc. The cell (1,1) would be white (row1) and white (column1), okay. Cell (1,2) white (row1) vs column2 black\u2014conflict.\n\nThus impossible.\n\nTherefore, I think the only valid maximal arrangements are the two monochromatic colorings. Hence, the answer is 2. \n\nBut the problem might have a different answer. Alternatively, perhaps the rows and columns can be set to E in a way that allows partial filling without conflicts.\n\nWait, another approach:\n\nThe problem requires that all chips in the same row/column have the same color, but doesn't require the entire row/column to be filled. Maximality requires that you can't add any more chips without violating the color condition.\n\nSuppose we have some rows colored white and some columns colored black, such that their intersections are empty. For example:\n\n- Rows 1-2 are white (so all their cells are white).\n\n- Columns 4-5 are black (so all their cells are black).\n\n- The remaining cells (rows3-5, columns1-3) must be filled with some color, but since their rows and columns are empty, they can be colored arbitrarily, but must be filled.\n\nTo maintain maximality, these remaining cells must be filled in such a way that you can't add any more chips.\n\nSuppose we color those cells white. Then rows3-5 have white chips, so they must be colored white. Thus rows3-5 are white. The columns1-3 have white chips, so they must be colored white. Thus columns1-3 are white. \n\nNow, the columns4-5 are black, which conflicts with rows1-2 at columns4-5 (which should be white due to rows, but black due to columns). \n\nConflict at cells (1,4), (1,5), etc.\n\nTherefore, this is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, color the remaining cells black:\n\nThen rows3-5 have black chips (so must be black), columns1-3 have black chips (so must be black). Now columns1-3 are black and columns4-5 are black. Rows1-2 are white and rows3-5 are black. \n\nThe intersections between rows1-2 and columns1-3 must be white (due to rows) but black (due to columns)\u2014conflict.\n\nThus, impossible.\n\nTherefore, no such arrangement is possible.\n\nHence, the only maximal arrangements are the two monochromatic colorings.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{2}.\n\n\nThe problem requires finding the number of ways to place chips on a 5x5 grid such that each row and column is monochromatic or empty, and the placement is maximal (no additional chips can be placed without violating the conditions). \n\nKey steps:\n1. **Maximality Condition**: Every cell must be filled because an empty cell could otherwise have a chip placed, violating maximality.\n2. **Color Consistency**: If a row and column intersect, their colors must agree if both are non-empty.\n3. **Monochromatic Requirement**: The only way to satisfy all conditions is if the entire grid is filled with a single color (white or black). Any other configuration would lead to conflicts or uncovered cells.\n\nThus, the only valid maximal arrangements are the two monochromatic colorings (all white or all black).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about arranging white and black chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThere are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinct. I need to place some of them into the 25 unit cells of a 5x5 grid with the following conditions:\n\n1. Each cell can have at most one chip.\n2. All chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color.\n3. The arrangement must be maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips without violating the previous conditions.\n\nHmm, so first, let me parse the constraints one by one. \n\nStarting with the second condition: in any row, all chips must be the same color. Similarly, in any column, all chips must be the same color. That seems like each row is either all white or all black (if it has chips), and same for each column. Wait, but actually, a row could have no chips, right? Because \"some of these chips\" can be placed. So rows and columns can be empty or filled with chips of one color. But the key is that if a row has chips, they must all be the same color, and similarly for columns.\n\nBut also, the third condition says that it's maximal. So there's no way to add another chip without violating the first two conditions. So that means that for any empty cell, if you try to place a chip there, either its row or column would have to have a different color. \n\nSo, for a cell to be empty, either its row is already filled with chips of one color (so adding another chip there would exceed the row's capacity?) Wait, no. Wait, actually, each row can have some number of chips, but they all must be the same color. But the row could have some number of chips, but since the grid is 5x5, each row has 5 cells. Wait, but the problem says \"each cell contains at most one chip,\" so each row can have 0 to 5 chips, all of the same color. Similarly for columns.\n\nBut the maximality condition requires that you can't add any more chips. So for any empty cell, if you try to put a chip there, either:\n\n- The row already has chips of a different color, so you can't add a chip of another color, or\n\n- The column already has chips of a different color, so same thing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the row is already full (i.e., all 5 cells are filled with chips of a color), so you can't add another chip there? Wait, but each cell can have at most one chip, so if a row has all 5 cells filled, you can't add any more. But in that case, the row is already full, so that cell can't be filled.\n\nTherefore, the maximality condition requires that for every empty cell, either its row is already filled (all 5 cells occupied, so can't add more), or the row has some chips but they are of a color different from what you would want to place (if you tried to place a white chip in a row that already has black chips, you can't, so you can't place it there), or same for the column.\n\nWait, actually, maybe the maximality is that for every empty cell, there is no color you can put there without violating the row or column color constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the row or column must already have chips of one color, so you can't add a chip of the other color. But if the row is empty, then you could add a chip of either color, so to be maximal, that cell must be filled?\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think of it as follows: the arrangement is maximal if every empty cell cannot have a chip placed in it because either:\n\n- The row already has chips of a particular color (so you can't put a different color there, and you can't add the same color if the row is already full? Wait, if the row is not full, but already has some chips of a color, you could add more of that color. Wait, but then the maximality would require that you can't add any more chips. So maybe in order for a cell to be empty, either:\n\n- The row has chips of one color, and the column has chips of a different color, so you can't place either color there without conflicting with row or column.\n\nOr perhaps the row is already filled (so you can't add anything), or the column is already filled (same), or the row and column have conflicting colors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximality requires that every empty cell is blocked by either its row being filled with one color or its column being filled with another. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the constraints on the rows and columns. Each row can be in one of the following states:\n\n- All cells are empty.\n\n- All non-empty cells in the row are white, and there are some number (1-5) of them.\n\n- All non-empty cells in the row are black, and there are some number (1-5) of them.\n\nSimilarly for each column.\n\nHowever, the row's non-empty cells must all be the same color, and the column's non-empty cells must all be the same color.\n\nAdditionally, the arrangement must be maximal, so you can't add any more chips. Therefore, for every empty cell (i,j), if you tried to put a white chip there, either:\n\n- The row i already has black chips (so you can't add white), or the row i has white chips but is already full (so can't add more), or the column j has black chips (so can't add white), or the column j has white chips but is already full (so can't add more). Wait, but actually, the column's color must also be considered.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is: To place a chip at (i,j), it must be of the same color as the row's current color (if the row is non-empty) or the same as the column's current color (if the column is non-empty). But since the row and column must both have the same color for that cell, the color of the row and column must agree. If they don't agree, then you can't place a chip there. So, if row i has white chips and column j has black chips, then cell (i,j) can't have a chip, because it would have to be both white and black. So such a cell must remain empty.\n\nTherefore, in order for the arrangement to be maximal, every empty cell must be blocked because either its row and column have conflicting colors, or the row is already full (so you can't add more), or the column is already full (same). Wait, but if the row has some color and isn't full, can't you add another chip of the same color? But if you can add another chip of the same color, then the arrangement isn't maximal. Therefore, for the arrangement to be maximal, whenever a row is not full, its column constraints must block adding more chips. Wait, perhaps the rows and columns must be such that any empty cell is either in a row that's already filled (so can't add more) or in a column that's already filled, or the row's color and column's color conflict.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal condition requires that for every empty cell (i,j), either:\n\n- The row i is non-empty and the column j is non-empty, but their colors are different. So you can't put a chip there because you can't satisfy both.\n\nOr,\n\n- The row i is non-empty and already has the maximum number of chips (i.e., all 5 cells filled with, say, white), so you can't add more.\n\nOr,\n\n- The column j is non-empty and already has all 5 cells filled, so can't add more.\n\nBut also, if a row is non-full but its column is also non-full, but same color, then you could add a chip there. Therefore, in a maximal arrangement, such cells must not exist. So for every cell that is empty, either:\n\nEither the row is full, or the column is full, or the row and column have conflicting colors.\n\nTherefore, the arrangement must be such that for every empty cell, one of these three conditions holds.\n\nHmm, this is a bit complex. Maybe a better approach is to model this as a matrix where each row is assigned a color (or none) and a number of chips, and each column similarly, with constraints that if a cell is in a row with color R and column with color C, then R must equal C or at least one of them is empty. Also, the total chips must not exceed 25 of each color.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows and columns can be partitioned into those that are colored and those that are not, with the colored rows and columns' colors needing to agree where they intersect.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be approached by considering that the grid is partitioned into regions where rows and columns have colors, and the intersections must agree. Let me think of it in terms of selecting certain rows and columns to be colored, and their colors must agree where they cross.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as choosing for each row a color (white, black, or none) and a number of chips (from 0 to 5), and similarly for each column, but ensuring that the row's color and column's color agree wherever they intersect. Also, the total white chips can't exceed 25, same for black.\n\nWait, but since the chips are indistinct, maybe we can model it as selecting a subset of rows and columns with colors, such that:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\n- If the row i is colored white, then all cells in row i must be white (but how many? Wait, actually, each row can have some number of chips, but all the same color. But actually, if a row is colored white, does that mean all its cells are filled with white chips? Or does it mean that any chips in that row must be white, but they can be a subset?\n\nWait the problem says \"each cell contains at most one chip\". So a row can have 0 to 5 chips, but all of the same color. Similarly for columns. So the color of the row is determined by the color of the chips in it, if any. So if a row has some white chips, it's a white row; if it has black chips, it's a black row; if it has none, it's uncolored. Similarly for columns.\n\nBut the constraints are that for any row and column, their intersection must be either:\n\n- Both uncolored (so the cell can be empty),\n\n- Both colored with the same color (so the cell can have a chip of that color),\n\n- Or one is colored and the other is uncolored, but then the cell can only be filled if the colored one's color is used, but the other is uncolored.\n\nWait, actually, the color of the row and column must agree on the cell's color. So if a row is white and a column is black, then their intersection cell can't have a chip, because it would need to be both white and black. So such a cell must be empty. \n\nTherefore, to have a valid arrangement, the colors of the rows and columns must be such that whenever a row and column are both colored, they must have the same color. Wait, no, not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose row i is white (meaning all chips in it are white) and column j is black (all chips in it are black). Then at their intersection cell (i,j), the cell can't have a chip because it would have to be both white and black. Therefore, in such a case, cell (i,j) must be empty. However, the row and column can both be colored with different colors as long as their intersection is empty. But in that case, the arrangement isn't maximal, because you could potentially add a chip somewhere else?\n\nWait, actually, the problem requires that the arrangement is maximal. So in such a scenario where row i is white and column j is black, their intersection cell (i,j) can't have a chip, but maybe there are other cells in row i or column j that can still have chips? Wait no, if the row is white, then all chips in row i must be white, so column j, which is black, can't have any chips in that row, so in column j, the cells in row i must be empty. But if column j is black, then its other cells (not in row i) must be black. \n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should model the grid as follows:\n\nLet me consider that each row can be in one of three states: white (W), black (B), or empty (E). Similarly, each column can be in W, B, or E. However, for any cell (i,j), if row i is W and column j is B, then that cell must be empty, because it can't be both. Similarly, if row i is W and column j is W, then the cell can be filled with a white chip, but the row and column can have some number of chips (but all same color). Wait, but how does the number of chips come into play here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows and columns that are colored (i.e., non-empty) must have their colors agree wherever they intersect. So the set of white rows and columns must form a rectangle? Or something like that?\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to think of the grid as being partitioned into regions where all the rows and columns of a particular color form a rectangle. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, let's think of the problem as choosing for each row a color (W, B, or E) and a number of chips (0 to 5 if E, but if colored, then the number can be from 1 to 5). Similarly for columns. But the color assignments must be compatible in that wherever a row and column are both non-empty, their colors must match. Additionally, the total number of white chips is the sum over all white rows of their number of chips, and similarly for black, but also considering the columns? Wait, no, actually the total white chips would be the sum over all white rows of their number of chips, but we have to ensure that in the columns as well. Wait, this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key idea is that the set of rows colored white must correspond to columns colored white, and similarly for black. Let me think of it this way: if a row is white, then all the columns that have a chip in that row must also be white. Similarly, if a column is white, all the rows that have a chip in that column must also be white. Therefore, the white rows and white columns form a subgrid where all their intersections are white chips. Similarly for black.\n\nWait, that might be the key. Let me formalize that.\n\nSuppose we have some white rows and white columns. The intersection of white rows and white columns must be filled with white chips. Similarly, black rows and black columns must intersect in black chips. Also, a row cannot be both white and black, obviously. \n\nMoreover, since the arrangement is maximal, every cell not in a white or black subgrid must be blocked by either the row or column being non-matching or full.\n\nAlternatively, the maximal condition implies that if a row is white, it must be fully filled with white chips, otherwise, you could add more. Wait, but the problem allows rows to have any number of chips as long as they are the same color. However, the maximality condition requires that you can't add any more chips. Therefore, if a row is white and has, say, 3 chips, then there must be at least one column in that row which is already black, so you can't add more white chips? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal condition requires that any row that is colored (non-empty) must be completely filled with its color, otherwise you could add more chips. Wait, that might make sense. Let me see.\n\nSuppose a row is white with 3 chips. Then, the remaining 2 cells in that row are empty. But if those cells are in columns that are either empty or also white, then you could add a white chip there. But since the arrangement is maximal, you can't. Therefore, those columns must be either colored black or already filled with white chips. Wait, but if the columns are white, then the row could be filled further. Therefore, in order to prevent adding more, those columns must be black or already filled? Wait, perhaps if a row is not completely filled, then the columns of the empty cells in that row must be colored with a different color (black), so that you can't add white chips there. But if the columns are colored black, then their intersection with this row would require that the cell can't have a chip (since row is white and column is black). Therefore, those cells must be empty, and the columns are black. But then the columns being black must have their own constraints.\n\nThis is getting really complicated. Maybe another way is to model this as a matrix where the rows and columns are either white, black, or empty, with the constraints that:\n\n1. For any cell (i,j), if row i is white and column j is white, then the cell can have a white chip.\n\n2. Similarly, if row i is black and column j is black, the cell can have a black chip.\n\n3. If row i and column j have different colors, the cell must be empty.\n\n4. If either the row or column is empty, the cell can be filled only if the other is also non-empty and of the same color? Wait, no.\n\nAlternatively, if a row is empty (E), then its cells can be filled only if the column they are in is also empty? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only allowed colored cells are those where the row and column have the same color. So:\n\n- A white cell must be in a white row and a white column.\n\n- A black cell must be in a black row and a black column.\n\n- An empty cell is either in a row and column of different colors, or at least one is empty.\n\nTherefore, the entire arrangement can be considered as two disjoint subgrids: one consisting of white rows and columns forming a rectangle (all intersections of white rows and columns are white chips), and similarly for black rows and columns forming another rectangle (but they can't overlap with white ones). Also, the remaining rows and columns can be unassigned (empty).\n\nMoreover, since the arrangement must be maximal, the white and black regions must be as large as possible. Wait, not exactly, but the maximality condition is that you can't add any more chips. So the white and black regions must be such that you can't add any more chips in the white rows/columns or black rows/columns without violating the color constraints.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the white rows and white columns form a complete rectangle: all intersections of white rows and white columns must be filled with white chips. Similarly for black. Otherwise, if there's an empty cell in the white region, you could add a white chip there, contradicting maximality.\n\nAh! That must be it. So for the white region, if you have some rows and columns designated as white, then all the cells at the intersection of a white row and white column must be filled with white chips. Because otherwise, you could add a white chip there. Similarly for black. Therefore, the white region is a rectangle determined by the set of white rows and white columns, and all those cells must be filled. Similarly for black. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to selecting a subset of rows and columns for white and black such that:\n\n1. The white region is the rectangle formed by the white rows and white columns, all filled with white chips.\n\n2. The black region is the rectangle formed by the black rows and black columns, all filled with black chips.\n\n3. The white and black regions do not overlap (since a cell can't be both white and black).\n\n4. The total number of white chips (rows_white * columns_white) plus black chips (rows_black * columns_black) does not exceed 25 each, but actually, since there are 25 white and 25 black chips available, but the total can be up to 25 each, but the problem says \"some of these chips\" so maybe we can use less? Wait, but the arrangement must be maximal, so perhaps they have to use as many as possible? Wait no, maximal just means you can't add more, but you can have fewer as long as adding more isn't possible.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.\" So the arrangement is maximal in the sense that it can't have any more chips added, but it doesn't necessarily have to use all the chips. However, since the chips are indistinct, maybe the count is just based on the possible regions.\n\nBut given that there are 25 white and 25 black chips, perhaps the regions can't exceed those numbers. Wait, but the problem allows using any number up to 25 of each. However, the arrangement must be such that you can't add any more chips. Therefore, the regions must be filled completely in their rectangles. \n\nTherefore, the white region is a rectangle of white rows and white columns, filled completely, and similarly for black. Moreover, the white and black regions can't overlap, so their row and column sets must be disjoint.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing two disjoint sets of rows and columns for white and black, such that:\n\n- Let W_rows be the set of white rows, W_cols the set of white columns. Similarly B_rows and B_cols for black.\n\n- The white region is W_rows \u00d7 W_cols, filled with white chips.\n\n- The black region is B_rows \u00d7 B_cols, filled with black chips.\n\n- The white and black regions must not overlap: so W_rows and B_rows are disjoint, and W_cols and B_cols are disjoint? Wait, no. Wait, the regions overlap only if a row is in both W_rows and B_rows, or a column is in both W_cols and B_cols. But actually, the regions can't overlap in cells. A cell is in both white and black regions only if it is in both W_rows \u00d7 W_cols and B_rows \u00d7 B_cols, which requires that its row is in both W_rows and B_rows, and column in both W_cols and B_cols. Since the cell can't be both colors, so the regions must be disjoint. Therefore, the sets W_rows and B_rows must be disjoint, and W_cols and B_cols must be disjoint. Wait, actually, not necessarily. Suppose a row is in neither W nor B, then it's empty. Similarly for columns. So the white and black regions are in separate row and column sets.\n\nWait, more precisely, the white rows and columns define a rectangle, and the black rows and columns define another rectangle, and these rectangles cannot intersect. That is, the intersection of the white rows and columns with the black rows and columns must be empty. Which would require that W_rows and B_rows are disjoint, and W_cols and B_cols are disjoint. Because if there was a row in both W and B, then the intersection of that row with a column in both W and B would be a cell that is in both regions, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the rows are partitioned into three parts: white rows, black rows, and empty rows. Similarly for columns. Let me denote:\n\nLet R_w be the number of white rows, R_b the number of black rows, R_e =5 - R_w - R_b empty rows.\n\nSimilarly C_w, C_b, C_e for columns.\n\nThen the white region has R_w \u00d7 C_w cells, all filled with white chips. The black region has R_b \u00d7 C_b cells, all filled with black chips. The total white chips used are R_w * C_w, and black chips R_b * C_b. These must satisfy:\n\nR_w * C_w \u2264 25,\n\nR_b * C_b \u2264 25,\n\nAlso, since the regions don't overlap, the rows and columns for white and black must be disjoint. So the total rows used are R_w + R_b \u22645,\n\nSimilarly columns: C_w + C_b \u22645.\n\nAdditionally, since the arrangement is maximal, we can't add any more white or black chips. \n\nWait, but the maximality condition implies that:\n\n- For any row not in white or black, if you tried to make it a white row, you would need to have some columns not already in black or white to form a rectangle. But since it's maximal, you can't. Similarly for columns. Hmm, actually, perhaps the maximality is already enforced by the regions being as large as possible given the disjointness? Not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nWait, according to the previous reasoning, the white and black regions must be filled completely. Because if there was a white row and column that wasn't filled, you could add a chip there, which would violate maximality. Therefore, indeed, the white and black regions must be filled to their full rectangle sizes. Therefore, the regions are maximal in the sense that you can't expand them without overlapping. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to selecting:\n\n- A set of rows and columns for white (W_rows, W_cols),\n\n- A set of rows and columns for black (B_rows, B_cols),\n\nsuch that:\n\n1. W_rows \u2229 B_rows = \u2205,\n\n2. W_cols \u2229 B_cols = \u2205,\n\n3. The white region is W_rows \u00d7 W_cols,\n\n4. The black region is B_rows \u00d7 B_cols,\n\n5. The number of white chips R_w * C_w \u226425,\n\n6. The number of black chips R_b * C_b \u226425,\n\nBut actually, since there are exactly 25 white and black chips available, but the problem says \"some of these chips\", so actually, the counts can be anything up to 25, but the arrangement just has to be maximal. Wait, but since the regions are filled completely, the number of white chips is exactly R_w*C_w, and black is R_b*C_b. The problem allows using up to 25 of each, but since we have 25 of each, the counts can be up to 25. So we just need R_w*C_w \u226425 and R_b*C_b \u226425. But since they are filled completely, the regions can't be expanded further. \n\nAdditionally, the remaining rows and columns (not in W or B) can't have any chips, because if they did, they would have to form their own regions, but they are not assigned to white or black. Wait, actually, the remaining rows and columns could potentially be partially filled, but given the constraints. \n\nWait, actually, no. Because any row not in W_rows or B_rows must be empty. Because if a row is not a white or black row, then it can't have any chips (since all chips in a row must be the same color; if it has any chips, they would have to form a color, but since it's not in W or B rows, that would conflict). Similarly for columns. \n\nTherefore, all non-W and non-B rows must be empty, and same for columns. Therefore, the entire grid is partitioned into three regions:\n\n1. The white rectangle W_rows \u00d7 W_cols,\n\n2. The black rectangle B_rows \u00d7 B_cols,\n\n3. The remaining cells (not in W_rows or B_rows, or not in W_cols or B_cols) must be empty.\n\nMoreover, these two rectangles cannot overlap, so the row and column sets must be disjoint as above.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to choose:\n\n- Two disjoint subsets of rows (W_rows and B_rows),\n\n- Two disjoint subsets of columns (W_cols and B_cols),\n\nsuch that:\n\n- The white area (R_w \u00d7 C_w) and black area (R_b \u00d7 C_b) do not exceed 25 chips each,\n\n- Additionally, since the regions can't be expanded further, meaning that if you tried to add another row or column to W or B, it would cause the product to exceed 25, or overlap with the other region?\n\nWait, actually, the maximality is already enforced by the fact that the regions are filled completely. Because if you could add another row to W_rows, keeping the columns same, then you could have a larger rectangle, but since it's maximal, you can't. Therefore, the current regions must be as large as possible given their row and column sets. Wait, perhaps the maximality in the problem's condition is already captured by the way we're defining the regions as filled rectangles. \n\nTherefore, the problem is to count all possible such configurations (W_rows, W_cols, B_rows, B_cols) with the constraints above, and then sum over all valid configurations. \n\nAdditionally, since the chips are indistinct, the only thing that matters is the number of rows and columns chosen for each color, and their positions. Wait, but the positions matter because different choices of rows and columns (even with same counts) can lead to different arrangements. For example, choosing rows 1,2 as white and columns 1,2 as white is different from rows 1,3 and columns 1,3.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is the sum over all possible R_w, C_w, R_b, C_b (with R_w + R_b \u22645, C_w + C_b \u22645, R_w*C_w \u226425, R_b*C_b \u226425), of:\n\n[Number of ways to choose W_rows (R_w rows) and W_cols (C_w columns)] \u00d7 [Number of ways to choose B_rows (R_b rows) from remaining rows and B_cols (C_b columns) from remaining columns].\n\nBut we have to ensure that the white and black regions are disjoint in both rows and columns. So once we choose W_rows and W_cols, the B_rows must be chosen from the remaining rows (5 - R_w), and B_cols from remaining columns (5 - C_w). Additionally, the black region's rows and columns can't overlap with white's.\n\nTherefore, for each possible R_w, C_w, R_b, C_b where:\n\n- R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b are non-negative integers,\n\n- R_w + R_b \u22645,\n\n- C_w + C_b \u22645,\n\n- R_w*C_w \u226425,\n\n- R_b*C_b \u226425,\n\nthe number of arrangements is:\n\nC(5, R_w) * C(5, C_w) * C(5 - R_w, R_b) * C(5 - C_w, C_b).\n\nAdditionally, we have to consider that the white and black regions can be arranged in any way as long as they don't overlap. Also, note that white and black can be swapped? Wait, no, because white and black are distinct colors, so choosing white with certain rows and columns and black with others is different from swapping their colors unless the regions are the same size and shape. So we don't have to worry about overcounting due to color swapping unless the regions are symmetric.\n\nTherefore, the total number is the sum over all valid R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b of the product as above.\n\nHowever, this seems very involved. Let me see if there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of the problem as first choosing the white rectangle and then the black rectangle in the remaining space, or vice versa.\n\nLet me consider that the entire grid can have white and black rectangles that don't overlap. So first, pick the white rectangle: choose some number of rows and columns, then pick the black rectangle from the remaining rows and columns. Then sum over all possible white and black rectangle sizes.\n\nTherefore, the total number is the sum over all possible white rectangle dimensions (r_w, c_w) where r_w is the number of rows, c_w columns, such that r_w*c_w \u226425, and similarly for black rectangles (r_b, c_b) with r_b*c_b \u226425, and r_w + r_b \u22645, c_w + c_b \u22645. For each such pair, the number of ways is C(5, r_w)*C(5, c_w)*C(5 - r_w, r_b)*C(5 - c_w, c_b).\n\nBut we also need to consider that the white and black regions can be placed in any non-overlapping way. Wait, but this is exactly what the above formula counts.\n\nHowever, we must also consider that the white and black regions can be in any order. For instance, choosing first a white rectangle and then a black one is the same as choosing black first then white, but since they are different colors, they are counted separately. Wait, actually no, because the color matters. So the formula above already accounts for all possibilities where white is placed first then black, and all the counts are correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem also allows for having only a white region and no black, or only a black region and no white, or neither. But the maximality condition requires that you can't add any more chips. If there's only a white region, then you can't add any more white chips (since it's filled), but could you add a black chip somewhere else? \n\nWait, let's consider the case where only a white rectangle is present. For the arrangement to be maximal, adding a black chip anywhere would require that the cell's row and column are both black. However, if there's an empty cell not in the white region, its row or column might be unassigned. Suppose there's an empty cell (not in white rows or columns). To place a black chip there, we would have to designate its row and column as black. But if those rows and columns are not already part of the white regions, then you could potentially do that. Therefore, the arrangement with only a white rectangle is not maximal unless the remaining rows and columns are such that you can't form a black rectangle.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. So perhaps my previous approach is missing something.\n\nWait, going back to the maximality condition: the arrangement must be such that no additional chip can be placed. Therefore, for any empty cell, you can't place either color there. \n\nSo for any empty cell (i,j):\n\n- If you try to place a white chip there, either the row i is already black (so can't), or the column j is already black (can't), or the row i is non-black but already has white chips, but the column j is non-white (so can't), or the row is unassigned but the column is unassigned, but adding a white chip would require that the row and column become white. But since the current arrangement is maximal, you can't do that. Wait, but actually, if the row and column are unassigned, you could choose to make that cell white by designating its row and column as white. But since the current arrangement doesn't have those rows and columns as white, then you could add that chip, which would violate maximality. Therefore, in a maximal arrangement, such cells cannot exist. Therefore, every empty cell must be in a row or column that is already assigned a conflicting color, or is full.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to formalize the conditions again.\n\nFor an arrangement to be maximal, every empty cell (i,j) must satisfy at least one of:\n\n1. The row i is colored (white or black), and the column j is colored with a different color.\n\n2. The row i is colored and is full (i.e., all its cells are filled with its color). Wait, but if the row is colored, say white, but not full, then the remaining cells in that row could be filled with white chips unless their columns are conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is needed. Let me think of the entire grid as divided into four parts:\n\n1. The white rectangle: rows W and columns C, all filled white.\n\n2. The black rectangle: rows B and columns D, all filled black.\n\n3. The remaining rows not in W or B, and columns not in C or D: these must be empty.\n\n4. The rows in W or B but columns not in their respective sets must be empty.\n\nWait, actually, the rows in W (white rows) must have all their chips in columns C (white columns). The other columns in white rows must be empty. Similarly, black rows have their chips only in black columns D. Similarly for columns.\n\nTherefore, the entire grid is divided into:\n\n- The white rectangle: W rows \u00d7 C columns (white chips).\n\n- The black rectangle: B rows \u00d7 D columns (black chips).\n\n- The remaining cells (outside these rectangles) must be empty.\n\nMoreover, the white and black rectangles cannot overlap, so W and B rows are disjoint, and C and D columns are disjoint.\n\nTherefore, the total number of white chips is |W|\u00d7|C|, black is |B|\u00d7|D|. The constraints are |W|\u00d7|C| \u226425, |B|\u00d7|D| \u226425. Also, |W| + |B| \u22645 (rows), |C| + |D| \u22645 (columns).\n\nAdditionally, the arrangement is maximal because:\n\n- You can't add a white chip outside the white rectangle because those cells are either in black rows/columns (conflict) or in empty rows/columns, but to add a white chip would require expanding the white rectangle. However, since the white rectangle is already as large as possible given W and C, you can't expand further without exceeding the 25 limit or overlapping with black.\n\nWait, actually, the maximality is ensured by the fact that if you tried to add a white chip outside the current white rectangle, you would have to either add a new row or column to W or C. However, since the arrangement is maximal, that must not be possible. But how do we ensure that? Maybe the white rectangle is already as large as possible given the available rows and columns not in black.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that the white and black regions are as large as possible given their row and column sets, so you can't expand them further without exceeding the 25 limit or overlapping. Therefore, the counts |W|\u00d7|C| and |B|\u00d7|D| can be up to 25, but don't have to be.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting all possible such quadruples (W,B,C,D) where:\n\n- W, B are disjoint subsets of rows,\n\n- C, D are disjoint subsets of columns,\n\n- |W|\u00d7|C| \u226425,\n\n- |B|\u00d7|D| \u226425,\n\nand then the number of such arrangements is the number of ways to choose W, B, C, D multiplied by 1 (since chips are indistinct). Wait, actually, the number of ways is the number of ways to choose the rows and columns for white and black.\n\nTherefore, the total number is the sum over all possible choices of:\n\n- Selecting W_rows (size r_w), B_rows (size r_b) from 5 rows, with r_w + r_b \u22645,\n\n- Selecting W_cols (size c_w), B_cols (size c_b) from 5 columns, with c_w + c_b \u22645,\n\nsuch that r_w * c_w \u226425 and r_b * c_b \u226425,\n\nand for each such selection, the number of ways is:\n\nC(5, r_w) * C(5 - r_w, r_b) * C(5, c_w) * C(5 - c_w, c_b).\n\nBut since the white and black regions are independent once the rows and columns are chosen, this should be the case.\n\nHowever, since the white and black regions are separate, and the order of choosing doesn't matter, except that they are colored differently, this formula should hold.\n\nTherefore, to compute this, we need to iterate over all possible r_w from 0 to 5, r_b from 0 to (5 - r_w), similarly for columns c_w from 0 to 5, c_b from 0 to (5 - c_w), check the product constraints, and accumulate the product of combinations.\n\nBut this is going to involve a lot of terms. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, note that since the maximum product for a 5x5 grid is 25 (5x5), so all possible products up to 25 are allowed. Since 5x5 is 25, so any r and c up to 5 are okay as long as their product is \u226425, which they always are because r and c are at most 5, so 5x5=25. Wait, actually, yes. Since r_w and c_w can be at most 5 each, their product can be up to 25. Similarly for r_b and c_b. Therefore, the constraints r_w*c_w \u226425 and r_b*c_b \u226425 are automatically satisfied. Because the maximum possible product for white is 5\u00d75=25, same for black. Therefore, the only constraints are:\n\nr_w + r_b \u22645,\n\nc_w + c_b \u22645,\n\nand the rows and columns are chosen accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is the sum over all possible r_w, r_b, c_w, c_b with r_w + r_b \u22645 and c_w + c_b \u22645 of [C(5, r_w)*C(5 - r_w, r_b) * C(5, c_w)*C(5 - c_w, c_b)].\n\nBut this counts all possible ways of choosing white and black rectangles (possibly empty) such that they don't overlap in rows or columns. However, we need to ensure that the arrangement is maximal. Wait, but does this count include non-maximal arrangements?\n\nAh, here's the problem. The above count includes all possible such configurations, including those that aren't maximal. For example, if I choose a white rectangle of 1x1 and a black rectangle of 1x1 in separate rows and columns, then there might be empty cells where you could add more chips. Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, if the regions are filled completely, then they are maximal? Wait no. Suppose you have a white rectangle of 2 rows and 1 column. Then the white region is 2x1, filled completely. The remaining rows and columns can potentially have black regions. But if there's an empty cell not in the white region, say in a row not in white or black and column not in white or black, then you could choose to make that cell part of a black region by designating its row and column as black. Since it's empty, you could add a black chip there, which would violate maximality. Therefore, such configurations are not maximal.\n\nTherefore, my earlier assumption that choosing any non-overlapping white and black rectangles would satisfy maximality is incorrect. \n\nThis complicates things further. So the maximality requires that there are no empty cells that can be part of an expansion of either the white or black regions.\n\nTherefore, in addition to the non-overlapping conditions, the regions must also be such that:\n\n- For the white region: If you have W rows and C columns, then you can't add any more rows or columns to W or C without either exceeding the 25 chip limit (unlikely since 5x5 is 25) or overlapping with the black region.\n\nWait, but since the black region is in separate rows and columns, expanding the white region into those rows or columns would conflict with black, so you can't. Therefore, to be maximal, the white region must be the entire set of rows and columns assigned to it. That is, you can't have unassigned rows or columns in the white region's rows or columns. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the maximality requires that for the white region:\n\n- All rows in W must be entirely filled with white chips in their W columns. So if you have W rows and C columns, then all cells in W rows and C columns must be filled. Additionally, the white region cannot be expanded further. Since the remaining rows and columns are either assigned to black or unassigned, you can't expand the white region into black's area. But you could potentially expand into unassigned rows or columns. \n\nTherefore, to prevent that, the unassigned rows and columns must be such that you can't form a larger white region by including them. That is, if there's an unassigned row not in W or B, then to expand the white region to include that row, you'd need to also include some columns. However, since those columns may be unassigned or in black's columns, you can't do it without conflict. Wait, this is getting too vague.\n\nPerhaps the correct way to ensure maximality is that the white and black regions are as large as possible given the constraints. That is, if there exists an unassigned row and column that could be added to the white region without conflict, then the arrangement isn't maximal. Therefore, for the arrangement to be maximal, every unassigned row must have at least one column in the black region (so you can't add it to white), and every unassigned column must have at least one row in the black region. Similarly for black.\n\nAlternatively, more formally:\n\nTo ensure maximality, the following must hold:\n\nFor every row not in W_rows or B_rows:\n\n- If you tried to add it to W_rows, then you would need to have columns not conflicting with B_cols. But since it's unassigned, the columns would have to be in W_cols or new columns. But since we want maximality, there must be no way to do that. Therefore, every such row must have at least one column in B_cols, so that adding it to W_rows would conflict with B_cols. Similarly, every unassigned column must have at least one row in B_rows.\n\nSimilarly, for black rows and columns:\n\nEvery unassigned row must have a column in W_cols, and every unassigned column must have a row in W_rows. Wait, no, that might be overkill.\n\nAlternatively, the maximality requires that:\n\n- For any unassigned row (not in W or B), there is no set of columns (either in W or new) that can be assigned to it to form an expanded white region without conflicting with black.\n\nBut this is too vague. Perhaps the only way to ensure maximality is that the union of white and black rows covers all rows, and similarly columns. Because otherwise, there's an unassigned row and column which could form a new region.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point! If there exists an unassigned row and an unassigned column, then you could form a 1x1 region (that row and column) with either color, hence violating maximality. Therefore, to satisfy maximality, there must be no unassigned rows or columns. Because if there is an unassigned row and an unassigned column, their intersection is an empty cell where you could place a chip (by designating that row and column as either color), hence violating maximality.\n\nTherefore, the maximality condition requires that all rows are either white or black, and all columns are either white or black. There can be no unassigned rows or columns. Because otherwise, you could create a new region in the unassigned row and column.\n\nAh! That's the key. So the maximality implies that every row must be either white, black, or... wait, but rows can't be both. Since all rows must be assigned to either white, black, or else you could use an unassigned row to create a new region. So indeed, all rows must be assigned to either white or black (or maybe one of them). Similarly, all columns must be assigned to either white or black.\n\nTherefore, the entire set of rows is partitioned into white rows, black rows, and there are no unassigned rows. Similarly for columns.\n\nTherefore, the earlier constraints R_w + R_b =5 and C_w + C_b =5. Because you can't have any rows left unassigned. Because if there was an unassigned row and an unassigned column, you could add a chip there, violating maximality. Therefore, every row must be in W or B, and every column must be in W or B.\n\nTherefore, the conditions are:\n\n- R_w + R_b =5,\n\n- C_w + C_b =5,\n\n- The white region is R_w \u00d7 C_w,\n\n- The black region is R_b \u00d7 C_b,\n\n- Additionally, the white and black regions must not overlap, which requires that the white rows and columns are disjoint from black rows and columns? Wait no, the white and black regions can't overlap in cells, which requires that the white rows and black rows are disjoint, and white columns and black columns are disjoint. Wait, but since all rows are assigned to either white or black, and all columns as well, the only way their regions don't overlap is if the white rows and black rows are disjoint, and white columns and black columns are disjoint. Wait, no, actually, if a row is white and a column is black, their intersection is an empty cell (since it can't be both colors). But since all rows and columns are assigned, the regions are:\n\n- White region: W_rows \u00d7 W_cols,\n\n- Black region: B_rows \u00d7 B_cols,\n\n- The remaining cells (i.e., W_rows \u00d7 B_cols and B_rows \u00d7 W_cols) must be empty.\n\nTherefore, the total number of chips is R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b.\n\nMoreover, since all rows and columns are assigned, the maximality is achieved because any empty cell is either in a white row and black column or vice versa, so you can't place a chip there without conflicting colors. And since all rows and columns are assigned, you can't add a new region.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to partition the rows into white and black, and the columns into white and black, such that the white and black regions don't overlap (i.e., white rows and columns are separate from black ones), and the counts R_w*C_w and R_b*C_b don't exceed 25 (though since R_w and C_w are at most 5, their product is at most 25, which is exactly the number of chips available, so actually, the only constraint is that R_w*C_w \u226425 and R_b*C_b \u226425, which are automatically true since the max is 25).\n\nWait, but the problem states there are 25 white and 25 black chips available. So the white region must use at most 25 white chips, and black region at most 25 black chips. Since R_w*C_w can be up to 25 (if 5x5), but since the entire grid is 25 cells, R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b \u226425. Wait, no, the total number of chips is R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b. Since the entire grid has 25 cells, this sum must be \u226425. Because each cell is either in white, black, or empty? Wait no, according to the above, the white and black regions are non-overlapping and cover some cells, and the rest are empty. Therefore, the total number of chips is R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b, which must be \u226425 (the total available chips of each color are 25 each, so actually, the white chips used can't exceed 25, and black the same, but since they are separate, the total can be up to 25+25=50, but the grid only has 25 cells, so the total chips can't exceed 25. Wait, this is a contradiction.\n\nWait a second, this is a critical mistake. The problem states there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips available, but the grid has 25 cells. Therefore, the total number of chips placed on the grid cannot exceed 25. Therefore, R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b \u226425. Additionally, the white chips used (R_w*C_w) cannot exceed 25, and the black chips similarly. But since R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b \u226425, both are automatically \u226425.\n\nTherefore, the only constraints are:\n\n- R_w + R_b =5,\n\n- C_w + C_b =5,\n\n- R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b \u226425.\n\nAdditionally, the regions must be non-overlapping as before.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting all possible ways to partition the 5 rows into white and black, and the 5 columns into white and black, such that the total number of chips (R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b) does not exceed 25. Since all partitions are allowed except those where the total exceeds 25.\n\nWait, but since R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b is the total number of chips, and the grid has 25 cells, so the maximum possible is 25. Therefore, the condition is R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b \u226425. But since R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b can be at most 25 (when, for example, all cells are filled with one color), but actually, if you have both white and black regions, their total can be up to 25. Wait, actually, if you have both white and black regions, their total could be up to 25. For example, if white is 5x5 (25), then black has to be 0. If white is 4x4 (16), black could be 1x1 (1), totaling 17 \u226425. So the only constraint is that their sum is \u226425, which is automatically true except when?\n\nWait, actually, when both white and black regions are large. For instance, if white is 3x3 (9) and black is 3x3 (9), but since rows and columns must be partitioned, it's impossible. Let's see:\n\nSuppose white has 3 rows and 3 columns, black has 2 rows and 2 columns. Then total chips are 3*3 + 2*2 =9 +4=13 \u226425. Even if white is 4 rows and 4 columns (16 chips), then black would have 1 row and 1 column (1 chip), total 17. The maximum possible sum would be when one region is as large as possible and the other as small as possible. The maximum total is 25, which occurs when one region is the entire grid (5x5) and the other is 0. So the only constraint is that the regions are non-overlapping and partition the rows and columns. The total chips can be anything up to 25, so all such partitions are allowed except when?\n\nWait actually, there's no restriction other than partitioning rows and columns into white and black, with R_w + R_b =5 and C_w + C_b =5. Because even if their product sum exceeds 25, but since the grid has only 25 cells, the maximum possible is 25. Wait, actually, the products R_w*C_w and R_b*C_b can't add up to more than 25, because the total cells are 25. So their sum is exactly the number of chips, so it can be any number from 0 (no chips) to 25. Therefore, all such partitions are allowed. Therefore, the only constraints are that rows and columns are partitioned into white and black.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is the number of ways to partition the rows into white and black, and columns into white and black, multiplied by 1 (since the chips are indistinct and placed completely in their regions).\n\nHowever, note that swapping white and black would give different arrangements unless the regions are symmetric. So we have to count all possible such partitions.\n\nThe number of ways to partition the rows into white and black is 2^5 =32, but since we have to choose subsets, it's actually the number of subsets for white rows (each row can be white or black), so 2^5. Similarly for columns 2^5. However, since the partitions are independent, the total would be 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024. But this counts all possible partitions, including those where, for example, all rows are white and all columns are black, which would result in a white region of 5 rows \u00d70 columns =0, and black region 0\u00d75=0, so no chips. But the problem requires placing \"some\" chips, i.e., at least one chip. Wait, the problem says \"some of these chips\", which I think allows zero chips? Wait, the exact wording is: \"place some of these chips\", so \"some\" could mean one or more. Therefore, we need to subtract the case where no chips are placed (i.e., all rows and columns are partitioned such that white and black regions have zero chips). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe total number of arrangements including the all-empty case is 2^5 (for rows) * 2^5 (for columns) = 1024. \n\nBut the all-empty case occurs when either:\n\n- All rows are black and all columns are white (so white region is 0 rows \u00d75 columns =0 and black region 5 rows \u00d70 columns=0), or\n\n- All rows are white and all columns are black (same result), or\n\n- Any combination where W_rows and W_cols are disjoint, but actually, the only way to have zero chips is if either:\n\n- W_rows =0 and W_cols =0, so white region is 0,\n\n- and B_rows and B_cols must also be such that their product is zero. Wait no, actually:\n\nWait, the total chips are R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b. To have zero chips, both terms must be zero. \n\nSo either:\n\nCase 1: R_w*C_w =0 and R_b*C_b =0.\n\nWhich requires that either:\n\n- R_w=0 and C_w can be anything, but then R_b=5, so R_b*C_b =5*C_b. To have R_b*C_b=0 requires C_b=0. But since columns must be partitioned, C_b =5 - C_w. If C_w is anything, but to get C_b=0, C_w=5. But then R_w=0, so W_rows=0, B_rows=5. Then W_cols=5 (since C_w=5), B_cols=0. So the white region is 0\u00d75=0, black region is 5\u00d70=0. So that's the case where all rows are black and all columns are white. \n\nSimilarly, if R_b=0 and C_b=0, then R_w=5 and C_w=5, so white region is 5\u00d75=25, black region 0. But that actually has 25 chips. \n\nWait, so the only way to have zero chips is when:\n\nEither (R_w=0 and C_w=5) with (R_b=5 and C_b=0), or (R_b=0 and C_b=5) with (R_w=5 and C_w=0). Wait, no:\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nIf white region has R_w rows and C_w columns. To have R_w*C_w=0, either R_w=0 or C_w=0.\n\nSimilarly for black region, R_b*C_b=0 requires R_b=0 or C_b=0.\n\nTo have both white and black regions zero:\n\n- White region zero: either R_w=0 or C_w=0.\n\n- Black region zero: either R_b=0 or C_b=0.\n\nBut since R_b =5 - R_w and C_b=5 - C_w,\n\nIf white region zero (R_w*C_w=0):\n\nCase 1: R_w=0. Then R_b=5. For black region to be zero, need R_b*C_b=0 \u21d2 C_b=0. Since C_b=5 - C_w, so 5 - C_w=0 \u21d2 C_w=5. Thus, C_w=5 and C_b=0. Therefore, in this case, the white region has R_w=0 rows and C_w=5 columns, so 0\u00d75=0. Black region has R_b=5 rows and C_b=0 columns \u21d25\u00d70=0. So this is the case where all rows are black, all columns are white.\n\nCase 2: C_w=0. Then C_b=5. For black region to be zero, need R_b*C_b=0 \u21d2 R_b=0. Since R_b=5 - R_w \u21d2 R_w=5. Thus, white region has R_w=5 rows and C_w=0 \u21d25\u00d70=0. Black region has R_b=0 rows and C_b=5 \u21d20\u00d75=0. This is the case where all rows are white and all columns are black.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly two configurations with zero chips. Therefore, the total number of arrangements with at least one chip is 1024 - 2 = 1022.\n\nHowever, the problem states \"some of these chips\", which could include zero, but I think in combinatorial problems like this, \"some\" usually means at least one. So maybe we subtract 2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.\" If no chips are placed, then you could place a chip anywhere, so that arrangement is not maximal. Because the maximality requires that you cannot add any more chips. If there are no chips, then you can add one, so the empty arrangement is not maximal. Therefore, we must exclude it.\n\nBut in our earlier analysis, there are two configurations with zero chips (all rows black and columns white, or vice versa). Wait, actually in those cases, can you add a chip?\n\nTake the first case: all rows are black, columns are white. Wait, rows are black meaning that any chips in those rows must be black, but columns are white meaning any chips in those columns must be white. Therefore, any cell is in a black row and white column, so you can't place a chip there (conflict). Therefore, in that case, the arrangement with zero chips is actually maximal, because you can't add any chips. Wait, this contradicts my previous thought.\n\nWait, in the case where all rows are black and all columns are white:\n\n- Any cell is in a black row and white column, so it can't have a chip of either color (since it would need to be both). Therefore, all cells must be empty. This is a valid maximal arrangement because you can't add any chips. Similarly for the all columns black and rows white.\n\nTherefore, those two configurations are valid maximal arrangements with zero chips. However, the problem says \"some of these chips\", which might mean at least one, but the problem statement doesn't explicitly say that. It just says \"place some of these chips\". Since \"some\" can sometimes mean \"any number including zero\", but in some contexts, it means \"at least one\". The problem might require at least one chip, but it's ambiguous.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5\u00d75 grid such that:\n\neach cell contains at most one chip\n\nall chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\n\nany additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.\"\n\nThe problem doesn't specify that at least one chip must be placed, so the empty arrangement is allowed if it satisfies the conditions. But in the empty arrangement, the two conditions are satisfied (trivially, since there are no chips), and it is maximal because you can't add any chips. However, in the empty arrangement, the rows and columns are unassigned? Wait, no. In our previous analysis, the rows and columns must be partitioned into white and black. In the case of zero chips, as in all rows black and columns white, that's a valid partition, but it results in zero chips. So that arrangement is counted in the total 1024.\n\nHowever, the problem might consider that \"some\" means at least one, so we need to subtract those two cases. But the problem says \"some of these chips\", which is vague, but in combinatorial problems, usually \"some\" means \"one or more\". Therefore, I think we should exclude the two zero-chip cases. So total arrangements would be 1024 - 2 = 1022.\n\nBut let me confirm with an example.\n\nSuppose all rows are white and all columns are white. Then the white region is 5\u00d75=25 chips, which uses all 25 white chips. This is allowed and maximal, since you can't add any more chips. Similarly, if all rows and columns are black, same.\n\nAnother example: choose 2 rows as white and 3 columns as white, and the remaining rows and columns as black. The white region is 2\u00d73=6 white chips. The black region is 3\u00d72=6 black chips. Total 12 chips. This is a valid maximal arrangement because any empty cell is either in a white row and black column (can't place white or black) or vice versa. So you can't add any chips. \n\nTherefore, all the 1024 possibilities except the two zero-chip cases are valid maximal arrangements with at least one chip. However, the problem didn't specify \"at least one\", so technically the answer could be 1024. But since the empty arrangement is technically allowed, but maybe the problem expects it to be excluded. Hmm.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"Find the number of ways to place some of these chips...\"\n\nThe word \"some\" can be ambiguous, but in mathematics, unless specified otherwise, \"some\" can include zero. However, in the context of placing chips on a grid, \"placing some chips\" might mean at least one. Also, the problem mentions \"any additional chip placed on the grid would violate...\", which is true even for the empty grid, so it is a valid solution. Therefore, perhaps we should include all 1024.\n\nWait, but in the case where all rows are black and columns are white (resulting in zero chips), the rows are all black, meaning that any chip in a black row must be black, but the columns are white, so any chip in a white column must be white. Therefore, no cell can have a chip, so that's valid. Similarly the other way.\n\nTherefore, those two cases are valid, so total is 1024.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"some chips\", but in the problem statement, \"some\" might mean \"at least one\" to avoid trivial cases. But since it's not specified, maybe we have to include all. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's see the original problem again:\n\n\"Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5\u00d75 grid such that:\n\neach cell contains at most one chip\n\nall chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\n\nany additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.\"\n\nThere's no stipulation that at least one chip must be placed, so the empty grid is allowed. Hence the total number is 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024.\n\nWait, but this can't be right, because when you choose the rows and columns for white and black, you might have overlapping regions? No, because the rows and columns are partitioned, so white and black regions are disjoint.\n\nWait, the total number of ways to choose the partition of rows is 2^5 (each row is either white or black). Similarly for columns. Since the choices are independent, it's 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024. Each such choice defines a unique maximal arrangement, including the two cases with zero chips. So the answer would be 1024. \n\nHowever, I need to confirm this with an example. Let me consider a smaller grid, say 1x1, to see if the logic holds.\n\nSuppose a 1x1 grid with 1 white and 1 black chip. The problem would be similar: place some chips with the conditions. \n\nThe possible maximal arrangements:\n\n- Place a white chip: then the only cell is white. Since it's maximal (can't add anything else). \n\n- Place a black chip: similarly.\n\n- Place nothing: then you can't add any chip because the row and column are unassigned. Wait, in the 1x1 case:\n\nIf you choose the row to be white and column to be white: place the white chip. \n\nIf row is black and column black: place black.\n\nIf row is white and column black: can't place anything, so that's a maximal arrangement with zero chips.\n\nSimilarly row black and column white: also zero chips.\n\nSo total arrangements: 2 (with one chip) + 2 (zero chips) =4. Which is 2^1 *2^1 =4. So the formula holds. But in this case, the problem would count the zero chips as valid. Therefore, for the original problem, the answer is 2^5 *2^5 =1024. However, the problem has 25 chips of each color, but in the 1x1 case, there's only one of each, so similar.\n\nWait but in the 1x1 case, the two zero-chip arrangements are when the row and column are conflicting (one white, one black). Those are valid maximal arrangements. So the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, the answer should be 2^5 *2^5 =1024. But wait, the problem has two colors, so the assignments of rows and columns to white or black are independent, so yes, 2^5 for rows, 2^5 for columns, total 1024.\n\nBut let me check another angle. Suppose I choose for rows: each row is independently white or black. Similarly for columns. For each such choice, the white region is the intersection of white rows and white columns, filled with white chips. The black region is intersection of black rows and black columns, filled with black chips. The rest are empty. This is exactly the construction, and each such choice gives a unique arrangement. Since the problem allows any number of chips (including zero), the total is 2^5 *2^5 =1024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1024. However, I need to make sure that in the problem statement, the chips are \"indistinguishable\", so different arrangements that only differ in the color assignment would count as different even if the regions are the same. Wait, no, the colors are distinct, so white and black are different. For example, swapping white and black would give a different arrangement unless the regions are symmetric.\n\nTherefore, the count of 1024 is correct because each choice of row and column colorings is unique, even if they result in symmetric regions with swapped colors.\n\nWait a second, actually, when you choose rows and columns for white and black, it's a binary choice for each row and column. There is no overcounting because each configuration is uniquely determined by the choice of white rows and white columns (since black is the complement). \n\nWait, actually, the way I considered it earlier is that for rows, each is either white or black, and similarly for columns. So the total number is indeed 2^5 *2^5 =1024. Each such assignment defines a unique maximal arrangement.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1024. But I have a doubt because in the problem statement it says \"some of these chips\", and maybe they want only arrangements with at least one chip. Let me see.\n\nIf the problem requires at least one chip, then subtract the two cases where all rows and columns are conflicting (the two zero-chip cases). So 1024 -2=1022. But in the 1x1 case, the analogous would be 4-2=2, which would exclude the two zero-chip arrangements. But in the 1x1 case, the problem allows zero chips because it's maximal, so the answer should be 4. Therefore, I think the problem includes zero.\n\nHowever, the problem mentions \"some chips\", but in the problem statement's conditions, the empty grid satisfies all conditions. Therefore, it must be included.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1024. However, I recall that in some similar problems, sometimes the all-zero case is considered non-maximal because you can add a chip, but in this case, in the all-zero case with conflicting rows and columns, you cannot add any chip. So it is maximal.\n\nWait in the all-zero case where rows are all black and columns all white, you can't add any chip. Similarly the other way. So those are valid.\n\nHence, the total is 1024.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another example. Suppose in a 2x2 grid:\n\nNumber of arrangements would be 2^2 *2^2=16.\n\nLet me list them:\n\nEach row can be W or B, each column can be W or B.\n\nFor instance:\n\nAll rows W, all columns W: 2x2 white chips.\n\nAll rows W, columns W and B split:\n\nSuppose rows: W W\n\nColumns: W B\n\nThen white region is 2 rows \u00d71 column =2 cells white.\n\nBlack region: 0 rows (since remaining rows are 0) \u00d71 column (remaining columns)=0.\n\nThe other cells (rows W and column B) are empty because they are in white rows and black columns (conflict).\n\nSimilarly, other combinations.\n\nAll possibilities are counted in 16. Including cases with zero chips, like rows all W and columns all B: which results in zero chips, since white region is 2\u00d70 and black region 0\u00d72. And that is maximal.\n\nThus, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2^5 *2^5 = 1024.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"some of these chips\", but the chips are 25 white and 25 black. However, in the arrangement where all cells are white, you need to use 25 white chips, which is allowed since there are exactly 25. Similarly for all black.\n\nTherefore, all configurations are allowed as long as the number of white chips used (R_w*C_w) does not exceed 25, which it never does, since R_w and C_w are at most 5. Similarly for black.\n\nTherefore, the total number is 1024. But wait, the problem says \"indistinguishable chips\", so does the count change?\n\nWait, no. Because the chips are indistinct, but the placement is determined by the regions. Each maximal arrangement is uniquely determined by the choice of white rows and columns, so the count remains 2^5*2^5=1024.\n\nHence, the answer should be \\boxed{1024}.\n\nWait, but I recall that in some similar problems, the count is different. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that the regions are determined by the row and column choices independently. Because when you choose rows and columns for white, the black regions are determined as the remaining rows and columns. However, the black region is the intersection of black rows and black columns. So the total arrangements are indeed the product of the row and column choices, hence 2^5 *2^5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the white and black regions cannot overlap, which they don't because of the partitioning. So yes, it's correct.\n\nWait, but in the process of choosing rows and columns, you might have:\n\nSuppose you choose some rows and columns for white, and the rest are black. The white region is white rows \u00d7 white columns. The black region is black rows \u00d7 black columns. These two regions don't overlap because white rows and black rows are disjoint, same with columns. Therefore, the total is indeed 2^5 *2^5.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 1024. However, I need to verify once more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a restriction that the white and black regions cannot be empty? No, the problem allows it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that each row and column must be entirely of one color if they have any chips. Which is already considered in the model.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 1024. But wait, the problem says \"any additional chip placed on the grid would violate...\", and in the case where you have both white and black regions, adding a chip in the intersection of a white row and black column is blocked, so it's okay. All cases are maximal.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1024}. However, I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes problems like this have a different answer. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: For each cell, its color is determined by the color of its row and column. To satisfy the conditions:\n\n- If a cell is in a white row and white column, it must be white.\n\n- If in a black row and black column, it must be black.\n\n- If in conflicting colors (white row, black column or vice versa), it must be empty.\n\n- If in an unassigned row or column? Wait no, all rows and columns are assigned to white or black.\n\nTherefore, each maximal arrangement is determined uniquely by the choice of which rows and columns are white or black. Since each row and column has two choices, independent of others, the total is 2^5 *2^5 = 1024.\n\nThus, I'm confident the answer is 1024.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of ways to place white and black chips on a 5\u00d75 grid such that each row and column has chips of a single color, and the arrangement is maximal (no additional chips can be placed without violating the conditions). \n\nKey steps:\n1. **Maximality Condition**: Every empty cell must be in a row or column of a conflicting color, preventing any further placements.\n2. **Row and Column Partitioning**: Each row and column must be assigned to either white, black, or remain unassigned. However, to ensure maximality, all rows and columns must be assigned to either white or black. This prevents having unassigned rows or columns, which would allow adding chips.\n3. **Non-overlapping Regions**: The white region (intersection of white rows and columns) and the black region (intersection of black rows and columns) must not overlap. This is naturally satisfied by partitioning rows and columns into white and black.\n4. **Counting Configurations**: Each row can independently be white or black (2 choices per row), and similarly for each column (2 choices per column). This results in \\(2^5 \\times 2^5 = 1024\\) configurations.\n\nThus, the number of valid maximal arrangements is \\(\\boxed{1024}\\).",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about arranging white and black chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThere are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinct. I need to place some of them into the 25 unit cells of a 5x5 grid with the following conditions:\n\n1. Each cell can have at most one chip.\n2. All chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color.\n3. The arrangement must be maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips without violating the previous conditions.\n\nHmm, so first, let me parse the constraints one by one. \n\nStarting with the second condition: in any row, all chips must be the same color. Similarly, in any column, all chips must be the same color. That seems like each row is either all white or all black (if it has chips), and same for each column. Wait, but actually, a row could have no chips, right? Because \"some of these chips\" can be placed. So rows and columns can be empty or filled with chips of one color. But the key is that if a row has chips, they must all be the same color, and similarly for columns.\n\nBut also, the third condition says that it's maximal. So there's no way to add another chip without violating the first two conditions. So that means that for any empty cell, if you try to place a chip there, either its row or column would have to have a different color. \n\nSo, for a cell to be empty, either its row is already filled with chips of one color (so adding another chip there would exceed the row's capacity?) Wait, no. Wait, actually, each row can have some number of chips, but they all must be the same color. But the row could have some number of chips, but since the grid is 5x5, each row has 5 cells. Wait, but the problem says \"each cell contains at most one chip,\" so each row can have 0 to 5 chips, all of the same color. Similarly for columns.\n\nBut the maximality condition requires that you can't add any more chips. So for any empty cell, if you try to put a chip there, either:\n\n- The row already has chips of a different color, so you can't add a chip of another color, or\n\n- The column already has chips of a different color, so same thing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the row is already full (i.e., all 5 cells are filled with chips of a color), so you can't add another chip there? Wait, but each cell can have at most one chip, so if a row has all 5 cells filled, you can't add any more. But in that case, the row is already full, so that cell can't be filled.\n\nTherefore, the maximality condition requires that for every empty cell, either its row is already filled (all 5 cells occupied, so can't add more), or the row has some chips but they are of a color different from what you would want to place (if you tried to place a white chip in a row that already has black chips, you can't, so you can't place it there), or same for the column.\n\nWait, actually, maybe the maximality is that for every empty cell, there is no color you can put there without violating the row or column color constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the row or column must already have chips of one color, so you can't add a chip of the other color. But if the row is empty, then you could add a chip of either color, so to be maximal, that cell must be filled?\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think of it as follows: the arrangement is maximal if every empty cell cannot have a chip placed in it because either:\n\n- The row already has chips of a particular color (so you can't put a different color there, and you can't add the same color if the row is already full? Wait, if the row is not full, but already has some chips of a color, you could add more of that color. Wait, but then the maximality would require that you can't add any more chips. So maybe in order for a cell to be empty, either:\n\n- The row has chips of one color, and the column has chips of a different color, so you can't place either color there without conflicting with row or column.\n\nOr perhaps the row is already filled (so you can't add anything), or the column is already filled (same), or the row and column have conflicting colors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximality requires that every empty cell is blocked by either its row being filled with one color or its column being filled with another. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the constraints on the rows and columns. Each row can be in one of the following states:\n\n- All cells are empty.\n\n- All non-empty cells in the row are white, and there are some number (1-5) of them.\n\n- All non-empty cells in the row are black, and there are some number (1-5) of them.\n\nSimilarly for each column.\n\nHowever, the row's non-empty cells must all be the same color, and the column's non-empty cells must all be the same color.\n\nAdditionally, the arrangement must be maximal, so you can't add any more chips. Therefore, for every empty cell (i,j), if you tried to put a white chip there, either:\n\n- The row i already has black chips (so you can't add white), or the row i has white chips but is already full (so can't add more), or the column j has black chips (so can't add white), or the column j has white chips but is already full (so can't add more). Wait, but actually, the column's color must also be considered.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is: To place a chip at (i,j), it must be of the same color as the row's current color (if the row is non-empty) or the same as the column's current color (if the column is non-empty). But since the row and column must both have the same color for that cell, the color of the row and column must agree. If they don't agree, then you can't place a chip there. So, if row i has white chips and column j has black chips, then cell (i,j) can't have a chip, because it would have to be both white and black. So such a cell must remain empty.\n\nTherefore, in order for the arrangement to be maximal, every empty cell must be blocked because either its row and column have conflicting colors, or the row is already full (so you can't add more), or the column is already full (same). Wait, but if the row has some color and isn't full, can't you add another chip of the same color? But if you can add another chip of the same color, then the arrangement isn't maximal. Therefore, for the arrangement to be maximal, whenever a row is not full, its column constraints must block adding more chips. Wait, perhaps the rows and columns must be such that any empty cell is either in a row that's already filled (so can't add more) or in a column that's already filled, or the row's color and column's color conflict.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal condition requires that for every empty cell (i,j), either:\n\n- The row i is non-empty and the column j is non-empty, but their colors are different. So you can't put a chip there because you can't satisfy both.\n\nOr,\n\n- The row i is non-empty and already has the maximum number of chips (i.e., all 5 cells filled with, say, white), so you can't add more.\n\nOr,\n\n- The column j is non-empty and already has all 5 cells filled, so can't add more.\n\nBut also, if a row is non-full but its column is also non-full, but same color, then you could add a chip there. Therefore, in a maximal arrangement, such cells must not exist. So for every cell that is empty, either:\n\nEither the row is full, or the column is full, or the row and column have conflicting colors.\n\nTherefore, the arrangement must be such that for every empty cell, one of these three conditions holds.\n\nHmm, this is a bit complex. Maybe a better approach is to model this as a matrix where each row is assigned a color (or none) and a number of chips, and each column similarly, with constraints that if a cell is in a row with color R and column with color C, then R must equal C or at least one of them is empty. Also, the total chips must not exceed 25 of each color.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows and columns can be partitioned into those that are colored and those that are not, with the colored rows and columns' colors needing to agree where they intersect.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be approached by considering that the grid is partitioned into regions where rows and columns have colors, and the intersections must agree. Let me think of it in terms of selecting certain rows and columns to be colored, and their colors must agree where they cross.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as choosing for each row a color (white, black, or none) and a number of chips (from 0 to 5), and similarly for each column, but ensuring that the row's color and column's color agree wherever they intersect. Also, the total white chips can't exceed 25, same for black.\n\nWait, but since the chips are indistinct, maybe we can model it as selecting a subset of rows and columns with colors, such that:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\n- If the row i is colored white, then all cells in row i must be white (but how many? Wait, actually, each row can have some number of chips, but all the same color. But actually, if a row is colored white, does that mean all its cells are filled with white chips? Or does it mean that any chips in that row must be white, but they can be a subset?\n\nWait the problem says \"each cell contains at most one chip\". So a row can have 0 to 5 chips, but all of the same color. Similarly for columns. So the color of the row is determined by the color of the chips in it, if any. So if a row has some white chips, it's a white row; if it has black chips, it's a black row; if it has none, it's uncolored. Similarly for columns.\n\nBut the constraints are that for any row and column, their intersection must be either:\n\n- Both uncolored (so the cell can be empty),\n\n- Both colored with the same color (so the cell can have a chip of that color),\n\n- Or one is colored and the other is uncolored, but then the cell can only be filled if the colored one's color is used, but the other is uncolored.\n\nWait, actually, the color of the row and column must agree on the cell's color. So if a row is white and a column is black, then their intersection cell can't have a chip, because it would need to be both white and black. So such a cell must be empty. \n\nTherefore, to have a valid arrangement, the colors of the rows and columns must be such that whenever a row and column are both colored, they must have the same color. Wait, no, not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose row i is white (meaning all chips in it are white) and column j is black (all chips in it are black). Then at their intersection cell (i,j), the cell can't have a chip because it would have to be both white and black. Therefore, in such a case, cell (i,j) must be empty. However, the row and column can both be colored with different colors as long as their intersection is empty. But in that case, the arrangement isn't maximal, because you could potentially add a chip somewhere else?\n\nWait, actually, the problem requires that the arrangement is maximal. So in such a scenario where row i is white and column j is black, their intersection cell (i,j) can't have a chip, but maybe there are other cells in row i or column j that can still have chips? Wait no, if the row is white, then all chips in row i must be white, so column j, which is black, can't have any chips in that row, so in column j, the cells in row i must be empty. But if column j is black, then its other cells (not in row i) must be black. \n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should model the grid as follows:\n\nLet me consider that each row can be in one of three states: white (W), black (B), or empty (E). Similarly, each column can be in W, B, or E. However, for any cell (i,j), if row i is W and column j is B, then that cell must be empty, because it can't be both. Similarly, if row i is W and column j is W, then the cell can be filled with a white chip, but the row and column can have some number of chips (but all same color). Wait, but how does the number of chips come into play here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows and columns that are colored (i.e., non-empty) must have their colors agree wherever they intersect. So the set of white rows and columns must form a rectangle? Or something like that?\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to think of the grid as being partitioned into regions where all the rows and columns of a particular color form a rectangle. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, let's think of the problem as choosing for each row a color (W, B, or E) and a number of chips (0 to 5 if E, but if colored, then the number can be from 1 to 5). Similarly for columns. But the color assignments must be compatible in that wherever a row and column are both non-empty, their colors must match. Additionally, the total number of white chips is the sum over all white rows of their number of chips, and similarly for black, but also considering the columns? Wait, no, actually the total white chips would be the sum over all white rows of their number of chips, but we have to ensure that in the columns as well. Wait, this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key idea is that the set of rows colored white must correspond to columns colored white, and similarly for black. Let me think of it this way: if a row is white, then all the columns that have a chip in that row must also be white. Similarly, if a column is white, all the rows that have a chip in that column must also be white. Therefore, the white rows and white columns form a subgrid where all their intersections are white chips. Similarly for black.\n\nWait, that might be the key. Let me formalize that.\n\nSuppose we have some white rows and white columns. The intersection of white rows and white columns must be filled with white chips. Similarly, black rows and black columns must intersect in black chips. Also, a row cannot be both white and black, obviously. \n\nMoreover, since the arrangement is maximal, every cell not in a white or black subgrid must be blocked by either the row or column being non-matching or full.\n\nAlternatively, the maximal condition implies that if a row is white, it must be fully filled with white chips, otherwise, you could add more. Wait, but the problem allows rows to have any number of chips as long as they are the same color. However, the maximality condition requires that you can't add any more chips. Therefore, if a row is white and has, say, 3 chips, then there must be at least one column in that row which is already black, so you can't add more white chips? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal condition requires that any row that is colored (non-empty) must be completely filled with its color, otherwise you could add more chips. Wait, that might make sense. Let me see.\n\nSuppose a row is white with 3 chips. Then, the remaining 2 cells in that row are empty. But if those cells are in columns that are either empty or also white, then you could add a white chip there. But since the arrangement is maximal, you can't. Therefore, those columns must be either colored black or already filled with white chips. Wait, but if the columns are white, then the row could be filled further. Therefore, in order to prevent adding more, those columns must be black or already filled? Wait, perhaps if a row is not completely filled, then the columns of the empty cells in that row must be colored with a different color (black), so that you can't add white chips there. But if the columns are colored black, then their intersection with this row would require that the cell can't have a chip (since row is white and column is black). Therefore, those cells must be empty, and the columns are black. But then the columns being black must have their own constraints.\n\nThis is getting really complicated. Maybe another way is to model this as a matrix where the rows and columns are either white, black, or empty, with the constraints that:\n\n1. For any cell (i,j), if row i is white and column j is white, then the cell can have a white chip.\n\n2. Similarly, if row i is black and column j is black, the cell can have a black chip.\n\n3. If row i and column j have different colors, the cell must be empty.\n\n4. If either the row or column is empty, the cell can be filled only if the other is also non-empty and of the same color? Wait, no.\n\nAlternatively, if a row is empty (E), then its cells can be filled only if the column they are in is also empty? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only allowed colored cells are those where the row and column have the same color. So:\n\n- A white cell must be in a white row and a white column.\n\n- A black cell must be in a black row and a black column.\n\n- An empty cell is either in a row and column of different colors, or at least one is empty.\n\nTherefore, the entire arrangement can be considered as two disjoint subgrids: one consisting of white rows and columns forming a rectangle (all intersections of white rows and columns are white chips), and similarly for black rows and columns forming another rectangle (but they can't overlap with white ones). Also, the remaining rows and columns can be unassigned (empty).\n\nMoreover, since the arrangement must be maximal, the white and black regions must be as large as possible. Wait, not exactly, but the maximality condition is that you can't add any more chips. So the white and black regions must be such that you can't add any more chips in the white rows/columns or black rows/columns without violating the color constraints.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the white rows and white columns form a complete rectangle: all intersections of white rows and white columns must be filled with white chips. Similarly for black. Otherwise, if there's an empty cell in the white region, you could add a white chip there, contradicting maximality.\n\nAh! That must be it. So for the white region, if you have some rows and columns designated as white, then all the cells at the intersection of a white row and white column must be filled with white chips. Because otherwise, you could add a white chip there. Similarly for black. Therefore, the white region is a rectangle determined by the set of white rows and white columns, and all those cells must be filled. Similarly for black. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to selecting a subset of rows and columns for white and black such that:\n\n1. The white region is the rectangle formed by the white rows and white columns, all filled with white chips.\n\n2. The black region is the rectangle formed by the black rows and black columns, all filled with black chips.\n\n3. The white and black regions do not overlap (since a cell can't be both white and black).\n\n4. The total number of white chips (rows_white * columns_white) plus black chips (rows_black * columns_black) does not exceed 25 each, but actually, since there are 25 white and 25 black chips available, but the total can be up to 25 each, but the problem says \"some of these chips\" so maybe we can use less? Wait, but the arrangement must be maximal, so perhaps they have to use as many as possible? Wait no, maximal just means you can't add more, but you can have fewer as long as adding more isn't possible.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.\" So the arrangement is maximal in the sense that it can't have any more chips added, but it doesn't necessarily have to use all the chips. However, since the chips are indistinct, maybe the count is just based on the possible regions.\n\nBut given that there are 25 white and 25 black chips, perhaps the regions can't exceed those numbers. Wait, but the problem allows using any number up to 25 of each. However, the arrangement must be such that you can't add any more chips. Therefore, the regions must be filled completely in their rectangles. \n\nTherefore, the white region is a rectangle of white rows and white columns, filled completely, and similarly for black. Moreover, the white and black regions can't overlap, so their row and column sets must be disjoint.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing two disjoint sets of rows and columns for white and black, such that:\n\n- Let W_rows be the set of white rows, W_cols the set of white columns. Similarly B_rows and B_cols for black.\n\n- The white region is W_rows \u00d7 W_cols, filled with white chips.\n\n- The black region is B_rows \u00d7 B_cols, filled with black chips.\n\n- The white and black regions must not overlap: so W_rows and B_rows are disjoint, and W_cols and B_cols are disjoint? Wait, no. Wait, the regions overlap only if a row is in both W_rows and B_rows, or a column is in both W_cols and B_cols. But actually, the regions can't overlap in cells. A cell is in both white and black regions only if it is in both W_rows \u00d7 W_cols and B_rows \u00d7 B_cols, which requires that its row is in both W_rows and B_rows, and column in both W_cols and B_cols. Since the cell can't be both colors, so the regions must be disjoint. Therefore, the sets W_rows and B_rows must be disjoint, and W_cols and B_cols must be disjoint. Wait, actually, not necessarily. Suppose a row is in neither W nor B, then it's empty. Similarly for columns. So the white and black regions are in separate row and column sets.\n\nWait, more precisely, the white rows and columns define a rectangle, and the black rows and columns define another rectangle, and these rectangles cannot intersect. That is, the intersection of the white rows and columns with the black rows and columns must be empty. Which would require that W_rows and B_rows are disjoint, and W_cols and B_cols are disjoint. Because if there was a row in both W and B, then the intersection of that row with a column in both W and B would be a cell that is in both regions, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the rows are partitioned into three parts: white rows, black rows, and empty rows. Similarly for columns. Let me denote:\n\nLet R_w be the number of white rows, R_b the number of black rows, R_e =5 - R_w - R_b empty rows.\n\nSimilarly C_w, C_b, C_e for columns.\n\nThen the white region has R_w \u00d7 C_w cells, all filled with white chips. The black region has R_b \u00d7 C_b cells, all filled with black chips. The total white chips used are R_w * C_w, and black chips R_b * C_b. These must satisfy:\n\nR_w * C_w \u2264 25,\n\nR_b * C_b \u2264 25,\n\nAlso, since the regions don't overlap, the rows and columns for white and black must be disjoint. So the total rows used are R_w + R_b \u22645,\n\nSimilarly columns: C_w + C_b \u22645.\n\nAdditionally, since the arrangement is maximal, we can't add any more white or black chips. \n\nWait, but the maximality condition implies that:\n\n- For any row not in white or black, if you tried to make it a white row, you would need to have some columns not already in black or white to form a rectangle. But since it's maximal, you can't. Similarly for columns. Hmm, actually, perhaps the maximality is already enforced by the regions being as large as possible given the disjointness? Not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nWait, according to the previous reasoning, the white and black regions must be filled completely. Because if there was a white row and column that wasn't filled, you could add a chip there, which would violate maximality. Therefore, indeed, the white and black regions must be filled to their full rectangle sizes. Therefore, the regions are maximal in the sense that you can't expand them without overlapping. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to selecting:\n\n- A set of rows and columns for white (W_rows, W_cols),\n\n- A set of rows and columns for black (B_rows, B_cols),\n\nsuch that:\n\n1. W_rows \u2229 B_rows = \u2205,\n\n2. W_cols \u2229 B_cols = \u2205,\n\n3. The white region is W_rows \u00d7 W_cols,\n\n4. The black region is B_rows \u00d7 B_cols,\n\n5. The number of white chips R_w * C_w \u226425,\n\n6. The number of black chips R_b * C_b \u226425,\n\nBut actually, since there are exactly 25 white and black chips available, but the problem says \"some of these chips\", so actually, the counts can be anything up to 25, but the arrangement just has to be maximal. Wait, but since the regions are filled completely, the number of white chips is exactly R_w*C_w, and black is R_b*C_b. The problem allows using up to 25 of each, but since we have 25 of each, the counts can be up to 25. So we just need R_w*C_w \u226425 and R_b*C_b \u226425. But since they are filled completely, the regions can't be expanded further. \n\nAdditionally, the remaining rows and columns (not in W or B) can't have any chips, because if they did, they would have to form their own regions, but they are not assigned to white or black. Wait, actually, the remaining rows and columns could potentially be partially filled, but given the constraints. \n\nWait, actually, no. Because any row not in W_rows or B_rows must be empty. Because if a row is not a white or black row, then it can't have any chips (since all chips in a row must be the same color; if it has any chips, they would have to form a color, but since it's not in W or B rows, that would conflict). Similarly for columns. \n\nTherefore, all non-W and non-B rows must be empty, and same for columns. Therefore, the entire grid is partitioned into three regions:\n\n1. The white rectangle W_rows \u00d7 W_cols,\n\n2. The black rectangle B_rows \u00d7 B_cols,\n\n3. The remaining cells (not in W_rows or B_rows, or not in W_cols or B_cols) must be empty.\n\nMoreover, these two rectangles cannot overlap, so the row and column sets must be disjoint as above.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to choose:\n\n- Two disjoint subsets of rows (W_rows and B_rows),\n\n- Two disjoint subsets of columns (W_cols and B_cols),\n\nsuch that:\n\n- The white area (R_w \u00d7 C_w) and black area (R_b \u00d7 C_b) do not exceed 25 chips each,\n\n- Additionally, since the regions can't be expanded further, meaning that if you tried to add another row or column to W or B, it would cause the product to exceed 25, or overlap with the other region?\n\nWait, actually, the maximality is already enforced by the fact that the regions are filled completely. Because if you could add another row to W_rows, keeping the columns same, then you could have a larger rectangle, but since it's maximal, you can't. Therefore, the current regions must be as large as possible given their row and column sets. Wait, perhaps the maximality in the problem's condition is already captured by the way we're defining the regions as filled rectangles. \n\nTherefore, the problem is to count all possible such configurations (W_rows, W_cols, B_rows, B_cols) with the constraints above, and then sum over all valid configurations. \n\nAdditionally, since the chips are indistinct, the only thing that matters is the number of rows and columns chosen for each color, and their positions. Wait, but the positions matter because different choices of rows and columns (even with same counts) can lead to different arrangements. For example, choosing rows 1,2 as white and columns 1,2 as white is different from rows 1,3 and columns 1,3.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is the sum over all possible R_w, C_w, R_b, C_b (with R_w + R_b \u22645, C_w + C_b \u22645, R_w*C_w \u226425, R_b*C_b \u226425), of:\n\n[Number of ways to choose W_rows (R_w rows) and W_cols (C_w columns)] \u00d7 [Number of ways to choose B_rows (R_b rows) from remaining rows and B_cols (C_b columns) from remaining columns].\n\nBut we have to ensure that the white and black regions are disjoint in both rows and columns. So once we choose W_rows and W_cols, the B_rows must be chosen from the remaining rows (5 - R_w), and B_cols from remaining columns (5 - C_w). Additionally, the black region's rows and columns can't overlap with white's.\n\nTherefore, for each possible R_w, C_w, R_b, C_b where:\n\n- R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b are non-negative integers,\n\n- R_w + R_b \u22645,\n\n- C_w + C_b \u22645,\n\n- R_w*C_w \u226425,\n\n- R_b*C_b \u226425,\n\nthe number of arrangements is:\n\nC(5, R_w) * C(5, C_w) * C(5 - R_w, R_b) * C(5 - C_w, C_b).\n\nAdditionally, we have to consider that the white and black regions can be arranged in any way as long as they don't overlap. Also, note that white and black can be swapped? Wait, no, because white and black are distinct colors, so choosing white with certain rows and columns and black with others is different from swapping their colors unless the regions are the same size and shape. So we don't have to worry about overcounting due to color swapping unless the regions are symmetric.\n\nTherefore, the total number is the sum over all valid R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b of the product as above.\n\nHowever, this seems very involved. Let me see if there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of the problem as first choosing the white rectangle and then the black rectangle in the remaining space, or vice versa.\n\nLet me consider that the entire grid can have white and black rectangles that don't overlap. So first, pick the white rectangle: choose some number of rows and columns, then pick the black rectangle from the remaining rows and columns. Then sum over all possible white and black rectangle sizes.\n\nTherefore, the total number is the sum over all possible white rectangle dimensions (r_w, c_w) where r_w is the number of rows, c_w columns, such that r_w*c_w \u226425, and similarly for black rectangles (r_b, c_b) with r_b*c_b \u226425, and r_w + r_b \u22645, c_w + c_b \u22645. For each such pair, the number of ways is C(5, r_w)*C(5, c_w)*C(5 - r_w, r_b)*C(5 - c_w, c_b).\n\nBut we also need to consider that the white and black regions can be placed in any non-overlapping way. Wait, but this is exactly what the above formula counts.\n\nHowever, we must also consider that the white and black regions can be in any order. For instance, choosing first a white rectangle and then a black one is the same as choosing black first then white, but since they are different colors, they are counted separately. Wait, actually no, because the color matters. So the formula above already accounts for all possibilities where white is placed first then black, and all the counts are correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem also allows for having only a white region and no black, or only a black region and no white, or neither. But the maximality condition requires that you can't add any more chips. If there's only a white region, then you can't add any more white chips (since it's filled), but could you add a black chip somewhere else? \n\nWait, let's consider the case where only a white rectangle is present. For the arrangement to be maximal, adding a black chip anywhere would require that the cell's row and column are both black. However, if there's an empty cell not in the white region, its row or column might be unassigned. Suppose there's an empty cell (not in white rows or columns). To place a black chip there, we would have to designate its row and column as black. But if those rows and columns are not already part of the white regions, then you could potentially do that. Therefore, the arrangement with only a white rectangle is not maximal unless the remaining rows and columns are such that you can't form a black rectangle.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. So perhaps my previous approach is missing something.\n\nWait, going back to the maximality condition: the arrangement must be such that no additional chip can be placed. Therefore, for any empty cell, you can't place either color there. \n\nSo for any empty cell (i,j):\n\n- If you try to place a white chip there, either the row i is already black (so can't), or the column j is already black (can't), or the row i is non-black but already has white chips, but the column j is non-white (so can't), or the row is unassigned but the column is unassigned, but adding a white chip would require that the row and column become white. But since the current arrangement is maximal, you can't do that. Wait, but actually, if the row and column are unassigned, you could choose to make that cell white by designating its row and column as white. But since the current arrangement doesn't have those rows and columns as white, then you could add that chip, which would violate maximality. Therefore, in a maximal arrangement, such cells cannot exist. Therefore, every empty cell must be in a row or column that is already assigned a conflicting color, or is full.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to formalize the conditions again.\n\nFor an arrangement to be maximal, every empty cell (i,j) must satisfy at least one of:\n\n1. The row i is colored (white or black), and the column j is colored with a different color.\n\n2. The row i is colored and is full (i.e., all its cells are filled with its color). Wait, but if the row is colored, say white, but not full, then the remaining cells in that row could be filled with white chips unless their columns are conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is needed. Let me think of the entire grid as divided into four parts:\n\n1. The white rectangle: rows W and columns C, all filled white.\n\n2. The black rectangle: rows B and columns D, all filled black.\n\n3. The remaining rows not in W or B, and columns not in C or D: these must be empty.\n\n4. The rows in W or B but columns not in their respective sets must be empty.\n\nWait, actually, the rows in W (white rows) must have all their chips in columns C (white columns). The other columns in white rows must be empty. Similarly, black rows have their chips only in black columns D. Similarly for columns.\n\nTherefore, the entire grid is divided into:\n\n- The white rectangle: W rows \u00d7 C columns (white chips).\n\n- The black rectangle: B rows \u00d7 D columns (black chips).\n\n- The remaining cells (outside these rectangles) must be empty.\n\nMoreover, the white and black rectangles cannot overlap, so W and B rows are disjoint, and C and D columns are disjoint.\n\nTherefore, the total number of white chips is |W|\u00d7|C|, black is |B|\u00d7|D|. The constraints are |W|\u00d7|C| \u226425, |B|\u00d7|D| \u226425. Also, |W| + |B| \u22645 (rows), |C| + |D| \u22645 (columns).\n\nAdditionally, the arrangement is maximal because:\n\n- You can't add a white chip outside the white rectangle because those cells are either in black rows/columns (conflict) or in empty rows/columns, but to add a white chip would require expanding the white rectangle. However, since the white rectangle is already as large as possible given W and C, you can't expand further without exceeding the 25 limit or overlapping with black.\n\nWait, actually, the maximality is ensured by the fact that if you tried to add a white chip outside the current white rectangle, you would have to either add a new row or column to W or C. However, since the arrangement is maximal, that must not be possible. But how do we ensure that? Maybe the white rectangle is already as large as possible given the available rows and columns not in black.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that the white and black regions are as large as possible given their row and column sets, so you can't expand them further without exceeding the 25 limit or overlapping. Therefore, the counts |W|\u00d7|C| and |B|\u00d7|D| can be up to 25, but don't have to be.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting all possible such quadruples (W,B,C,D) where:\n\n- W, B are disjoint subsets of rows,\n\n- C, D are disjoint subsets of columns,\n\n- |W|\u00d7|C| \u226425,\n\n- |B|\u00d7|D| \u226425,\n\nand then the number of such arrangements is the number of ways to choose W, B, C, D multiplied by 1 (since chips are indistinct). Wait, actually, the number of ways is the number of ways to choose the rows and columns for white and black.\n\nTherefore, the total number is the sum over all possible choices of:\n\n- Selecting W_rows (size r_w), B_rows (size r_b) from 5 rows, with r_w + r_b \u22645,\n\n- Selecting W_cols (size c_w), B_cols (size c_b) from 5 columns, with c_w + c_b \u22645,\n\nsuch that r_w * c_w \u226425 and r_b * c_b \u226425,\n\nand for each such selection, the number of ways is:\n\nC(5, r_w) * C(5 - r_w, r_b) * C(5, c_w) * C(5 - c_w, c_b).\n\nBut since the white and black regions are independent once the rows and columns are chosen, this should be the case.\n\nHowever, since the white and black regions are separate, and the order of choosing doesn't matter, except that they are colored differently, this formula should hold.\n\nTherefore, to compute this, we need to iterate over all possible r_w from 0 to 5, r_b from 0 to (5 - r_w), similarly for columns c_w from 0 to 5, c_b from 0 to (5 - c_w), check the product constraints, and accumulate the product of combinations.\n\nBut this is going to involve a lot of terms. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, note that since the maximum product for a 5x5 grid is 25 (5x5), so all possible products up to 25 are allowed. Since 5x5 is 25, so any r and c up to 5 are okay as long as their product is \u226425, which they always are because r and c are at most 5, so 5x5=25. Wait, actually, yes. Since r_w and c_w can be at most 5 each, their product can be up to 25. Similarly for r_b and c_b. Therefore, the constraints r_w*c_w \u226425 and r_b*c_b \u226425 are automatically satisfied. Because the maximum possible product for white is 5\u00d75=25, same for black. Therefore, the only constraints are:\n\nr_w + r_b \u22645,\n\nc_w + c_b \u22645,\n\nand the rows and columns are chosen accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is the sum over all possible r_w, r_b, c_w, c_b with r_w + r_b \u22645 and c_w + c_b \u22645 of [C(5, r_w)*C(5 - r_w, r_b) * C(5, c_w)*C(5 - c_w, c_b)].\n\nBut this counts all possible ways of choosing white and black rectangles (possibly empty) such that they don't overlap in rows or columns. However, we need to ensure that the arrangement is maximal. Wait, but does this count include non-maximal arrangements?\n\nAh, here's the problem. The above count includes all possible such configurations, including those that aren't maximal. For example, if I choose a white rectangle of 1x1 and a black rectangle of 1x1 in separate rows and columns, then there might be empty cells where you could add more chips. Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, if the regions are filled completely, then they are maximal? Wait no. Suppose you have a white rectangle of 2 rows and 1 column. Then the white region is 2x1, filled completely. The remaining rows and columns can potentially have black regions. But if there's an empty cell not in the white region, say in a row not in white or black and column not in white or black, then you could choose to make that cell part of a black region by designating its row and column as black. Since it's empty, you could add a black chip there, which would violate maximality. Therefore, such configurations are not maximal.\n\nTherefore, my earlier assumption that choosing any non-overlapping white and black rectangles would satisfy maximality is incorrect. \n\nThis complicates things further. So the maximality requires that there are no empty cells that can be part of an expansion of either the white or black regions.\n\nTherefore, in addition to the non-overlapping conditions, the regions must also be such that:\n\n- For the white region: If you have W rows and C columns, then you can't add any more rows or columns to W or C without either exceeding the 25 chip limit (unlikely since 5x5 is 25) or overlapping with the black region.\n\nWait, but since the black region is in separate rows and columns, expanding the white region into those rows or columns would conflict with black, so you can't. Therefore, to be maximal, the white region must be the entire set of rows and columns assigned to it. That is, you can't have unassigned rows or columns in the white region's rows or columns. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the maximality requires that for the white region:\n\n- All rows in W must be entirely filled with white chips in their W columns. So if you have W rows and C columns, then all cells in W rows and C columns must be filled. Additionally, the white region cannot be expanded further. Since the remaining rows and columns are either assigned to black or unassigned, you can't expand the white region into black's area. But you could potentially expand into unassigned rows or columns. \n\nTherefore, to prevent that, the unassigned rows and columns must be such that you can't form a larger white region by including them. That is, if there's an unassigned row not in W or B, then to expand the white region to include that row, you'd need to also include some columns. However, since those columns may be unassigned or in black's columns, you can't do it without conflict. Wait, this is getting too vague.\n\nPerhaps the correct way to ensure maximality is that the white and black regions are as large as possible given the constraints. That is, if there exists an unassigned row and column that could be added to the white region without conflict, then the arrangement isn't maximal. Therefore, for the arrangement to be maximal, every unassigned row must have at least one column in the black region (so you can't add it to white), and every unassigned column must have at least one row in the black region. Similarly for black.\n\nAlternatively, more formally:\n\nTo ensure maximality, the following must hold:\n\nFor every row not in W_rows or B_rows:\n\n- If you tried to add it to W_rows, then you would need to have columns not conflicting with B_cols. But since it's unassigned, the columns would have to be in W_cols or new columns. But since we want maximality, there must be no way to do that. Therefore, every such row must have at least one column in B_cols, so that adding it to W_rows would conflict with B_cols. Similarly, every unassigned column must have at least one row in B_rows.\n\nSimilarly, for black rows and columns:\n\nEvery unassigned row must have a column in W_cols, and every unassigned column must have a row in W_rows. Wait, no, that might be overkill.\n\nAlternatively, the maximality requires that:\n\n- For any unassigned row (not in W or B), there is no set of columns (either in W or new) that can be assigned to it to form an expanded white region without conflicting with black.\n\nBut this is too vague. Perhaps the only way to ensure maximality is that the union of white and black rows covers all rows, and similarly columns. Because otherwise, there's an unassigned row and column which could form a new region.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point! If there exists an unassigned row and an unassigned column, then you could form a 1x1 region (that row and column) with either color, hence violating maximality. Therefore, to satisfy maximality, there must be no unassigned rows or columns. Because if there is an unassigned row and an unassigned column, their intersection is an empty cell where you could place a chip (by designating that row and column as either color), hence violating maximality.\n\nTherefore, the maximality condition requires that all rows are either white or black, and all columns are either white or black. There can be no unassigned rows or columns. Because otherwise, you could create a new region in the unassigned row and column.\n\nAh! That's the key. So the maximality implies that every row must be either white, black, or... wait, but rows can't be both. Since all rows must be assigned to either white, black, or else you could use an unassigned row to create a new region. So indeed, all rows must be assigned to either white or black (or maybe one of them). Similarly, all columns must be assigned to either white or black.\n\nTherefore, the entire set of rows is partitioned into white rows, black rows, and there are no unassigned rows. Similarly for columns.\n\nTherefore, the earlier constraints R_w + R_b =5 and C_w + C_b =5. Because you can't have any rows left unassigned. Because if there was an unassigned row and an unassigned column, you could add a chip there, violating maximality. Therefore, every row must be in W or B, and every column must be in W or B.\n\nTherefore, the conditions are:\n\n- R_w + R_b =5,\n\n- C_w + C_b =5,\n\n- The white region is R_w \u00d7 C_w,\n\n- The black region is R_b \u00d7 C_b,\n\n- Additionally, the white and black regions must not overlap, which requires that the white rows and columns are disjoint from black rows and columns? Wait no, the white and black regions can't overlap in cells, which requires that the white rows and black rows are disjoint, and white columns and black columns are disjoint. Wait, but since all rows are assigned to either white or black, and all columns as well, the only way their regions don't overlap is if the white rows and black rows are disjoint, and white columns and black columns are disjoint. Wait, no, actually, if a row is white and a column is black, their intersection is an empty cell (since it can't be both colors). But since all rows and columns are assigned, the regions are:\n\n- White region: W_rows \u00d7 W_cols,\n\n- Black region: B_rows \u00d7 B_cols,\n\n- The remaining cells (i.e., W_rows \u00d7 B_cols and B_rows \u00d7 W_cols) must be empty.\n\nTherefore, the total number of chips is R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b.\n\nMoreover, since all rows and columns are assigned, the maximality is achieved because any empty cell is either in a white row and black column or vice versa, so you can't place a chip there without conflicting colors. And since all rows and columns are assigned, you can't add a new region.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to partition the rows into white and black, and the columns into white and black, such that the white and black regions don't overlap (i.e., white rows and columns are separate from black ones), and the counts R_w*C_w and R_b*C_b don't exceed 25 (though since R_w and C_w are at most 5, their product is at most 25, which is exactly the number of chips available, so actually, the only constraint is that R_w*C_w \u226425 and R_b*C_b \u226425, which are automatically true since the max is 25).\n\nWait, but the problem states there are 25 white and 25 black chips available. So the white region must use at most 25 white chips, and black region at most 25 black chips. Since R_w*C_w can be up to 25 (if 5x5), but since the entire grid is 25 cells, R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b \u226425. Wait, no, the total number of chips is R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b. Since the entire grid has 25 cells, this sum must be \u226425. Because each cell is either in white, black, or empty? Wait no, according to the above, the white and black regions are non-overlapping and cover some cells, and the rest are empty. Therefore, the total number of chips is R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b, which must be \u226425 (the total available chips of each color are 25 each, so actually, the white chips used can't exceed 25, and black the same, but since they are separate, the total can be up to 25+25=50, but the grid only has 25 cells, so the total chips can't exceed 25. Wait, this is a contradiction.\n\nWait a second, this is a critical mistake. The problem states there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips available, but the grid has 25 cells. Therefore, the total number of chips placed on the grid cannot exceed 25. Therefore, R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b \u226425. Additionally, the white chips used (R_w*C_w) cannot exceed 25, and the black chips similarly. But since R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b \u226425, both are automatically \u226425.\n\nTherefore, the only constraints are:\n\n- R_w + R_b =5,\n\n- C_w + C_b =5,\n\n- R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b \u226425.\n\nAdditionally, the regions must be non-overlapping as before.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting all possible ways to partition the 5 rows into white and black, and the 5 columns into white and black, such that the total number of chips (R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b) does not exceed 25. Since all partitions are allowed except those where the total exceeds 25.\n\nWait, but since R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b is the total number of chips, and the grid has 25 cells, so the maximum possible is 25. Therefore, the condition is R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b \u226425. But since R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b can be at most 25 (when, for example, all cells are filled with one color), but actually, if you have both white and black regions, their total can be up to 25. Wait, actually, if you have both white and black regions, their total could be up to 25. For example, if white is 5x5 (25), then black has to be 0. If white is 4x4 (16), black could be 1x1 (1), totaling 17 \u226425. So the only constraint is that their sum is \u226425, which is automatically true except when?\n\nWait, actually, when both white and black regions are large. For instance, if white is 3x3 (9) and black is 3x3 (9), but since rows and columns must be partitioned, it's impossible. Let's see:\n\nSuppose white has 3 rows and 3 columns, black has 2 rows and 2 columns. Then total chips are 3*3 + 2*2 =9 +4=13 \u226425. Even if white is 4 rows and 4 columns (16 chips), then black would have 1 row and 1 column (1 chip), total 17. The maximum possible sum would be when one region is as large as possible and the other as small as possible. The maximum total is 25, which occurs when one region is the entire grid (5x5) and the other is 0. So the only constraint is that the regions are non-overlapping and partition the rows and columns. The total chips can be anything up to 25, so all such partitions are allowed except when?\n\nWait actually, there's no restriction other than partitioning rows and columns into white and black, with R_w + R_b =5 and C_w + C_b =5. Because even if their product sum exceeds 25, but since the grid has only 25 cells, the maximum possible is 25. Wait, actually, the products R_w*C_w and R_b*C_b can't add up to more than 25, because the total cells are 25. So their sum is exactly the number of chips, so it can be any number from 0 (no chips) to 25. Therefore, all such partitions are allowed. Therefore, the only constraints are that rows and columns are partitioned into white and black.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is the number of ways to partition the rows into white and black, and columns into white and black, multiplied by 1 (since the chips are indistinct and placed completely in their regions).\n\nHowever, note that swapping white and black would give different arrangements unless the regions are symmetric. So we have to count all possible such partitions.\n\nThe number of ways to partition the rows into white and black is 2^5 =32, but since we have to choose subsets, it's actually the number of subsets for white rows (each row can be white or black), so 2^5. Similarly for columns 2^5. However, since the partitions are independent, the total would be 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024. But this counts all possible partitions, including those where, for example, all rows are white and all columns are black, which would result in a white region of 5 rows \u00d70 columns =0, and black region 0\u00d75=0, so no chips. But the problem requires placing \"some\" chips, i.e., at least one chip. Wait, the problem says \"some of these chips\", which I think allows zero chips? Wait, the exact wording is: \"place some of these chips\", so \"some\" could mean one or more. Therefore, we need to subtract the case where no chips are placed (i.e., all rows and columns are partitioned such that white and black regions have zero chips). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe total number of arrangements including the all-empty case is 2^5 (for rows) * 2^5 (for columns) = 1024. \n\nBut the all-empty case occurs when either:\n\n- All rows are black and all columns are white (so white region is 0 rows \u00d75 columns =0 and black region 5 rows \u00d70 columns=0), or\n\n- All rows are white and all columns are black (same result), or\n\n- Any combination where W_rows and W_cols are disjoint, but actually, the only way to have zero chips is if either:\n\n- W_rows =0 and W_cols =0, so white region is 0,\n\n- and B_rows and B_cols must also be such that their product is zero. Wait no, actually:\n\nWait, the total chips are R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b. To have zero chips, both terms must be zero. \n\nSo either:\n\nCase 1: R_w*C_w =0 and R_b*C_b =0.\n\nWhich requires that either:\n\n- R_w=0 and C_w can be anything, but then R_b=5, so R_b*C_b =5*C_b. To have R_b*C_b=0 requires C_b=0. But since columns must be partitioned, C_b =5 - C_w. If C_w is anything, but to get C_b=0, C_w=5. But then R_w=0, so W_rows=0, B_rows=5. Then W_cols=5 (since C_w=5), B_cols=0. So the white region is 0\u00d75=0, black region is 5\u00d70=0. So that's the case where all rows are black and all columns are white. \n\nSimilarly, if R_b=0 and C_b=0, then R_w=5 and C_w=5, so white region is 5\u00d75=25, black region 0. But that actually has 25 chips. \n\nWait, so the only way to have zero chips is when:\n\nEither (R_w=0 and C_w=5) with (R_b=5 and C_b=0), or (R_b=0 and C_b=5) with (R_w=5 and C_w=0). Wait, no:\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nIf white region has R_w rows and C_w columns. To have R_w*C_w=0, either R_w=0 or C_w=0.\n\nSimilarly for black region, R_b*C_b=0 requires R_b=0 or C_b=0.\n\nTo have both white and black regions zero:\n\n- White region zero: either R_w=0 or C_w=0.\n\n- Black region zero: either R_b=0 or C_b=0.\n\nBut since R_b =5 - R_w and C_b=5 - C_w,\n\nIf white region zero (R_w*C_w=0):\n\nCase 1: R_w=0. Then R_b=5. For black region to be zero, need R_b*C_b=0 \u21d2 C_b=0. Since C_b=5 - C_w, so 5 - C_w=0 \u21d2 C_w=5. Thus, C_w=5 and C_b=0. Therefore, in this case, the white region has R_w=0 rows and C_w=5 columns, so 0\u00d75=0. Black region has R_b=5 rows and C_b=0 columns \u21d25\u00d70=0. So this is the case where all rows are black, all columns are white.\n\nCase 2: C_w=0. Then C_b=5. For black region to be zero, need R_b*C_b=0 \u21d2 R_b=0. Since R_b=5 - R_w \u21d2 R_w=5. Thus, white region has R_w=5 rows and C_w=0 \u21d25\u00d70=0. Black region has R_b=0 rows and C_b=5 \u21d20\u00d75=0. This is the case where all rows are white and all columns are black.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly two configurations with zero chips. Therefore, the total number of arrangements with at least one chip is 1024 - 2 = 1022.\n\nHowever, the problem states \"some of these chips\", which could include zero, but I think in combinatorial problems like this, \"some\" usually means at least one. So maybe we subtract 2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.\" If no chips are placed, then you could place a chip anywhere, so that arrangement is not maximal. Because the maximality requires that you cannot add any more chips. If there are no chips, then you can add one, so the empty arrangement is not maximal. Therefore, we must exclude it.\n\nBut in our earlier analysis, there are two configurations with zero chips (all rows black and columns white, or vice versa). Wait, actually in those cases, can you add a chip?\n\nTake the first case: all rows are black, columns are white. Wait, rows are black meaning that any chips in those rows must be black, but columns are white meaning any chips in those columns must be white. Therefore, any cell is in a black row and white column, so you can't place a chip there (conflict). Therefore, in that case, the arrangement with zero chips is actually maximal, because you can't add any chips. Wait, this contradicts my previous thought.\n\nWait, in the case where all rows are black and all columns are white:\n\n- Any cell is in a black row and white column, so it can't have a chip of either color (since it would need to be both). Therefore, all cells must be empty. This is a valid maximal arrangement because you can't add any chips. Similarly for the all columns black and rows white.\n\nTherefore, those two configurations are valid maximal arrangements with zero chips. However, the problem says \"some of these chips\", which might mean at least one, but the problem statement doesn't explicitly say that. It just says \"place some of these chips\". Since \"some\" can sometimes mean \"any number including zero\", but in some contexts, it means \"at least one\". The problem might require at least one chip, but it's ambiguous.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5\u00d75 grid such that:\n\neach cell contains at most one chip\n\nall chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\n\nany additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.\"\n\nThe problem doesn't specify that at least one chip must be placed, so the empty arrangement is allowed if it satisfies the conditions. But in the empty arrangement, the two conditions are satisfied (trivially, since there are no chips), and it is maximal because you can't add any chips. However, in the empty arrangement, the rows and columns are unassigned? Wait, no. In our previous analysis, the rows and columns must be partitioned into white and black. In the case of zero chips, as in all rows black and columns white, that's a valid partition, but it results in zero chips. So that arrangement is counted in the total 1024.\n\nHowever, the problem might consider that \"some\" means at least one, so we need to subtract those two cases. But the problem says \"some of these chips\", which is vague, but in combinatorial problems, usually \"some\" means \"one or more\". Therefore, I think we should exclude the two zero-chip cases. So total arrangements would be 1024 - 2 = 1022.\n\nBut let me confirm with an example.\n\nSuppose all rows are white and all columns are white. Then the white region is 5\u00d75=25 chips, which uses all 25 white chips. This is allowed and maximal, since you can't add any more chips. Similarly, if all rows and columns are black, same.\n\nAnother example: choose 2 rows as white and 3 columns as white, and the remaining rows and columns as black. The white region is 2\u00d73=6 white chips. The black region is 3\u00d72=6 black chips. Total 12 chips. This is a valid maximal arrangement because any empty cell is either in a white row and black column (can't place white or black) or vice versa. So you can't add any chips. \n\nTherefore, all the 1024 possibilities except the two zero-chip cases are valid maximal arrangements with at least one chip. However, the problem didn't specify \"at least one\", so technically the answer could be 1024. But since the empty arrangement is technically allowed, but maybe the problem expects it to be excluded. Hmm.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"Find the number of ways to place some of these chips...\"\n\nThe word \"some\" can be ambiguous, but in mathematics, unless specified otherwise, \"some\" can include zero. However, in the context of placing chips on a grid, \"placing some chips\" might mean at least one. Also, the problem mentions \"any additional chip placed on the grid would violate...\", which is true even for the empty grid, so it is a valid solution. Therefore, perhaps we should include all 1024.\n\nWait, but in the case where all rows are black and columns are white (resulting in zero chips), the rows are all black, meaning that any chip in a black row must be black, but the columns are white, so any chip in a white column must be white. Therefore, no cell can have a chip, so that's valid. Similarly the other way.\n\nTherefore, those two cases are valid, so total is 1024.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"some chips\", but in the problem statement, \"some\" might mean \"at least one\" to avoid trivial cases. But since it's not specified, maybe we have to include all. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's see the original problem again:\n\n\"Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5\u00d75 grid such that:\n\neach cell contains at most one chip\n\nall chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\n\nany additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.\"\n\nThere's no stipulation that at least one chip must be placed, so the empty grid is allowed. Hence the total number is 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024.\n\nWait, but this can't be right, because when you choose the rows and columns for white and black, you might have overlapping regions? No, because the rows and columns are partitioned, so white and black regions are disjoint.\n\nWait, the total number of ways to choose the partition of rows is 2^5 (each row is either white or black). Similarly for columns. Since the choices are independent, it's 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024. Each such choice defines a unique maximal arrangement, including the two cases with zero chips. So the answer would be 1024. \n\nHowever, I need to confirm this with an example. Let me consider a smaller grid, say 1x1, to see if the logic holds.\n\nSuppose a 1x1 grid with 1 white and 1 black chip. The problem would be similar: place some chips with the conditions. \n\nThe possible maximal arrangements:\n\n- Place a white chip: then the only cell is white. Since it's maximal (can't add anything else). \n\n- Place a black chip: similarly.\n\n- Place nothing: then you can't add any chip because the row and column are unassigned. Wait, in the 1x1 case:\n\nIf you choose the row to be white and column to be white: place the white chip. \n\nIf row is black and column black: place black.\n\nIf row is white and column black: can't place anything, so that's a maximal arrangement with zero chips.\n\nSimilarly row black and column white: also zero chips.\n\nSo total arrangements: 2 (with one chip) + 2 (zero chips) =4. Which is 2^1 *2^1 =4. So the formula holds. But in this case, the problem would count the zero chips as valid. Therefore, for the original problem, the answer is 2^5 *2^5 =1024. However, the problem has 25 chips of each color, but in the 1x1 case, there's only one of each, so similar.\n\nWait but in the 1x1 case, the two zero-chip arrangements are when the row and column are conflicting (one white, one black). Those are valid maximal arrangements. So the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, the answer should be 2^5 *2^5 =1024. But wait, the problem has two colors, so the assignments of rows and columns to white or black are independent, so yes, 2^5 for rows, 2^5 for columns, total 1024.\n\nBut let me check another angle. Suppose I choose for rows: each row is independently white or black. Similarly for columns. For each such choice, the white region is the intersection of white rows and white columns, filled with white chips. The black region is intersection of black rows and black columns, filled with black chips. The rest are empty. This is exactly the construction, and each such choice gives a unique arrangement. Since the problem allows any number of chips (including zero), the total is 2^5 *2^5 =1024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1024. However, I need to make sure that in the problem statement, the chips are \"indistinguishable\", so different arrangements that only differ in the color assignment would count as different even if the regions are the same. Wait, no, the colors are distinct, so white and black are different. For example, swapping white and black would give a different arrangement unless the regions are symmetric.\n\nTherefore, the count of 1024 is correct because each choice of row and column colorings is unique, even if they result in symmetric regions with swapped colors.\n\nWait a second, actually, when you choose rows and columns for white and black, it's a binary choice for each row and column. There is no overcounting because each configuration is uniquely determined by the choice of white rows and white columns (since black is the complement). \n\nWait, actually, the way I considered it earlier is that for rows, each is either white or black, and similarly for columns. So the total number is indeed 2^5 *2^5 =1024. Each such assignment defines a unique maximal arrangement.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1024. But I have a doubt because in the problem statement it says \"some of these chips\", and maybe they want only arrangements with at least one chip. Let me see.\n\nIf the problem requires at least one chip, then subtract the two cases where all rows and columns are conflicting (the two zero-chip cases). So 1024 -2=1022. But in the 1x1 case, the analogous would be 4-2=2, which would exclude the two zero-chip arrangements. But in the 1x1 case, the problem allows zero chips because it's maximal, so the answer should be 4. Therefore, I think the problem includes zero.\n\nHowever, the problem mentions \"some chips\", but in the problem statement's conditions, the empty grid satisfies all conditions. Therefore, it must be included.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1024. However, I recall that in some similar problems, sometimes the all-zero case is considered non-maximal because you can add a chip, but in this case, in the all-zero case with conflicting rows and columns, you cannot add any chip. So it is maximal.\n\nWait in the all-zero case where rows are all black and columns all white, you can't add any chip. Similarly the other way. So those are valid.\n\nHence, the total is 1024.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another example. Suppose in a 2x2 grid:\n\nNumber of arrangements would be 2^2 *2^2=16.\n\nLet me list them:\n\nEach row can be W or B, each column can be W or B.\n\nFor instance:\n\nAll rows W, all columns W: 2x2 white chips.\n\nAll rows W, columns W and B split:\n\nSuppose rows: W W\n\nColumns: W B\n\nThen white region is 2 rows \u00d71 column =2 cells white.\n\nBlack region: 0 rows (since remaining rows are 0) \u00d71 column (remaining columns)=0.\n\nThe other cells (rows W and column B) are empty because they are in white rows and black columns (conflict).\n\nSimilarly, other combinations.\n\nAll possibilities are counted in 16. Including cases with zero chips, like rows all W and columns all B: which results in zero chips, since white region is 2\u00d70 and black region 0\u00d72. And that is maximal.\n\nThus, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2^5 *2^5 = 1024.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"some of these chips\", but the chips are 25 white and 25 black. However, in the arrangement where all cells are white, you need to use 25 white chips, which is allowed since there are exactly 25. Similarly for all black.\n\nTherefore, all configurations are allowed as long as the number of white chips used (R_w*C_w) does not exceed 25, which it never does, since R_w and C_w are at most 5. Similarly for black.\n\nTherefore, the total number is 1024. But wait, the problem says \"indistinguishable chips\", so does the count change?\n\nWait, no. Because the chips are indistinct, but the placement is determined by the regions. Each maximal arrangement is uniquely determined by the choice of white rows and columns, so the count remains 2^5*2^5=1024.\n\nHence, the answer should be \\boxed{1024}.\n\nWait, but I recall that in some similar problems, the count is different. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that the regions are determined by the row and column choices independently. Because when you choose rows and columns for white, the black regions are determined as the remaining rows and columns. However, the black region is the intersection of black rows and black columns. So the total arrangements are indeed the product of the row and column choices, hence 2^5 *2^5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the white and black regions cannot overlap, which they don't because of the partitioning. So yes, it's correct.\n\nWait, but in the process of choosing rows and columns, you might have:\n\nSuppose you choose some rows and columns for white, and the rest are black. The white region is white rows \u00d7 white columns. The black region is black rows \u00d7 black columns. These two regions don't overlap because white rows and black rows are disjoint, same with columns. Therefore, the total is indeed 2^5 *2^5.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 1024. However, I need to verify once more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a restriction that the white and black regions cannot be empty? No, the problem allows it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that each row and column must be entirely of one color if they have any chips. Which is already considered in the model.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 1024. But wait, the problem says \"any additional chip placed on the grid would violate...\", and in the case where you have both white and black regions, adding a chip in the intersection of a white row and black column is blocked, so it's okay. All cases are maximal.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1024}. However, I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes problems like this have a different answer. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: For each cell, its color is determined by the color of its row and column. To satisfy the conditions:\n\n- If a cell is in a white row and white column, it must be white.\n\n- If in a black row and black column, it must be black.\n\n- If in conflicting colors (white row, black column or vice versa), it must be empty.\n\n- If in an unassigned row or column? Wait no, all rows and columns are assigned to white or black.\n\nTherefore, each maximal arrangement is determined uniquely by the choice of which rows and columns are white or black. Since each row and column has two choices, independent of others, the total is 2^5 *2^5 = 1024.\n\nThus, I'm confident the answer is 1024.\n\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of ways to place white and black chips on a 5\u00d75 grid such that each row and column has chips of a single color, and the arrangement is maximal (no additional chips can be placed without violating the conditions). \n\nKey steps:\n1. **Maximality Condition**: Every empty cell must be in a row or column of a conflicting color, preventing any further placements.\n2. **Row and Column Partitioning**: Each row and column must be assigned to either white, black, or remain unassigned. However, to ensure maximality, all rows and columns must be assigned to either white or black. This prevents having unassigned rows or columns, which would allow adding chips.\n3. **Non-overlapping Regions**: The white region (intersection of white rows and columns) and the black region (intersection of black rows and columns) must not overlap. This is naturally satisfied by partitioning rows and columns into white and black.\n4. **Counting Configurations**: Each row can independently be white or black (2 choices per row), and similarly for each column (2 choices per column). This results in \\(2^5 \\times 2^5 = 1024\\) configurations.\n\nThus, the number of valid maximal arrangements is \\(\\boxed{1024}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThere are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinct except for color. I need to place some of them in the grid such that each cell has at most one chip. The conditions are:\n\n1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.\n2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.\n3. The arrangement is maximal, meaning I can't add any more chips without violating the first two conditions.\n\nHmm, okay. So each row must be all white or all black, but only the chips that are placed in that row. Wait, actually, the problem says \"all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\". So if a row has some chips, they must all be the same color, and similarly for columns. But since the chips are placed in cells, each cell can have at most one chip. So for each row, either it's entirely empty, or all the chips in it are the same color. Same with columns. \n\nAdditionally, the arrangement must be maximal. That means that if I try to add any more chips, I can't, because adding a chip would violate the row or column color condition. So the placement is as large as possible given the constraints. \n\nSo, the problem is to count the number of such maximal arrangements. \n\nFirst, I need to think about how such a maximal arrangement would look. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, since each row can be either all white, all black, or empty? Wait, no, the row can have some number of chips, but all the chips in the row must be the same color. Similarly for columns. But the row must also not allow any more chips without violating the color condition. \n\nWait, actually, if a row is not completely filled, then adding a chip to that row would require that the new chip is the same color as the existing ones. But if the row is already partially filled with, say, white chips, then adding another white chip would be okay unless the column it's in already has a different color? Wait, no. The column must also have all chips of the same color. So if I want to add a chip to a cell in a row that already has white chips, then the column for that cell must also not have any conflicting colors. \n\nThis seems a bit complex. Maybe there's a better way to model this. Let me think of the grid as a matrix where each cell is either empty or has a color (W or B). The constraints are that in each row, all non-empty cells are the same color. Similarly, in each column, all non-empty cells are the same color. And the arrangement is maximal, meaning that you can't add any chip without violating the row or column color constraints. \n\nSo, for maximality, suppose in a row, if there is at least one cell not filled, but adding a chip to that cell would conflict with the row's color or the column's color. Wait, but to be maximal, for every empty cell, either the row already has chips of a different color (so you can't add that color), or the column already has chips of a different color (so you can't add that color), or the row is empty but adding a color would conflict with the column's color? Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal condition implies that every empty cell is in a row that already has both colors? Wait, no, that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the maximal condition requires that for every empty cell, either its row is already filled with a color, or its column is already filled with a different color? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal arrangement is such that for every row, either the entire row is filled with one color, or it's empty? But no, that can't be, because then the column constraints might not hold. \n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me think of the grid as a matrix where each row is either all white, all black, or empty, and each column is similarly constrained. But also, the arrangement is maximal. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal condition implies that every row is either entirely white, entirely black, or entirely empty, and similarly for columns. But that might not be sufficient. Wait, if a row is partially filled with white chips, then it can't be extended further without violating the color constraints. So the row must be such that there exists at least one column in that row which is already filled with a different color? \n\nHmm, perhaps an example would help. Let me try to think of a small grid. Suppose a 2x2 grid. Let me see how the maximal arrangements would look there. \n\nSuppose in a 2x2 grid, if I place a white chip in the top-left cell. Then the row (top row) must be all white, so the other cell in the top row must be white or empty? Wait, no, actually, since the top row has a white chip, then any other chip in that row must also be white. But the column (left column) has a white chip, so any other chip in that column must also be white. \n\nTherefore, if I have a white chip in (1,1), then the entire first row and first column must be white? Wait, no, not necessarily. Wait, the first row must have all chips of the same color as the existing ones. Since there's a white chip in the first row, the rest of the row must either be white or empty. Similarly, the first column must be all white or empty. But if I have a white chip in (1,1), then the cell (1,2) can be white or empty, and (2,1) can be white or empty. But if I want the arrangement to be maximal, then I cannot add any more chips. So, suppose I have just (1,1) as white. Then, can I add a white chip in (1,2)? Since the row is already partially white, adding another white is okay, but then the column (column 2) would then have a white chip. But then, if I added (1,2), then the row is still white, and column 2 now has a white. But then, the cell (2,2) is in column 2 (which now is white) and row 2. If row 2 is empty, then you could add a white there. Wait, so if you only have (1,1), then you could add (1,2) and (2,1), so the arrangement isn't maximal. \n\nTherefore, to make it maximal, if you have a white in (1,1), you need to have all the remaining cells in row 1 and column 1 filled with white? Or perhaps not. Wait, perhaps the maximal arrangement requires that every row is either completely filled with one color or empty, and every column is the same? But that might be too restrictive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximal condition requires that for every row, if it's not completely filled, then all columns that intersect it have a different color? \n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to think of it in terms of the grid being partitioned into monochromatic rectangles. Wait, perhaps each cell that is filled must belong to a rectangle of the same color, but the maximal condition would mean that you can't have any larger such rectangle. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: since each row must be monochromatic (if non-empty) and each column must be monochromatic (if non-empty), then the entire grid's filled cells form a set of rows and columns that are colored such that overlapping rows and columns agree on the color. \n\nWait, perhaps the arrangement can be described by choosing for each row a color (W, B, or none) and for each column a color (W, B, or none), such that whenever a row and column intersect, their colors are compatible (either the same or one is empty). But the maximal condition complicates this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each cell that is filled must have its row and column both set to that color. So if a cell is filled with white, then the entire row must be white and the entire column must be white? Wait, that can't be, because then if you have two white cells in different rows and columns, their rows and columns would have to be all white, leading to a larger rectangle. \n\nWait, actually, if a cell is filled, then its entire row must be of that color, and its entire column must be of that color. Therefore, the only way this can happen is that all filled cells form a rectangle of a single color. But then, if you have two overlapping rectangles of different colors, that would conflict. \n\nWait, perhaps the filled cells must form a rectangle of one color, and the rest can be filled with another color? No, but the problem allows for both colors. Hmm, maybe I need to think of the grid as partitioned into regions where each region is a rectangle of a single color, and these regions don't overlap except on edges? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire grid is partitioned into some rows and columns. Let me think again step by step. \n\nThe key constraints are:\n\n1. Each row is either empty or all chips in it are the same color (either W or B).\n2. Each column is either empty or all chips in it are the same color (either W or B).\n3. The arrangement is maximal, so you can't add any more chips without violating 1 or 2.\n\nSo, for maximality, every empty cell must be such that either its row is already non-empty with a color different from the potential color you might place, or its column is already non-empty with a different color. \n\nAlternatively, for every empty cell (i,j), either row i has some color (so you can't place a different color there) or column j has some color (so you can't place a different color there). But if both row i and column j are non-empty, they must be the same color, otherwise you couldn't place anything in (i,j). \n\nWait, perhaps the maximal condition implies that for every empty cell (i,j), either row i is non-empty (so the color of row i is fixed, so you can't place a different color there, but could you place the same color? Wait, but if the row is already non-empty, say white, then you can place white in (i,j). But then, the column j must also be white? Because if column j had a different color, then placing white would conflict. \n\nHmm, this is getting really tangled. Let me try to think of the maximal condition more formally. \n\nSuppose the grid has some cells filled. To be maximal, there must be no empty cell where you can place a chip (either white or black) without violating the row or column color constraints. \n\nSo for any empty cell (i,j), if you tried to place a white chip there, either:\n\n- The row i already has a black chip (so can't place white), or\n\n- The column j already has a black chip (so can't place white), or\n\n- The row i is entirely empty and the column j is entirely empty, but then you could place white? Wait, no, in that case, you could place white, so the arrangement wouldn't be maximal. \n\nWait, so to prevent that, if a cell (i,j) is empty, then placing white there would require that either row i has some non-white (so row i has black or is not all white), or column j has some non-white. Similarly, placing black there would require that either row i has some non-black or column j has some non-black. \n\nTherefore, to make the arrangement maximal, for every empty cell (i,j), either:\n\n- The row i is non-empty and its color is different from white (so you can't place white), or the column j is non-empty and its color is different from white (so you can't place white). \n\nSimilarly, for black: either row i is non-empty and its color is not black, or column j is non-empty and its color is not black. \n\nBut actually, to prevent placing any color, both must hold? Wait, no. To prevent placing either color, it must be that for every empty cell (i,j):\n\nEither:\n\n- The row i has a color different from white (so can't place white) and a color different from black (so can't place black). But that's impossible because a row can only be one color or empty.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to think is that, for each empty cell (i,j), either:\n\n- The row i is non-empty (so has a color, say C), and the column j is non-empty (has a color D), and C \u2260 D. Then you can't place any color there because any color would conflict with either the row or column.\n\nOr,\n\n- The row i is non-empty with color C, and the column j is empty. But then, you could place color C in (i,j), so unless the column is non-empty with a different color, you can't have that.\n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe a better approach is to model this as a matrix where each row is either empty, all white, or all black, and each column is similarly constrained. Moreover, the arrangement must be such that there's no way to add another chip without violating the row or column color. \n\nSo, for a row to be non-maximal, if it's partially filled, then you could add more chips. Wait, but if a row is partially filled with white chips, then to add another white chip is okay as long as the column allows it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximal condition requires that every row is either entirely filled with a color or entirely empty, and similarly for every column. Because if a row is partially filled, you could add more chips to it as long as the column constraints allow. \n\nWait, that might be the case. Let me see: Suppose a row has some white chips but isn't full. Then, to be maximal, you can't add another white chip in that row. Therefore, every column in that row must already have a non-white color? Because otherwise, you could add a white chip to an empty cell in the row whose column is also empty or white. \n\nHmm, so maybe the only way a row can be partially filled is if all the remaining columns in that row are blocked by columns of a different color. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal arrangements are exactly those where every row is entirely filled with a single color or empty, and every column is entirely filled with a single color or empty, and the intersection of a filled row and a filled column must have the same color. \n\nWait, that might make sense. Let me think through this.\n\nSuppose that each row is either all white, all black, or empty, and each column is similarly. Additionally, whenever a row and column are both non-empty, their colors must match. Because otherwise, the cell at their intersection would have conflicting colors. \n\nTherefore, the entire arrangement must be such that all non-empty rows have the same color, and all non-empty columns have the same color, and the color of the rows must equal the color of the columns. Wait, but that would mean that all non-empty rows and columns must be of a single color. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the colors of the rows and columns must be consistent. For example, suppose some rows are white, some are black, but then the columns must also be white or black in such a way that wherever a white row and a black column intersect, there can be no chip. But this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the set of filled rows and columns must form a rectangle of a single color. Wait, perhaps the entire filled area must form a rectangle of one color. Because if you have two different colors, their rectangles would have to be separate, but overlapping would cause conflicts. \n\nWait, suppose we have a white rectangle and a black rectangle. The overlapping cells would have to be both white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, all non-empty cells must be of a single color. Therefore, the entire arrangement is a single monochromatic rectangle, or two separate monochromatic rectangles of different colors? Wait, but different colors can't overlap. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire grid is partitioned into regions of white and black, each forming a rectangle, but they can't overlap. However, the maximal condition complicates this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only maximal arrangements are those where all the non-empty cells form a rectangle of a single color, and that rectangle is as large as possible. But how does maximality play here?\n\nWait, maybe the maximal condition requires that for any row that is not completely filled, all the columns intersecting it must be filled with that row's color or already have another color. Hmm, not sure. \n\nPerhaps another approach: Let's model the problem as choosing for each row a color (W, B, or empty), and similarly for each column, such that whenever a row and column are both non-empty, they must agree on the color. Then, the total number of such assignments, but considering that the chips are placed in the intersections where the row and column agree. \n\nBut also, the arrangement must be maximal. So, if a row is set to W, then all columns that are non-empty must also be W where they intersect. Wait, this is getting too vague. Let me formalize this.\n\nSuppose that for each row, we choose a color (W, B, or none), and similarly for each column. However, whenever a row is colored C and a column is colored D, the cell at their intersection must be colored only if C = D. The chips are placed in all cells where the row's color and column's color are the same and not none. \n\nAdditionally, to satisfy maximality, there should be no way to change a row or column from \"none\" to a color without causing a conflict. Wait, perhaps not exactly. \n\nAlternatively, the maximality condition implies that for any row that is not fully colored (i.e., if it's colored at all), it cannot be extended further. But if a row is colored W, then all columns that intersect it must also be W or empty? Wait, this is getting too tangled. \n\nMaybe an alternative approach: Since each row is either all white, all black, or empty, and each column is the same, the entire arrangement can be thought of as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote R_i as the color of row i (W, B, or 0 for empty). Similarly, C_j for column j. \n\nThe condition is that for every cell (i,j), if R_i is not 0 and C_j is not 0, then R_i must equal C_j. Otherwise, the cell is empty. \n\nWait, but that might not capture all cases. Let me think again. \n\nActually, the color of the cell (i,j) must be equal to the color of row i if the row is non-empty, and also equal to the color of column j if the column is non-empty. Therefore, whenever both row i and column j are non-empty, their colors must be equal. \n\nTherefore, all non-zero rows must have the same color, and all non-zero columns must also have the same color, and the row color must equal the column color. \n\nWait, that's an important point. Suppose there are two non-empty rows with different colors. Then, any column that intersects both would have to be both colors, which is impossible. Therefore, all non-empty rows must have the same color. Similarly, all non-empty columns must have the same color. Moreover, the row color must equal the column color. \n\nTherefore, there are a few cases:\n\n1. All non-empty rows and columns are white.\n\n2. All non-empty rows and columns are black.\n\n3. All rows are empty except some, and all columns are empty except some, but their colors must match.\n\nWait, actually, the conclusion is that either:\n\n- All non-empty rows are white, and all non-empty columns are white.\n\n- All non-empty rows are black, and all non-empty columns are black.\n\n- Or, all rows and columns are empty (but this is trivial and probably not maximal).\n\nWait, but the maximal condition requires that you can't add any more chips. So if all rows and columns are empty, you can add a chip anywhere, so that's not maximal. Therefore, the only maximal arrangements are those where either:\n\n- There exists at least one non-empty row and column, and all non-empty rows and columns are of the same color (either all white or all black), and the intersection of non-empty rows and columns form a rectangle of that color, and this rectangle is maximal in the sense that you can't add any more rows or columns of that color without violating the maximality.\n\nWait, perhaps more precisely, the arrangement consists of choosing a subset of rows (possibly none) and a subset of columns (possibly none), all of the same color, such that the intersection of these rows and columns is filled with that color, and there are no other chips outside this rectangle. Additionally, the rectangle must be as large as possible in the sense that you can't add another row or column to it without being able to extend the rectangle further, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, actually, given the constraints, if you choose some rows and columns of the same color, then the filled cells must be exactly the intersection of those rows and columns. Because any cell not in those rows or columns would be in an empty row or column, hence cannot have a chip. \n\nMoreover, to make it maximal, you can't add any more rows or columns of that color. Wait, but how does that work?\n\nSuppose you have a rectangle formed by selecting some rows and columns of white. To make it maximal, you can't add any more rows or columns to the white set, because that would allow adding more white chips. Wait, but if you add a new row, then the existing columns would allow you to fill the new row in those columns, right? \n\nTherefore, for maximality, the selected rows and columns must form a rectangle such that there are no other rows or columns that can be added without allowing an extension. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximal condition requires that every row not in the selected rows must have at least one column in the selected columns that is already filled (so they can't be added), and similarly every column not in the selected columns must have at least one row in the selected rows that is filled. \n\nAlternatively, the complement of the selected rows must intersect the complement of the selected columns in such a way that you can't extend. \n\nThis is getting too abstract. Let me think of it in terms of choosing a rectangle. \n\nSuppose we choose a rectangle of size a x b, filled with white chips. To be maximal, there can't be any row outside of the a rows that could be added to the rectangle (i.e., all such rows must have at least one column in the b columns already filled with white, so you can't add those rows without adding more white chips in those columns, which would require the columns to be extended, but the columns are already part of the rectangle). Wait, actually, if you have a rectangle of a rows and b columns, then any row not in those a rows could potentially be added as a new row to the rectangle, but only if all the columns in the existing rectangle allow it (i.e., those columns are still white). But since those columns are already part of the rectangle, they are white, so you could indeed add another row. \n\nTherefore, to make it maximal, you can't add any more rows or columns. Therefore, the rectangle must cover all rows or all columns? \n\nWait, that can't be. For example, if you have a 5x5 grid, choosing all rows and columns would fill the entire grid, which is maximal. But smaller rectangles can also be maximal if they can't be extended. \n\nWait, suppose we have a 3x3 white rectangle in the top-left corner. Then, to be maximal, you can't add any more rows or columns to this rectangle. However, you could add a fourth row (say row 4) and set it to white, provided that the existing columns (1-3) are white. But adding row 4 would allow filling columns 1-3 in row 4, which is allowed. Therefore, the 3x3 rectangle isn't maximal because you can extend it. \n\nTherefore, to be maximal, the rectangle must be such that you can't add any more rows or columns to it. That would mean that either all rows are included, or all columns are included. Wait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the maximal rectangle must be such that either all rows are included or all columns are included. Wait, not necessarily. \n\nAlternatively, the maximal rectangle must be as large as possible, such that you can't add a row without also needing to add a column, which might not be possible. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's try to formalize it. \n\nSuppose the white rectangle is formed by selecting R rows and C columns. To be maximal, you can't add any row not in R or column not in C without being able to extend the rectangle. \n\nTherefore, to prevent adding a row r not in R, there must be at least one column in C that already has a white chip in some other row, but actually, if you add row r to R, you can fill all columns in C with white in row r, which would be allowed unless those columns already have another color. But since we are considering only white, the columns must already be white. Therefore, actually, you can always add another row if the columns are white. \n\nTherefore, the only way to prevent adding more rows is if there are no rows left to add, i.e., R is all rows. Similarly, to prevent adding more columns, C must be all columns. \n\nWait, so the only maximal white rectangle is the entire grid. But that's not true, because you could have a smaller rectangle but arranged such that the remaining rows or columns cannot be added because they conflict with other colors? \n\nAh! Here's the thing: the arrangement can include both white and black regions, as long as their rectangles don't overlap. \n\nWait, perhaps the entire grid can be partitioned into white and black rectangles that don't overlap, and the arrangement is maximal. \n\nWait, but how would that work? Let me think. \n\nSuppose there is a white rectangle and a black rectangle, but they don't overlap. Then, the white rectangle can be extended into the black area if possible, but since those areas are black, you can't. \n\nAlternatively, if the white and black regions are separated by rows and columns. For instance, suppose the first two rows are white, the next two are black, and the fifth is empty. But then columns would have to be consistent. \n\nAlternatively, suppose we divide the grid into regions using rows and columns. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximal arrangements are those where the grid is divided into four regions by a horizontal and vertical line, with one quadrant white, another black, but this might not satisfy the row and column constraints. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think in terms of choosing a set of rows and columns for white and another set for black, such that their intersections don't conflict. \n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me consider that the grid must be partitioned into white and black regions where each region is a rectangle, and the regions don't overlap. Moreover, each row and column is entirely one color or empty. \n\nWait, but actually, the problem allows for rows and columns to be empty. The key is that in any row that has chips, all chips are the same color, and similarly for columns. So the filled cells must form a set of rows and columns of a single color, but overlapping regions must agree in color. \n\nAlternatively, the entire arrangement can be characterized by choosing a set of rows and columns for white, and a set of rows and columns for black, such that the white regions and black regions don't overlap, and every cell is either in a white region, black region, or empty. But this might not capture all constraints. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be equivalent to choosing for each cell a color or empty, such that rows and columns are monochromatic (if non-empty), and the arrangement is maximal. \n\nPerhaps the key is that the maximal arrangement corresponds to a partition of the grid into white and black rectangles, where each rectangle is as large as possible. But I need to formalize this. \n\nAlternatively, here's another thought: The maximal condition implies that for every pair of a row and column not both in the filled regions, you cannot add a chip there because either the row is already filled with a different color, or the column is. \n\nTherefore, the entire grid is divided into white and black regions such that the white region is a rectangle (rows W_rows and columns W_cols), and the black region is a rectangle (rows B_rows and columns B_cols), and these regions do not overlap (i.e., W_rows and B_rows are disjoint or their columns don't intersect). Wait, but overlapping would require same color. \n\nAlternatively, the white and black regions must be separated by rows and columns. \n\nThis is getting too vague. Let me look for a different angle. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the possible color assignments. Each row can be in one of three states: white, black, or empty. Similarly, each column can be in one of three states. However, the assignments must be consistent: if a row is white and a column is black, their intersection must be empty. \n\nMoreover, the arrangement is maximal, so you cannot add any more chips. That means that for every empty cell (i,j), either row i is non-empty (so you can't place a different color there) or column j is non-empty (same). \n\nTherefore, the set of empty cells must be exactly the cells where either the row is non-empty or the column is non-empty with a different color. Wait, actually, for any empty cell (i,j), it must be that:\n\nIf you try to place white there, either row i is non-white (so it's black or empty) or column j is non-white (so it's black or empty). But to block both possibilities, the cell must be in a row that's black or a column that's black (if trying to place white), and similarly for black. \n\nTherefore, the empty cells are precisely those cells that are in a row of a different color or a column of a different color. \n\nAlternatively, the non-empty cells must form a set where all the rows and columns they are in are monochromatic, and the rest of the grid is blocked by conflicting colors. \n\nWait, perhaps the non-empty cells form a rectangle of one color, say white, and all rows outside this rectangle are black or all columns outside are black, preventing extension. \n\nAlternatively, the non-empty cells form a white rectangle, and all the rows not in this rectangle are black, and all columns not in this rectangle are black? Then you can't add anything else. \n\nWait, let's suppose the white rectangle is a \u00d7 b. Then, to prevent adding more white chips, the remaining rows must be black or the remaining columns must be black. \n\nBut if the remaining rows are black, then those rows can't have white, but they can have black. However, adding a black chip in a remaining row but in a column outside the white rectangle would be allowed unless that column is already white. \n\nHmm, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to think of possible cases.\n\nCase 1: All cells are filled with a single color. Then this is maximal, because you can't add anything. There are 2 such arrangements (all white or all black).\n\nCase 2: The grid is partially filled with a single color, say white, such that you can't add any more white chips, and there are no black chips. To be maximal, any empty cell must be in a row or column that already has white (so you can't add white there). But if a row has some white and some empty, then the empty cells in that row are in columns that must already have non-white (but there are no black chips). Contradiction. Therefore, all rows with any white must be entirely white, and all columns with any white must be entirely white. So the white region must be a rectangle. To be maximal, you can't add any more rows or columns to this rectangle. That would require that every row not in the rectangle has at least one column in the rectangle which is already white, so you can't extend the row. Wait, but those columns are already white, so you could extend the row into those columns. \n\nWait, actually, if the white rectangle is a \u00d7 b, then any row not in the a rows could be extended into the b columns, but since those columns are already white, the row would have to be white. So to prevent that, those rows must be non-white, i.e., they must be black or empty. But if they are black, then their intersection with the white columns would be conflicting. \n\nTherefore, to have a white rectangle a \u00d7 b and prevent adding more rows, the rows outside must be black, but then their columns can't be white. Contradiction. \n\nHmm, maybe the only way is that the white rectangle is the entire grid, which is case 1. Similarly for black. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximal arrangements with a single color must be the full grid. Because otherwise, you can always add another row or column. \n\nWait, let's test with a smaller grid. Suppose a 1x1 grid. Then, placing a white or black chip is maximal (since you can't add more). Also, leaving it empty is not maximal because you can add a chip. So for 1x1, there are 2 maximal arrangements. \n\nFor a 2x2 grid:\n\nCase 1: All white or all black: 2 arrangements.\n\nCase 2: A 1x1 white square. To be maximal, the remaining cells must be blocked. The remaining cells are in rows and columns that are either non-white or non-white? Wait, if I have a single white cell at (1,1), then rows 1 and columns 1 are white. The other cells:\n\n- (1,2): in row 1 (white), so can't place non-white. But can place white? But the column 2 is empty, so column 2 could be white. But since the arrangement is maximal, we can't add anything. Therefore, to block adding white to (1,2), column 2 must be non-white (black or empty). But if column 2 is non-white, then it's black or empty. If it's black, then you can't place white there, but you could place black in (1,2) if row 1 is white? No, because row 1 is white, so you can't place black there. \n\nWait, if column 2 is black, then (1,2) is in a white row and black column, so it must be empty. Similarly, (2,1) is in a white column and whatever row 2 is. To block adding to (2,1), row 2 must be non-white (black or empty). If row 2 is black, then (2,1) is in black row and white column, so must be empty. (2,2) is in row 2 (black) and column 2 (black), so can be black. But then, can we add black to (2,2)? If we do, then the arrangement would have white at (1,1), black at (2,2), but then row 1 has white and column 2 has black, conflicting at (1,2). Wait, no, (1,2) is in a white row and black column, so it can't have a chip. But (2,2) is in black row and column, so can be black. \n\nWait, actually, if I have (1,1) as white, then row 1 is white, column 1 is white. Then, if I set row 2 to black, then column 2 can be black. Then (2,2) can be black. But then, the arrangement would have white at (1,1) and black at (2,2). However, the row 2 is black, so the entire row 2 must be black. But column 2 is black, so the entire column 2 must be black. Therefore, (1,2) must be black, but row 1 is white. Contradiction. \n\nTherefore, such an arrangement is impossible. So to have a single white cell at (1,1), the other cells must be such that rows and columns outside can't be filled. \n\nAlternatively, if I have (1,1) as white, then row 1 is white, column 1 is white. To prevent adding to (1,2), column 2 must be non-white (black or empty). If column 2 is black, then row 1 can't have black, so (1,2) must be empty. To prevent adding to column 2, the rows not in row 1 must have their columns set such that they can't add black. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe in the 2x2 case, the only maximal arrangements are the fully filled ones and those where all rows and columns are either entirely white or entirely black, forming a rectangle. Wait, actually, perhaps in the 2x2 grid, another maximal arrangement is a 1x2 white row and a 2x1 black column, but their intersection can't have both. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the only maximal arrangements with a single color are the full grid, and the other maximal arrangements involve both colors in such a way that they block each other. \n\nWait, suppose in the 2x2 grid, we have the top row white and the right column black. Then their intersection at (1,2) must be empty. The other cells: (2,1) can be black (since column 1 is empty and row 2 is empty?), but actually, row 2 hasn't been assigned a color yet. \n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern or mathematical formula. \n\nWait, going back to the original problem. Since each row and column must be monochromatic if non-empty, the entire arrangement is determined by selecting a subset of rows and columns for white, and another subset for black, such that the white and black regions do not overlap, and the arrangement is maximal. \n\nMoreover, the maximality implies that every empty cell is adjacent (in row or column) to a conflicting color. \n\nAlternatively, the entire grid is partitioned into white, black, and empty regions, where each non-empty region is a rectangle of a single color, and these rectangles are placed such that they can't be expanded without overlapping. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem reduces to choosing a white rectangle and a black rectangle that don't overlap, and together they cover the entire grid? No, because they could leave some cells empty. But maximality requires that those empty cells can't be filled with either color. \n\nAlternatively, the white and black regions must form a partition of the grid such that any empty cell is on a row or column of both colors, preventing it from being filled. \n\nThis seems similar to a bipartition of the grid into white, black, and a forbidden region where rows and columns have conflicting colors. \n\nAlternatively, think of the grid as a bipartition between white and black regions, where the white region is a rectangle and the black region is another rectangle, and their union is the entire grid, but they can't overlap. But that would require that their rectangles are complementary. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be equivalent to choosing a subset of rows and columns for white and another for black such that:\n\n- The white rows and columns form a rectangle (i.e., if a row is white, all its columns in the white set are white).\n\nWait, perhaps the key idea is that the white region is determined by a set of rows and a set of columns, and the intersection of these is filled with white. Similarly for black. However, white and black regions can't overlap. \n\nTo maximize, the white and black regions must be such that there is no space left to add another region without overlapping. \n\nAlternatively, the entire grid must be covered by white and black rectangles, with no overlaps, and every cell is in exactly one of the rectangles or is empty but cannot be filled due to conflicting row/column colors. \n\nThis is still too vague. Let me try to think in terms of the possible color assignments for rows and columns.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet R_w be the set of rows colored white.\n\nLet R_b be the set of rows colored black.\n\nSimilarly, C_w and C_b for columns.\n\nRows not in R_w or R_b are empty.\n\nColumns not in C_w or C_b are empty.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\n- For any row in R_w, all its columns must be in C_w or empty? No, actually, the row is white, so all its non-empty cells must be white. However, the columns can be white or empty. Wait, no. If a row is white, then any column intersecting it must either be white (so their intersection is white) or empty (so the cell is empty). Similarly, a column in C_w must have all its non-empty rows in R_w.\n\nTherefore, the white cells are exactly the intersection of R_w and C_w.\n\nSimilarly, the black cells are exactly the intersection of R_b and C_b.\n\nMoreover, R_w and R_b must be disjoint (a row can't be both white and black), similarly for C_w and C_b.\n\nAdditionally, the white and black regions cannot overlap, so R_w \u2229 R_b = empty, and C_w \u2229 C_b = empty? No, actually, the regions can't overlap in the grid, so the intersections (R_w \u00d7 C_w) and (R_b \u00d7 C_b) must be disjoint. Therefore, either R_w and R_b are disjoint, or C_w and C_b are disjoint? Not exactly. The regions can overlap only if their colors are the same, but since white and black are different, their regions must not overlap. Therefore:\n\nFor any cell (i,j), it can be white only if i \u2208 R_w and j \u2208 C_w, and black only if i \u2208 R_b and j \u2208 C_b. Therefore, to prevent overlap, we must have that:\n\nIf a cell is in both R_w \u00d7 C_w and R_b \u00d7 C_b, that would mean it's both white and black, which is impossible. Hence, the sets R_w \u00d7 C_w and R_b \u00d7 C_b must be disjoint. \n\nThis can be achieved if either:\n\n- The row sets R_w and R_b are disjoint, or\n\n- The column sets C_w and C_b are disjoint,\n\nBut actually, more precisely, for any row in R_w, it cannot be in R_b, and vice versa. Similarly for columns. So R_w and R_b are disjoint, and C_w and C_b are disjoint. \n\nAdditionally, the regions must not overlap, which is already satisfied if the row and column sets are disjoint.\n\nWait, actually, the regions can only overlap if a row is in both R_w and R_b (which they can't be), or a column is in both C_w and C_b (which they can't be). So as long as R_w and R_b are disjoint, and C_w and C_b are disjoint, the regions won't overlap. \n\nNow, the maximality condition requires that there is no way to add another white or black cell. \n\nTo add a white cell at (i,j), we need that i is not in R_b (since R_b rows are black) and j is not in C_b (since C_b columns are black). Also, i can be in R_w or not, and j can be in C_w or not. But to add white at (i,j), we need to add i to R_w and j to C_w, but this must not conflict with existing assignments. \n\nHowever, the maximality condition says that such an addition is not possible. Therefore, for every cell not in R_w \u00d7 C_w \u222a R_b \u00d7 C_b (i.e., the empty cells), either:\n\n- The row i is in R_b (so can't be white) or the column j is in C_b (same),\n\nAND\n\n- The row i is in R_w (can't be black) or the column j is in C_w (same).\n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe the maximality condition translates to:\n\nFor every empty cell (i,j):\n\n- Either row i is in R_b (so can't be white) or column j is in C_b (so can't be white),\n\nAND\n\n- Either row i is in R_w (so can't be black) or column j is in C_w (so can't be black).\n\nTherefore, for an empty cell, it cannot be turned white or black without violating the existing row or column assignments. \n\nTherefore, for each empty cell (i,j):\n\nEither:\n\n1. row i is in R_b or column j is in C_b (prevents white),\n\nAND\n\n2. row i is in R_w or column j is in C_w (prevents black).\n\nTherefore, combining these, for an empty cell (i,j):\n\nEither (row i is in R_b or column j in C_b) AND (row i in R_w or column j in C_w).\n\nThis can be rephrased as:\n\nEither:\n\n- (row i in R_b AND row i in R_w) which is impossible since R_w and R_b are disjoint,\n\n- (row i in R_b AND column j in C_w),\n\n- (column j in C_b AND row i in R_w),\n\n- (column j in C_b AND column j in C_w) which is impossible,\n\nSo the valid cases are:\n\nEither:\n\n- row i is in R_b and column j is in C_w, \n\nOR \n\n- column j is in C_b and row i is in R_w.\n\nTherefore, the empty cells must lie in the intersection of R_b \u00d7 C_w or R_w \u00d7 C_b.\n\nTherefore, the entire grid is partitioned into:\n\n- White region: R_w \u00d7 C_w,\n\n- Black region: R_b \u00d7 C_b,\n\n- Empty regions: (R_b \u00d7 C_w) \u222a (R_w \u00d7 C_b),\n\n- The remaining cells would be those not in R_w \u222a R_b or C_w \u222a C_b, but since rows and columns not in R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b are empty rows or columns, so their intersections are also empty.\n\nTherefore, the entire grid is covered by these four regions:\n\n1. White: R_w \u00d7 C_w,\n\n2. Black: R_b \u00d7 C_b,\n\n3. Empty: R_b \u00d7 C_w,\n\n4. Empty: R_w \u00d7 C_b,\n\nAdditionally, the rows not in R_w or R_b are entirely empty, and columns not in C_w or C_b are entirely empty.\n\nNow, the maximality condition is satisfied because any empty cell is either in R_b \u00d7 C_w (so can't be white because column is C_w? Wait, no, R_b is black rows, so row is black, so can't be white. Column C_w is white columns, so can't be black because column is white. So the cell can't be colored either way. Similarly for R_w \u00d7 C_b.\n\nTherefore, such a partition satisfies the maximality condition. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing:\n\n- Two disjoint sets of rows: R_w and R_b (since a row can't be both white and black),\n\n- Two disjoint sets of columns: C_w and C_b,\n\n- Additionally, the remaining rows (not in R_w or R_b) are empty,\n\n- The remaining columns (not in C_w or C_b) are empty.\n\nMoreover, since we can have empty rows and columns, the only constraints are that R_w and R_b are disjoint, and C_w and C_b are disjoint. \n\nHowever, we also have the chips available: 25 white and 25 black. The number of white chips used is |R_w| \u00d7 |C_w|, and black chips used is |R_b| \u00d7 |C_b|. These must satisfy:\n\n|R_w| \u00d7 |C_w| \u2264 25,\n\n|R_b| \u00d7 |C_b| \u2264 25,\n\nand the total chips used (white + black) must be \u2264 50 (but since each cell is at most one, the total is |R_w|\u00d7|C_w| + |R_b|\u00d7|C_b| \u2264 25 cells, since it's a 5x5 grid. Wait, actually, the grid has 25 cells. Wait, the problem says \"some of these chips\", so total chips placed can be up to 25, but with the constraints. \n\nWait, the problem states \"each cell contains at most one chip\", so the total number of chips is between 0 and 25. But since the arrangement must be maximal, it can't have fewer than some number. \n\nBut in our current model, the number of white chips is |R_w|\u00d7|C_w| and black is |R_b|\u00d7|C_b|, so total chips is |R_w||C_w| + |R_b||C_b|. This must be \u226425. \n\nHowever, since we have 25 white and 25 black chips available, but we can choose to use any number up to those, as long as the total chips don't exceed 25. But actually, the problem allows using any number of chips, as long as the conditions are met. \n\nWait, but the chips are indistinct except for color, so the count is based on the number of white and black chips used, but since they are indistinct, the only thing that matters is the counts. However, the problem says \"some of these chips\", so we can use any number from 0 to 25, but with the constraints. \n\nBut in our current model, the count is fixed by the sizes of R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b. \n\nTherefore, to count the number of such maximal arrangements, we need to consider all possible choices of R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b such that:\n\n1. R_w and R_b are disjoint subsets of the 5 rows,\n\n2. C_w and C_b are disjoint subsets of the 5 columns,\n\n3. The white region R_w \u00d7 C_w and black region R_b \u00d7 C_b do not overlap (which they don't by construction),\n\n4. The total number of white chips |R_w||C_w| \u226425 and black chips |R_b||C_c| \u226425. But since the grid is 5x5, the maximum possible is 25, so this is automatically satisfied as long as the regions are within the grid.\n\nHowever, the problem requires that the arrangement is maximal. Wait, but in our current model, any such partition is maximal because any empty cell can't be filled. So all such partitions are maximal? \n\nWait, actually yes. Because in such a partition, every empty cell is in R_b \u00d7 C_w or R_w \u00d7 C_b, so can't be filled with either color. Therefore, these are indeed maximal. \n\nAdditionally, the only other maximal arrangements would be those where either all rows and columns are white or black (the full grid), but those are included in the above model by setting R_w = all rows, C_w = all columns, R_b and C_b empty; or vice versa for black. \n\nTherefore, the total number of maximal arrangements is equal to the number of ways to choose R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b with the above conditions. \n\nHowever, we have to consider that the white and black regions can be empty. For example, if R_w and C_w are empty, then the white region is empty, and the black region is R_b \u00d7 C_b. Similarly, if both are empty, the entire grid is empty, but that's not maximal because you can add a chip. Wait, so the case where both R_w,C_w and R_b,C_b are empty (i.e., all rows and columns are empty) is not allowed, since it's not maximal. \n\nTherefore, we must exclude the case where both white and black regions are empty. \n\nSo, the total number is equal to the number of possible choices of R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b where:\n\n- R_w and R_b are disjoint subsets of rows,\n\n- C_w and C_b are disjoint subsets of columns,\n\n- At least one of the regions (white or black) is non-empty (to ensure maximality),\n\nplus the cases where one region is the entire grid (but those are already included).\n\nWait, actually, the above conditions already include all possible non-empty cases except the entirely empty grid, which we have to subtract. \n\nTherefore, the total number is:\n\n(Total number of choices for R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b with R_w \u2229 R_b = \u2205, C_w \u2229 C_b = \u2205) minus 1 (the all-empty case).\n\nBut how do we count the total number?\n\nFirst, note that for the rows:\n\nEach row can be in R_w, R_b, or neither. However, R_w and R_b must be disjoint. So for each row, there are three choices: white, black, or empty. Similarly for columns: each column can be in C_w, C_b, or neither. \n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b without any restrictions except R_w \u2229 R_b = \u2205 and C_w \u2229 C_b = \u2205 is:\n\n(3^5) * (3^5) = 3^10.\n\nBut from this, we must subtract the case where both white and black regions are empty. The regions are empty if R_w = R_b = \u2205 and C_w = C_b = \u2205. Wait, actually, the regions are empty if either:\n\n- For white: R_w and C_w are both empty,\n\n- For black: R_b and C_b are both empty.\n\nBut the entire arrangement is empty only when both white and black regions are empty, i.e., R_w = C_w = \u2205 and R_b = C_b = \u2205. \n\nTherefore, the number of arrangements where the grid is entirely empty is 1 (all rows and columns are empty). \n\nTherefore, the total number of maximal arrangements is 3^10 - 1. But wait, this can't be right because some of these choices might not satisfy the maximality condition. \n\nWait, actually, in our earlier analysis, any such choice where the regions are non-empty (i.e., not all empty) corresponds to a maximal arrangement. But actually, there's a mistake here: even if you choose R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b such that, for example, R_w is non-empty but C_w is empty, then the white region is R_w \u00d7 C_w which is empty. Similarly for other cases. \n\nTherefore, the regions can be empty individually, but the arrangement is considered maximal as long as the non-empty regions are set such that you can't add anything. \n\nWait, but suppose we choose R_w = {row1}, C_w = {}, then the white region is empty. Similarly, if C_w is empty, then even if R_w is non-empty, the white region is empty. \n\nTherefore, the maximality condition is satisfied as long as for every empty cell, the constraints are met. Even if one of the regions is empty. \n\nTherefore, all the 3^10 - 1 possibilities (excluding the all-empty grid) are valid maximal arrangements. But this can't be correct because some of these would allow adding chips. \n\nWait, let's test with an example. \n\nSuppose we choose R_w = {row1}, C_w = {col1}, and R_b = {row2}, C_b = {col2}. \n\nThen the white region is row1, col1: cell (1,1).\n\nThe black region is row2, col2: cell (2,2).\n\nThe remaining empty cells are in:\n\n- R_b \u00d7 C_w = {row2} \u00d7 {col1}: cell (2,1),\n\n- R_w \u00d7 C_b = {row1} \u00d7 {col2}: cell (1,2),\n\n- and other cells not in any of the row or column sets. For example, cell (3,3) is in neither R_w nor R_b, and neither C_w nor C_b, so it's in an empty row and column, so can it be filled?\n\nWait, the row 3 is not in R_w or R_b, so it's an empty row. Similarly column3 is not in C_w or C_b, so it's an empty column. Therefore, cell (3,3) is in an empty row and column. \n\nAccording to our earlier analysis, such a cell can be filled with either color? Because the row and column are empty. \n\nBut in our current model, the arrangement would allow this, but according to the maximality condition, it should not. \n\nAh! Here's the problem. In our current counting, we considered that any cell not in white or black regions is in R_b \u00d7 C_w or R_w \u00d7 C_b or in the remaining empty rows/columns. \n\nThe remaining cells not in any of the four regions (white, black, R_b\u00d7C_w, R_w\u00d7C_b) are those where the row is neither in R_w nor R_b and the column is neither in C_w nor C_b. For such cells, their rows and columns are entirely empty. Therefore, those cells can be filled with either color, violating the maximality. \n\nTherefore, our earlier analysis was incorrect. The regions R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b must be chosen such that there are no such remaining cells. In other words, every row must be in either R_w or R_b or neither, but if a row is in neither, then all its columns must be in neither C_w nor C_b, but that leads to the possibility of adding chips. \n\nTherefore, to satisfy maximality, the entire grid must be covered by the four regions (white, black, R_b\u00d7C_w, R_w\u00d7C_b). That is, there are no rows or columns that are neither in R_w nor R_b, and similarly for columns. \n\nTherefore, every row must be in either R_w or R_b, and every column must be in either C_w or C_b. \n\nAh! This is the missing condition. \n\nTherefore, to ensure maximality, there can be no rows or columns that are entirely empty. Because if there is a row not in R_w or R_b, then it's an empty row, and its columns not in C_w or C_b would allow placing a chip there. \n\nTherefore, the correct conditions are:\n\n- Every row is in either R_w or R_b,\n\n- Every column is in either C_w or C_b,\n\n- R_w and R_b are disjoint,\n\n- C_w and C_b are disjoint.\n\nThus, each row is assigned to either white or black,\n\nEach column is assigned to either white or black,\n\nWith the white region being R_w \u00d7 C_w and black region R_b \u00d7 C_b,\n\nAnd the other regions being R_b \u00d7 C_w (empty) and R_w \u00d7 C_b (empty).\n\nThis way, there are no rows or columns left unassigned, so every cell is in one of the four regions, hence every empty cell is in R_b \u00d7 C_w or R_w \u00d7 C_b, so cannot be filled. \n\nTherefore, the total number of such arrangements is:\n\nFor each row, decide whether it's in R_w or R_b (2 choices per row),\n\nFor each column, decide whether it's in C_w or C_b (2 choices per column),\n\nBut we have to exclude the case where all rows are in R_w and all columns in C_b (or similar), but actually, no, all possibilities are allowed except the case where both white and black regions are empty? Wait no. \n\nWait, actually, each row must be assigned to either R_w or R_b (so 2^5 choices),\n\nEach column must be assigned to either C_w or C_b (so 2^5 choices),\n\nBut we have to exclude the case where either:\n\n- All rows are in R_w and all columns in C_b: then white region is R_w\u00d7C_w = all rows \u00d7 empty = empty, and black region is R_b\u00d7C_b = empty \u00d7 all columns = empty. So the entire grid is empty, which is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, if all rows are in R_b and all columns in C_w, same problem.\n\nWait, actually, the only invalid case is when either:\n\n- All rows are in R_w and all columns in C_b (white region empty, black region empty),\n\n- Or all rows in R_b and all columns in C_w (same),\n\n- Or both white and black regions are empty in another way?\n\nWait, more precisely, the only case where both white and black regions are empty is when:\n\nEither:\n\n- R_w and C_w are both empty, and R_b and C_b are both empty (but this requires all rows assigned to neither, which is not allowed as per the new conditions),\n\nWait no, under the new conditions, every row is assigned to R_w or R_b, and every column to C_w or C_b. So the only way both white and black regions are empty is if:\n\n- R_w is non-empty but C_w is empty, and R_b is non-empty but C_b is empty,\n\nBut in that case, the white region is R_w \u00d7 empty = empty, and black region is R_b \u00d7 empty = empty,\n\nBut columns must be assigned to C_w or C_b, so if C_w and C_b are both empty, that would violate the column assignment. Wait, no, columns must be assigned to either C_w or C_b, so C_w and C_b cannot both be empty. \n\nWait, actually, if all columns are assigned to C_w, then C_b is empty,\n\nIf all columns are assigned to C_b, then C_w is empty,\n\nBut if some columns are in C_w and others in C_b, then both are non-empty.\n\nTherefore, the only way for both white and black regions to be empty is:\n\nEither:\n\n- R_w is non-empty but C_w is empty (so all columns are in C_b),\n\nand R_b is non-empty but C_b is empty (so all columns are in C_w),\n\nwhich is impossible because columns can't be both in C_w and C_b.\n\nAlternatively, the case where:\n\nAll rows are in R_w, and all columns are in C_b,\n\nthen white region is R_w \u00d7 C_w = all rows \u00d7 empty = empty,\n\nblack region is R_b \u00d7 C_b = empty \u00d7 all columns = empty,\n\nso the entire grid is empty. \n\nSimilarly, if all rows are in R_b and all columns in C_w, same result. \n\nTherefore, the only invalid case is when:\n\nEither (all rows in R_w AND all columns in C_b) OR (all rows in R_b AND all columns in C_w). \n\nTherefore, the total number of valid arrangements is:\n\nTotal assignments (2^5 \u00d7 2^5) minus the 2 invalid cases where the grid is entirely empty. \n\nWait, actually, how many such invalid cases are there?\n\nCase 1: All rows in R_w, all columns in C_b.\n\nThis is 1 case (since all rows assigned to R_w, all columns to C_b).\n\nCase 2: All rows in R_b, all columns in C_w.\n\nAlso 1 case.\n\nTherefore total invalid cases are 2.\n\nTherefore, the total number of maximal arrangements is (2^5)(2^5) - 2 = 1024 - 2 = 1022.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me verify this.\n\nEach row has 2 choices: R_w or R_b: 2^5.\n\nEach column has 2 choices: C_w or C_b: 2^5.\n\nTotal combinations: 2^5 \u00d7 2^5 = 1024.\n\nFrom this, subtract the two cases where the entire grid is empty:\n\n- All rows in R_w and all columns in C_b (so white region is R_w\u00d7C_w = all rows \u00d7 columns not in C_b? Wait no, C_w is empty in this case because all columns are in C_b. So white region is R_w \u00d7 C_w = all rows \u00d7 empty set = empty. Similarly, black region is R_b (empty) \u00d7 C_b (all columns) = empty. So the grid is empty.\n\nSimilarly for the other case.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly 2 such cases where the grid is entirely empty, which are invalid because the arrangement isn't maximal (you can add a chip). Therefore, subtract 2.\n\nHence total arrangements: 1024 - 2 = 1022.\n\nHowever, this counts all possible color assignments of rows and columns (each row to W or B, each column to W or B), except the two cases where the grid is empty.\n\nBut wait, does this account for the colorings where, for example, some rows are assigned to W but their columns are assigned to B, leading to empty regions?\n\nYes, because those are allowed as long as they are maximal. For instance, if some rows are W and some columns are B, their intersection is empty but can't be filled.\n\nBut in this count, we are considering all possible assignments except the two entirely empty cases. Each such assignment corresponds to a maximal arrangement because any empty cell is blocked by row or column color.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1022?\n\nWait, but the problem mentions indistinct chips. However, in our counting, we considered the assignments of rows and columns to colors, which would correspond to different arrangements even if the actual chips are indistinct. Since the chips of the same color are indistinct, the count is correct because the regions are determined by the row and column choices, and the chips are placed accordingly.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"the number of ways to place some of these chips\". Since the chips are indistinct except for color, the different arrangements are determined by which cells are white, black, or empty, under the given constraints. The way we counted (assigning rows and columns to colors) directly corresponds to the placement of chips, so each assignment corresponds to exactly one arrangement. Hence the total is 1022.\n\nBut the problem has a 5x5 grid. Wait, 2^5\u00d72^5 is 1024, minus 2 gives 1022. But this seems too large. Let me think of a small case again.\n\nTake the 1x1 grid. Then rows and columns are 1 each.\n\nTotal assignments: 2\u00d72 =4.\n\nSubtract 2 cases where grid is empty: 4-2=2. Which matches the correct answer (all white or all black). \n\nFor 2x2 grid:\n\nTotal would be 2^2\u00d72^2 -2 = 16-2=14.\n\nLet me see if that makes sense.\n\nPossible maximal arrangements:\n\n1. All white (1),\n\n2. All black (1),\n\n3. White in a 1x1 cell and black in another, but arranged so they don't conflict? Wait, but in our model, each arrangement is determined by row and column assignments.\n\nFor example:\n\nAssign first row to W, second to B,\n\nFirst column to W, second to B.\n\nThen white region is (1,1), black region (2,2). The other cells (1,2) is R_w \u00d7 C_b (empty), (2,1) is R_b \u00d7 C_w (empty). This is a valid maximal arrangement.\n\nSimilarly, many others. \n\nTotal 14 seems plausible for 2x2. \n\nTherefore, the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, for the 5x5 grid, the answer should be 2^5\u00d72^5 -2 = 1024-2=1022.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions \"some of these chips\", so the empty grid is excluded (since it uses zero chips), but in our count we subtracted the two cases where the grid is entirely empty. Wait, actually in our count, the two subtracted cases are precisely the two assignments that lead to an empty grid (all rows W and columns B, or vice versa). \n\nTherefore, the total number of maximal arrangements is 1022. But let me confirm once more.\n\nWait, in the 1x1 case, the two subtracted cases are:\n\n- Row assigned to W, column assigned to B: cell is empty.\n\n- Row assigned to B, column assigned to W: cell is empty.\n\nThese are the two cases leading to empty grid, so subtracting them gives 2, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly for 2x2, yes. \n\nTherefore, for 5x5, the answer is 1022. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions\". The two conditions being that all chips in the same row/column are same color. So, the maximal condition is indeed captured by our model. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 1022. \n\nWait, but the problem specifies 25 white chips and 25 black chips available. Does this affect the count? \n\nHmm, in our current model, we didn't consider the number of chips used. For example, an arrangement might require 30 white chips, but we only have 25. Wait, but in the 5x5 grid, the maximum number of white chips is 5\u00d75=25, similarly for black. Therefore, any arrangement using up to 25 white and/or black chips is allowed as long as they don't exceed the available chips. \n\nHowever, in our counting above, we considered all possible assignments, even those that require more than 25 chips of a color. \n\nWait a minute! This is a critical oversight. \n\nFor example, if we assign all 5 rows to R_w and all 5 columns to C_w, then the white region is 5\u00d75=25 chips, which is exactly the number available. That's okay. \n\nBut if we assign all rows to R_w and all columns to C_w and some to C_b, but that might complicate. \n\nWait, actually, in our model, the number of white chips is |R_w| \u00d7 |C_w| and black chips is |R_b| \u00d7 |C_b|. Since the total white chips cannot exceed 25 and black similarly. \n\nHowever, in a 5x5 grid, the maximum white chips is 25 (if R_w and C_w are all 5), which is exactly the number available. Similarly for black. \n\nBut if an arrangement requires, say, 30 white chips, which is impossible, but in a 5x5 grid, the maximum is 25, so it's okay. \n\nWait, actually, in our model, since the grid is 5x5, the maximum white chips is 5\u00d75=25, so any assignment is allowed as long as the counts are within the grid. Since we have exactly 25 white and 25 black chips, any arrangement that uses W chips \u226425 and B chips \u226425 is okay, but since the grid has only 25 cells, W + B \u226425. \n\nHowever, the problem states \"some of these chips\", so we can use any number from 0 to 25, provided the constraints. \n\nBut in our previous counting, we counted all assignments except the two empty grid cases, but some of those assignments may require more than 25 white or black chips? \n\nWait, no, because in a 5x5 grid, the maximum white chips possible is 25 (when R_w and C_w are all 5). Similarly for black. Since the problem allows using up to 25 of each, those are okay. \n\nTherefore, actually, all the assignments except the two empty grid cases are valid, because even if an arrangement uses 25 white and 0 black, or 0 white and 25 black, or any combination where W + B \u226425. \n\nTherefore, the total number is indeed 2^5\u00d72^5 -2 = 1022. \n\nBut the problem says \"Find the number of ways to place some of these chips...\". The chips are indistinct except for color, so each maximal arrangement is uniquely determined by which cells are white, black, or empty, under the constraints. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1022. \n\nHowever, I have a doubt because the problem specifies 25 white and 25 black chips. Does this affect the count? \n\nWait, suppose an arrangement requires, say, 10 white chips and 15 black chips. Since we have 25 of each, that's okay. The only constraint is that we can't use more than 25 of either. Since all arrangements in our count use at most 25 of each, it's okay. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 1022. \n\nWait, but I recall that in some combinatorial problems, the assignment of rows and columns might have symmetries or overcounting. For example, swapping white and black might result in the same arrangement if the counts are the same. But in this problem, since the chips are colored, swapping white and black would produce a different arrangement unless the regions are symmetric. \n\nHowever, the problem counts arrangements as distinct if the colors are different. So white and black are distinguishable, so each assignment is unique. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is indeed 1022. \n\nBut wait, let me verify with another small case. Take 1x1 grid:\n\nUsing the formula: 2^(1+1) -2 =4-2=2, which matches. \n\nAnother test case: 2x2 grid. \n\nTotal arrangements: 14. Let me count manually:\n\nCases where all white:1, all black:1,\n\nCases with one white and one black: For example, the diagonal. There are two possibilities (white at (1,1) and black at (2,2), or white at (1,2) and black at (2,1)), but actually, in our model, these correspond to different row and column assignments. \n\nWait, actually, for 2x2:\n\nEach arrangement is determined by row assignments (2 rows each to W or B) and column assignments (2 columns each to W or B), except the two empty cases.\n\nTotal 14. \n\nIt's tedious to count them all, but let's see:\n\nNumber of ways to assign rows: 2^2=4,\n\ncolumns: 2^2=4,\n\nTotal 16. Subtract 2 gives 14.\n\nYes, so the formula holds. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 1022. \n\nWait, but the problem might require that at least one chip is placed. Since the two subtracted cases are the entirely empty grids, which are invalid because they are not maximal. Therefore, the total is indeed 1022. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{1022}.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem requires finding the number of ways to place indistinguishable white and black chips on a 5\u00d75 grid such that each row and column is monochromatic if non-empty, and the arrangement is maximal (no additional chips can be placed without violating the constraints).\n\nKey steps:\n1. **Row and Column Assignments**: Each row can be assigned to white (W), black (B), or must be part of either W or B rows.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThere are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinct except for color. I need to place some of them in the grid such that each cell has at most one chip. The conditions are:\n\n1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.\n2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.\n3. The arrangement is maximal, meaning I can't add any more chips without violating the first two conditions.\n\nHmm, okay. So each row must be all white or all black, but only the chips that are placed in that row. Wait, actually, the problem says \"all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\". So if a row has some chips, they must all be the same color, and similarly for columns. But since the chips are placed in cells, each cell can have at most one chip. So for each row, either it's entirely empty, or all the chips in it are the same color. Same with columns. \n\nAdditionally, the arrangement must be maximal. That means that if I try to add any more chips, I can't, because adding a chip would violate the row or column color condition. So the placement is as large as possible given the constraints. \n\nSo, the problem is to count the number of such maximal arrangements. \n\nFirst, I need to think about how such a maximal arrangement would look. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, since each row can be either all white, all black, or empty? Wait, no, the row can have some number of chips, but all the chips in the row must be the same color. Similarly for columns. But the row must also not allow any more chips without violating the color condition. \n\nWait, actually, if a row is not completely filled, then adding a chip to that row would require that the new chip is the same color as the existing ones. But if the row is already partially filled with, say, white chips, then adding another white chip would be okay unless the column it's in already has a different color? Wait, no. The column must also have all chips of the same color. So if I want to add a chip to a cell in a row that already has white chips, then the column for that cell must also not have any conflicting colors. \n\nThis seems a bit complex. Maybe there's a better way to model this. Let me think of the grid as a matrix where each cell is either empty or has a color (W or B). The constraints are that in each row, all non-empty cells are the same color. Similarly, in each column, all non-empty cells are the same color. And the arrangement is maximal, meaning that you can't add any chip without violating the row or column color constraints. \n\nSo, for maximality, suppose in a row, if there is at least one cell not filled, but adding a chip to that cell would conflict with the row's color or the column's color. Wait, but to be maximal, for every empty cell, either the row already has chips of a different color (so you can't add that color), or the column already has chips of a different color (so you can't add that color), or the row is empty but adding a color would conflict with the column's color? Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal condition implies that every empty cell is in a row that already has both colors? Wait, no, that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the maximal condition requires that for every empty cell, either its row is already filled with a color, or its column is already filled with a different color? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal arrangement is such that for every row, either the entire row is filled with one color, or it's empty? But no, that can't be, because then the column constraints might not hold. \n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me think of the grid as a matrix where each row is either all white, all black, or empty, and each column is similarly constrained. But also, the arrangement is maximal. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal condition implies that every row is either entirely white, entirely black, or entirely empty, and similarly for columns. But that might not be sufficient. Wait, if a row is partially filled with white chips, then it can't be extended further without violating the color constraints. So the row must be such that there exists at least one column in that row which is already filled with a different color? \n\nHmm, perhaps an example would help. Let me try to think of a small grid. Suppose a 2x2 grid. Let me see how the maximal arrangements would look there. \n\nSuppose in a 2x2 grid, if I place a white chip in the top-left cell. Then the row (top row) must be all white, so the other cell in the top row must be white or empty? Wait, no, actually, since the top row has a white chip, then any other chip in that row must also be white. But the column (left column) has a white chip, so any other chip in that column must also be white. \n\nTherefore, if I have a white chip in (1,1), then the entire first row and first column must be white? Wait, no, not necessarily. Wait, the first row must have all chips of the same color as the existing ones. Since there's a white chip in the first row, the rest of the row must either be white or empty. Similarly, the first column must be all white or empty. But if I have a white chip in (1,1), then the cell (1,2) can be white or empty, and (2,1) can be white or empty. But if I want the arrangement to be maximal, then I cannot add any more chips. So, suppose I have just (1,1) as white. Then, can I add a white chip in (1,2)? Since the row is already partially white, adding another white is okay, but then the column (column 2) would then have a white chip. But then, if I added (1,2), then the row is still white, and column 2 now has a white. But then, the cell (2,2) is in column 2 (which now is white) and row 2. If row 2 is empty, then you could add a white there. Wait, so if you only have (1,1), then you could add (1,2) and (2,1), so the arrangement isn't maximal. \n\nTherefore, to make it maximal, if you have a white in (1,1), you need to have all the remaining cells in row 1 and column 1 filled with white? Or perhaps not. Wait, perhaps the maximal arrangement requires that every row is either completely filled with one color or empty, and every column is the same? But that might be too restrictive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximal condition requires that for every row, if it's not completely filled, then all columns that intersect it have a different color? \n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to think of it in terms of the grid being partitioned into monochromatic rectangles. Wait, perhaps each cell that is filled must belong to a rectangle of the same color, but the maximal condition would mean that you can't have any larger such rectangle. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: since each row must be monochromatic (if non-empty) and each column must be monochromatic (if non-empty), then the entire grid's filled cells form a set of rows and columns that are colored such that overlapping rows and columns agree on the color. \n\nWait, perhaps the arrangement can be described by choosing for each row a color (W, B, or none) and for each column a color (W, B, or none), such that whenever a row and column intersect, their colors are compatible (either the same or one is empty). But the maximal condition complicates this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each cell that is filled must have its row and column both set to that color. So if a cell is filled with white, then the entire row must be white and the entire column must be white? Wait, that can't be, because then if you have two white cells in different rows and columns, their rows and columns would have to be all white, leading to a larger rectangle. \n\nWait, actually, if a cell is filled, then its entire row must be of that color, and its entire column must be of that color. Therefore, the only way this can happen is that all filled cells form a rectangle of a single color. But then, if you have two overlapping rectangles of different colors, that would conflict. \n\nWait, perhaps the filled cells must form a rectangle of one color, and the rest can be filled with another color? No, but the problem allows for both colors. Hmm, maybe I need to think of the grid as partitioned into regions where each region is a rectangle of a single color, and these regions don't overlap except on edges? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire grid is partitioned into some rows and columns. Let me think again step by step. \n\nThe key constraints are:\n\n1. Each row is either empty or all chips in it are the same color (either W or B).\n2. Each column is either empty or all chips in it are the same color (either W or B).\n3. The arrangement is maximal, so you can't add any more chips without violating 1 or 2.\n\nSo, for maximality, every empty cell must be such that either its row is already non-empty with a color different from the potential color you might place, or its column is already non-empty with a different color. \n\nAlternatively, for every empty cell (i,j), either row i has some color (so you can't place a different color there) or column j has some color (so you can't place a different color there). But if both row i and column j are non-empty, they must be the same color, otherwise you couldn't place anything in (i,j). \n\nWait, perhaps the maximal condition implies that for every empty cell (i,j), either row i is non-empty (so the color of row i is fixed, so you can't place a different color there, but could you place the same color? Wait, but if the row is already non-empty, say white, then you can place white in (i,j). But then, the column j must also be white? Because if column j had a different color, then placing white would conflict. \n\nHmm, this is getting really tangled. Let me try to think of the maximal condition more formally. \n\nSuppose the grid has some cells filled. To be maximal, there must be no empty cell where you can place a chip (either white or black) without violating the row or column color constraints. \n\nSo for any empty cell (i,j), if you tried to place a white chip there, either:\n\n- The row i already has a black chip (so can't place white), or\n\n- The column j already has a black chip (so can't place white), or\n\n- The row i is entirely empty and the column j is entirely empty, but then you could place white? Wait, no, in that case, you could place white, so the arrangement wouldn't be maximal. \n\nWait, so to prevent that, if a cell (i,j) is empty, then placing white there would require that either row i has some non-white (so row i has black or is not all white), or column j has some non-white. Similarly, placing black there would require that either row i has some non-black or column j has some non-black. \n\nTherefore, to make the arrangement maximal, for every empty cell (i,j), either:\n\n- The row i is non-empty and its color is different from white (so you can't place white), or the column j is non-empty and its color is different from white (so you can't place white). \n\nSimilarly, for black: either row i is non-empty and its color is not black, or column j is non-empty and its color is not black. \n\nBut actually, to prevent placing any color, both must hold? Wait, no. To prevent placing either color, it must be that for every empty cell (i,j):\n\nEither:\n\n- The row i has a color different from white (so can't place white) and a color different from black (so can't place black). But that's impossible because a row can only be one color or empty.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to think is that, for each empty cell (i,j), either:\n\n- The row i is non-empty (so has a color, say C), and the column j is non-empty (has a color D), and C \u2260 D. Then you can't place any color there because any color would conflict with either the row or column.\n\nOr,\n\n- The row i is non-empty with color C, and the column j is empty. But then, you could place color C in (i,j), so unless the column is non-empty with a different color, you can't have that.\n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe a better approach is to model this as a matrix where each row is either empty, all white, or all black, and each column is similarly constrained. Moreover, the arrangement must be such that there's no way to add another chip without violating the row or column color. \n\nSo, for a row to be non-maximal, if it's partially filled, then you could add more chips. Wait, but if a row is partially filled with white chips, then to add another white chip is okay as long as the column allows it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximal condition requires that every row is either entirely filled with a color or entirely empty, and similarly for every column. Because if a row is partially filled, you could add more chips to it as long as the column constraints allow. \n\nWait, that might be the case. Let me see: Suppose a row has some white chips but isn't full. Then, to be maximal, you can't add another white chip in that row. Therefore, every column in that row must already have a non-white color? Because otherwise, you could add a white chip to an empty cell in the row whose column is also empty or white. \n\nHmm, so maybe the only way a row can be partially filled is if all the remaining columns in that row are blocked by columns of a different color. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal arrangements are exactly those where every row is entirely filled with a single color or empty, and every column is entirely filled with a single color or empty, and the intersection of a filled row and a filled column must have the same color. \n\nWait, that might make sense. Let me think through this.\n\nSuppose that each row is either all white, all black, or empty, and each column is similarly. Additionally, whenever a row and column are both non-empty, their colors must match. Because otherwise, the cell at their intersection would have conflicting colors. \n\nTherefore, the entire arrangement must be such that all non-empty rows have the same color, and all non-empty columns have the same color, and the color of the rows must equal the color of the columns. Wait, but that would mean that all non-empty rows and columns must be of a single color. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the colors of the rows and columns must be consistent. For example, suppose some rows are white, some are black, but then the columns must also be white or black in such a way that wherever a white row and a black column intersect, there can be no chip. But this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the set of filled rows and columns must form a rectangle of a single color. Wait, perhaps the entire filled area must form a rectangle of one color. Because if you have two different colors, their rectangles would have to be separate, but overlapping would cause conflicts. \n\nWait, suppose we have a white rectangle and a black rectangle. The overlapping cells would have to be both white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, all non-empty cells must be of a single color. Therefore, the entire arrangement is a single monochromatic rectangle, or two separate monochromatic rectangles of different colors? Wait, but different colors can't overlap. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire grid is partitioned into regions of white and black, each forming a rectangle, but they can't overlap. However, the maximal condition complicates this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only maximal arrangements are those where all the non-empty cells form a rectangle of a single color, and that rectangle is as large as possible. But how does maximality play here?\n\nWait, maybe the maximal condition requires that for any row that is not completely filled, all the columns intersecting it must be filled with that row's color or already have another color. Hmm, not sure. \n\nPerhaps another approach: Let's model the problem as choosing for each row a color (W, B, or empty), and similarly for each column, such that whenever a row and column are both non-empty, they must agree on the color. Then, the total number of such assignments, but considering that the chips are placed in the intersections where the row and column agree. \n\nBut also, the arrangement must be maximal. So, if a row is set to W, then all columns that are non-empty must also be W where they intersect. Wait, this is getting too vague. Let me formalize this.\n\nSuppose that for each row, we choose a color (W, B, or none), and similarly for each column. However, whenever a row is colored C and a column is colored D, the cell at their intersection must be colored only if C = D. The chips are placed in all cells where the row's color and column's color are the same and not none. \n\nAdditionally, to satisfy maximality, there should be no way to change a row or column from \"none\" to a color without causing a conflict. Wait, perhaps not exactly. \n\nAlternatively, the maximality condition implies that for any row that is not fully colored (i.e., if it's colored at all), it cannot be extended further. But if a row is colored W, then all columns that intersect it must also be W or empty? Wait, this is getting too tangled. \n\nMaybe an alternative approach: Since each row is either all white, all black, or empty, and each column is the same, the entire arrangement can be thought of as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote R_i as the color of row i (W, B, or 0 for empty). Similarly, C_j for column j. \n\nThe condition is that for every cell (i,j), if R_i is not 0 and C_j is not 0, then R_i must equal C_j. Otherwise, the cell is empty. \n\nWait, but that might not capture all cases. Let me think again. \n\nActually, the color of the cell (i,j) must be equal to the color of row i if the row is non-empty, and also equal to the color of column j if the column is non-empty. Therefore, whenever both row i and column j are non-empty, their colors must be equal. \n\nTherefore, all non-zero rows must have the same color, and all non-zero columns must also have the same color, and the row color must equal the column color. \n\nWait, that's an important point. Suppose there are two non-empty rows with different colors. Then, any column that intersects both would have to be both colors, which is impossible. Therefore, all non-empty rows must have the same color. Similarly, all non-empty columns must have the same color. Moreover, the row color must equal the column color. \n\nTherefore, there are a few cases:\n\n1. All non-empty rows and columns are white.\n\n2. All non-empty rows and columns are black.\n\n3. All rows are empty except some, and all columns are empty except some, but their colors must match.\n\nWait, actually, the conclusion is that either:\n\n- All non-empty rows are white, and all non-empty columns are white.\n\n- All non-empty rows are black, and all non-empty columns are black.\n\n- Or, all rows and columns are empty (but this is trivial and probably not maximal).\n\nWait, but the maximal condition requires that you can't add any more chips. So if all rows and columns are empty, you can add a chip anywhere, so that's not maximal. Therefore, the only maximal arrangements are those where either:\n\n- There exists at least one non-empty row and column, and all non-empty rows and columns are of the same color (either all white or all black), and the intersection of non-empty rows and columns form a rectangle of that color, and this rectangle is maximal in the sense that you can't add any more rows or columns of that color without violating the maximality.\n\nWait, perhaps more precisely, the arrangement consists of choosing a subset of rows (possibly none) and a subset of columns (possibly none), all of the same color, such that the intersection of these rows and columns is filled with that color, and there are no other chips outside this rectangle. Additionally, the rectangle must be as large as possible in the sense that you can't add another row or column to it without being able to extend the rectangle further, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, actually, given the constraints, if you choose some rows and columns of the same color, then the filled cells must be exactly the intersection of those rows and columns. Because any cell not in those rows or columns would be in an empty row or column, hence cannot have a chip. \n\nMoreover, to make it maximal, you can't add any more rows or columns of that color. Wait, but how does that work?\n\nSuppose you have a rectangle formed by selecting some rows and columns of white. To make it maximal, you can't add any more rows or columns to the white set, because that would allow adding more white chips. Wait, but if you add a new row, then the existing columns would allow you to fill the new row in those columns, right? \n\nTherefore, for maximality, the selected rows and columns must form a rectangle such that there are no other rows or columns that can be added without allowing an extension. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximal condition requires that every row not in the selected rows must have at least one column in the selected columns that is already filled (so they can't be added), and similarly every column not in the selected columns must have at least one row in the selected rows that is filled. \n\nAlternatively, the complement of the selected rows must intersect the complement of the selected columns in such a way that you can't extend. \n\nThis is getting too abstract. Let me think of it in terms of choosing a rectangle. \n\nSuppose we choose a rectangle of size a x b, filled with white chips. To be maximal, there can't be any row outside of the a rows that could be added to the rectangle (i.e., all such rows must have at least one column in the b columns already filled with white, so you can't add those rows without adding more white chips in those columns, which would require the columns to be extended, but the columns are already part of the rectangle). Wait, actually, if you have a rectangle of a rows and b columns, then any row not in those a rows could potentially be added as a new row to the rectangle, but only if all the columns in the existing rectangle allow it (i.e., those columns are still white). But since those columns are already part of the rectangle, they are white, so you could indeed add another row. \n\nTherefore, to make it maximal, you can't add any more rows or columns. Therefore, the rectangle must cover all rows or all columns? \n\nWait, that can't be. For example, if you have a 5x5 grid, choosing all rows and columns would fill the entire grid, which is maximal. But smaller rectangles can also be maximal if they can't be extended. \n\nWait, suppose we have a 3x3 white rectangle in the top-left corner. Then, to be maximal, you can't add any more rows or columns to this rectangle. However, you could add a fourth row (say row 4) and set it to white, provided that the existing columns (1-3) are white. But adding row 4 would allow filling columns 1-3 in row 4, which is allowed. Therefore, the 3x3 rectangle isn't maximal because you can extend it. \n\nTherefore, to be maximal, the rectangle must be such that you can't add any more rows or columns to it. That would mean that either all rows are included, or all columns are included. Wait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the maximal rectangle must be such that either all rows are included or all columns are included. Wait, not necessarily. \n\nAlternatively, the maximal rectangle must be as large as possible, such that you can't add a row without also needing to add a column, which might not be possible. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's try to formalize it. \n\nSuppose the white rectangle is formed by selecting R rows and C columns. To be maximal, you can't add any row not in R or column not in C without being able to extend the rectangle. \n\nTherefore, to prevent adding a row r not in R, there must be at least one column in C that already has a white chip in some other row, but actually, if you add row r to R, you can fill all columns in C with white in row r, which would be allowed unless those columns already have another color. But since we are considering only white, the columns must already be white. Therefore, actually, you can always add another row if the columns are white. \n\nTherefore, the only way to prevent adding more rows is if there are no rows left to add, i.e., R is all rows. Similarly, to prevent adding more columns, C must be all columns. \n\nWait, so the only maximal white rectangle is the entire grid. But that's not true, because you could have a smaller rectangle but arranged such that the remaining rows or columns cannot be added because they conflict with other colors? \n\nAh! Here's the thing: the arrangement can include both white and black regions, as long as their rectangles don't overlap. \n\nWait, perhaps the entire grid can be partitioned into white and black rectangles that don't overlap, and the arrangement is maximal. \n\nWait, but how would that work? Let me think. \n\nSuppose there is a white rectangle and a black rectangle, but they don't overlap. Then, the white rectangle can be extended into the black area if possible, but since those areas are black, you can't. \n\nAlternatively, if the white and black regions are separated by rows and columns. For instance, suppose the first two rows are white, the next two are black, and the fifth is empty. But then columns would have to be consistent. \n\nAlternatively, suppose we divide the grid into regions using rows and columns. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximal arrangements are those where the grid is divided into four regions by a horizontal and vertical line, with one quadrant white, another black, but this might not satisfy the row and column constraints. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think in terms of choosing a set of rows and columns for white and another set for black, such that their intersections don't conflict. \n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me consider that the grid must be partitioned into white and black regions where each region is a rectangle, and the regions don't overlap. Moreover, each row and column is entirely one color or empty. \n\nWait, but actually, the problem allows for rows and columns to be empty. The key is that in any row that has chips, all chips are the same color, and similarly for columns. So the filled cells must form a set of rows and columns of a single color, but overlapping regions must agree in color. \n\nAlternatively, the entire arrangement can be characterized by choosing a set of rows and columns for white, and a set of rows and columns for black, such that the white regions and black regions don't overlap, and every cell is either in a white region, black region, or empty. But this might not capture all constraints. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be equivalent to choosing for each cell a color or empty, such that rows and columns are monochromatic (if non-empty), and the arrangement is maximal. \n\nPerhaps the key is that the maximal arrangement corresponds to a partition of the grid into white and black rectangles, where each rectangle is as large as possible. But I need to formalize this. \n\nAlternatively, here's another thought: The maximal condition implies that for every pair of a row and column not both in the filled regions, you cannot add a chip there because either the row is already filled with a different color, or the column is. \n\nTherefore, the entire grid is divided into white and black regions such that the white region is a rectangle (rows W_rows and columns W_cols), and the black region is a rectangle (rows B_rows and columns B_cols), and these regions do not overlap (i.e., W_rows and B_rows are disjoint or their columns don't intersect). Wait, but overlapping would require same color. \n\nAlternatively, the white and black regions must be separated by rows and columns. \n\nThis is getting too vague. Let me look for a different angle. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the possible color assignments. Each row can be in one of three states: white, black, or empty. Similarly, each column can be in one of three states. However, the assignments must be consistent: if a row is white and a column is black, their intersection must be empty. \n\nMoreover, the arrangement is maximal, so you cannot add any more chips. That means that for every empty cell (i,j), either row i is non-empty (so you can't place a different color there) or column j is non-empty (same). \n\nTherefore, the set of empty cells must be exactly the cells where either the row is non-empty or the column is non-empty with a different color. Wait, actually, for any empty cell (i,j), it must be that:\n\nIf you try to place white there, either row i is non-white (so it's black or empty) or column j is non-white (so it's black or empty). But to block both possibilities, the cell must be in a row that's black or a column that's black (if trying to place white), and similarly for black. \n\nTherefore, the empty cells are precisely those cells that are in a row of a different color or a column of a different color. \n\nAlternatively, the non-empty cells must form a set where all the rows and columns they are in are monochromatic, and the rest of the grid is blocked by conflicting colors. \n\nWait, perhaps the non-empty cells form a rectangle of one color, say white, and all rows outside this rectangle are black or all columns outside are black, preventing extension. \n\nAlternatively, the non-empty cells form a white rectangle, and all the rows not in this rectangle are black, and all columns not in this rectangle are black? Then you can't add anything else. \n\nWait, let's suppose the white rectangle is a \u00d7 b. Then, to prevent adding more white chips, the remaining rows must be black or the remaining columns must be black. \n\nBut if the remaining rows are black, then those rows can't have white, but they can have black. However, adding a black chip in a remaining row but in a column outside the white rectangle would be allowed unless that column is already white. \n\nHmm, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to think of possible cases.\n\nCase 1: All cells are filled with a single color. Then this is maximal, because you can't add anything. There are 2 such arrangements (all white or all black).\n\nCase 2: The grid is partially filled with a single color, say white, such that you can't add any more white chips, and there are no black chips. To be maximal, any empty cell must be in a row or column that already has white (so you can't add white there). But if a row has some white and some empty, then the empty cells in that row are in columns that must already have non-white (but there are no black chips). Contradiction. Therefore, all rows with any white must be entirely white, and all columns with any white must be entirely white. So the white region must be a rectangle. To be maximal, you can't add any more rows or columns to this rectangle. That would require that every row not in the rectangle has at least one column in the rectangle which is already white, so you can't extend the row. Wait, but those columns are already white, so you could extend the row into those columns. \n\nWait, actually, if the white rectangle is a \u00d7 b, then any row not in the a rows could be extended into the b columns, but since those columns are already white, the row would have to be white. So to prevent that, those rows must be non-white, i.e., they must be black or empty. But if they are black, then their intersection with the white columns would be conflicting. \n\nTherefore, to have a white rectangle a \u00d7 b and prevent adding more rows, the rows outside must be black, but then their columns can't be white. Contradiction. \n\nHmm, maybe the only way is that the white rectangle is the entire grid, which is case 1. Similarly for black. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximal arrangements with a single color must be the full grid. Because otherwise, you can always add another row or column. \n\nWait, let's test with a smaller grid. Suppose a 1x1 grid. Then, placing a white or black chip is maximal (since you can't add more). Also, leaving it empty is not maximal because you can add a chip. So for 1x1, there are 2 maximal arrangements. \n\nFor a 2x2 grid:\n\nCase 1: All white or all black: 2 arrangements.\n\nCase 2: A 1x1 white square. To be maximal, the remaining cells must be blocked. The remaining cells are in rows and columns that are either non-white or non-white? Wait, if I have a single white cell at (1,1), then rows 1 and columns 1 are white. The other cells:\n\n- (1,2): in row 1 (white), so can't place non-white. But can place white? But the column 2 is empty, so column 2 could be white. But since the arrangement is maximal, we can't add anything. Therefore, to block adding white to (1,2), column 2 must be non-white (black or empty). But if column 2 is non-white, then it's black or empty. If it's black, then you can't place white there, but you could place black in (1,2) if row 1 is white? No, because row 1 is white, so you can't place black there. \n\nWait, if column 2 is black, then (1,2) is in a white row and black column, so it must be empty. Similarly, (2,1) is in a white column and whatever row 2 is. To block adding to (2,1), row 2 must be non-white (black or empty). If row 2 is black, then (2,1) is in black row and white column, so must be empty. (2,2) is in row 2 (black) and column 2 (black), so can be black. But then, can we add black to (2,2)? If we do, then the arrangement would have white at (1,1), black at (2,2), but then row 1 has white and column 2 has black, conflicting at (1,2). Wait, no, (1,2) is in a white row and black column, so it can't have a chip. But (2,2) is in black row and column, so can be black. \n\nWait, actually, if I have (1,1) as white, then row 1 is white, column 1 is white. Then, if I set row 2 to black, then column 2 can be black. Then (2,2) can be black. But then, the arrangement would have white at (1,1) and black at (2,2). However, the row 2 is black, so the entire row 2 must be black. But column 2 is black, so the entire column 2 must be black. Therefore, (1,2) must be black, but row 1 is white. Contradiction. \n\nTherefore, such an arrangement is impossible. So to have a single white cell at (1,1), the other cells must be such that rows and columns outside can't be filled. \n\nAlternatively, if I have (1,1) as white, then row 1 is white, column 1 is white. To prevent adding to (1,2), column 2 must be non-white (black or empty). If column 2 is black, then row 1 can't have black, so (1,2) must be empty. To prevent adding to column 2, the rows not in row 1 must have their columns set such that they can't add black. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe in the 2x2 case, the only maximal arrangements are the fully filled ones and those where all rows and columns are either entirely white or entirely black, forming a rectangle. Wait, actually, perhaps in the 2x2 grid, another maximal arrangement is a 1x2 white row and a 2x1 black column, but their intersection can't have both. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the only maximal arrangements with a single color are the full grid, and the other maximal arrangements involve both colors in such a way that they block each other. \n\nWait, suppose in the 2x2 grid, we have the top row white and the right column black. Then their intersection at (1,2) must be empty. The other cells: (2,1) can be black (since column 1 is empty and row 2 is empty?), but actually, row 2 hasn't been assigned a color yet. \n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern or mathematical formula. \n\nWait, going back to the original problem. Since each row and column must be monochromatic if non-empty, the entire arrangement is determined by selecting a subset of rows and columns for white, and another subset for black, such that the white and black regions do not overlap, and the arrangement is maximal. \n\nMoreover, the maximality implies that every empty cell is adjacent (in row or column) to a conflicting color. \n\nAlternatively, the entire grid is partitioned into white, black, and empty regions, where each non-empty region is a rectangle of a single color, and these rectangles are placed such that they can't be expanded without overlapping. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem reduces to choosing a white rectangle and a black rectangle that don't overlap, and together they cover the entire grid? No, because they could leave some cells empty. But maximality requires that those empty cells can't be filled with either color. \n\nAlternatively, the white and black regions must form a partition of the grid such that any empty cell is on a row or column of both colors, preventing it from being filled. \n\nThis seems similar to a bipartition of the grid into white, black, and a forbidden region where rows and columns have conflicting colors. \n\nAlternatively, think of the grid as a bipartition between white and black regions, where the white region is a rectangle and the black region is another rectangle, and their union is the entire grid, but they can't overlap. But that would require that their rectangles are complementary. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be equivalent to choosing a subset of rows and columns for white and another for black such that:\n\n- The white rows and columns form a rectangle (i.e., if a row is white, all its columns in the white set are white).\n\nWait, perhaps the key idea is that the white region is determined by a set of rows and a set of columns, and the intersection of these is filled with white. Similarly for black. However, white and black regions can't overlap. \n\nTo maximize, the white and black regions must be such that there is no space left to add another region without overlapping. \n\nAlternatively, the entire grid must be covered by white and black rectangles, with no overlaps, and every cell is in exactly one of the rectangles or is empty but cannot be filled due to conflicting row/column colors. \n\nThis is still too vague. Let me try to think in terms of the possible color assignments for rows and columns.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet R_w be the set of rows colored white.\n\nLet R_b be the set of rows colored black.\n\nSimilarly, C_w and C_b for columns.\n\nRows not in R_w or R_b are empty.\n\nColumns not in C_w or C_b are empty.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\n- For any row in R_w, all its columns must be in C_w or empty? No, actually, the row is white, so all its non-empty cells must be white. However, the columns can be white or empty. Wait, no. If a row is white, then any column intersecting it must either be white (so their intersection is white) or empty (so the cell is empty). Similarly, a column in C_w must have all its non-empty rows in R_w.\n\nTherefore, the white cells are exactly the intersection of R_w and C_w.\n\nSimilarly, the black cells are exactly the intersection of R_b and C_b.\n\nMoreover, R_w and R_b must be disjoint (a row can't be both white and black), similarly for C_w and C_b.\n\nAdditionally, the white and black regions cannot overlap, so R_w \u2229 R_b = empty, and C_w \u2229 C_b = empty? No, actually, the regions can't overlap in the grid, so the intersections (R_w \u00d7 C_w) and (R_b \u00d7 C_b) must be disjoint. Therefore, either R_w and R_b are disjoint, or C_w and C_b are disjoint? Not exactly. The regions can overlap only if their colors are the same, but since white and black are different, their regions must not overlap. Therefore:\n\nFor any cell (i,j), it can be white only if i \u2208 R_w and j \u2208 C_w, and black only if i \u2208 R_b and j \u2208 C_b. Therefore, to prevent overlap, we must have that:\n\nIf a cell is in both R_w \u00d7 C_w and R_b \u00d7 C_b, that would mean it's both white and black, which is impossible. Hence, the sets R_w \u00d7 C_w and R_b \u00d7 C_b must be disjoint. \n\nThis can be achieved if either:\n\n- The row sets R_w and R_b are disjoint, or\n\n- The column sets C_w and C_b are disjoint,\n\nBut actually, more precisely, for any row in R_w, it cannot be in R_b, and vice versa. Similarly for columns. So R_w and R_b are disjoint, and C_w and C_b are disjoint. \n\nAdditionally, the regions must not overlap, which is already satisfied if the row and column sets are disjoint.\n\nWait, actually, the regions can only overlap if a row is in both R_w and R_b (which they can't be), or a column is in both C_w and C_b (which they can't be). So as long as R_w and R_b are disjoint, and C_w and C_b are disjoint, the regions won't overlap. \n\nNow, the maximality condition requires that there is no way to add another white or black cell. \n\nTo add a white cell at (i,j), we need that i is not in R_b (since R_b rows are black) and j is not in C_b (since C_b columns are black). Also, i can be in R_w or not, and j can be in C_w or not. But to add white at (i,j), we need to add i to R_w and j to C_w, but this must not conflict with existing assignments. \n\nHowever, the maximality condition says that such an addition is not possible. Therefore, for every cell not in R_w \u00d7 C_w \u222a R_b \u00d7 C_b (i.e., the empty cells), either:\n\n- The row i is in R_b (so can't be white) or the column j is in C_b (same),\n\nAND\n\n- The row i is in R_w (can't be black) or the column j is in C_w (same).\n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe the maximality condition translates to:\n\nFor every empty cell (i,j):\n\n- Either row i is in R_b (so can't be white) or column j is in C_b (so can't be white),\n\nAND\n\n- Either row i is in R_w (so can't be black) or column j is in C_w (so can't be black).\n\nTherefore, for an empty cell, it cannot be turned white or black without violating the existing row or column assignments. \n\nTherefore, for each empty cell (i,j):\n\nEither:\n\n1. row i is in R_b or column j is in C_b (prevents white),\n\nAND\n\n2. row i is in R_w or column j is in C_w (prevents black).\n\nTherefore, combining these, for an empty cell (i,j):\n\nEither (row i is in R_b or column j in C_b) AND (row i in R_w or column j in C_w).\n\nThis can be rephrased as:\n\nEither:\n\n- (row i in R_b AND row i in R_w) which is impossible since R_w and R_b are disjoint,\n\n- (row i in R_b AND column j in C_w),\n\n- (column j in C_b AND row i in R_w),\n\n- (column j in C_b AND column j in C_w) which is impossible,\n\nSo the valid cases are:\n\nEither:\n\n- row i is in R_b and column j is in C_w, \n\nOR \n\n- column j is in C_b and row i is in R_w.\n\nTherefore, the empty cells must lie in the intersection of R_b \u00d7 C_w or R_w \u00d7 C_b.\n\nTherefore, the entire grid is partitioned into:\n\n- White region: R_w \u00d7 C_w,\n\n- Black region: R_b \u00d7 C_b,\n\n- Empty regions: (R_b \u00d7 C_w) \u222a (R_w \u00d7 C_b),\n\n- The remaining cells would be those not in R_w \u222a R_b or C_w \u222a C_b, but since rows and columns not in R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b are empty rows or columns, so their intersections are also empty.\n\nTherefore, the entire grid is covered by these four regions:\n\n1. White: R_w \u00d7 C_w,\n\n2. Black: R_b \u00d7 C_b,\n\n3. Empty: R_b \u00d7 C_w,\n\n4. Empty: R_w \u00d7 C_b,\n\nAdditionally, the rows not in R_w or R_b are entirely empty, and columns not in C_w or C_b are entirely empty.\n\nNow, the maximality condition is satisfied because any empty cell is either in R_b \u00d7 C_w (so can't be white because column is C_w? Wait, no, R_b is black rows, so row is black, so can't be white. Column C_w is white columns, so can't be black because column is white. So the cell can't be colored either way. Similarly for R_w \u00d7 C_b.\n\nTherefore, such a partition satisfies the maximality condition. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing:\n\n- Two disjoint sets of rows: R_w and R_b (since a row can't be both white and black),\n\n- Two disjoint sets of columns: C_w and C_b,\n\n- Additionally, the remaining rows (not in R_w or R_b) are empty,\n\n- The remaining columns (not in C_w or C_b) are empty.\n\nMoreover, since we can have empty rows and columns, the only constraints are that R_w and R_b are disjoint, and C_w and C_b are disjoint. \n\nHowever, we also have the chips available: 25 white and 25 black. The number of white chips used is |R_w| \u00d7 |C_w|, and black chips used is |R_b| \u00d7 |C_b|. These must satisfy:\n\n|R_w| \u00d7 |C_w| \u2264 25,\n\n|R_b| \u00d7 |C_b| \u2264 25,\n\nand the total chips used (white + black) must be \u2264 50 (but since each cell is at most one, the total is |R_w|\u00d7|C_w| + |R_b|\u00d7|C_b| \u2264 25 cells, since it's a 5x5 grid. Wait, actually, the grid has 25 cells. Wait, the problem says \"some of these chips\", so total chips placed can be up to 25, but with the constraints. \n\nWait, the problem states \"each cell contains at most one chip\", so the total number of chips is between 0 and 25. But since the arrangement must be maximal, it can't have fewer than some number. \n\nBut in our current model, the number of white chips is |R_w|\u00d7|C_w| and black is |R_b|\u00d7|C_b|, so total chips is |R_w||C_w| + |R_b||C_b|. This must be \u226425. \n\nHowever, since we have 25 white and 25 black chips available, but we can choose to use any number up to those, as long as the total chips don't exceed 25. But actually, the problem allows using any number of chips, as long as the conditions are met. \n\nWait, but the chips are indistinct except for color, so the count is based on the number of white and black chips used, but since they are indistinct, the only thing that matters is the counts. However, the problem says \"some of these chips\", so we can use any number from 0 to 25, but with the constraints. \n\nBut in our current model, the count is fixed by the sizes of R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b. \n\nTherefore, to count the number of such maximal arrangements, we need to consider all possible choices of R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b such that:\n\n1. R_w and R_b are disjoint subsets of the 5 rows,\n\n2. C_w and C_b are disjoint subsets of the 5 columns,\n\n3. The white region R_w \u00d7 C_w and black region R_b \u00d7 C_b do not overlap (which they don't by construction),\n\n4. The total number of white chips |R_w||C_w| \u226425 and black chips |R_b||C_c| \u226425. But since the grid is 5x5, the maximum possible is 25, so this is automatically satisfied as long as the regions are within the grid.\n\nHowever, the problem requires that the arrangement is maximal. Wait, but in our current model, any such partition is maximal because any empty cell can't be filled. So all such partitions are maximal? \n\nWait, actually yes. Because in such a partition, every empty cell is in R_b \u00d7 C_w or R_w \u00d7 C_b, so can't be filled with either color. Therefore, these are indeed maximal. \n\nAdditionally, the only other maximal arrangements would be those where either all rows and columns are white or black (the full grid), but those are included in the above model by setting R_w = all rows, C_w = all columns, R_b and C_b empty; or vice versa for black. \n\nTherefore, the total number of maximal arrangements is equal to the number of ways to choose R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b with the above conditions. \n\nHowever, we have to consider that the white and black regions can be empty. For example, if R_w and C_w are empty, then the white region is empty, and the black region is R_b \u00d7 C_b. Similarly, if both are empty, the entire grid is empty, but that's not maximal because you can add a chip. Wait, so the case where both R_w,C_w and R_b,C_b are empty (i.e., all rows and columns are empty) is not allowed, since it's not maximal. \n\nTherefore, we must exclude the case where both white and black regions are empty. \n\nSo, the total number is equal to the number of possible choices of R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b where:\n\n- R_w and R_b are disjoint subsets of rows,\n\n- C_w and C_b are disjoint subsets of columns,\n\n- At least one of the regions (white or black) is non-empty (to ensure maximality),\n\nplus the cases where one region is the entire grid (but those are already included).\n\nWait, actually, the above conditions already include all possible non-empty cases except the entirely empty grid, which we have to subtract. \n\nTherefore, the total number is:\n\n(Total number of choices for R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b with R_w \u2229 R_b = \u2205, C_w \u2229 C_b = \u2205) minus 1 (the all-empty case).\n\nBut how do we count the total number?\n\nFirst, note that for the rows:\n\nEach row can be in R_w, R_b, or neither. However, R_w and R_b must be disjoint. So for each row, there are three choices: white, black, or empty. Similarly for columns: each column can be in C_w, C_b, or neither. \n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b without any restrictions except R_w \u2229 R_b = \u2205 and C_w \u2229 C_b = \u2205 is:\n\n(3^5) * (3^5) = 3^10.\n\nBut from this, we must subtract the case where both white and black regions are empty. The regions are empty if R_w = R_b = \u2205 and C_w = C_b = \u2205. Wait, actually, the regions are empty if either:\n\n- For white: R_w and C_w are both empty,\n\n- For black: R_b and C_b are both empty.\n\nBut the entire arrangement is empty only when both white and black regions are empty, i.e., R_w = C_w = \u2205 and R_b = C_b = \u2205. \n\nTherefore, the number of arrangements where the grid is entirely empty is 1 (all rows and columns are empty). \n\nTherefore, the total number of maximal arrangements is 3^10 - 1. But wait, this can't be right because some of these choices might not satisfy the maximality condition. \n\nWait, actually, in our earlier analysis, any such choice where the regions are non-empty (i.e., not all empty) corresponds to a maximal arrangement. But actually, there's a mistake here: even if you choose R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b such that, for example, R_w is non-empty but C_w is empty, then the white region is R_w \u00d7 C_w which is empty. Similarly for other cases. \n\nTherefore, the regions can be empty individually, but the arrangement is considered maximal as long as the non-empty regions are set such that you can't add anything. \n\nWait, but suppose we choose R_w = {row1}, C_w = {}, then the white region is empty. Similarly, if C_w is empty, then even if R_w is non-empty, the white region is empty. \n\nTherefore, the maximality condition is satisfied as long as for every empty cell, the constraints are met. Even if one of the regions is empty. \n\nTherefore, all the 3^10 - 1 possibilities (excluding the all-empty grid) are valid maximal arrangements. But this can't be correct because some of these would allow adding chips. \n\nWait, let's test with an example. \n\nSuppose we choose R_w = {row1}, C_w = {col1}, and R_b = {row2}, C_b = {col2}. \n\nThen the white region is row1, col1: cell (1,1).\n\nThe black region is row2, col2: cell (2,2).\n\nThe remaining empty cells are in:\n\n- R_b \u00d7 C_w = {row2} \u00d7 {col1}: cell (2,1),\n\n- R_w \u00d7 C_b = {row1} \u00d7 {col2}: cell (1,2),\n\n- and other cells not in any of the row or column sets. For example, cell (3,3) is in neither R_w nor R_b, and neither C_w nor C_b, so it's in an empty row and column, so can it be filled?\n\nWait, the row 3 is not in R_w or R_b, so it's an empty row. Similarly column3 is not in C_w or C_b, so it's an empty column. Therefore, cell (3,3) is in an empty row and column. \n\nAccording to our earlier analysis, such a cell can be filled with either color? Because the row and column are empty. \n\nBut in our current model, the arrangement would allow this, but according to the maximality condition, it should not. \n\nAh! Here's the problem. In our current counting, we considered that any cell not in white or black regions is in R_b \u00d7 C_w or R_w \u00d7 C_b or in the remaining empty rows/columns. \n\nThe remaining cells not in any of the four regions (white, black, R_b\u00d7C_w, R_w\u00d7C_b) are those where the row is neither in R_w nor R_b and the column is neither in C_w nor C_b. For such cells, their rows and columns are entirely empty. Therefore, those cells can be filled with either color, violating the maximality. \n\nTherefore, our earlier analysis was incorrect. The regions R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b must be chosen such that there are no such remaining cells. In other words, every row must be in either R_w or R_b or neither, but if a row is in neither, then all its columns must be in neither C_w nor C_b, but that leads to the possibility of adding chips. \n\nTherefore, to satisfy maximality, the entire grid must be covered by the four regions (white, black, R_b\u00d7C_w, R_w\u00d7C_b). That is, there are no rows or columns that are neither in R_w nor R_b, and similarly for columns. \n\nTherefore, every row must be in either R_w or R_b, and every column must be in either C_w or C_b. \n\nAh! This is the missing condition. \n\nTherefore, to ensure maximality, there can be no rows or columns that are entirely empty. Because if there is a row not in R_w or R_b, then it's an empty row, and its columns not in C_w or C_b would allow placing a chip there. \n\nTherefore, the correct conditions are:\n\n- Every row is in either R_w or R_b,\n\n- Every column is in either C_w or C_b,\n\n- R_w and R_b are disjoint,\n\n- C_w and C_b are disjoint.\n\nThus, each row is assigned to either white or black,\n\nEach column is assigned to either white or black,\n\nWith the white region being R_w \u00d7 C_w and black region R_b \u00d7 C_b,\n\nAnd the other regions being R_b \u00d7 C_w (empty) and R_w \u00d7 C_b (empty).\n\nThis way, there are no rows or columns left unassigned, so every cell is in one of the four regions, hence every empty cell is in R_b \u00d7 C_w or R_w \u00d7 C_b, so cannot be filled. \n\nTherefore, the total number of such arrangements is:\n\nFor each row, decide whether it's in R_w or R_b (2 choices per row),\n\nFor each column, decide whether it's in C_w or C_b (2 choices per column),\n\nBut we have to exclude the case where all rows are in R_w and all columns in C_b (or similar), but actually, no, all possibilities are allowed except the case where both white and black regions are empty? Wait no. \n\nWait, actually, each row must be assigned to either R_w or R_b (so 2^5 choices),\n\nEach column must be assigned to either C_w or C_b (so 2^5 choices),\n\nBut we have to exclude the case where either:\n\n- All rows are in R_w and all columns in C_b: then white region is R_w\u00d7C_w = all rows \u00d7 empty = empty, and black region is R_b\u00d7C_b = empty \u00d7 all columns = empty. So the entire grid is empty, which is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, if all rows are in R_b and all columns in C_w, same problem.\n\nWait, actually, the only invalid case is when either:\n\n- All rows are in R_w and all columns in C_b (white region empty, black region empty),\n\n- Or all rows in R_b and all columns in C_w (same),\n\n- Or both white and black regions are empty in another way?\n\nWait, more precisely, the only case where both white and black regions are empty is when:\n\nEither:\n\n- R_w and C_w are both empty, and R_b and C_b are both empty (but this requires all rows assigned to neither, which is not allowed as per the new conditions),\n\nWait no, under the new conditions, every row is assigned to R_w or R_b, and every column to C_w or C_b. So the only way both white and black regions are empty is if:\n\n- R_w is non-empty but C_w is empty, and R_b is non-empty but C_b is empty,\n\nBut in that case, the white region is R_w \u00d7 empty = empty, and black region is R_b \u00d7 empty = empty,\n\nBut columns must be assigned to C_w or C_b, so if C_w and C_b are both empty, that would violate the column assignment. Wait, no, columns must be assigned to either C_w or C_b, so C_w and C_b cannot both be empty. \n\nWait, actually, if all columns are assigned to C_w, then C_b is empty,\n\nIf all columns are assigned to C_b, then C_w is empty,\n\nBut if some columns are in C_w and others in C_b, then both are non-empty.\n\nTherefore, the only way for both white and black regions to be empty is:\n\nEither:\n\n- R_w is non-empty but C_w is empty (so all columns are in C_b),\n\nand R_b is non-empty but C_b is empty (so all columns are in C_w),\n\nwhich is impossible because columns can't be both in C_w and C_b.\n\nAlternatively, the case where:\n\nAll rows are in R_w, and all columns are in C_b,\n\nthen white region is R_w \u00d7 C_w = all rows \u00d7 empty = empty,\n\nblack region is R_b \u00d7 C_b = empty \u00d7 all columns = empty,\n\nso the entire grid is empty. \n\nSimilarly, if all rows are in R_b and all columns in C_w, same result. \n\nTherefore, the only invalid case is when:\n\nEither (all rows in R_w AND all columns in C_b) OR (all rows in R_b AND all columns in C_w). \n\nTherefore, the total number of valid arrangements is:\n\nTotal assignments (2^5 \u00d7 2^5) minus the 2 invalid cases where the grid is entirely empty. \n\nWait, actually, how many such invalid cases are there?\n\nCase 1: All rows in R_w, all columns in C_b.\n\nThis is 1 case (since all rows assigned to R_w, all columns to C_b).\n\nCase 2: All rows in R_b, all columns in C_w.\n\nAlso 1 case.\n\nTherefore total invalid cases are 2.\n\nTherefore, the total number of maximal arrangements is (2^5)(2^5) - 2 = 1024 - 2 = 1022.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me verify this.\n\nEach row has 2 choices: R_w or R_b: 2^5.\n\nEach column has 2 choices: C_w or C_b: 2^5.\n\nTotal combinations: 2^5 \u00d7 2^5 = 1024.\n\nFrom this, subtract the two cases where the entire grid is empty:\n\n- All rows in R_w and all columns in C_b (so white region is R_w\u00d7C_w = all rows \u00d7 columns not in C_b? Wait no, C_w is empty in this case because all columns are in C_b. So white region is R_w \u00d7 C_w = all rows \u00d7 empty set = empty. Similarly, black region is R_b (empty) \u00d7 C_b (all columns) = empty. So the grid is empty.\n\nSimilarly for the other case.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly 2 such cases where the grid is entirely empty, which are invalid because the arrangement isn't maximal (you can add a chip). Therefore, subtract 2.\n\nHence total arrangements: 1024 - 2 = 1022.\n\nHowever, this counts all possible color assignments of rows and columns (each row to W or B, each column to W or B), except the two cases where the grid is empty.\n\nBut wait, does this account for the colorings where, for example, some rows are assigned to W but their columns are assigned to B, leading to empty regions?\n\nYes, because those are allowed as long as they are maximal. For instance, if some rows are W and some columns are B, their intersection is empty but can't be filled.\n\nBut in this count, we are considering all possible assignments except the two entirely empty cases. Each such assignment corresponds to a maximal arrangement because any empty cell is blocked by row or column color.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1022?\n\nWait, but the problem mentions indistinct chips. However, in our counting, we considered the assignments of rows and columns to colors, which would correspond to different arrangements even if the actual chips are indistinct. Since the chips of the same color are indistinct, the count is correct because the regions are determined by the row and column choices, and the chips are placed accordingly.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"the number of ways to place some of these chips\". Since the chips are indistinct except for color, the different arrangements are determined by which cells are white, black, or empty, under the given constraints. The way we counted (assigning rows and columns to colors) directly corresponds to the placement of chips, so each assignment corresponds to exactly one arrangement. Hence the total is 1022.\n\nBut the problem has a 5x5 grid. Wait, 2^5\u00d72^5 is 1024, minus 2 gives 1022. But this seems too large. Let me think of a small case again.\n\nTake the 1x1 grid. Then rows and columns are 1 each.\n\nTotal assignments: 2\u00d72 =4.\n\nSubtract 2 cases where grid is empty: 4-2=2. Which matches the correct answer (all white or all black). \n\nFor 2x2 grid:\n\nTotal would be 2^2\u00d72^2 -2 = 16-2=14.\n\nLet me see if that makes sense.\n\nPossible maximal arrangements:\n\n1. All white (1),\n\n2. All black (1),\n\n3. White in a 1x1 cell and black in another, but arranged so they don't conflict? Wait, but in our model, each arrangement is determined by row and column assignments.\n\nFor example:\n\nAssign first row to W, second to B,\n\nFirst column to W, second to B.\n\nThen white region is (1,1), black region (2,2). The other cells (1,2) is R_w \u00d7 C_b (empty), (2,1) is R_b \u00d7 C_w (empty). This is a valid maximal arrangement.\n\nSimilarly, many others. \n\nTotal 14 seems plausible for 2x2. \n\nTherefore, the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, for the 5x5 grid, the answer should be 2^5\u00d72^5 -2 = 1024-2=1022.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions \"some of these chips\", so the empty grid is excluded (since it uses zero chips), but in our count we subtracted the two cases where the grid is entirely empty. Wait, actually in our count, the two subtracted cases are precisely the two assignments that lead to an empty grid (all rows W and columns B, or vice versa). \n\nTherefore, the total number of maximal arrangements is 1022. But let me confirm once more.\n\nWait, in the 1x1 case, the two subtracted cases are:\n\n- Row assigned to W, column assigned to B: cell is empty.\n\n- Row assigned to B, column assigned to W: cell is empty.\n\nThese are the two cases leading to empty grid, so subtracting them gives 2, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly for 2x2, yes. \n\nTherefore, for 5x5, the answer is 1022. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions\". The two conditions being that all chips in the same row/column are same color. So, the maximal condition is indeed captured by our model. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 1022. \n\nWait, but the problem specifies 25 white chips and 25 black chips available. Does this affect the count? \n\nHmm, in our current model, we didn't consider the number of chips used. For example, an arrangement might require 30 white chips, but we only have 25. Wait, but in the 5x5 grid, the maximum number of white chips is 5\u00d75=25, similarly for black. Therefore, any arrangement using up to 25 white and/or black chips is allowed as long as they don't exceed the available chips. \n\nHowever, in our counting above, we considered all possible assignments, even those that require more than 25 chips of a color. \n\nWait a minute! This is a critical oversight. \n\nFor example, if we assign all 5 rows to R_w and all 5 columns to C_w, then the white region is 5\u00d75=25 chips, which is exactly the number available. That's okay. \n\nBut if we assign all rows to R_w and all columns to C_w and some to C_b, but that might complicate. \n\nWait, actually, in our model, the number of white chips is |R_w| \u00d7 |C_w| and black chips is |R_b| \u00d7 |C_b|. Since the total white chips cannot exceed 25 and black similarly. \n\nHowever, in a 5x5 grid, the maximum white chips is 25 (if R_w and C_w are all 5), which is exactly the number available. Similarly for black. \n\nBut if an arrangement requires, say, 30 white chips, which is impossible, but in a 5x5 grid, the maximum is 25, so it's okay. \n\nWait, actually, in our model, since the grid is 5x5, the maximum white chips is 5\u00d75=25, so any assignment is allowed as long as the counts are within the grid. Since we have exactly 25 white and 25 black chips, any arrangement that uses W chips \u226425 and B chips \u226425 is okay, but since the grid has only 25 cells, W + B \u226425. \n\nHowever, the problem states \"some of these chips\", so we can use any number from 0 to 25, provided the constraints. \n\nBut in our previous counting, we counted all assignments except the two empty grid cases, but some of those assignments may require more than 25 white or black chips? \n\nWait, no, because in a 5x5 grid, the maximum white chips possible is 25 (when R_w and C_w are all 5). Similarly for black. Since the problem allows using up to 25 of each, those are okay. \n\nTherefore, actually, all the assignments except the two empty grid cases are valid, because even if an arrangement uses 25 white and 0 black, or 0 white and 25 black, or any combination where W + B \u226425. \n\nTherefore, the total number is indeed 2^5\u00d72^5 -2 = 1022. \n\nBut the problem says \"Find the number of ways to place some of these chips...\". The chips are indistinct except for color, so each maximal arrangement is uniquely determined by which cells are white, black, or empty, under the constraints. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1022. \n\nHowever, I have a doubt because the problem specifies 25 white and 25 black chips. Does this affect the count? \n\nWait, suppose an arrangement requires, say, 10 white chips and 15 black chips. Since we have 25 of each, that's okay. The only constraint is that we can't use more than 25 of either. Since all arrangements in our count use at most 25 of each, it's okay. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 1022. \n\nWait, but I recall that in some combinatorial problems, the assignment of rows and columns might have symmetries or overcounting. For example, swapping white and black might result in the same arrangement if the counts are the same. But in this problem, since the chips are colored, swapping white and black would produce a different arrangement unless the regions are symmetric. \n\nHowever, the problem counts arrangements as distinct if the colors are different. So white and black are distinguishable, so each assignment is unique. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is indeed 1022. \n\nBut wait, let me verify with another small case. Take 1x1 grid:\n\nUsing the formula: 2^(1+1) -2 =4-2=2, which matches. \n\nAnother test case: 2x2 grid. \n\nTotal arrangements: 14. Let me count manually:\n\nCases where all white:1, all black:1,\n\nCases with one white and one black: For example, the diagonal. There are two possibilities (white at (1,1) and black at (2,2), or white at (1,2) and black at (2,1)), but actually, in our model, these correspond to different row and column assignments. \n\nWait, actually, for 2x2:\n\nEach arrangement is determined by row assignments (2 rows each to W or B) and column assignments (2 columns each to W or B), except the two empty cases.\n\nTotal 14. \n\nIt's tedious to count them all, but let's see:\n\nNumber of ways to assign rows: 2^2=4,\n\ncolumns: 2^2=4,\n\nTotal 16. Subtract 2 gives 14.\n\nYes, so the formula holds. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 1022. \n\nWait, but the problem might require that at least one chip is placed. Since the two subtracted cases are the entirely empty grids, which are invalid because they are not maximal. Therefore, the total is indeed 1022. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{1022}.\n\n\nThe problem requires finding the number of ways to place indistinguishable white and black chips on a 5\u00d75 grid such that each row and column is monochromatic if non-empty, and the arrangement is maximal (no additional chips can be placed without violating the constraints).\n\nKey steps:\n1. **Row and Column Assignments**: Each row can be assigned to white (W), black (B), or must be part of either W or B rows. Similarly, each column can be assigned to W or B.\n2. **Maximality Condition**: The arrangement must cover all rows and columns such that no empty cell can be filled without violating row or column color constraints. This requires every row and column to be assigned to either W or B.\n3. **Exclusion of Empty Grid**: The only invalid cases are when all rows are assigned to W and all columns to B (or vice versa), resulting in an empty grid. These two cases are subtracted.\n\nCalculations:\n- Each row has 2 choices (W or B): \\(2^5\\) ways.\n- Each column has 2 choices (W or B): \\(2^5\\) ways.\n- Total assignments: \\(2^5 \\times 2^5 = 1024\\).\n- Subtract the 2 invalid cases (empty grid): \\(1024 - 2 = 1022\\).\n\nThus, the number of valid maximal arrangements is \\(\\boxed{1022}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. Hmm, so we have a 5x5 grid, and we need to place some white and black chips in the cells. The conditions are: each cell can have at most one chip; all chips in the same row or column must be the same color; and the arrangement has to be maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips without breaking the rules. The chips are indistinct except for their color. We need to count the number of such arrangements.\n\nFirst, let me parse the constraints again. Each row must have chips of the same color, and each column must also have chips of the same color. Additionally, the arrangement is maximal, so adding any chip would violate the color conditions or the one-chip-per-cell rule. Since the chips are indistinct except for color, the problem is about choosing which rows and columns are colored, and with which color, such that the intersection of a colored row and column must also have a chip of the same color. Wait, actually, that might complicate things. Let me think step by step.\n\nLet me start by considering the constraints for rows and columns. Since every row must have chips of the same color, each row can be either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column must be all white, all black, or empty. However, the color of a row and column must be consistent where they intersect. For instance, if a row is colored white, then every column that intersects it must either be white or empty. Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose a row is colored white. That means all the chips in that row are white. Similarly, a column colored black would have all its chips black. However, where a white row and black column intersect, that cell must have a chip of both colors, which is impossible. Therefore, such a configuration is invalid. Therefore, the colors of the rows and columns must be compatible.\n\nTherefore, the rows and columns must be colored in such a way that if a row is colored, say, white, then all the columns that intersect it must either be white or not colored (i.e., empty). Wait, but actually, if a column is colored black, then it can't have any white chips. But the row is white, so the cell at their intersection would have a white chip, conflicting with the column's black requirement. Therefore, such an intersection is forbidden, so a white row cannot intersect a black column. Therefore, the rows and columns must all be the same color, or empty?\n\nHmm, maybe not exactly. Let me think of this as a matrix where each row is assigned a color (or none), and each column is assigned a color (or none). The intersection of a row and column must be a chip of the color common to both. If a row is white and a column is white, then the cell is white. If a row is white and the column is black, that's impossible, so that cell cannot have a chip. Similarly, if a row is white and the column is unassigned (empty), then the column's color is not set, so the row's white color is allowed, so the cell can have a white chip? Wait, no. Wait, the column being \"empty\" would mean that the column has no chips, so the cell in that column cannot have a chip. Wait, actually, maybe we need to formalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the way to model this is that for each row, we choose a color (white, black, or none), and similarly for each column. However, the color assignments must satisfy that for every cell (i,j), if the row i is colored (say, color R) and column j is colored (color C), then R must equal C, and the cell must have a chip of that color. If either the row or column is uncolored (i.e., not chosen to have chips), then the cell must be empty. Wait, but that might not be exactly the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the color of the row and column must agree wherever they both have chips. Wait, perhaps another approach is better.\n\nLet me think of the grid as a matrix where each cell (i,j) can be either empty, white, or black. The constraints are:\n\n1. In any row, all non-empty cells must be the same color.\n\n2. In any column, all non-empty cells must be the same color.\n\n3. The arrangement is maximal: you can't add any more chips without violating the first two conditions.\n\nSo, the maximality condition implies that for every cell that is empty, if you try to place a chip there, either its row or column would have a different color already. So, every empty cell must be such that either its row already has chips of one color, and the column has a different color, making it impossible to add a chip there. Alternatively, if a row is empty and a column is empty, you could add a chip there, but then you have to make sure that the color is consistent with the row and column. Wait, but since the row and column are empty, you could choose either color? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximality condition means that for every empty cell, at least one of the following is true: the row already has chips of a certain color, so you can't add a different color; or the column already has chips of a different color, so you can't add a chip there. Alternatively, if both the row and column are empty, then you could add a chip there, so the arrangement wouldn't be maximal. Therefore, to be maximal, every empty cell must be in a row that's already been assigned a color or in a column that's already been assigned a color (possibly a different one), but such that you can't add a chip there without conflicting with the row or column's color.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe another approach is better. Let me think in terms of selecting a subset of rows and columns to color, with colors, such that the colored rows and columns form a \"grid\" where the intersections are colored consistently. Wait, maybe the problem reduces to choosing a set of rows and columns, each assigned a color, such that all intersections of those rows and columns are colored with that color, and the rest are empty. But with the condition that you can't add any more chips. So, to maximize, you have to have that every row not fully colored must have at least one column that is colored with a conflicting color, or vice versa?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the arrangement can be thought of as choosing for each row a color or none, and similarly for each column, such that whenever a row and column are both colored, their colors must agree. Then the chips are placed at the intersections where the row and column are both colored. But in that case, the color of the cell is the color of the row (and column). However, this would mean that all the colored cells in a row are of the same color as the row, and similarly for columns. But then the problem's first two conditions are satisfied. Then, the maximality condition would require that for any uncolored row or column, if you try to color it, there is a conflict with an existing column or row. Hmm, perhaps.\n\nWait, let me see. Suppose we model the grid as follows: Let R be the set of rows that are colored (either white or black), and C be the set of columns that are colored (white or black). Each colored row has a color, say, for row i, color r_i (either W or B or uncolored?), wait no, actually if it's colored, it must be assigned a color. Wait, perhaps better: Each row is either uncolored (so no chips) or colored white or black. Similarly for each column. But then, the color assignments must be such that for any row i and column j, if row i is colored (say, color R) and column j is colored (color C), then R must equal C. Otherwise, the cell (i,j) would have conflicting colors. But since the cell can have at most one chip, this is impossible, so such a configuration is invalid. Therefore, the assignments must be such that all colored rows and columns have the same color? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the colors of the rows and columns must be such that all colored rows have the same color, and all colored columns have the same color, but those two colors must be the same?\n\nWait, that might be too restrictive. Alternatively, perhaps all the colored rows must be of one color, say white, and all colored columns must be of that same color, or uncolored? Hmm, maybe I need to think of this as follows:\n\nSuppose we choose a subset of rows to color white, another subset to color black, and the remaining rows are uncolored. Similarly for columns. However, the constraints are that if a row is colored white and a column is colored black, then their intersection cell cannot have a chip. But since both the row and column are colored, they must have chips in their respective cells, but the intersection can only have one color. Therefore, such a combination is forbidden. Therefore, all colored rows must be of the same color as all colored columns. Wait, but that might not necessarily be the case. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only valid colorings are those where all colored rows have the same color, and all colored columns have the same color, and the row color must equal the column color. Because otherwise, if there's a row colored white and a column colored black, their intersection is a conflict. Therefore, the only way to have both colored rows and columns is if they are all the same color. Alternatively, you can have all colored rows as white and no colored columns, or all colored columns as black and no colored rows, etc. Hmm, perhaps that's the case.\n\nWait, so maybe the entire arrangement can be characterized by choosing a color (W or B or neither), a set of rows to be colored with that color, and a set of columns to be colored with that color. Then, the intersection of these rows and columns will have chips of that color, and the rest of the cells in the rows and columns must also have chips? Wait, no, if a row is colored white, then all its cells must be white, but if the column is uncolored, then the column can have cells outside the colored rows as empty. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nPerhaps an example would help. Let me try with a smaller grid, say 2x2, to see if I can get the idea.\n\nSuppose in a 2x2 grid. Let's say I choose row 1 to be white, and column 1 to be white. Then cell (1,1) is white, and the rest of row 1 must be white (so cell (1,2) is white), and the rest of column 1 must be white (so cell (2,1) is white). But then, column 2 is not colored, so cell (2,2) can be empty or can it? Wait, since column 2 is uncolored, but row 2 is uncolored, so could we place a chip there? Wait, according to the maximality condition, the arrangement must be such that you can't add any more chips. If cell (2,2) is empty, then since neither its row nor column is colored, we could add a chip there of any color, which would violate the maximality. Therefore, such a configuration (rows 1 white, column 1 white) would not be maximal because you can still add a chip in (2,2). Therefore, to be maximal, we need that any uncolored row or column must intersect with a colored column or row of a different color, making it impossible to add a chip.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal condition requires that every empty cell is in a row that has chips of one color and a column that has chips of a different color. Therefore, you can't add a chip there without conflicting. So for the 2x2 example, if I have row 1 as white and column 1 as white, then cell (2,2) is in row 2 (uncolored) and column 2 (uncolored). Since neither is colored, you can add a chip there, so that configuration isn't maximal. To make it maximal, you have to color either row 2 or column 2, but if you color row 2 as white, then column 2 must also be white (since the intersection (2,2) would need to be white). Alternatively, if you color column 2 as white, same thing. Alternatively, you could color row 2 as black, but then column 2 must be black, but then the intersection (2,2) would be black. However, the existing column 1 is white, so cell (2,1) would have to be white (from column 1) but row 2 is black? Wait, no, that would conflict. So if row 2 is colored black, then column 1, which is white, would have cell (2,1) needing to be both white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, you can't have row 2 colored black if column 1 is white.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the key idea is that the set of colored rows and columns must form a \"rectangle\" of a single color. For example, if I choose some rows and columns to be white, their intersection forms a rectangle where all those cells are white. Similarly, maybe another set for black, but they can't overlap. Wait, but the problem allows for multiple colors as long as the rows and columns are consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire arrangement must be a single monochromatic rectangle? No, that might not be necessary. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the arrangement can be partitioned into a white rectangle and a black rectangle, but they can't overlap? Not sure.\n\nWait, let me think again of the problem's conditions:\n\nEach row must have all chips of the same color (or none), same for each column. The arrangement is maximal, so you can't add any more chips without violating these conditions.\n\nSo, to satisfy maximality, every empty cell must be such that either its row already has some chips (so you can't add a different color) or its column already has some chips of a different color, making it impossible to add a chip there.\n\nAlternatively, if a cell is empty, then either:\n\n- Its row has chips of one color, so you can't add a chip of a different color there, but you could add the same color? Wait, but if the row is already that color, then adding another chip of the same color is allowed, but the column might restrict it. Hmm, perhaps I need to formalize this.\n\nSuppose a cell (i,j) is empty. Then:\n\n- If row i has chips of color R, then to add a chip at (i,j), it must be color R. However, column j must then also allow that color. So if column j has chips of a different color, then you can't add a chip there. If column j is empty, then you could add a chip of color R there, which would violate the maximality unless column j is also set to R.\n\nAlternatively, the maximality condition requires that for every empty cell (i,j), either:\n\n- Row i has chips of some color, and column j has chips of a different color, so you can't add any chip there (since it would have to be both colors), or\n\n- Row i is empty and column j is empty, but then you could add a chip of any color, so that's not allowed. Therefore, such cells must not exist in a maximal arrangement.\n\nTherefore, in a maximal arrangement, every empty cell must be in a row that has chips of one color and a column that has chips of a different color. Therefore, there can be no empty cells that are in an empty row and empty column.\n\nTherefore, the arrangement must be such that every empty cell is \"blocked\" by either its row or column having chips of a conflicting color. So, this suggests that the colored rows and columns form a kind of \"cross\" or \"grid\" that partitions the grid such that any uncolored cell is adjacent (in row or column) to a colored row or column of a different color.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the arrangement is determined by choosing two subsets of rows and columns, one for white and one for black, such that the white rows and columns form a rectangle (all intersections are white), and the black rows and columns form another rectangle, and these two rectangles don't overlap? Wait, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire grid is partitioned into white and black regions where each region is a rectangle, but they can't overlap. Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me try to think of the problem in terms of selecting for each row a color or none, and similarly for each column, such that whenever a row and column are both colored, their colors agree. Additionally, the arrangement must be maximal, so that every uncolored row or column intersects a colored column or row of a different color, preventing the addition of a chip.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximal condition requires that every uncolored row has at least one column that's colored with some color (so you can't add a chip to that row without conflicting with that column's color), and every uncolored column has at least one row that's colored with a different color? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach. Let me consider that the grid must be covered by some white and black rectangles such that they don't overlap (since a cell can have only one chip), and they are maximal. Wait, but maybe the entire arrangement can be considered as choosing a set of rows for white, columns for white, rows for black, columns for black, with certain constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is analogous to a bipartition of the grid into white and black regions, where each region is a rectangle, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of it as a matrix where each row is assigned a color (W, B, or blank) and each column is assigned a color (W, B, or blank). The cell (i,j) is colored with the color common to row i and column j, if they are the same, otherwise it's blank. However, the maximality condition requires that you can't change any row or column's color to non-blank without causing a conflict. Wait, maybe not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, here's a different way. Since every row must be monochromatic or empty, and every column must be monochromatic or empty, the entire grid can be partitioned into some rows and columns with colors such that the intersections are consistent.\n\nPerhaps the key is to choose for each row a color (W, B, or none) and for each column a color (W, B, or none), such that for any row and column, if they are both colored, their colors must match. Additionally, the arrangement must be maximal, so you can't add any color to an uncolored row or column without conflicting with an existing color.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nLet R be the set of rows colored W, B, or uncolored (let's denote uncolored as 0). Similarly, C for columns. The constraints are:\n\n1. For any row i and column j, if row i is colored (say, color r_i) and column j is colored (color c_j), then r_i must equal c_j.\n\n2. The arrangement is maximal, so for any uncolored row i, there exists at least one column j that is colored with some color different from any color that could be assigned to row i without conflict. Wait, perhaps more precisely, if you try to color an uncolored row i with color r, then there must exist a column j such that column j is colored with a different color than r, so that assigning row i to r would conflict with column j at (i,j).\n\nSimilarly for columns. Alternatively, the maximality condition requires that for every uncolored row, there exists a column that is already colored with some color, so that if you try to color the row, you can't do it without conflicting with that column's color. Similarly, every uncolored column must have a row already colored with a conflicting color.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire set of colored rows and columns form a \"blocking set\" such that any uncolored row is adjacent (in terms of columns) to a colored column, and vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only way to have a maximal arrangement is to have all the colored rows and columns be of the same color, and they form a rectangle. For example, if you choose some rows to be white and some columns to be white, their intersection must be white, and the rest of the cells in those rows and columns must also be white. But then, if there are any uncolored rows or columns outside this rectangle, they can't have any chips because they would conflict with the existing colored rows or columns.\n\nWait, for instance, suppose I choose rows 1-3 to be white and columns 1-3 to be white. Then the intersection (the 3x3 grid) is white, and the rest of the cells in rows 1-3 and columns 1-3 must also be white? Wait, no. If rows 1-3 are white, then all cells in those rows must be white. Similarly, columns 1-3 being white would require all cells in those columns to be white. Therefore, the entire intersection (rows 1-3 and columns 1-3) would be white, but also, the rest of the cells in rows 1-3 (columns 4-5) must be white, and the rest of the cells in columns 1-3 (rows 4-5) must be white. Therefore, actually, the entire first three rows and first three columns would form a 3x5 and 5x3 area, but their intersection is a 3x3. Wait, no, actually, if rows 1-3 are white, then all cells in those rows must be white, so columns 4 and 5 in rows 1-3 are also white. Similarly, columns 1-3 being white would require all their cells to be white, so rows 4-5 in columns 1-3 must be white. Therefore, the entire grid up to rows 1-3 and columns 1-3 would be white, but rows 4-5 and columns 4-5 would be white too? Wait, no, only the rows and columns selected as white would have all their cells white. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, actually, if a row is colored white, then every cell in that row must be white. Similarly, a column colored white must have every cell in it white. Therefore, if you have a row and a column both colored white, their intersection is white, but the entire row and column must be white. So, if you have multiple rows and columns colored white, their union must form a rectangle? Wait, no. For example, if rows 1 and 2 are white, and columns 1 and 2 are white, then all of rows 1 and 2 are white (so columns 3-5 in those rows are also white), and columns 1 and 2 are white (so rows 3-5 in those columns are white). Therefore, the entire grid would have white in rows 1-2 and columns 1-2, but also, all of rows 1-2 (so columns 3-5 are white), and all of columns 1-2 (so rows 3-5 are white). Therefore, actually, the entire grid would be white except for the intersection of rows 3-5 and columns 3-5. Wait, but rows 3-5 in columns 1-2 are white because columns 1-2 are white. Similarly, columns 3-5 in rows 1-2 are white because rows 1-2 are white. Therefore, the only cells not necessarily white would be rows 3-5 and columns 3-5. Wait, no, actually, if columns 3-5 are not colored, then their cells in rows 3-5 can be anything, but since rows 3-5 are not colored (assuming we only colored rows 1-2), then those cells can be empty or colored, but since the columns are uncolored, but the rows are uncolored, but they can't have chips because otherwise, you could add a chip there. Wait, this is getting too tangled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only way to have a maximal arrangement is to have all colored rows and columns of the same color, forming a rectangle, and the rest of the grid must be blocked by either rows or columns of that color. For example, suppose we choose a rectangle of size m x n, colored white. Then, all rows in that rectangle are white rows, and all columns in that rectangle are white columns. The remaining rows outside must have at least one white column intersecting them, so they can't be colored black or white without conflict. Similarly, remaining columns must have at least one white row. Therefore, that rectangle is maximal. Similarly, you could have a black rectangle, or both a white and a black rectangle, but they can't overlap.\n\nWait, but if you have both white and black regions, their rectangles can't overlap. For instance, suppose there is a white rectangle in the top-left corner and a black rectangle in the bottom-right corner. But then, the overlapping area would have to be both colors, which is impossible. So they must be disjoint.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire grid can be partitioned into a white rectangle and a black rectangle, separated by some uncolored rows or columns. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose in a 5x5 grid, we have a white rectangle occupying the first 3 rows and first 3 columns. So rows 1-3 are white, columns 1-3 are white. Then, the rest of the grid (rows 4-5 and columns 4-5) could potentially have a black rectangle? But columns 4-5 are uncolored, so if we color rows 4-5 as black, then columns 4-5 must also be black. However, columns 4-5 in rows 1-3 (which are white rows) would then have to be both white (from the row) and black (from the column), which is impossible. Therefore, you can't have both a white and black rectangle unless they are separated by uncolored rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire grid can be divided into a white block and a black block separated by a border of uncolored rows and columns. For instance, suppose the first two rows are white, the next two rows are black, and the last row is uncolored. Similarly for columns. But this might not satisfy the column constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal arrangements can be categorized into three types:\n\n1. All chips are white, forming a rectangle of some size, and the rest are blocked by the white rows/columns.\n\n2. All chips are black, similarly.\n\n3. A combination of white and black regions, but arranged so they don't interfere.\n\nBut maybe the combination is not possible due to overlapping constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only maximal arrangements are those where all the chips are of a single color, forming a rectangle, or the entire grid is filled with one color, or something like that. But since the problem allows for both colors, there must be arrangements with both colors.\n\nWait, let me consider an example with both colors. Suppose we have a white rectangle in the top-left 3x3 and a black rectangle in the bottom-right 2x2. But the columns and rows separating them must be uncolored. However, the rows and columns between the white and black regions would have to be uncolored. Let's see:\n\nSuppose rows 1-3 are white, columns 1-3 are white. Then rows 4-5 and columns 4-5 are uncolored. Now, if we want to have a black rectangle in rows 4-5 and columns 4-5, then those rows and columns must be colored black. However, column 4 is part of the white columns (columns 1-3) no, columns 4-5 are uncolored. Wait, if columns 4-5 are uncolored, then we can color them black along with rows 4-5. But then, the intersection of rows 4-5 and columns 4-5 would be black. However, the problem is that column 4 is uncolored in the white area (rows 1-3). Since column 4 is now colored black, the cells in rows 1-3, column 4 must be black? But those rows are white, so they can only have white chips. Therefore, that's a conflict. Therefore, such an arrangement is impossible.\n\nTherefore, perhaps you cannot have both white and black regions unless they are separated by at least one uncolored row and column. For example, a white rectangle in the top-left and a black rectangle in the bottom-right, separated by an empty row and column in the middle. Let's see:\n\nSuppose rows 1-2 are white, columns 1-2 are white. Then, rows 4-5 are black, columns 4-5 are black. The third row and third column are uncolored (so all cells in row 3 and column 3 are empty). Now, check the intersections:\n\n- In rows 1-2 and columns 1-2: white chips.\n\n- In rows 4-5 and columns 4-5: black chips.\n\n- The cells in rows 1-2, columns 3-5 (except column 3 is uncolored) would be in rows that are white but columns that are either uncolored (column 3) or black (columns 4-5). Since the rows are white, those columns must be white to have chips, but columns 4-5 are black, so those cells must be empty. Similarly, columns 1-2 in rows 3-5 would be in columns white but rows black or uncolored. Since rows 4-5 are black, their intersection with columns 1-2 must be black, but columns 1-2 are white, so those cells must be empty. The central cell (3,3) is empty because both row and column are uncolored. The cells in row 3 (uncolored) and columns 4-5 (black) would be in columns that are black, so they must be black, but row 3 is uncolored. Wait, no\u2014if a column is colored black, then all its cells must be black. So column 4, which is black, requires all cells in column 4 to be black. But row 3, column 4 is in an uncolored row, so can it have a black chip? Since the column is black, yes, it must have a black chip. However, the row 3 is uncolored, so it can have chips as long as they are all the same color. But since column 4 requires it to be black, then row 3, column 4 must be black, but row 3 is uncolored, so it can have a black chip there. Wait, but if row 3 is uncolored, does that mean it can have any color? No, actually, if a row is uncolored, it means it has no chips. Wait, hold on. This is a critical point.\n\nIf a row is uncolored, does that mean it cannot have any chips, or can it have chips as long as they are all the same color? Wait, according to the problem's first condition: \"each cell contains at most one chip\", and \"all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\". So, if a row is uncolored, it can have some chips, but they must all be the same color. Wait, no, actually, the row can have no chips (so uncolored), or have chips all of one color. Similarly, a column can be uncolored (no chips) or have chips all of one color.\n\nTherefore, in my previous example, column 4 is colored black, so all cells in column 4 must be black. Therefore, row 3, column 4 must be black. But row 3 is uncolored, so it can have chips as long as they are all black. Since column 4 requires it to be black, that's okay. Therefore, row 3 would have a black chip in column 4 and column 5 (since column 5 is also black). However, column 3 is uncolored, so row 3, column 3 must be empty. Similarly, column 3, row 4 must be in a black row, so column 3 is uncolored, so the cell can be black? Wait, column 3 is uncolored, so it can have chips, but they must be all the same color. Since row 4 is black, the cell (4,3) must be black, which is allowed as column 3 can be black. Wait, but if column 3 has a black chip in (4,3) and (5,3), but also maybe in row 3, column 3 is empty. Wait, but column 3 is uncolored, so it can have chips of any single color. Since some cells in column 3 (like (4,3) and (5,3)) are black, then column 3 must be entirely black? No, because if column 3 has some black chips and some empty cells, that's allowed as long as the non-empty chips are all the same color. Wait, but the problem says \"all chips in the same column have the same color\". So if column 3 has a black chip in row 4, then any other chips in column 3 must also be black. But since column 3 is uncolored, it can have chips of a single color. Therefore, column 3 can be considered as a black column because it has some black chips, but since it's unassigned, it's allowed? Wait, no. If a column has chips, they must all be the same color, but the column itself isn't necessarily \"assigned\" a color. Wait, the problem doesn't mention assigning colors to rows or columns, just that in any row or column, the chips must be the same color.\n\nTherefore, in this example, column 3 has a black chip in row 4 and 5, so it must be a black column. But we initially considered it uncolored. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, my previous assumption was wrong.\n\nAh, here's the key: If a column has any chips, they must all be the same color. Therefore, column 3 in the previous example, since it has chips in rows 4 and 5 (black), must be a black column. Therefore, we can't have it as uncolored. Therefore, the column must be considered as black, which would require all its cells to be black or empty. Therefore, the cell (3,3) must be black as well, but row 3 is uncolored. Since column 3 is black, cell (3,3) must be black. However, row 3 has a black chip at (3,3) and potentially others. But row 3 is uncolored, so it can have chips as long as they're all the same color. Since (3,3) is black, then any chips in row 3 must be black. However, column 1 is white, so cell (3,1) would have to be white if it's a chip, but column 1 is white, so it can be a white chip. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe my example is invalid because of these constraints.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the only way to have both colors is to have them separated by an uncolored row or column. Let me try again.\n\nSuppose we have the first two rows as white (so all their columns must be white where they intersect), and the last two rows as black, with a central row (row 3) uncolored. Similarly, columns 1-2 as white and columns 4-5 as black, with column 3 uncolored. Then:\n\n- Rows 1-2 are white: all their cells must be white. Therefore, columns 1-2, 3-5 in these rows are white.\n\n- Columns 1-2 are white: all their cells must be white. Therefore, rows 1-5 in columns 1-2 are white.\n\n- Rows 4-5 are black: all their cells must be black. Therefore, columns 1-5 in rows 4-5 are black.\n\n- Columns 4-5 are black: all their cells must be black. Therefore, rows 1-5 in columns 4-5 are black.\n\nBut now, the intersection of rows 1-2 and columns 4-5 must be both white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, this arrangement is invalid.\n\nTherefore, maybe having both colors requires that their regions don't overlap in rows or columns. For instance, white in the top-left and black in the bottom-right, separated by an empty row and column.\n\nLet me try:\n\n- Rows 1-2 and columns 1-2 are white. So the intersection forms a white rectangle.\n\n- Rows 4-5 and columns 4-5 are black. Their intersection forms a black rectangle.\n\n- Rows 3 and columns 3 are uncolored.\n\nNow check:\n\n- For rows 1-2: all their cells must be white. So columns 1-2, 3-5 in these rows are white. Wait, but columns 3-5 in rows 1-2 are in uncolored columns (column 3) or columns 4-5 (which are black? No, columns 4-5 are part of the black region in rows 4-5. Wait, columns 4-5 are assigned to black because rows 4-5 are black. Therefore, columns 4-5 must be black. Therefore, in rows 1-2, columns 4-5 must be black, but rows 1-2 are white. Contradiction again.\n\nHmm, this seems really tricky. Maybe the only way to have both colors is to have them in separate rows and columns with no overlap. For example:\n\n- All white chips are in rows 1-2 and columns 1-2.\n\n- All black chips are in rows 3-5 and columns 3-5.\n\nBut then, columns 1-2 in rows 3-5 must be black? No, columns 1-2 are white (because rows 1-2 are white and those columns must be white). Therefore, columns 1-2 must be white, so their cells in rows 3-5 must also be white, conflicting with the black chips there. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the white and black regions are in separate rows and columns with a buffer of uncolored rows and columns between them.\n\nSuppose:\n\n- White region: rows 1-2, columns 1-2.\n\n- Black region: rows 4-5, columns 4-5.\n\n- Rows 3 and columns 3 are uncolored.\n\nThen:\n\n- In rows 1-2, all cells must be white (since those rows are white). Therefore, columns 1-2 in those rows are white, and columns 3-5 must also be white? Wait, no. Wait, if a row is white, all its cells must be white, so yes, the entire row 1 and 2 must be white. That means columns 3-5 in rows 1-2 are white. But columns 3-5 in those rows are part of columns 3-5. Columns 3 is uncolored, so column 3 can have chips as long as they are all the same color. Since rows 1-2 have white chips in column 3, column 3 must be white. Therefore, columns 3 must be white, which would conflict with the black region in columns 4-5. Wait, columns 4-5 are part of the black region in rows 4-5, so columns 4-5 must be black. Therefore, column 3 is white, column 4-5 are black, so in row 3 (uncolored), column 3 must be white (since column 3 is white) and columns 4-5 must be black (since columns 4-5 are black). However, row 3 is uncolored, so it can have chips as long as they are all the same color. But column 3 requires white and column 4-5 require black, so the row can't have both, so row 3 must be empty. That's okay.\n\nSimilarly, columns 1-2 are white (due to rows 1-2), so in rows 3-5, columns 1-2 must be white. But rows 4-5 are black, so their cells in columns 1-2 must be black. Contradiction again. Because rows 4-5 are black, so their entire rows must be black, conflicting with columns 1-2 being white.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe it's impossible to have both colors in a maximal arrangement? Or maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the only maximal arrangements are those where all the chips are of a single color, forming a rectangle, or the entire grid is filled with one color, or perhaps some other configuration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal arrangements correspond to choosing a rectangle of white chips and a rectangle of black chips, but they can't overlap, and they are as large as possible. But I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the problem again: the arrangement must be maximal, so you can't add any chip. Therefore, for every empty cell, at least one of the following is true:\n\n- The cell's row already has chips of one color, so you can't add a different color there, but you could add the same color. Wait, but if the row is already that color, then you can add the same color unless the column restricts it.\n\nWait, actually, if a row is already white, then all its cells must be white. So you can't add a black chip there, but you could add a white chip only if the column allows it. However, if the column is uncolored, then you could add a white chip there, which would extend the column's color to white. But since the arrangement is maximal, you can't do that. Therefore, the column must already be white or black.\n\nWait, perhaps for every empty cell (i,j), either:\n\n- The row i has chips of color W, so you can't add a B chip there. But you could add a W chip only if column j is uncolored or also W. But since it's empty, column j must already be colored B or uncolored? No, this is getting too tangled.\n\nAlternatively, the maximal condition implies that for every empty cell (i,j), the row i has chips of some color and the column j has chips of a different color. Therefore, you can't add any chip there because it would have to be both colors. Therefore, every empty cell is \"blocked\" by a row and column of different colors.\n\nTherefore, in such a case, the entire grid can be divided into three regions:\n\n1. Cells where the row and column are both colored the same (so they have a chip).\n\n2. Cells where the row and column are colored differently (so they are empty).\n\n3. Cells where either the row or column is uncolored, but then they must be blocked by another conflicting color.\n\nWait, actually, if a cell is in an uncolored row and uncolored column, then you could add a chip there of any color, so the arrangement isn't maximal. Therefore, such cells cannot exist. Therefore, every empty cell must be in a row that is colored and a column that is colored with a different color.\n\nTherefore, the entire grid can be partitioned into four regions:\n\n- Rows colored W and columns colored W: these cells have W chips.\n\n- Rows colored W and columns colored B: these cells are empty.\n\n- Rows colored B and columns colored W: empty.\n\n- Rows colored B and columns colored B: have B chips.\n\nAdditionally, there are rows and columns that are uncolored. But any uncolored row must be such that every column it intersects is either colored W or B, so that you can't add a chip to the row (since the columns are already colored, conflicting with the row's potential color). Similarly for uncolored columns.\n\nWait, this seems promising. Let me formalize this:\n\nSuppose we choose a subset of rows to color W, a subset to color B, and the remaining rows are uncolored. Similarly, choose a subset of columns to color W, a subset to color B, and the remaining columns are uncolored.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\n1. For any row colored W, all its cells must be W where the column is also colored W or uncolored? Wait no, actually, if a row is colored W, then all its cells must be W if the column allows it, but actually, more strictly, if a row is colored W, then any column that intersects it must either be uncolored (so the cell can be W) or also colored W (so the cell is W). If a column is colored B, then the intersection cell would have to be both W and B, which is impossible, so such a row and column cannot both be colored.\n\nTherefore, the rows and columns must be colored such that all W rows are only intersecting W columns or uncolored columns, and all B rows are only intersecting B columns or uncolored columns.\n\nWait, actually, more precisely, the coloring must satisfy that if a row is colored W, then all columns that are colored B must not intersect it. Similarly, if a column is colored B, then all rows colored W must not intersect it. Therefore, the W rows and B columns must be disjoint in their indices.\n\nTherefore, the set of W rows and B columns must form a partition of the grid's rows and columns in such a way that they don't intersect. Similarly for B rows and W columns.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a bipartition of rows and columns into W, B, or uncolored, with the constraints that W rows can only intersect W columns or uncolored columns, and similarly for B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key idea is that the W rows and W columns form a rectangle (their intersection is W chips), and similarly the B rows and B columns form another rectangle, and these two rectangles don't overlap. Additionally, the uncolored rows and columns must be arranged such that they are \"blocked\" by the colored rows or columns of opposite color.\n\nThis is getting too abstract. Maybe there's a better mathematical way to model this.\n\nLet me consider that the grid can be divided into four regions based on the colors of rows and columns:\n\nLet R_W be the set of rows colored W,\n\nR_B be the set of rows colored B,\n\nC_W be the set of columns colored W,\n\nC_B be the set of columns colored B,\n\nand the remaining rows and columns are uncolored.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\n- For any row in R_W, it can only intersect columns in C_W or uncolored columns. But if it intersects a column in C_B, that would require the cell to be both W and B, which is impossible. Therefore, R_W must be disjoint from C_B in the sense that no row in R_W intersects a column in C_B. Wait, actually, rows and columns are sets, so the intersection is their indices. Therefore, the column indices in C_B must not be in the columns of rows R_W. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the columns in C_B cannot be in the columns that are in C_W or uncolored? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, more precisely, if a row is in R_W, then any column that is in C_B cannot have an intersection with that row because the cell would need to be both W and B. Therefore, all columns in C_B must be excluded from the columns that intersect with R_W rows. Wait, this is getting too tangled.\n\nPerhaps another way: To avoid conflicts between colored rows and columns, the sets R_W and C_B must be disjoint in the sense that no row in R_W can have a column in C_B. That is, the columns in C_B must not be in the columns of R_W? Not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, the columns in C_B must not be in the columns that are in C_W? No, that's not necessarily.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of it this way: If a column is colored B, then no row colored W can have that column, because their intersection would require the cell to be both W and B. Therefore, any column in C_B cannot be in any row in R_W. So the columns in C_B must be a subset of the columns not covered by any rows in R_W? Not exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps the columns in C_B must be disjoint from the rows in R_W? Not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, if a column is in C_B, then any row in R_W cannot have that column. Therefore, the columns in C_B must be a subset of the columns not covered by any rows in R_W? Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe it's better to think in terms of choosing for each row a color (W, B, or uncolored) and similarly for each column, such that whenever a row is colored W and a column is colored B, they cannot intersect (i.e., their indices don't overlap). Wait, but rows and columns are in a grid, so every row and column intersect at exactly one cell. Therefore, if a row is colored W and a column is colored B, their intersection cell would have conflicting colors. Therefore, such a pairing is forbidden. Therefore, the set of W rows and B columns must be disjoint in the sense that no W row is paired with a B column.\n\nWait, perhaps more precisely, the sets R_W and C_B must be such that for any row in R_W and column in C_B, their intersection cell is not allowed, but since they must intersect, this is impossible. Therefore, to avoid this, either there are no W rows and B columns, or their intersections must somehow be blocked. Wait, but the only way to block it is to have the cell be empty, but since the row is W and column is B, they can't have a chip there, so it must be empty. But since the row is W, all its cells must be W except those in B columns. Wait, no, if a row is W, then all its cells must be W if the columns allow it, but if a column is B, then that cell can't be W. Therefore, such a cell must be empty. However, the row being W requires that all non-empty cells in the row are W, but the column being B requires that all non-empty cells in the column are B. Therefore, the cell at their intersection must be empty. But the row is W, so it can have other cells as W. Therefore, it's allowed as long as that particular cell is empty.\n\nWait, so actually, it's possible to have W rows and B columns as long as their intersections are empty. But for the arrangement to be maximal, those intersections must be empty and blocked by the conflicting colors.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the entire arrangement can be defined by choosing:\n\n- A set of W rows R_W,\n\n- A set of W columns C_W,\n\n- A set of B rows R_B,\n\n- A set of B columns C_B,\n\nsuch that:\n\n1. R_W and R_B are disjoint (a row can't be both W and B),\n\n2. C_W and C_B are disjoint,\n\n3. The intersection of R_W and C_B must be empty? Wait no, they can intersect, but their cells must be empty,\n\nWait, actually, the constraints are:\n\n- For any row in R_W, all its cells in columns not in C_B must be W, and cells in C_B must be empty.\n\nWait, no. If a row is in R_W, then all its non-empty cells must be W. The columns in C_B have their non-empty cells must be B. Therefore, the intersection cells between R_W rows and C_B columns must be empty, because otherwise, the cell would have to be both W and B.\n\nTherefore, for all i in R_W and j in C_B, the cell (i,j) must be empty. Similarly, for all i in R_B and j in C_W, the cell (i,j) must be empty.\n\nAdditionally, the remaining cells (outside these intersections) must be filled appropriately:\n\n- For a cell (i,j) where i is in R_W and j is in C_W: must be W.\n\n- For a cell (i,j) where i is in R_B and j is in C_B: must be B.\n\n- Cells where i is in R_W and j is uncolored (not in C_W or C_B): can be W (since the row is W and the column is uncolored, so the column can have W there).\n\nWait, but if the column is uncolored, it can have any color as long as it's consistent. However, since the row is W, the cell must be W. Therefore, those cells must be W.\n\nSimilarly, if a cell is in an uncolored row and a W column, it must be W.\n\nTherefore, all cells in R_W rows and columns not in C_B must be W. Similarly for B.\n\nBut also, the maximality condition requires that there are no empty cells that could be filled without conflict. Therefore, every empty cell must be in a W row and B column, or vice versa.\n\nThus, the empty cells are precisely those in R_W \u00d7 C_B and R_B \u00d7 C_W.\n\nTherefore, to ensure maximality, there should be no cells that are in an uncolored row and uncolored column, because such a cell could be filled with any color, violating maximality. Therefore, all uncolored rows and columns must be \"blocked\" by either W or B in such a way that their intersections are already blocked.\n\nTherefore, the set of uncolored rows (not in R_W or R_B) must have every column either in C_W or C_B. Similarly, the set of uncolored columns must have every row in R_W or R_B.\n\nWait, more precisely:\n\nFor any uncolored row (not in R_W or R_B), every column must be in either C_W or C_B. Otherwise, there exists a column not in C_W or C_B (i.e., uncolored), so the cell at (that row, that column) is in an uncolored row and uncolored column, which would allow adding a chip there, violating maximality.\n\nSimilarly, for any uncolored column (not in C_W or C_B), every row must be in R_W or R_B. Otherwise, there's a row not in R_W or R_B (uncolored), leading to an empty cell in an uncolored row and column.\n\nTherefore, the uncolored rows must be entirely covered by C_W \u222a C_B columns, and uncolored columns must be entirely covered by R_W \u222a R_B rows.\n\nThis is getting very formal, but perhaps we can model this as a matrix where:\n\n- The W region is R_W \u00d7 C_W,\n\n- The B region is R_B \u00d7 C_B,\n\n- The blocked regions are R_W \u00d7 C_B and R_B \u00d7 C_W,\n\n- The remaining regions (outside R_W \u222a R_B rows and C_W \u222a C_B columns) must be empty, but since they would form uncolored rows and columns, they must not exist.\n\nTherefore, the entire grid must be covered by R_W \u222a R_B rows and C_W \u222a C_B columns. Wait, but the uncolored rows and columns are those not in R_W \u222a R_B or C_W \u222a C_B, but they can't exist because of the maximality condition. Therefore, R_W \u222a R_B must cover all rows, and C_W \u222a C_B must cover all columns. Wait, no, that's too strict.\n\nWait, actually, the uncolored rows are those not in R_W or R_B, but for every such row, every column must be in C_W or C_B. Since columns not in C_W or C_B would allow an empty cell in an uncolored row and uncolored column. Therefore, to prevent that, the columns not in C_W or C_B must be nonexistent. Therefore, C_W \u222a C_B must cover all columns. Similarly, R_W \u222a R_B must cover all rows. Therefore, there are no uncolored rows or columns. Thus, every row is either W, B, or neither? Wait no, we just concluded that every row must be in R_W or R_B, because otherwise, there would be uncolored rows which require all columns to be covered, but columns are already covered. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf there exists an uncolored row (not in R_W or R_B), then to satisfy maximality, every column must be in C_W or C_B. Therefore, all columns are covered by C_W and C_B. Similarly, if there exists an uncolored column, then all rows must be in R_W or R_B.\n\nTherefore, either:\n\n- All rows are colored (R_W \u222a R_B = all rows),\n\n- Or all columns are colored (C_W \u222a C_B = all columns),\n\n- Or both.\n\nWait, actually, it's possible to have some uncolored rows and uncolored columns as long as the uncolored rows are only those for which all columns are colored, and uncolored columns are only those for which all rows are colored. But this would require that the set of uncolored rows and columns are such that their intersections are covered.\n\nThis is getting too involved. Perhaps it's better to model the problem as choosing for each row a color (W, B, or uncolored) and for each column similarly, with the constraints that:\n\n1. If a row is W, then all columns that are B cannot have that row's cells (they must be empty).\n\n2. Similarly for other color combinations.\n\n3. The arrangement is maximal, so there are no uncolored rows and columns with intersections that are unblocked.\n\nThis seems to be leading me towards the conclusion that the only maximal arrangements are those where all rows and columns are colored either W or B, with no overlaps between W and B regions. That is, the grid is partitioned into four regions:\n\n- W rows and W columns: W chips.\n\n- B rows and B columns: B chips.\n\n- W rows and B columns: empty.\n\n- B rows and W columns: empty.\n\nAdditionally, there can be no uncolored rows or columns, because if there were, they would have to be covered by the other colors, but since they are uncolored, their intersections with other uncolored rows/columns would allow adding chips, violating maximality.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing a subset of rows to be W, a subset to be B, and similarly for columns, such that the W rows and columns form a rectangle, and the B rows and columns form another rectangle, and the W and B regions don't overlap (i.e., the W rows don't intersect B columns and vice versa). Wait, but actually, the W rows and B columns can intersect, but those intersections must be empty, which they are by the above partition.\n\nTherefore, the total number of such arrangements is the number of ways to choose a subset of rows for W, a subset of rows for B (disjoint from W), a subset of columns for W, and a subset of columns for B (disjoint from W columns), such that the W rows and B columns don't have overlapping cells (which they don't need to avoid; their intersections are just empty). Wait, actually, the only constraint is that the W rows and B columns can coexist as long as their intersections are empty, but since those cells are just empty, it's allowed.\n\nWait, actually, the constraints are automatically satisfied as long as the row and column colors are chosen such that:\n\n- Any W row and W column intersection has a W chip.\n\n- Any B row and B column intersection has a B chip.\n\n- All other intersections (W row & B column, B row & W column) are empty.\n\n- All rows are either W, B, or uncolored, but to satisfy maximality, there can't be uncolored rows or columns. Therefore, all rows and columns must be colored either W or B.\n\nWait, but if all rows and columns are colored, then the maximality condition is satisfied because any empty cell is in a W row and B column (or vice versa), so you can't add a chip there. Additionally, there are no uncolored rows or columns to allow adding chips.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing for each row a color (W or B), and for each column a color (W or B), with the condition that whenever a row is colored W and a column is colored B, their intersection is empty (which it is, since it's just empty). The only constraint is that we can't have both a row and column uncolored, but since we're coloring all rows and columns, that's fine.\n\nHowever, we also have to consider that the chips are indistinct except for color. So the count is the number of color assignments to rows and columns (each row can be W or B, each column can be W or B), but with the caveat that the assignments must be such that the resulting grid's chips are placed according to the row and column colors, and the count considers indistinct chips of the same color.\n\nWait, but actually, each assignment of row and column colors defines a unique grid: for each cell, if the row is W and column is W, it's W; if row B and column B, it's B; otherwise, empty. Since the chips are indistinct except for color, this is counted as one arrangement per such assignment.\n\nHowever, we must also consider that some assignments may result in the same grid. For example, if all rows and columns are W, that's one arrangement. Similarly for all B. But since the problem says \"some of these chips\", meaning they can choose any subset, but under the constraints.\n\nWait, actually, each assignment of row and column colors gives a unique grid. Because the color of each cell is determined uniquely by the row and column colors. So the total number would be the number of ways to choose row colors (each row can be W or B, 2^5) multiplied by the number of column colorings (2^5), so 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024. But this is way too big, and also includes cases where, for example, all rows are W and all columns are W, resulting in a fully white grid. Similarly for all B.\n\nHowever, the problem requires that the arrangement is maximal. The above count includes all possible assignments, including those that are not maximal. For instance, if all rows and columns are W, then the grid is fully white, which is maximal because you can't add any chips. But if you have some rows and columns uncolored (but earlier we thought they must be colored), but wait, in the previous analysis, we concluded that for maximality, all rows and columns must be colored. Because otherwise, an uncolored row and column would allow adding a chip.\n\nWait, let me verify this point again. Suppose there's an uncolored row and an uncolored column. Their intersection cell is in an uncolored row and column, so you could add a chip there of any color, violating maximality. Therefore, in a maximal arrangement, there can be no uncolored rows or columns. Therefore, all rows and columns must be colored either W or B. Therefore, the total number of colorings is indeed 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024. However, this includes colorings where, for example, a row is W and a column is B, leading to some empty cells, but those are allowed as long as they're maximal.\n\nWait, but the problem also says \"any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous conditions\". So if all rows and columns are colored, then indeed, you can't add any more chips because every empty cell is in a W row and B column (or vice versa), so you can't place a chip there without conflicting. So those 1024 colorings are all maximal.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that there are 25 indistinguishable white chips and 25 indistinguishable black chips. Wait, but in our current model, the number of white and black chips can vary. For example, if all rows and columns are W, then all 25 cells are white, using 25 white chips. But the problem states \"some of these chips\", so using up to 25 white and 25 black. However, the problem says \"the number of ways to place some of these chips\", so perhaps we are to count all such maximal arrangements, regardless of the number of chips used, as long as they use some chips (but the problem says \"some\", but maybe including zero? Wait, the problem says \"some\", so maybe at least one chip. But in the problem statement, it says \"each cell contains at most one chip\", so an empty grid is allowed? But the maximality condition says you can't add any chips, which would require that every cell is already blocked. But an empty grid can have chips added, so it's not maximal. Therefore, the maximal arrangements must have at least one chip.\n\nBut in our current count of 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024, this includes the all-white and all-black grids (which are valid), and also the case where all rows and columns are colored but no cells are actually colored. Wait, no\u2014if all rows and columns are colored W or B such that there's no overlap between W rows and W columns, leading to an empty grid? Wait, no. For example, if all rows are W and all columns are B, then every cell is in a W row and B column, so all cells are empty. This would be an empty grid, which is not maximal because you can add a chip anywhere. Therefore, such a coloring is invalid.\n\nAh! This is a critical mistake. So not all colorings are valid. Specifically, if the intersection of W rows and W columns is empty (i.e., no W rows or no W columns), then the W region is empty, similarly for B. So the total number of chips is the number of W cells (rows_W \u00d7 cols_W) plus the number of B cells (rows_B \u00d7 cols_B).\n\nTo have a maximal arrangement, the grid cannot be empty. Therefore, we must have that either:\n\n- There are W rows and W columns such that rows_W \u00d7 cols_W is non-empty, or\n\n- There are B rows and B columns such that rows_B \u00d7 cols_B is non-empty,\n\nor both.\n\nAdditionally, the arrangement must be maximal, so the empty grid (all rows and columns colored such that W and B regions are empty) is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the total number of valid arrangements is equal to the number of colorings (row and column color assignments) minus the cases where both W and B regions are empty.\n\nHow many colorings result in both W and B regions being empty?\n\nThat would be when either:\n\n1. There are no W rows or no W columns, and also no B rows or no B columns.\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nThe W region is non-empty iff there is at least one W row and at least one W column.\n\nSimilarly, the B region is non-empty iff there is at least one B row and at least one B column.\n\nTherefore, the cases where both regions are empty are those where:\n\n- Either there are no W rows or no W columns, AND\n\n- Either there are no B rows or no B columns.\n\nBut this is a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of colorings where the grid is empty is the number of colorings where (there are no W rows or no W columns) AND (there are no B rows or no B columns).\n\nWait, no. The grid is empty only if both the W region and B region are empty. The W region is empty if there are no W rows or no W columns. Similarly for B. So the grid is empty when:\n\n(W rows = 0 OR W columns = 0) AND (B rows = 0 OR B columns = 0).\n\nTherefore, to compute the number of such colorings, we can use inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal colorings where W region is empty: 2^5 (row colorings with no W rows or no W columns) ?\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet A be the set of colorings where the W region is empty (i.e., either no W rows or no W columns).\n\nLet B be the set of colorings where the B region is empty (either no B rows or no B columns).\n\nWe need to compute |A \u2229 B|, the number of colorings where both regions are empty.\n\nThe total number of maximal arrangements is Total = (2^5 * 2^5) - |A \u2229 B|.\n\nFirst, compute Total colorings: 2^5 (row colors: each row can be W, B) \u00d7 2^5 (column colors: each column can be W, B). Wait, actually, each row has two choices: W or B. Similarly for each column. Therefore, it's 2^5 \u00d7 2^5 = 1024.\n\nNow compute |A \u2229 B|:\n\nA \u2229 B is the set of colorings where:\n\n- W region is empty: (no W rows OR no W columns)\n\nAND\n\n- B region is empty: (no B rows OR no B columns)\n\nSo, to be in A \u2229 B, the coloring must satisfy:\n\nEither (no W rows or no W columns) AND (no B rows or no B columns).\n\nThis can be broken into cases:\n\nCase 1: No W rows AND no B rows. Then all rows are uncolored? Wait no, rows must be colored either W or B. If there are no W rows and no B rows, that would mean all rows are uncolored, but earlier we concluded that rows must be colored. Wait, actually in our model, rows must be colored either W or B, so there are no uncolored rows. Similarly for columns. Therefore, \"no W rows\" means all rows are B, and \"no B rows\" means all rows are W.\n\nWait, this is a key point. Since every row must be colored either W or B (as per maximality requiring no uncolored rows), \"no W rows\" means all rows are B, and \"no B rows\" means all rows are W. Similarly for columns.\n\nTherefore, the condition \"W region is empty\" is equivalent to:\n\nEither (all rows are B) OR (all columns are B).\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, the W region is empty if either there are no W rows (i.e., all rows are B) or no W columns (all columns are B).\n\nSimilarly, the B region is empty if either no B rows (all rows are W) or no B columns (all columns are W).\n\nTherefore, the intersection A \u2229 B is the set of colorings where:\n\n[ (all rows B or all columns B) AND (all rows W or all columns W) ]\n\nThis can be broken into cases:\n\n1. All rows are B AND all rows are W: impossible.\n\n2. All rows are B AND all columns are W: this satisfies both conditions. Because:\n\n- All rows are B \u21d2 W region is empty (no W rows),\n\n- All columns are W \u21d2 B region is empty (no B columns).\n\nTherefore, this is a valid case.\n\n3. All columns are B AND all rows are W: similarly, this would satisfy:\n\n- All columns are B \u21d2 W region is empty (no W columns),\n\n- All rows are W \u21d2 B region is empty (no B rows).\n\nAnother valid case.\n\n4. All columns are B AND all columns are W: impossible.\n\nAdditionally, there might be other cases where:\n\nWait, perhaps also:\n\nWait, let me rephrase.\n\nThe conditions for A \u2229 B are:\n\nEither:\n\n- (All rows are B or all columns are B) AND (All rows are W or all columns are W)\n\nThis can be:\n\nCase 1: All rows are B AND all rows are W \u21d2 impossible.\n\nCase 2: All rows are B AND all columns are W \u21d2 valid.\n\nCase 3: All columns are B AND all rows are W \u21d2 valid.\n\nCase 4: All columns are B AND all columns are W \u21d2 impossible.\n\nCase 5: All rows are B AND all columns are W: already covered.\n\nWait, perhaps also:\n\nWait, maybe there are cases where:\n\n- All rows are B and all columns are W,\n\n- All rows are W and all columns are B,\n\n- All rows are B and all columns are B,\n\n- All rows are W and all columns are W,\n\nWait, but the last two would not satisfy both conditions.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nSuppose all rows are B and all columns are B:\n\n- Then the W region is empty (no W rows or columns),\n\n- The B region is non-empty (rows and columns are B),\n\nTherefore, it doesn't satisfy B region being empty, so not in A \u2229 B.\n\nSimilarly, all rows W and all columns W would not satisfy the B region being empty.\n\nTherefore, only the two cases:\n\n1. All rows are B and all columns are W.\n\n2. All rows are W and all columns are B.\n\nEach of these results in an empty grid.\n\nAdditionally, are there other possibilities?\n\nSuppose, for example, all rows are B, and columns are neither all W nor all B. Then:\n\n- The W region is empty (no W rows),\n\n- The B region is non-empty (since there are B rows and at least one B column).\n\nThus, it doesn't satisfy B region being empty, so not in A \u2229 B.\n\nSimilarly, if all columns are B and rows are neither all W nor all B:\n\n- W region could be non-empty if there are W columns (but columns are all B), so W region is empty,\n\n- B region is non-empty,\n\nThus, not in A \u2229 B.\n\nTherefore, the only colorings in A \u2229 B are the two cases:\n\n1. All rows B, all columns W.\n\n2. All rows W, all columns B.\n\nEach of these results in an empty grid (since W region requires W rows and W columns, but there are none; similarly for B region). So those are the only two colorings where the grid is entirely empty, which are invalid because they are not maximal.\n\nTherefore, |A \u2229 B| = 2.\n\nTherefore, the total number of maximal arrangements is 1024 - 2 = 1022.\n\nHowever, wait, hold on. Are there other colorings where the grid is empty?\n\nSuppose some rows are W and some are B, but the columns are arranged such that there's no overlap between W rows and W columns, and similarly for B.\n\nFor example:\n\nSuppose we have some W rows and some B rows, and columns are split into W and B such that the W columns don't intersect the W rows, and B columns don't intersect B rows. But this would require that:\n\n- The W rows have no W columns,\n\n- The B rows have no B columns,\n\nThus making both regions empty.\n\nThis can happen even if not all rows are W or B, and similarly for columns.\n\nFor example:\n\nLet rows 1-2 be W, rows 3-5 be B.\n\nColumns 1-2 be B, columns 3-5 be W.\n\nThen:\n\n- The W region requires W rows (1-2) and W columns (3-5). Their intersection (rows 1-2, cols 3-5) would be W chips. Wait, but columns 3-5 are W, so yes, those cells are W.\n\nWait, so this would have a non-empty W region. Similarly, the B region would be rows 3-5 and columns 1-2, so their intersection (rows 3-5, cols 1-2) are B chips.\n\nTherefore, this is a valid non-empty arrangement.\n\nAnother example where regions are empty:\n\nSuppose rows 1-2 are W, rows 3-5 are B.\n\nColumns 1-2 are B, columns 3-5 are W.\n\nWait, as above, that has both regions non-empty.\n\nSuppose instead:\n\nRows 1-2 are W, rows 3-5 are B.\n\nColumns all are B.\n\nThen:\n\n- W region requires W rows (1-2) and W columns. But columns are all B, so W columns don't exist \u21d2 W region is empty.\n\n- B region requires B rows (3-5) and B columns (all). So B region is rows 3-5 and all columns \u21d2 B region is non-empty.\n\nThus, the grid is partially filled with B chips. So this is a valid arrangement (non-empty), so it's counted in the 1024 total.\n\nTherefore, the only cases where the grid is empty are the two cases where:\n\nAll rows are W and all columns are B, or vice versa.\n\nTherefore, |A \u2229 B| = 2.\n\nTherefore, total maximal arrangements are 1024 - 2 = 1022.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the number of ways to place some of these chips\". The chips are indistinct except for color, so each valid grid is counted once, regardless of the number of chips.\n\nHowever, the problem also mentions \"there is a collection of 25 indistinguishable white chips and 25 indistinguishable black chips\". Does this mean that we cannot use more than 25 of each? In our current model, the number of white chips is (number of W rows) \u00d7 (number of W columns), and similarly for black. Since the grid is 5x5, the maximum number of white chips is 25 (if all rows and columns are W), and similarly for black. Since we have exactly 25 of each, those maximums are allowed. Any smaller number is also allowed as long as they don't exceed 25, which they won't because it's a 5x5 grid. Therefore, all the colorings are valid as long as they don't exceed the chip counts, but since we have 25 of each, it's okay.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1022.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again. The problem says \"some of these chips\", so arrangements with zero chips are excluded. The two cases we subtract are the two empty grids, so the total is 1024 - 2 = 1022. But wait, are there any other arrangements with zero chips?\n\nSuppose all rows are W and all columns are W. Then the grid is fully white, which is non-empty. Similarly, all rows B and columns B is fully black. The only empty grids are the two cases where rows and columns are opposite colors.\n\nTherefore, yes, subtracting those two gives 1022. But let me check with an example.\n\nTake a small grid, say 1x1. Then following the same logic:\n\nTotal colorings: 2 (row) \u00d7 2 (column) = 4.\n\nThe two cases where grid is empty are:\n\n- Row is W, column is B,\n\n- Row is B, column is W.\n\nThus, subtract 2, giving 2 valid arrangements: the fully W and fully B. Which is correct because in a 1x1 grid, the maximal arrangements are either having the single cell white or black, since adding another chip isn't possible. The empty grid is not maximal. So 2 = 4-2. So the formula works here.\n\nAnother test case: 2x2 grid.\n\nTotal colorings: 2^2 * 2^2 = 16.\n\nSubtract 2 cases where it's empty: row all W and column all B, or vice versa. So 14.\n\nLet's enumerate:\n\nPossible maximal arrangements:\n\nAll white: 1.\n\nAll black: 1.\n\nHalf white and half black? For example, rows [W,W], columns [B,B]. This makes the grid empty. Which is subtracted.\n\nOther arrangements:\n\nSuppose rows [W,B], columns [W,B].\n\nThen:\n\n- W row and W column: cell (1,1) is W.\n\n- B row and B column: cell (2,2) is B.\n\n- The other cells are empty (since row W and column B, etc.). This is a valid maximal arrangement with two chips.\n\nThere are many such possibilities. The total should be 14. Seems plausible.\n\nTherefore, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, for the 5x5 grid, the answer is 2^10 - 2 = 1024 - 2 = 1022.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that there are 25 white and 25 black chips available. But in our count, we are counting all possible color assignments, including those that use more than 25 of one color? Wait, no.\n\nWait, in a 5x5 grid, the maximum number of white chips is 5*5=25 (if all rows and columns are W). Similarly for black. Since we have exactly 25 of each, any arrangement that uses up to 25 of each is allowed. Since our count includes all such arrangements (as the maximum is exactly 25), there's no overcounting.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1022.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. The problem states \"the number of ways to place some of these chips\". Since the chips are indistinct except for color, each arrangement is uniquely determined by which cells are white, black, or empty, under the constraints. The count via row and column colorings is correct because each such coloring gives a unique arrangement, and we have to exclude only the two empty grids.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1022. But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming all rows and columns must be colored. Let me re-express the maximality condition.\n\nSuppose there exists an uncolored row (i.e., a row not colored W or B). Then, for maximality, every column must be colored W or B, so that the uncolored row's cells are in columns that are already colored, preventing adding a chip there. Similarly, an uncolored column requires all rows to be colored.\n\nHowever, an arrangement can have some uncolored rows or columns as long as the above is satisfied. For example, suppose:\n\n- All rows except row 1 are colored W,\n\n- All columns except column 1 are colored W.\n\nThen row 1 is uncolored, but every column except column 1 is colored W. Therefore, in row 1, columns 2-5 are in W columns, so they must be W (since the column is W). But row 1 is uncolored, so it can have chips as long as they're all the same color. However, columns 2-5 require those cells to be W, so row 1 must be W. Contradiction, so row 1 cannot be uncolored.\n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Alternatively, if there's an uncolored row, then all columns must be colored, so that every cell in the uncolored row is in a colored column. Therefore, the uncolored row can have chips only if all its cells are of the column's color. But since the row is uncolored, it can have any color as long as it's consistent. However, since the columns are colored, each cell in the uncolored row must match the column's color. Therefore, the uncolored row's cells must be the same as their respective columns' colors. But since the row is uncolored, it can have those chips as long as they are consistent. However, this doesn't violate the maximality because you can't add any more chips. Wait, but the problem requires that the arrangement is maximal, so you can't add any chips. However, in this case, the uncolored row could potentially have chips matching the column's colors, but since it's uncolored, it can choose to have those chips or not. Wait, no\u2014if the column is colored W, then its cells must be W if they are filled. The uncolored row can choose to have those cells filled with W or not. But to be maximal, they must be filled. Because otherwise, you could add a W chip there without conflict. Therefore, in fact, an uncolored row must have all its cells filled with the column's color wherever possible. But this requires that the row's cells are filled according to the columns' colors, but since the row is uncolored, it can have any color as long as it's consistent with the column.\n\nThis is getting too confusing, but given that the earlier analysis with the 1x1 and 2x2 grids works, and the logic that maximality requires all rows and columns to be colored (since otherwise you can add a chip in an uncolored row and column), then the count of 1022 is correct.\n\nWait, but in the example where rows are all W and columns all B, resulting in an empty grid, that's invalid, so subtract those two cases. Therefore, the final answer is 1022.\n\nHowever, the problem might have a different answer. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"each cell contains at most one chip\". So the empty grid is allowed in terms of cell count, but it's not maximal because you can add chips. Therefore, it's excluded.\n\nBut in the row and column coloring model, the only empty grids are the two cases where rows and columns are opposite colors. So subtracting those gives the correct count.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 1022. But I need to confirm once more.\n\nWait, another way: The number of ways to choose row colors (each row W or B) is 2^5, and column colors 2^5, so 1024 total colorings. Each coloring corresponds to a unique arrangement. The only invalid ones are the two where it's entirely empty, so subtract those, giving 1022. Yes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1022}.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of maximal arrangements of chips on a 5\u00d75 grid where each row and column must be monochromatic or empty, and no additional chips can be placed without violating these conditions. \n\nKey steps:\n1. **Maximality Condition**: An arrangement is maximal if every empty cell is blocked by conflicting row or column colors, preventing any further chip placement.\n2. **Row and Column Coloring**: Each row and column must be colored either white (W), black (B), or uncolored.

      "full_content": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. Hmm, so we have a 5x5 grid, and we need to place some white and black chips in the cells. The conditions are: each cell can have at most one chip; all chips in the same row or column must be the same color; and the arrangement has to be maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips without breaking the rules. The chips are indistinct except for their color. We need to count the number of such arrangements.\n\nFirst, let me parse the constraints again. Each row must have chips of the same color, and each column must also have chips of the same color. Additionally, the arrangement is maximal, so adding any chip would violate the color conditions or the one-chip-per-cell rule. Since the chips are indistinct except for color, the problem is about choosing which rows and columns are colored, and with which color, such that the intersection of a colored row and column must also have a chip of the same color. Wait, actually, that might complicate things. Let me think step by step.\n\nLet me start by considering the constraints for rows and columns. Since every row must have chips of the same color, each row can be either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column must be all white, all black, or empty. However, the color of a row and column must be consistent where they intersect. For instance, if a row is colored white, then every column that intersects it must either be white or empty. Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose a row is colored white. That means all the chips in that row are white. Similarly, a column colored black would have all its chips black. However, where a white row and black column intersect, that cell must have a chip of both colors, which is impossible. Therefore, such a configuration is invalid. Therefore, the colors of the rows and columns must be compatible.\n\nTherefore, the rows and columns must be colored in such a way that if a row is colored, say, white, then all the columns that intersect it must either be white or not colored (i.e., empty). Wait, but actually, if a column is colored black, then it can't have any white chips. But the row is white, so the cell at their intersection would have a white chip, conflicting with the column's black requirement. Therefore, such an intersection is forbidden, so a white row cannot intersect a black column. Therefore, the rows and columns must all be the same color, or empty?\n\nHmm, maybe not exactly. Let me think of this as a matrix where each row is assigned a color (or none), and each column is assigned a color (or none). The intersection of a row and column must be a chip of the color common to both. If a row is white and a column is white, then the cell is white. If a row is white and the column is black, that's impossible, so that cell cannot have a chip. Similarly, if a row is white and the column is unassigned (empty), then the column's color is not set, so the row's white color is allowed, so the cell can have a white chip? Wait, no. Wait, the column being \"empty\" would mean that the column has no chips, so the cell in that column cannot have a chip. Wait, actually, maybe we need to formalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the way to model this is that for each row, we choose a color (white, black, or none), and similarly for each column. However, the color assignments must satisfy that for every cell (i,j), if the row i is colored (say, color R) and column j is colored (color C), then R must equal C, and the cell must have a chip of that color. If either the row or column is uncolored (i.e., not chosen to have chips), then the cell must be empty. Wait, but that might not be exactly the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the color of the row and column must agree wherever they both have chips. Wait, perhaps another approach is better.\n\nLet me think of the grid as a matrix where each cell (i,j) can be either empty, white, or black. The constraints are:\n\n1. In any row, all non-empty cells must be the same color.\n\n2. In any column, all non-empty cells must be the same color.\n\n3. The arrangement is maximal: you can't add any more chips without violating the first two conditions.\n\nSo, the maximality condition implies that for every cell that is empty, if you try to place a chip there, either its row or column would have a different color already. So, every empty cell must be such that either its row already has chips of one color, and the column has a different color, making it impossible to add a chip there. Alternatively, if a row is empty and a column is empty, you could add a chip there, but then you have to make sure that the color is consistent with the row and column. Wait, but since the row and column are empty, you could choose either color? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximality condition means that for every empty cell, at least one of the following is true: the row already has chips of a certain color, so you can't add a different color; or the column already has chips of a different color, so you can't add a chip there. Alternatively, if both the row and column are empty, then you could add a chip there, so the arrangement wouldn't be maximal. Therefore, to be maximal, every empty cell must be in a row that's already been assigned a color or in a column that's already been assigned a color (possibly a different one), but such that you can't add a chip there without conflicting with the row or column's color.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe another approach is better. Let me think in terms of selecting a subset of rows and columns to color, with colors, such that the colored rows and columns form a \"grid\" where the intersections are colored consistently. Wait, maybe the problem reduces to choosing a set of rows and columns, each assigned a color, such that all intersections of those rows and columns are colored with that color, and the rest are empty. But with the condition that you can't add any more chips. So, to maximize, you have to have that every row not fully colored must have at least one column that is colored with a conflicting color, or vice versa?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the arrangement can be thought of as choosing for each row a color or none, and similarly for each column, such that whenever a row and column are both colored, their colors must agree. Then the chips are placed at the intersections where the row and column are both colored. But in that case, the color of the cell is the color of the row (and column). However, this would mean that all the colored cells in a row are of the same color as the row, and similarly for columns. But then the problem's first two conditions are satisfied. Then, the maximality condition would require that for any uncolored row or column, if you try to color it, there is a conflict with an existing column or row. Hmm, perhaps.\n\nWait, let me see. Suppose we model the grid as follows: Let R be the set of rows that are colored (either white or black), and C be the set of columns that are colored (white or black). Each colored row has a color, say, for row i, color r_i (either W or B or uncolored?), wait no, actually if it's colored, it must be assigned a color. Wait, perhaps better: Each row is either uncolored (so no chips) or colored white or black. Similarly for each column. But then, the color assignments must be such that for any row i and column j, if row i is colored (say, color R) and column j is colored (color C), then R must equal C. Otherwise, the cell (i,j) would have conflicting colors. But since the cell can have at most one chip, this is impossible, so such a configuration is invalid. Therefore, the assignments must be such that all colored rows and columns have the same color? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the colors of the rows and columns must be such that all colored rows have the same color, and all colored columns have the same color, but those two colors must be the same?\n\nWait, that might be too restrictive. Alternatively, perhaps all the colored rows must be of one color, say white, and all colored columns must be of that same color, or uncolored? Hmm, maybe I need to think of this as follows:\n\nSuppose we choose a subset of rows to color white, another subset to color black, and the remaining rows are uncolored. Similarly for columns. However, the constraints are that if a row is colored white and a column is colored black, then their intersection cell cannot have a chip. But since both the row and column are colored, they must have chips in their respective cells, but the intersection can only have one color. Therefore, such a combination is forbidden. Therefore, all colored rows must be of the same color as all colored columns. Wait, but that might not necessarily be the case. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only valid colorings are those where all colored rows have the same color, and all colored columns have the same color, and the row color must equal the column color. Because otherwise, if there's a row colored white and a column colored black, their intersection is a conflict. Therefore, the only way to have both colored rows and columns is if they are all the same color. Alternatively, you can have all colored rows as white and no colored columns, or all colored columns as black and no colored rows, etc. Hmm, perhaps that's the case.\n\nWait, so maybe the entire arrangement can be characterized by choosing a color (W or B or neither), a set of rows to be colored with that color, and a set of columns to be colored with that color. Then, the intersection of these rows and columns will have chips of that color, and the rest of the cells in the rows and columns must also have chips? Wait, no, if a row is colored white, then all its cells must be white, but if the column is uncolored, then the column can have cells outside the colored rows as empty. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nPerhaps an example would help. Let me try with a smaller grid, say 2x2, to see if I can get the idea.\n\nSuppose in a 2x2 grid. Let's say I choose row 1 to be white, and column 1 to be white. Then cell (1,1) is white, and the rest of row 1 must be white (so cell (1,2) is white), and the rest of column 1 must be white (so cell (2,1) is white). But then, column 2 is not colored, so cell (2,2) can be empty or can it? Wait, since column 2 is uncolored, but row 2 is uncolored, so could we place a chip there? Wait, according to the maximality condition, the arrangement must be such that you can't add any more chips. If cell (2,2) is empty, then since neither its row nor column is colored, we could add a chip there of any color, which would violate the maximality. Therefore, such a configuration (rows 1 white, column 1 white) would not be maximal because you can still add a chip in (2,2). Therefore, to be maximal, we need that any uncolored row or column must intersect with a colored column or row of a different color, making it impossible to add a chip.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal condition requires that every empty cell is in a row that has chips of one color and a column that has chips of a different color. Therefore, you can't add a chip there without conflicting. So for the 2x2 example, if I have row 1 as white and column 1 as white, then cell (2,2) is in row 2 (uncolored) and column 2 (uncolored). Since neither is colored, you can add a chip there, so that configuration isn't maximal. To make it maximal, you have to color either row 2 or column 2, but if you color row 2 as white, then column 2 must also be white (since the intersection (2,2) would need to be white). Alternatively, if you color column 2 as white, same thing. Alternatively, you could color row 2 as black, but then column 2 must be black, but then the intersection (2,2) would be black. However, the existing column 1 is white, so cell (2,1) would have to be white (from column 1) but row 2 is black? Wait, no, that would conflict. So if row 2 is colored black, then column 1, which is white, would have cell (2,1) needing to be both white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, you can't have row 2 colored black if column 1 is white.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the key idea is that the set of colored rows and columns must form a \"rectangle\" of a single color. For example, if I choose some rows and columns to be white, their intersection forms a rectangle where all those cells are white. Similarly, maybe another set for black, but they can't overlap. Wait, but the problem allows for multiple colors as long as the rows and columns are consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire arrangement must be a single monochromatic rectangle? No, that might not be necessary. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the arrangement can be partitioned into a white rectangle and a black rectangle, but they can't overlap? Not sure.\n\nWait, let me think again of the problem's conditions:\n\nEach row must have all chips of the same color (or none), same for each column. The arrangement is maximal, so you can't add any more chips without violating these conditions.\n\nSo, to satisfy maximality, every empty cell must be such that either its row already has some chips (so you can't add a different color) or its column already has some chips of a different color, making it impossible to add a chip there.\n\nAlternatively, if a cell is empty, then either:\n\n- Its row has chips of one color, so you can't add a chip of a different color there, but you could add the same color? Wait, but if the row is already that color, then adding another chip of the same color is allowed, but the column might restrict it. Hmm, perhaps I need to formalize this.\n\nSuppose a cell (i,j) is empty. Then:\n\n- If row i has chips of color R, then to add a chip at (i,j), it must be color R. However, column j must then also allow that color. So if column j has chips of a different color, then you can't add a chip there. If column j is empty, then you could add a chip of color R there, which would violate the maximality unless column j is also set to R.\n\nAlternatively, the maximality condition requires that for every empty cell (i,j), either:\n\n- Row i has chips of some color, and column j has chips of a different color, so you can't add any chip there (since it would have to be both colors), or\n\n- Row i is empty and column j is empty, but then you could add a chip of any color, so that's not allowed. Therefore, such cells must not exist in a maximal arrangement.\n\nTherefore, in a maximal arrangement, every empty cell must be in a row that has chips of one color and a column that has chips of a different color. Therefore, there can be no empty cells that are in an empty row and empty column.\n\nTherefore, the arrangement must be such that every empty cell is \"blocked\" by either its row or column having chips of a conflicting color. So, this suggests that the colored rows and columns form a kind of \"cross\" or \"grid\" that partitions the grid such that any uncolored cell is adjacent (in row or column) to a colored row or column of a different color.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the arrangement is determined by choosing two subsets of rows and columns, one for white and one for black, such that the white rows and columns form a rectangle (all intersections are white), and the black rows and columns form another rectangle, and these two rectangles don't overlap? Wait, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire grid is partitioned into white and black regions where each region is a rectangle, but they can't overlap. Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me try to think of the problem in terms of selecting for each row a color or none, and similarly for each column, such that whenever a row and column are both colored, their colors agree. Additionally, the arrangement must be maximal, so that every uncolored row or column intersects a colored column or row of a different color, preventing the addition of a chip.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximal condition requires that every uncolored row has at least one column that's colored with some color (so you can't add a chip to that row without conflicting with that column's color), and every uncolored column has at least one row that's colored with a different color? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach. Let me consider that the grid must be covered by some white and black rectangles such that they don't overlap (since a cell can have only one chip), and they are maximal. Wait, but maybe the entire arrangement can be considered as choosing a set of rows for white, columns for white, rows for black, columns for black, with certain constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is analogous to a bipartition of the grid into white and black regions, where each region is a rectangle, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of it as a matrix where each row is assigned a color (W, B, or blank) and each column is assigned a color (W, B, or blank). The cell (i,j) is colored with the color common to row i and column j, if they are the same, otherwise it's blank. However, the maximality condition requires that you can't change any row or column's color to non-blank without causing a conflict. Wait, maybe not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, here's a different way. Since every row must be monochromatic or empty, and every column must be monochromatic or empty, the entire grid can be partitioned into some rows and columns with colors such that the intersections are consistent.\n\nPerhaps the key is to choose for each row a color (W, B, or none) and for each column a color (W, B, or none), such that for any row and column, if they are both colored, their colors must match. Additionally, the arrangement must be maximal, so you can't add any color to an uncolored row or column without conflicting with an existing color.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nLet R be the set of rows colored W, B, or uncolored (let's denote uncolored as 0). Similarly, C for columns. The constraints are:\n\n1. For any row i and column j, if row i is colored (say, color r_i) and column j is colored (color c_j), then r_i must equal c_j.\n\n2. The arrangement is maximal, so for any uncolored row i, there exists at least one column j that is colored with some color different from any color that could be assigned to row i without conflict. Wait, perhaps more precisely, if you try to color an uncolored row i with color r, then there must exist a column j such that column j is colored with a different color than r, so that assigning row i to r would conflict with column j at (i,j).\n\nSimilarly for columns. Alternatively, the maximality condition requires that for every uncolored row, there exists a column that is already colored with some color, so that if you try to color the row, you can't do it without conflicting with that column's color. Similarly, every uncolored column must have a row already colored with a conflicting color.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire set of colored rows and columns form a \"blocking set\" such that any uncolored row is adjacent (in terms of columns) to a colored column, and vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only way to have a maximal arrangement is to have all the colored rows and columns be of the same color, and they form a rectangle. For example, if you choose some rows to be white and some columns to be white, their intersection must be white, and the rest of the cells in those rows and columns must also be white. But then, if there are any uncolored rows or columns outside this rectangle, they can't have any chips because they would conflict with the existing colored rows or columns.\n\nWait, for instance, suppose I choose rows 1-3 to be white and columns 1-3 to be white. Then the intersection (the 3x3 grid) is white, and the rest of the cells in rows 1-3 and columns 1-3 must also be white? Wait, no. If rows 1-3 are white, then all cells in those rows must be white. Similarly, columns 1-3 being white would require all cells in those columns to be white. Therefore, the entire intersection (rows 1-3 and columns 1-3) would be white, but also, the rest of the cells in rows 1-3 (columns 4-5) must be white, and the rest of the cells in columns 1-3 (rows 4-5) must be white. Therefore, actually, the entire first three rows and first three columns would form a 3x5 and 5x3 area, but their intersection is a 3x3. Wait, no, actually, if rows 1-3 are white, then all cells in those rows must be white, so columns 4 and 5 in rows 1-3 are also white. Similarly, columns 1-3 being white would require all their cells to be white, so rows 4-5 in columns 1-3 must be white. Therefore, the entire grid up to rows 1-3 and columns 1-3 would be white, but rows 4-5 and columns 4-5 would be white too? Wait, no, only the rows and columns selected as white would have all their cells white. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, actually, if a row is colored white, then every cell in that row must be white. Similarly, a column colored white must have every cell in it white. Therefore, if you have a row and a column both colored white, their intersection is white, but the entire row and column must be white. So, if you have multiple rows and columns colored white, their union must form a rectangle? Wait, no. For example, if rows 1 and 2 are white, and columns 1 and 2 are white, then all of rows 1 and 2 are white (so columns 3-5 in those rows are also white), and columns 1 and 2 are white (so rows 3-5 in those columns are white). Therefore, the entire grid would have white in rows 1-2 and columns 1-2, but also, all of rows 1-2 (so columns 3-5 are white), and all of columns 1-2 (so rows 3-5 are white). Therefore, actually, the entire grid would be white except for the intersection of rows 3-5 and columns 3-5. Wait, but rows 3-5 in columns 1-2 are white because columns 1-2 are white. Similarly, columns 3-5 in rows 1-2 are white because rows 1-2 are white. Therefore, the only cells not necessarily white would be rows 3-5 and columns 3-5. Wait, no, actually, if columns 3-5 are not colored, then their cells in rows 3-5 can be anything, but since rows 3-5 are not colored (assuming we only colored rows 1-2), then those cells can be empty or colored, but since the columns are uncolored, but the rows are uncolored, but they can't have chips because otherwise, you could add a chip there. Wait, this is getting too tangled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only way to have a maximal arrangement is to have all colored rows and columns of the same color, forming a rectangle, and the rest of the grid must be blocked by either rows or columns of that color. For example, suppose we choose a rectangle of size m x n, colored white. Then, all rows in that rectangle are white rows, and all columns in that rectangle are white columns. The remaining rows outside must have at least one white column intersecting them, so they can't be colored black or white without conflict. Similarly, remaining columns must have at least one white row. Therefore, that rectangle is maximal. Similarly, you could have a black rectangle, or both a white and a black rectangle, but they can't overlap.\n\nWait, but if you have both white and black regions, their rectangles can't overlap. For instance, suppose there is a white rectangle in the top-left corner and a black rectangle in the bottom-right corner. But then, the overlapping area would have to be both colors, which is impossible. So they must be disjoint.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire grid can be partitioned into a white rectangle and a black rectangle, separated by some uncolored rows or columns. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose in a 5x5 grid, we have a white rectangle occupying the first 3 rows and first 3 columns. So rows 1-3 are white, columns 1-3 are white. Then, the rest of the grid (rows 4-5 and columns 4-5) could potentially have a black rectangle? But columns 4-5 are uncolored, so if we color rows 4-5 as black, then columns 4-5 must also be black. However, columns 4-5 in rows 1-3 (which are white rows) would then have to be both white (from the row) and black (from the column), which is impossible. Therefore, you can't have both a white and black rectangle unless they are separated by uncolored rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire grid can be divided into a white block and a black block separated by a border of uncolored rows and columns. For instance, suppose the first two rows are white, the next two rows are black, and the last row is uncolored. Similarly for columns. But this might not satisfy the column constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal arrangements can be categorized into three types:\n\n1. All chips are white, forming a rectangle of some size, and the rest are blocked by the white rows/columns.\n\n2. All chips are black, similarly.\n\n3. A combination of white and black regions, but arranged so they don't interfere.\n\nBut maybe the combination is not possible due to overlapping constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only maximal arrangements are those where all the chips are of a single color, forming a rectangle, or the entire grid is filled with one color, or something like that. But since the problem allows for both colors, there must be arrangements with both colors.\n\nWait, let me consider an example with both colors. Suppose we have a white rectangle in the top-left 3x3 and a black rectangle in the bottom-right 2x2. But the columns and rows separating them must be uncolored. However, the rows and columns between the white and black regions would have to be uncolored. Let's see:\n\nSuppose rows 1-3 are white, columns 1-3 are white. Then rows 4-5 and columns 4-5 are uncolored. Now, if we want to have a black rectangle in rows 4-5 and columns 4-5, then those rows and columns must be colored black. However, column 4 is part of the white columns (columns 1-3) no, columns 4-5 are uncolored. Wait, if columns 4-5 are uncolored, then we can color them black along with rows 4-5. But then, the intersection of rows 4-5 and columns 4-5 would be black. However, the problem is that column 4 is uncolored in the white area (rows 1-3). Since column 4 is now colored black, the cells in rows 1-3, column 4 must be black? But those rows are white, so they can only have white chips. Therefore, that's a conflict. Therefore, such an arrangement is impossible.\n\nTherefore, perhaps you cannot have both white and black regions unless they are separated by at least one uncolored row and column. For example, a white rectangle in the top-left and a black rectangle in the bottom-right, separated by an empty row and column in the middle. Let's see:\n\nSuppose rows 1-2 are white, columns 1-2 are white. Then, rows 4-5 are black, columns 4-5 are black. The third row and third column are uncolored (so all cells in row 3 and column 3 are empty). Now, check the intersections:\n\n- In rows 1-2 and columns 1-2: white chips.\n\n- In rows 4-5 and columns 4-5: black chips.\n\n- The cells in rows 1-2, columns 3-5 (except column 3 is uncolored) would be in rows that are white but columns that are either uncolored (column 3) or black (columns 4-5). Since the rows are white, those columns must be white to have chips, but columns 4-5 are black, so those cells must be empty. Similarly, columns 1-2 in rows 3-5 would be in columns white but rows black or uncolored. Since rows 4-5 are black, their intersection with columns 1-2 must be black, but columns 1-2 are white, so those cells must be empty. The central cell (3,3) is empty because both row and column are uncolored. The cells in row 3 (uncolored) and columns 4-5 (black) would be in columns that are black, so they must be black, but row 3 is uncolored. Wait, no\u2014if a column is colored black, then all its cells must be black. So column 4, which is black, requires all cells in column 4 to be black. But row 3, column 4 is in an uncolored row, so can it have a black chip? Since the column is black, yes, it must have a black chip. However, the row 3 is uncolored, so it can have chips as long as they are all the same color. But since column 4 requires it to be black, then row 3, column 4 must be black, but row 3 is uncolored, so it can have a black chip there. Wait, but if row 3 is uncolored, does that mean it can have any color? No, actually, if a row is uncolored, it means it has no chips. Wait, hold on. This is a critical point.\n\nIf a row is uncolored, does that mean it cannot have any chips, or can it have chips as long as they are all the same color? Wait, according to the problem's first condition: \"each cell contains at most one chip\", and \"all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\". So, if a row is uncolored, it can have some chips, but they must all be the same color. Wait, no, actually, the row can have no chips (so uncolored), or have chips all of one color. Similarly, a column can be uncolored (no chips) or have chips all of one color.\n\nTherefore, in my previous example, column 4 is colored black, so all cells in column 4 must be black. Therefore, row 3, column 4 must be black. But row 3 is uncolored, so it can have chips as long as they are all black. Since column 4 requires it to be black, that's okay. Therefore, row 3 would have a black chip in column 4 and column 5 (since column 5 is also black). However, column 3 is uncolored, so row 3, column 3 must be empty. Similarly, column 3, row 4 must be in a black row, so column 3 is uncolored, so the cell can be black? Wait, column 3 is uncolored, so it can have chips, but they must be all the same color. Since row 4 is black, the cell (4,3) must be black, which is allowed as column 3 can be black. Wait, but if column 3 has a black chip in (4,3) and (5,3), but also maybe in row 3, column 3 is empty. Wait, but column 3 is uncolored, so it can have chips of any single color. Since some cells in column 3 (like (4,3) and (5,3)) are black, then column 3 must be entirely black? No, because if column 3 has some black chips and some empty cells, that's allowed as long as the non-empty chips are all the same color. Wait, but the problem says \"all chips in the same column have the same color\". So if column 3 has a black chip in row 4, then any other chips in column 3 must also be black. But since column 3 is uncolored, it can have chips of a single color. Therefore, column 3 can be considered as a black column because it has some black chips, but since it's unassigned, it's allowed? Wait, no. If a column has chips, they must all be the same color, but the column itself isn't necessarily \"assigned\" a color. Wait, the problem doesn't mention assigning colors to rows or columns, just that in any row or column, the chips must be the same color.\n\nTherefore, in this example, column 3 has a black chip in row 4 and 5, so it must be a black column. But we initially considered it uncolored. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, my previous assumption was wrong.\n\nAh, here's the key: If a column has any chips, they must all be the same color. Therefore, column 3 in the previous example, since it has chips in rows 4 and 5 (black), must be a black column. Therefore, we can't have it as uncolored. Therefore, the column must be considered as black, which would require all its cells to be black or empty. Therefore, the cell (3,3) must be black as well, but row 3 is uncolored. Since column 3 is black, cell (3,3) must be black. However, row 3 has a black chip at (3,3) and potentially others. But row 3 is uncolored, so it can have chips as long as they're all the same color. Since (3,3) is black, then any chips in row 3 must be black. However, column 1 is white, so cell (3,1) would have to be white if it's a chip, but column 1 is white, so it can be a white chip. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe my example is invalid because of these constraints.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the only way to have both colors is to have them separated by an uncolored row or column. Let me try again.\n\nSuppose we have the first two rows as white (so all their columns must be white where they intersect), and the last two rows as black, with a central row (row 3) uncolored. Similarly, columns 1-2 as white and columns 4-5 as black, with column 3 uncolored. Then:\n\n- Rows 1-2 are white: all their cells must be white. Therefore, columns 1-2, 3-5 in these rows are white.\n\n- Columns 1-2 are white: all their cells must be white. Therefore, rows 1-5 in columns 1-2 are white.\n\n- Rows 4-5 are black: all their cells must be black. Therefore, columns 1-5 in rows 4-5 are black.\n\n- Columns 4-5 are black: all their cells must be black. Therefore, rows 1-5 in columns 4-5 are black.\n\nBut now, the intersection of rows 1-2 and columns 4-5 must be both white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, this arrangement is invalid.\n\nTherefore, maybe having both colors requires that their regions don't overlap in rows or columns. For instance, white in the top-left and black in the bottom-right, separated by an empty row and column.\n\nLet me try:\n\n- Rows 1-2 and columns 1-2 are white. So the intersection forms a white rectangle.\n\n- Rows 4-5 and columns 4-5 are black. Their intersection forms a black rectangle.\n\n- Rows 3 and columns 3 are uncolored.\n\nNow check:\n\n- For rows 1-2: all their cells must be white. So columns 1-2, 3-5 in these rows are white. Wait, but columns 3-5 in rows 1-2 are in uncolored columns (column 3) or columns 4-5 (which are black? No, columns 4-5 are part of the black region in rows 4-5. Wait, columns 4-5 are assigned to black because rows 4-5 are black. Therefore, columns 4-5 must be black. Therefore, in rows 1-2, columns 4-5 must be black, but rows 1-2 are white. Contradiction again.\n\nHmm, this seems really tricky. Maybe the only way to have both colors is to have them in separate rows and columns with no overlap. For example:\n\n- All white chips are in rows 1-2 and columns 1-2.\n\n- All black chips are in rows 3-5 and columns 3-5.\n\nBut then, columns 1-2 in rows 3-5 must be black? No, columns 1-2 are white (because rows 1-2 are white and those columns must be white). Therefore, columns 1-2 must be white, so their cells in rows 3-5 must also be white, conflicting with the black chips there. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the white and black regions are in separate rows and columns with a buffer of uncolored rows and columns between them.\n\nSuppose:\n\n- White region: rows 1-2, columns 1-2.\n\n- Black region: rows 4-5, columns 4-5.\n\n- Rows 3 and columns 3 are uncolored.\n\nThen:\n\n- In rows 1-2, all cells must be white (since those rows are white). Therefore, columns 1-2 in those rows are white, and columns 3-5 must also be white? Wait, no. Wait, if a row is white, all its cells must be white, so yes, the entire row 1 and 2 must be white. That means columns 3-5 in rows 1-2 are white. But columns 3-5 in those rows are part of columns 3-5. Columns 3 is uncolored, so column 3 can have chips as long as they are all the same color. Since rows 1-2 have white chips in column 3, column 3 must be white. Therefore, columns 3 must be white, which would conflict with the black region in columns 4-5. Wait, columns 4-5 are part of the black region in rows 4-5, so columns 4-5 must be black. Therefore, column 3 is white, column 4-5 are black, so in row 3 (uncolored), column 3 must be white (since column 3 is white) and columns 4-5 must be black (since columns 4-5 are black). However, row 3 is uncolored, so it can have chips as long as they are all the same color. But column 3 requires white and column 4-5 require black, so the row can't have both, so row 3 must be empty. That's okay.\n\nSimilarly, columns 1-2 are white (due to rows 1-2), so in rows 3-5, columns 1-2 must be white. But rows 4-5 are black, so their cells in columns 1-2 must be black. Contradiction again. Because rows 4-5 are black, so their entire rows must be black, conflicting with columns 1-2 being white.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe it's impossible to have both colors in a maximal arrangement? Or maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the only maximal arrangements are those where all the chips are of a single color, forming a rectangle, or the entire grid is filled with one color, or perhaps some other configuration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal arrangements correspond to choosing a rectangle of white chips and a rectangle of black chips, but they can't overlap, and they are as large as possible. But I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the problem again: the arrangement must be maximal, so you can't add any chip. Therefore, for every empty cell, at least one of the following is true:\n\n- The cell's row already has chips of one color, so you can't add a different color there, but you could add the same color. Wait, but if the row is already that color, then you can add the same color unless the column restricts it.\n\nWait, actually, if a row is already white, then all its cells must be white. So you can't add a black chip there, but you could add a white chip only if the column allows it. However, if the column is uncolored, then you could add a white chip there, which would extend the column's color to white. But since the arrangement is maximal, you can't do that. Therefore, the column must already be white or black.\n\nWait, perhaps for every empty cell (i,j), either:\n\n- The row i has chips of color W, so you can't add a B chip there. But you could add a W chip only if column j is uncolored or also W. But since it's empty, column j must already be colored B or uncolored? No, this is getting too tangled.\n\nAlternatively, the maximal condition implies that for every empty cell (i,j), the row i has chips of some color and the column j has chips of a different color. Therefore, you can't add any chip there because it would have to be both colors. Therefore, every empty cell is \"blocked\" by a row and column of different colors.\n\nTherefore, in such a case, the entire grid can be divided into three regions:\n\n1. Cells where the row and column are both colored the same (so they have a chip).\n\n2. Cells where the row and column are colored differently (so they are empty).\n\n3. Cells where either the row or column is uncolored, but then they must be blocked by another conflicting color.\n\nWait, actually, if a cell is in an uncolored row and uncolored column, then you could add a chip there of any color, so the arrangement isn't maximal. Therefore, such cells cannot exist. Therefore, every empty cell must be in a row that is colored and a column that is colored with a different color.\n\nTherefore, the entire grid can be partitioned into four regions:\n\n- Rows colored W and columns colored W: these cells have W chips.\n\n- Rows colored W and columns colored B: these cells are empty.\n\n- Rows colored B and columns colored W: empty.\n\n- Rows colored B and columns colored B: have B chips.\n\nAdditionally, there are rows and columns that are uncolored. But any uncolored row must be such that every column it intersects is either colored W or B, so that you can't add a chip to the row (since the columns are already colored, conflicting with the row's potential color). Similarly for uncolored columns.\n\nWait, this seems promising. Let me formalize this:\n\nSuppose we choose a subset of rows to color W, a subset to color B, and the remaining rows are uncolored. Similarly, choose a subset of columns to color W, a subset to color B, and the remaining columns are uncolored.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\n1. For any row colored W, all its cells must be W where the column is also colored W or uncolored? Wait no, actually, if a row is colored W, then all its cells must be W if the column allows it, but actually, more strictly, if a row is colored W, then any column that intersects it must either be uncolored (so the cell can be W) or also colored W (so the cell is W). If a column is colored B, then the intersection cell would have to be both W and B, which is impossible, so such a row and column cannot both be colored.\n\nTherefore, the rows and columns must be colored such that all W rows are only intersecting W columns or uncolored columns, and all B rows are only intersecting B columns or uncolored columns.\n\nWait, actually, more precisely, the coloring must satisfy that if a row is colored W, then all columns that are colored B must not intersect it. Similarly, if a column is colored B, then all rows colored W must not intersect it. Therefore, the W rows and B columns must be disjoint in their indices.\n\nTherefore, the set of W rows and B columns must form a partition of the grid's rows and columns in such a way that they don't intersect. Similarly for B rows and W columns.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a bipartition of rows and columns into W, B, or uncolored, with the constraints that W rows can only intersect W columns or uncolored columns, and similarly for B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key idea is that the W rows and W columns form a rectangle (their intersection is W chips), and similarly the B rows and B columns form another rectangle, and these two rectangles don't overlap. Additionally, the uncolored rows and columns must be arranged such that they are \"blocked\" by the colored rows or columns of opposite color.\n\nThis is getting too abstract. Maybe there's a better mathematical way to model this.\n\nLet me consider that the grid can be divided into four regions based on the colors of rows and columns:\n\nLet R_W be the set of rows colored W,\n\nR_B be the set of rows colored B,\n\nC_W be the set of columns colored W,\n\nC_B be the set of columns colored B,\n\nand the remaining rows and columns are uncolored.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\n- For any row in R_W, it can only intersect columns in C_W or uncolored columns. But if it intersects a column in C_B, that would require the cell to be both W and B, which is impossible. Therefore, R_W must be disjoint from C_B in the sense that no row in R_W intersects a column in C_B. Wait, actually, rows and columns are sets, so the intersection is their indices. Therefore, the column indices in C_B must not be in the columns of rows R_W. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the columns in C_B cannot be in the columns that are in C_W or uncolored? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, more precisely, if a row is in R_W, then any column that is in C_B cannot have an intersection with that row because the cell would need to be both W and B. Therefore, all columns in C_B must be excluded from the columns that intersect with R_W rows. Wait, this is getting too tangled.\n\nPerhaps another way: To avoid conflicts between colored rows and columns, the sets R_W and C_B must be disjoint in the sense that no row in R_W can have a column in C_B. That is, the columns in C_B must not be in the columns of R_W? Not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, the columns in C_B must not be in the columns that are in C_W? No, that's not necessarily.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of it this way: If a column is colored B, then no row colored W can have that column, because their intersection would require the cell to be both W and B. Therefore, any column in C_B cannot be in any row in R_W. So the columns in C_B must be a subset of the columns not covered by any rows in R_W? Not exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps the columns in C_B must be disjoint from the rows in R_W? Not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, if a column is in C_B, then any row in R_W cannot have that column. Therefore, the columns in C_B must be a subset of the columns not covered by any rows in R_W? Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe it's better to think in terms of choosing for each row a color (W, B, or uncolored) and similarly for each column, such that whenever a row is colored W and a column is colored B, they cannot intersect (i.e., their indices don't overlap). Wait, but rows and columns are in a grid, so every row and column intersect at exactly one cell. Therefore, if a row is colored W and a column is colored B, their intersection cell would have conflicting colors. Therefore, such a pairing is forbidden. Therefore, the set of W rows and B columns must be disjoint in the sense that no W row is paired with a B column.\n\nWait, perhaps more precisely, the sets R_W and C_B must be such that for any row in R_W and column in C_B, their intersection cell is not allowed, but since they must intersect, this is impossible. Therefore, to avoid this, either there are no W rows and B columns, or their intersections must somehow be blocked. Wait, but the only way to block it is to have the cell be empty, but since the row is W and column is B, they can't have a chip there, so it must be empty. But since the row is W, all its cells must be W except those in B columns. Wait, no, if a row is W, then all its cells must be W if the columns allow it, but if a column is B, then that cell can't be W. Therefore, such a cell must be empty. However, the row being W requires that all non-empty cells in the row are W, but the column being B requires that all non-empty cells in the column are B. Therefore, the cell at their intersection must be empty. But the row is W, so it can have other cells as W. Therefore, it's allowed as long as that particular cell is empty.\n\nWait, so actually, it's possible to have W rows and B columns as long as their intersections are empty. But for the arrangement to be maximal, those intersections must be empty and blocked by the conflicting colors.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the entire arrangement can be defined by choosing:\n\n- A set of W rows R_W,\n\n- A set of W columns C_W,\n\n- A set of B rows R_B,\n\n- A set of B columns C_B,\n\nsuch that:\n\n1. R_W and R_B are disjoint (a row can't be both W and B),\n\n2. C_W and C_B are disjoint,\n\n3. The intersection of R_W and C_B must be empty? Wait no, they can intersect, but their cells must be empty,\n\nWait, actually, the constraints are:\n\n- For any row in R_W, all its cells in columns not in C_B must be W, and cells in C_B must be empty.\n\nWait, no. If a row is in R_W, then all its non-empty cells must be W. The columns in C_B have their non-empty cells must be B. Therefore, the intersection cells between R_W rows and C_B columns must be empty, because otherwise, the cell would have to be both W and B.\n\nTherefore, for all i in R_W and j in C_B, the cell (i,j) must be empty. Similarly, for all i in R_B and j in C_W, the cell (i,j) must be empty.\n\nAdditionally, the remaining cells (outside these intersections) must be filled appropriately:\n\n- For a cell (i,j) where i is in R_W and j is in C_W: must be W.\n\n- For a cell (i,j) where i is in R_B and j is in C_B: must be B.\n\n- Cells where i is in R_W and j is uncolored (not in C_W or C_B): can be W (since the row is W and the column is uncolored, so the column can have W there).\n\nWait, but if the column is uncolored, it can have any color as long as it's consistent. However, since the row is W, the cell must be W. Therefore, those cells must be W.\n\nSimilarly, if a cell is in an uncolored row and a W column, it must be W.\n\nTherefore, all cells in R_W rows and columns not in C_B must be W. Similarly for B.\n\nBut also, the maximality condition requires that there are no empty cells that could be filled without conflict. Therefore, every empty cell must be in a W row and B column, or vice versa.\n\nThus, the empty cells are precisely those in R_W \u00d7 C_B and R_B \u00d7 C_W.\n\nTherefore, to ensure maximality, there should be no cells that are in an uncolored row and uncolored column, because such a cell could be filled with any color, violating maximality. Therefore, all uncolored rows and columns must be \"blocked\" by either W or B in such a way that their intersections are already blocked.\n\nTherefore, the set of uncolored rows (not in R_W or R_B) must have every column either in C_W or C_B. Similarly, the set of uncolored columns must have every row in R_W or R_B.\n\nWait, more precisely:\n\nFor any uncolored row (not in R_W or R_B), every column must be in either C_W or C_B. Otherwise, there exists a column not in C_W or C_B (i.e., uncolored), so the cell at (that row, that column) is in an uncolored row and uncolored column, which would allow adding a chip there, violating maximality.\n\nSimilarly, for any uncolored column (not in C_W or C_B), every row must be in R_W or R_B. Otherwise, there's a row not in R_W or R_B (uncolored), leading to an empty cell in an uncolored row and column.\n\nTherefore, the uncolored rows must be entirely covered by C_W \u222a C_B columns, and uncolored columns must be entirely covered by R_W \u222a R_B rows.\n\nThis is getting very formal, but perhaps we can model this as a matrix where:\n\n- The W region is R_W \u00d7 C_W,\n\n- The B region is R_B \u00d7 C_B,\n\n- The blocked regions are R_W \u00d7 C_B and R_B \u00d7 C_W,\n\n- The remaining regions (outside R_W \u222a R_B rows and C_W \u222a C_B columns) must be empty, but since they would form uncolored rows and columns, they must not exist.\n\nTherefore, the entire grid must be covered by R_W \u222a R_B rows and C_W \u222a C_B columns. Wait, but the uncolored rows and columns are those not in R_W \u222a R_B or C_W \u222a C_B, but they can't exist because of the maximality condition. Therefore, R_W \u222a R_B must cover all rows, and C_W \u222a C_B must cover all columns. Wait, no, that's too strict.\n\nWait, actually, the uncolored rows are those not in R_W or R_B, but for every such row, every column must be in C_W or C_B. Since columns not in C_W or C_B would allow an empty cell in an uncolored row and uncolored column. Therefore, to prevent that, the columns not in C_W or C_B must be nonexistent. Therefore, C_W \u222a C_B must cover all columns. Similarly, R_W \u222a R_B must cover all rows. Therefore, there are no uncolored rows or columns. Thus, every row is either W, B, or neither? Wait no, we just concluded that every row must be in R_W or R_B, because otherwise, there would be uncolored rows which require all columns to be covered, but columns are already covered. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf there exists an uncolored row (not in R_W or R_B), then to satisfy maximality, every column must be in C_W or C_B. Therefore, all columns are covered by C_W and C_B. Similarly, if there exists an uncolored column, then all rows must be in R_W or R_B.\n\nTherefore, either:\n\n- All rows are colored (R_W \u222a R_B = all rows),\n\n- Or all columns are colored (C_W \u222a C_B = all columns),\n\n- Or both.\n\nWait, actually, it's possible to have some uncolored rows and uncolored columns as long as the uncolored rows are only those for which all columns are colored, and uncolored columns are only those for which all rows are colored. But this would require that the set of uncolored rows and columns are such that their intersections are covered.\n\nThis is getting too involved. Perhaps it's better to model the problem as choosing for each row a color (W, B, or uncolored) and for each column similarly, with the constraints that:\n\n1. If a row is W, then all columns that are B cannot have that row's cells (they must be empty).\n\n2. Similarly for other color combinations.\n\n3. The arrangement is maximal, so there are no uncolored rows and columns with intersections that are unblocked.\n\nThis seems to be leading me towards the conclusion that the only maximal arrangements are those where all rows and columns are colored either W or B, with no overlaps between W and B regions. That is, the grid is partitioned into four regions:\n\n- W rows and W columns: W chips.\n\n- B rows and B columns: B chips.\n\n- W rows and B columns: empty.\n\n- B rows and W columns: empty.\n\nAdditionally, there can be no uncolored rows or columns, because if there were, they would have to be covered by the other colors, but since they are uncolored, their intersections with other uncolored rows/columns would allow adding chips, violating maximality.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing a subset of rows to be W, a subset to be B, and similarly for columns, such that the W rows and columns form a rectangle, and the B rows and columns form another rectangle, and the W and B regions don't overlap (i.e., the W rows don't intersect B columns and vice versa). Wait, but actually, the W rows and B columns can intersect, but those intersections must be empty, which they are by the above partition.\n\nTherefore, the total number of such arrangements is the number of ways to choose a subset of rows for W, a subset of rows for B (disjoint from W), a subset of columns for W, and a subset of columns for B (disjoint from W columns), such that the W rows and B columns don't have overlapping cells (which they don't need to avoid; their intersections are just empty). Wait, actually, the only constraint is that the W rows and B columns can coexist as long as their intersections are empty, but since those cells are just empty, it's allowed.\n\nWait, actually, the constraints are automatically satisfied as long as the row and column colors are chosen such that:\n\n- Any W row and W column intersection has a W chip.\n\n- Any B row and B column intersection has a B chip.\n\n- All other intersections (W row & B column, B row & W column) are empty.\n\n- All rows are either W, B, or uncolored, but to satisfy maximality, there can't be uncolored rows or columns. Therefore, all rows and columns must be colored either W or B.\n\nWait, but if all rows and columns are colored, then the maximality condition is satisfied because any empty cell is in a W row and B column (or vice versa), so you can't add a chip there. Additionally, there are no uncolored rows or columns to allow adding chips.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing for each row a color (W or B), and for each column a color (W or B), with the condition that whenever a row is colored W and a column is colored B, their intersection is empty (which it is, since it's just empty). The only constraint is that we can't have both a row and column uncolored, but since we're coloring all rows and columns, that's fine.\n\nHowever, we also have to consider that the chips are indistinct except for color. So the count is the number of color assignments to rows and columns (each row can be W or B, each column can be W or B), but with the caveat that the assignments must be such that the resulting grid's chips are placed according to the row and column colors, and the count considers indistinct chips of the same color.\n\nWait, but actually, each assignment of row and column colors defines a unique grid: for each cell, if the row is W and column is W, it's W; if row B and column B, it's B; otherwise, empty. Since the chips are indistinct except for color, this is counted as one arrangement per such assignment.\n\nHowever, we must also consider that some assignments may result in the same grid. For example, if all rows and columns are W, that's one arrangement. Similarly for all B. But since the problem says \"some of these chips\", meaning they can choose any subset, but under the constraints.\n\nWait, actually, each assignment of row and column colors gives a unique grid. Because the color of each cell is determined uniquely by the row and column colors. So the total number would be the number of ways to choose row colors (each row can be W or B, 2^5) multiplied by the number of column colorings (2^5), so 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024. But this is way too big, and also includes cases where, for example, all rows are W and all columns are W, resulting in a fully white grid. Similarly for all B.\n\nHowever, the problem requires that the arrangement is maximal. The above count includes all possible assignments, including those that are not maximal. For instance, if all rows and columns are W, then the grid is fully white, which is maximal because you can't add any chips. But if you have some rows and columns uncolored (but earlier we thought they must be colored), but wait, in the previous analysis, we concluded that for maximality, all rows and columns must be colored. Because otherwise, an uncolored row and column would allow adding a chip.\n\nWait, let me verify this point again. Suppose there's an uncolored row and an uncolored column. Their intersection cell is in an uncolored row and column, so you could add a chip there of any color, violating maximality. Therefore, in a maximal arrangement, there can be no uncolored rows or columns. Therefore, all rows and columns must be colored either W or B. Therefore, the total number of colorings is indeed 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024. However, this includes colorings where, for example, a row is W and a column is B, leading to some empty cells, but those are allowed as long as they're maximal.\n\nWait, but the problem also says \"any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous conditions\". So if all rows and columns are colored, then indeed, you can't add any more chips because every empty cell is in a W row and B column (or vice versa), so you can't place a chip there without conflicting. So those 1024 colorings are all maximal.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that there are 25 indistinguishable white chips and 25 indistinguishable black chips. Wait, but in our current model, the number of white and black chips can vary. For example, if all rows and columns are W, then all 25 cells are white, using 25 white chips. But the problem states \"some of these chips\", so using up to 25 white and 25 black. However, the problem says \"the number of ways to place some of these chips\", so perhaps we are to count all such maximal arrangements, regardless of the number of chips used, as long as they use some chips (but the problem says \"some\", but maybe including zero? Wait, the problem says \"some\", so maybe at least one chip. But in the problem statement, it says \"each cell contains at most one chip\", so an empty grid is allowed? But the maximality condition says you can't add any chips, which would require that every cell is already blocked. But an empty grid can have chips added, so it's not maximal. Therefore, the maximal arrangements must have at least one chip.\n\nBut in our current count of 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024, this includes the all-white and all-black grids (which are valid), and also the case where all rows and columns are colored but no cells are actually colored. Wait, no\u2014if all rows and columns are colored W or B such that there's no overlap between W rows and W columns, leading to an empty grid? Wait, no. For example, if all rows are W and all columns are B, then every cell is in a W row and B column, so all cells are empty. This would be an empty grid, which is not maximal because you can add a chip anywhere. Therefore, such a coloring is invalid.\n\nAh! This is a critical mistake. So not all colorings are valid. Specifically, if the intersection of W rows and W columns is empty (i.e., no W rows or no W columns), then the W region is empty, similarly for B. So the total number of chips is the number of W cells (rows_W \u00d7 cols_W) plus the number of B cells (rows_B \u00d7 cols_B).\n\nTo have a maximal arrangement, the grid cannot be empty. Therefore, we must have that either:\n\n- There are W rows and W columns such that rows_W \u00d7 cols_W is non-empty, or\n\n- There are B rows and B columns such that rows_B \u00d7 cols_B is non-empty,\n\nor both.\n\nAdditionally, the arrangement must be maximal, so the empty grid (all rows and columns colored such that W and B regions are empty) is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the total number of valid arrangements is equal to the number of colorings (row and column color assignments) minus the cases where both W and B regions are empty.\n\nHow many colorings result in both W and B regions being empty?\n\nThat would be when either:\n\n1. There are no W rows or no W columns, and also no B rows or no B columns.\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nThe W region is non-empty iff there is at least one W row and at least one W column.\n\nSimilarly, the B region is non-empty iff there is at least one B row and at least one B column.\n\nTherefore, the cases where both regions are empty are those where:\n\n- Either there are no W rows or no W columns, AND\n\n- Either there are no B rows or no B columns.\n\nBut this is a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of colorings where the grid is empty is the number of colorings where (there are no W rows or no W columns) AND (there are no B rows or no B columns).\n\nWait, no. The grid is empty only if both the W region and B region are empty. The W region is empty if there are no W rows or no W columns. Similarly for B. So the grid is empty when:\n\n(W rows = 0 OR W columns = 0) AND (B rows = 0 OR B columns = 0).\n\nTherefore, to compute the number of such colorings, we can use inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal colorings where W region is empty: 2^5 (row colorings with no W rows or no W columns) ?\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet A be the set of colorings where the W region is empty (i.e., either no W rows or no W columns).\n\nLet B be the set of colorings where the B region is empty (either no B rows or no B columns).\n\nWe need to compute |A \u2229 B|, the number of colorings where both regions are empty.\n\nThe total number of maximal arrangements is Total = (2^5 * 2^5) - |A \u2229 B|.\n\nFirst, compute Total colorings: 2^5 (row colors: each row can be W, B) \u00d7 2^5 (column colors: each column can be W, B). Wait, actually, each row has two choices: W or B. Similarly for each column. Therefore, it's 2^5 \u00d7 2^5 = 1024.\n\nNow compute |A \u2229 B|:\n\nA \u2229 B is the set of colorings where:\n\n- W region is empty: (no W rows OR no W columns)\n\nAND\n\n- B region is empty: (no B rows OR no B columns)\n\nSo, to be in A \u2229 B, the coloring must satisfy:\n\nEither (no W rows or no W columns) AND (no B rows or no B columns).\n\nThis can be broken into cases:\n\nCase 1: No W rows AND no B rows. Then all rows are uncolored? Wait no, rows must be colored either W or B. If there are no W rows and no B rows, that would mean all rows are uncolored, but earlier we concluded that rows must be colored. Wait, actually in our model, rows must be colored either W or B, so there are no uncolored rows. Similarly for columns. Therefore, \"no W rows\" means all rows are B, and \"no B rows\" means all rows are W.\n\nWait, this is a key point. Since every row must be colored either W or B (as per maximality requiring no uncolored rows), \"no W rows\" means all rows are B, and \"no B rows\" means all rows are W. Similarly for columns.\n\nTherefore, the condition \"W region is empty\" is equivalent to:\n\nEither (all rows are B) OR (all columns are B).\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, the W region is empty if either there are no W rows (i.e., all rows are B) or no W columns (all columns are B).\n\nSimilarly, the B region is empty if either no B rows (all rows are W) or no B columns (all columns are W).\n\nTherefore, the intersection A \u2229 B is the set of colorings where:\n\n[ (all rows B or all columns B) AND (all rows W or all columns W) ]\n\nThis can be broken into cases:\n\n1. All rows are B AND all rows are W: impossible.\n\n2. All rows are B AND all columns are W: this satisfies both conditions. Because:\n\n- All rows are B \u21d2 W region is empty (no W rows),\n\n- All columns are W \u21d2 B region is empty (no B columns).\n\nTherefore, this is a valid case.\n\n3. All columns are B AND all rows are W: similarly, this would satisfy:\n\n- All columns are B \u21d2 W region is empty (no W columns),\n\n- All rows are W \u21d2 B region is empty (no B rows).\n\nAnother valid case.\n\n4. All columns are B AND all columns are W: impossible.\n\nAdditionally, there might be other cases where:\n\nWait, perhaps also:\n\nWait, let me rephrase.\n\nThe conditions for A \u2229 B are:\n\nEither:\n\n- (All rows are B or all columns are B) AND (All rows are W or all columns are W)\n\nThis can be:\n\nCase 1: All rows are B AND all rows are W \u21d2 impossible.\n\nCase 2: All rows are B AND all columns are W \u21d2 valid.\n\nCase 3: All columns are B AND all rows are W \u21d2 valid.\n\nCase 4: All columns are B AND all columns are W \u21d2 impossible.\n\nCase 5: All rows are B AND all columns are W: already covered.\n\nWait, perhaps also:\n\nWait, maybe there are cases where:\n\n- All rows are B and all columns are W,\n\n- All rows are W and all columns are B,\n\n- All rows are B and all columns are B,\n\n- All rows are W and all columns are W,\n\nWait, but the last two would not satisfy both conditions.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nSuppose all rows are B and all columns are B:\n\n- Then the W region is empty (no W rows or columns),\n\n- The B region is non-empty (rows and columns are B),\n\nTherefore, it doesn't satisfy B region being empty, so not in A \u2229 B.\n\nSimilarly, all rows W and all columns W would not satisfy the B region being empty.\n\nTherefore, only the two cases:\n\n1. All rows are B and all columns are W.\n\n2. All rows are W and all columns are B.\n\nEach of these results in an empty grid.\n\nAdditionally, are there other possibilities?\n\nSuppose, for example, all rows are B, and columns are neither all W nor all B. Then:\n\n- The W region is empty (no W rows),\n\n- The B region is non-empty (since there are B rows and at least one B column).\n\nThus, it doesn't satisfy B region being empty, so not in A \u2229 B.\n\nSimilarly, if all columns are B and rows are neither all W nor all B:\n\n- W region could be non-empty if there are W columns (but columns are all B), so W region is empty,\n\n- B region is non-empty,\n\nThus, not in A \u2229 B.\n\nTherefore, the only colorings in A \u2229 B are the two cases:\n\n1. All rows B, all columns W.\n\n2. All rows W, all columns B.\n\nEach of these results in an empty grid (since W region requires W rows and W columns, but there are none; similarly for B region). So those are the only two colorings where the grid is entirely empty, which are invalid because they are not maximal.\n\nTherefore, |A \u2229 B| = 2.\n\nTherefore, the total number of maximal arrangements is 1024 - 2 = 1022.\n\nHowever, wait, hold on. Are there other colorings where the grid is empty?\n\nSuppose some rows are W and some are B, but the columns are arranged such that there's no overlap between W rows and W columns, and similarly for B.\n\nFor example:\n\nSuppose we have some W rows and some B rows, and columns are split into W and B such that the W columns don't intersect the W rows, and B columns don't intersect B rows. But this would require that:\n\n- The W rows have no W columns,\n\n- The B rows have no B columns,\n\nThus making both regions empty.\n\nThis can happen even if not all rows are W or B, and similarly for columns.\n\nFor example:\n\nLet rows 1-2 be W, rows 3-5 be B.\n\nColumns 1-2 be B, columns 3-5 be W.\n\nThen:\n\n- The W region requires W rows (1-2) and W columns (3-5). Their intersection (rows 1-2, cols 3-5) would be W chips. Wait, but columns 3-5 are W, so yes, those cells are W.\n\nWait, so this would have a non-empty W region. Similarly, the B region would be rows 3-5 and columns 1-2, so their intersection (rows 3-5, cols 1-2) are B chips.\n\nTherefore, this is a valid non-empty arrangement.\n\nAnother example where regions are empty:\n\nSuppose rows 1-2 are W, rows 3-5 are B.\n\nColumns 1-2 are B, columns 3-5 are W.\n\nWait, as above, that has both regions non-empty.\n\nSuppose instead:\n\nRows 1-2 are W, rows 3-5 are B.\n\nColumns all are B.\n\nThen:\n\n- W region requires W rows (1-2) and W columns. But columns are all B, so W columns don't exist \u21d2 W region is empty.\n\n- B region requires B rows (3-5) and B columns (all). So B region is rows 3-5 and all columns \u21d2 B region is non-empty.\n\nThus, the grid is partially filled with B chips. So this is a valid arrangement (non-empty), so it's counted in the 1024 total.\n\nTherefore, the only cases where the grid is empty are the two cases where:\n\nAll rows are W and all columns are B, or vice versa.\n\nTherefore, |A \u2229 B| = 2.\n\nTherefore, total maximal arrangements are 1024 - 2 = 1022.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the number of ways to place some of these chips\". The chips are indistinct except for color, so each valid grid is counted once, regardless of the number of chips.\n\nHowever, the problem also mentions \"there is a collection of 25 indistinguishable white chips and 25 indistinguishable black chips\". Does this mean that we cannot use more than 25 of each? In our current model, the number of white chips is (number of W rows) \u00d7 (number of W columns), and similarly for black. Since the grid is 5x5, the maximum number of white chips is 25 (if all rows and columns are W), and similarly for black. Since we have exactly 25 of each, those maximums are allowed. Any smaller number is also allowed as long as they don't exceed 25, which they won't because it's a 5x5 grid. Therefore, all the colorings are valid as long as they don't exceed the chip counts, but since we have 25 of each, it's okay.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1022.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again. The problem says \"some of these chips\", so arrangements with zero chips are excluded. The two cases we subtract are the two empty grids, so the total is 1024 - 2 = 1022. But wait, are there any other arrangements with zero chips?\n\nSuppose all rows are W and all columns are W. Then the grid is fully white, which is non-empty. Similarly, all rows B and columns B is fully black. The only empty grids are the two cases where rows and columns are opposite colors.\n\nTherefore, yes, subtracting those two gives 1022. But let me check with an example.\n\nTake a small grid, say 1x1. Then following the same logic:\n\nTotal colorings: 2 (row) \u00d7 2 (column) = 4.\n\nThe two cases where grid is empty are:\n\n- Row is W, column is B,\n\n- Row is B, column is W.\n\nThus, subtract 2, giving 2 valid arrangements: the fully W and fully B. Which is correct because in a 1x1 grid, the maximal arrangements are either having the single cell white or black, since adding another chip isn't possible. The empty grid is not maximal. So 2 = 4-2. So the formula works here.\n\nAnother test case: 2x2 grid.\n\nTotal colorings: 2^2 * 2^2 = 16.\n\nSubtract 2 cases where it's empty: row all W and column all B, or vice versa. So 14.\n\nLet's enumerate:\n\nPossible maximal arrangements:\n\nAll white: 1.\n\nAll black: 1.\n\nHalf white and half black? For example, rows [W,W], columns [B,B]. This makes the grid empty. Which is subtracted.\n\nOther arrangements:\n\nSuppose rows [W,B], columns [W,B].\n\nThen:\n\n- W row and W column: cell (1,1) is W.\n\n- B row and B column: cell (2,2) is B.\n\n- The other cells are empty (since row W and column B, etc.). This is a valid maximal arrangement with two chips.\n\nThere are many such possibilities. The total should be 14. Seems plausible.\n\nTherefore, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, for the 5x5 grid, the answer is 2^10 - 2 = 1024 - 2 = 1022.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that there are 25 white and 25 black chips available. But in our count, we are counting all possible color assignments, including those that use more than 25 of one color? Wait, no.\n\nWait, in a 5x5 grid, the maximum number of white chips is 5*5=25 (if all rows and columns are W). Similarly for black. Since we have exactly 25 of each, any arrangement that uses up to 25 of each is allowed. Since our count includes all such arrangements (as the maximum is exactly 25), there's no overcounting.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1022.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. The problem states \"the number of ways to place some of these chips\". Since the chips are indistinct except for color, each arrangement is uniquely determined by which cells are white, black, or empty, under the constraints. The count via row and column colorings is correct because each such coloring gives a unique arrangement, and we have to exclude only the two empty grids.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1022. But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming all rows and columns must be colored. Let me re-express the maximality condition.\n\nSuppose there exists an uncolored row (i.e., a row not colored W or B). Then, for maximality, every column must be colored W or B, so that the uncolored row's cells are in columns that are already colored, preventing adding a chip there. Similarly, an uncolored column requires all rows to be colored.\n\nHowever, an arrangement can have some uncolored rows or columns as long as the above is satisfied. For example, suppose:\n\n- All rows except row 1 are colored W,\n\n- All columns except column 1 are colored W.\n\nThen row 1 is uncolored, but every column except column 1 is colored W. Therefore, in row 1, columns 2-5 are in W columns, so they must be W (since the column is W). But row 1 is uncolored, so it can have chips as long as they're all the same color. However, columns 2-5 require those cells to be W, so row 1 must be W. Contradiction, so row 1 cannot be uncolored.\n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Alternatively, if there's an uncolored row, then all columns must be colored, so that every cell in the uncolored row is in a colored column. Therefore, the uncolored row can have chips only if all its cells are of the column's color. But since the row is uncolored, it can have any color as long as it's consistent. However, since the columns are colored, each cell in the uncolored row must match the column's color. Therefore, the uncolored row's cells must be the same as their respective columns' colors. But since the row is uncolored, it can have those chips as long as they are consistent. However, this doesn't violate the maximality because you can't add any more chips. Wait, but the problem requires that the arrangement is maximal, so you can't add any chips. However, in this case, the uncolored row could potentially have chips matching the column's colors, but since it's uncolored, it can choose to have those chips or not. Wait, no\u2014if the column is colored W, then its cells must be W if they are filled. The uncolored row can choose to have those cells filled with W or not. But to be maximal, they must be filled. Because otherwise, you could add a W chip there without conflict. Therefore, in fact, an uncolored row must have all its cells filled with the column's color wherever possible. But this requires that the row's cells are filled according to the columns' colors, but since the row is uncolored, it can have any color as long as it's consistent with the column.\n\nThis is getting too confusing, but given that the earlier analysis with the 1x1 and 2x2 grids works, and the logic that maximality requires all rows and columns to be colored (since otherwise you can add a chip in an uncolored row and column), then the count of 1022 is correct.\n\nWait, but in the example where rows are all W and columns all B, resulting in an empty grid, that's invalid, so subtract those two cases. Therefore, the final answer is 1022.\n\nHowever, the problem might have a different answer. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"each cell contains at most one chip\". So the empty grid is allowed in terms of cell count, but it's not maximal because you can add chips. Therefore, it's excluded.\n\nBut in the row and column coloring model, the only empty grids are the two cases where rows and columns are opposite colors. So subtracting those gives the correct count.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 1022. But I need to confirm once more.\n\nWait, another way: The number of ways to choose row colors (each row W or B) is 2^5, and column colors 2^5, so 1024 total colorings. Each coloring corresponds to a unique arrangement. The only invalid ones are the two where it's entirely empty, so subtract those, giving 1022. Yes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1022}.\n\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of maximal arrangements of chips on a 5\u00d75 grid where each row and column must be monochromatic or empty, and no additional chips can be placed without violating these conditions. \n\nKey steps:\n1. **Maximality Condition**: An arrangement is maximal if every empty cell is blocked by conflicting row or column colors, preventing any further chip placement.\n2. **Row and Column Coloring**: Each row and column must be colored either white (W), black (B), or uncolored. However, for maximality, all rows and columns must be colored (either W or B) to avoid unblocked cells.\n3. **Invalid Configurations**: Configurations resulting in an empty grid are excluded. These occur when all rows are W and columns are B, or vice versa, leading to no chips.\n\nCalculations:\n- Total colorings: \\(2^5 \\times 2^5 = 1024\\).\n- Invalid configurations (empty grids): 2 (all rows W and columns B, or all rows B and columns W).\n\nThus, the number of valid maximal arrangements is:\n\\[\n1024 - 2 = 1022\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{1022}\\).",
