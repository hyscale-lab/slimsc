      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, since \\(\\omega\\) is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies \\(\\omega^{13} = 1\\). Also, the minimal polynomial for \\(\\omega\\) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, but maybe I can work with the equation \\(x^{13} - 1 = 0\\). The roots of this equation are all the 13th roots of unity, including 1 and the other primitive roots.\n\nThe problem is asking for the product over all \\(k\\) from 0 to 12 of \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\). That seems complicated, but maybe there's a way to rewrite the expression inside the product to make it more manageable.\n\nLet me consider each term in the product: \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\). Maybe I can factor this expression or relate it to some known polynomial. Let me try to manipulate the expression:\n\nFirst, notice that \\(\\omega^{2k}\\) is \\((\\omega^k)^2\\). Let me denote \\(z = \\omega^k\\), so each term becomes \\(2 - 2z + z^2\\). Therefore, each term is a quadratic in \\(z\\). So the product becomes \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\\) where \\(z\\) runs over all 13th roots of unity. Wait, actually, when \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 12, \\(\\omega^k\\) takes all the 13th roots of unity, including 1. So the product is over all 13th roots of unity \\(z\\), so the product is \\(\\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\\).\n\nHmm, that's an interesting way to think about it. So the problem reduces to evaluating the product of \\(z^2 - 2z + 2\\) over all 13th roots of unity \\(z\\).\n\nNow, products over roots of unity often relate to cyclotomic polynomials or to evaluating certain polynomials at roots. Let me recall that if I have a polynomial \\(P(x)\\) with roots \\(r_i\\), then \\(\\prod (x - r_i) = P(x)\\). But here, the product is over \\(z^2 - 2z + 2\\) where \\(z^{13}=1\\). Maybe I can consider this as evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the product over all roots \\(z\\) of \\(x^{13} - 1\\) of \\(z^2 - 2z + 2\\) can be related to the resultant or something else. Wait, maybe I can think of this product as the value of some polynomial evaluated at certain points?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the product \\(\\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\\) can be written as \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\\) where \\(z = \\omega^k\\). Let me consider substituting \\(z = \\omega^k\\) into the quadratic and then taking the product over all k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the product as the resultant of the polynomials \\(x^{13} - 1\\) and \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\). Wait, the resultant of two polynomials is the product of \\(f(a_i)\\) where \\(a_i\\) are the roots of the other polynomial. Hmm, not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the product over all roots z of \\(x^{13}-1\\) of (z^2 - 2 z + 2) is equal to the product of (z^2 - 2 z + 2) for each root z. Let me think of this as evaluating the product over all z such that z^13=1 of (z^2 - 2 z + 2). \n\nPerhaps I can write this product as the value of some polynomial at a specific point. Let me see.\n\nSuppose I have a polynomial whose roots are the z's. Since the roots z satisfy z^13 =1, then the minimal polynomial is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, but perhaps here we can use the factored form.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z - a) = z^{13} -1. But here the factors are quadratic in z, so perhaps we can consider a substitution.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2 z + 2) can be written as the product over all z^{13}=1 of ( (z - 1)^2 +1 ). Hmm, since \\( z^2 -2 z +2 = (z -1)^2 +1 \\). Maybe that helps?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that for each z, we can write (z^2 - 2 z +2) = (z^2 - 2 z +1) +1 = (z -1)^2 +1. So that's the same as (z -1)^2 +1. Not sure if that helps immediately, but maybe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that if I have a function f(z) = z^2 - 2 z +2, then the product over all 13th roots of unity of f(z) is equal to the resultant of x^{13}-1 and f(x). The resultant of two polynomials f and g is the product of f(a_i) where a_i are the roots of g. So here, since f(z) is quadratic and g(z)=z^{13}-1, then the resultant Res(g,f) is the product of f(z_i) over all roots z_i of g. So that is exactly the product we need. Therefore, the product is Res(z^{13}-1, z^2 - 2 z +2). \n\nNow, the resultant can be computed as the determinant of the Sylvester matrix, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe there is a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2 z +2) is equal to the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z - a)(z - b), where a and b are the roots of the quadratic equation z^2 -2 z +2 =0. Let me compute those roots. The roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 -8)] /2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So the quadratic factors as (z - (1+i))(z - (1 -i)). \n\nTherefore, the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 -2 z +2) is equal to the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z - (1+i))(z - (1 -i)). \n\nTherefore, this is equal to [product over z^{13}=1 of (z - (1+i))] multiplied by [product over z^{13}=1 of (z - (1 -i))].\n\nEach of those products is the value of the polynomial x^{13} -1 evaluated at x = 1 + i and x =1 -i respectively. Because if you have a polynomial P(x) = product_{k}(x - z_k), then product_{k}(a - z_k) = P(a).\n\nTherefore, the first product is ( (1 + i)^{13} -1 ) and the second product is ( (1 -i)^{13} -1 ). Therefore, the total product is [ ( (1 + i)^{13} -1 ) ( (1 -i)^{13} -1 ) ].\n\nSo that's a key insight. Therefore, the original product is equal to [(1 + i)^{13} -1][(1 -i)^{13} -1]. Therefore, now I can compute this expression and then take the result mod 1000.\n\nTherefore, my next step is to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 -i)^13, subtract 1 from each, multiply them, and then take modulo 1000.\n\nFirst, let me compute (1 + i)^n. Since 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2), and the angle is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. Therefore, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n \u03c0/4}. Similarly, (1 - i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{-i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i 13\u03c0/4}, and (1 -i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute 13\u03c0/4. Since 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*2 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Wait, 3\u03c0 is 12\u03c0/4, so 13\u03c0/4 is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, which is equivalent to \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = -7\u03c0/4? Wait, perhaps better to compute modulo 2\u03c0. Let's see:\n\n13\u03c0/4 divided by 2\u03c0 is 13/8, so subtract 2\u03c0 once (which is 8\u03c0/4) gives 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So the angle 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 5\u03c0/4. Therefore, e^{i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = cos(-5\u03c0/4) + i sin(-5\u03c0/4) = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nSimilarly, (1 -i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13}. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (sqrt(2))^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). Therefore, (sqrt(2))^{13} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute the multiplication step by step:\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) multiplied by sqrt(2)/2 is (2)/2 = 1. Therefore, the terms:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64*(-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the second term:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-i)*(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 = 64*(-i)*(2)/2 = 64*(-i).\n\nWait, wait, let me check that again:\n\nWait, actually, the first term:\n\nsqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) = (2)/2 = 1. So:\n\nFirst term: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64*(-2/2) = -64.\n\nSecond term: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * (-i) * (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 = 64*(-i)*(2)/2 = 64*(-i). Wait, that's correct. So the second term is -64i.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute (1 -i)^13.\n\nFollowing the same steps, (1 -i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) multiplied by [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nSo first term:\n\n64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = same as before, -64.\n\nSecond term:\n\n64*sqrt(2)*(i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*i*(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 = 64i*(2)/2 = 64i.\n\nTherefore, (1 -i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i, and (1 -i)^13 = -64 +64i.\n\nTherefore, now compute [(1 + i)^13 -1] and [(1 -i)^13 -1].\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 -i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nTherefore, the product of these two terms is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). Let me compute that.\n\nMultiply the two complex conjugates. Since (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, but here the terms are not exactly in that form. Wait, actually, let's compute it directly:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)(-65) + (-65)(64i) + (-64i)(-65) + (-64i)(64i)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-65)(-65) = 65\u00b2 = 4225\n\nSecond term: (-65)(64i) = -65*64 i\n\nThird term: (-64i)(-65) = 64*65 i\n\nFourth term: (-64i)(64i) = -64*64 i\u00b2 = -4096*(-1) because i\u00b2 = -1, so that's +4096.\n\nNow, notice that the second and third terms are -65*64i + 65*64i, which cancel each other out.\n\nTherefore, the total is 4225 + 4096 = 4225 + 4096.\n\nCompute that: 4225 + 4096. Let's see: 4000 + 4000 = 8000, and 225 + 96 = 321, so total is 8321? Wait, 4225 + 4096:\n\n4225 + 4000 = 8225, then +96 = 8321. Yes, so total is 8321.\n\nTherefore, the product [(1 + i)^13 -1][(1 -i)^13 -1] equals 8321. \n\nTherefore, the original product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is equal to 8321. Wait, but hold on, is that correct?\n\nWait a second, let me check again. Let me verify my steps again to be sure.\n\nFirst, the key steps were converting the product over roots into evaluating the polynomial at (1+i) and (1 -i). Let me confirm that:\n\nThe product over all z^{13}=1 of (z - a) is indeed equal to the value of the polynomial x^{13} -1 at x = a. Therefore, product_{z^{13}=1} (z - a) = a^{13} -1. So, yes, so that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 -2 z +2) = product_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 +i))(z - (1 -i)) = product_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 +i)) * product_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 -i)) = ( (1 +i)^{13} -1 )*( (1 -i)^{13} -1 ). That seems right.\n\nThen, computing (1 +i)^13 and (1 -i)^13.\n\nWe converted to polar form. Let me verify (1 +i)^13:\n\n1 + i has modulus sqrt(2), angle \u03c0/4. So, (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i 13*(\u03c0/4)}. 13*(\u03c0/4) is indeed 13\u03c0/4, which reduces to 13\u03c0/4 - 3*2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 6\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 24\u03c0/4 = -11\u03c0/4? Wait, but perhaps I should compute modulo 2\u03c0:\n\n13\u03c0/4 divided by 2\u03c0 is (13/4)/2 = 13/8. So subtract 2\u03c0 twice (since 2\u03c0 is 8\u03c0/4). 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So angle is 5\u03c0/4. So that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, (1 +i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i5\u03c0/4}. Then, sqrt(2)^13 is (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64*sqrt(2). So that is correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by e^{i5\u03c0/4} gives the components:\n\ne^{i5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2. So multiplying by 64*sqrt(2):\n\n64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(- (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 - i (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 )\n\nsqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so each term becomes:\n\n64*(-2/2 - i 2/2) = 64*(-1 -i) = -64 -64i. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for (1 -i)^13, same modulus, angle -5\u03c0/4 (or 7\u03c0/4?), but the calculation gives -64 +64i. So that's correct.\n\nThen, subtracting 1 gives:\n\n(1 +i)^13 -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i,\n\n(1 -i)^13 -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i,\n\nMultiplying these:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). Let me compute this again step by step:\n\nFirst, expand using FOIL:\n\nFirst: (-65)(-65) = 4225,\n\nOuter: (-65)(64i) = -4160i,\n\nInner: (-64i)(-65) = +4160i,\n\nLast: (-64i)(64i) = -4096i\u00b2 = -4096*(-1) = +4096.\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n4225 + (-4160i + 4160i) + 4096 = 4225 + 0 + 4096 = 8321. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the product is indeed 8321. So the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. Therefore, 8321 divided by 1000, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, 1000*8 = 8000, so 8321 - 8000 = 321, so the remainder is 321. Therefore, the answer is 321 mod 1000, so 321.\n\nBut hold on, let me confirm once more. Let me check all steps again because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers and exponents, there might be an error in calculation.\n\nWait, (sqrt(2))^{13} is 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64*sqrt(2). Correct. Then multiplied by e^{i5\u03c0/4} which has components (-sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)/2). So:\n\n64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(- (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64*(-2/2) = -64. Similarly for the imaginary part. So that's correct.\n\nThen subtracting 1 gives -65 -64i. Then the product with the conjugate gives 8321. So 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So the answer should be 321.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the remainder when [...] is divided by 1000\". So 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 + 321, so remainder is 321. Therefore, the answer is 321.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if I made any miscalculations in exponents or angles. Let me recompute (1 +i)^13 again, perhaps via binomial theorem?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute (1 +i)^2 = 2i,\n\n(1 +i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4,\n\n(1 +i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16,\n\nThen (1 +i)^13 = (1 +i)^8 * (1 +i)^4 * (1 +i)^1 = 16 * (-4) * (1 +i) = 16*(-4)*(1 +i) = -64*(1 +i) = -64 -64i. Which matches the previous result. So that's correct. Similarly, (1 -i)^13 = -64 +64i. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculations are correct. Thus the answer is 321. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me confirm once more the product [(1 +i)^13 -1][(1 -i)^13 -1] is indeed the product over all roots. Wait, the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 -2 z +2) equals [(1 +i)^13 -1][(1 -i)^13 -1]. Let me see:\n\nYes, because z^2 -2 z +2 factors into (z - (1 +i))(z - (1 -i)), so the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z - (1 +i))(z - (1 -i)) is equal to [product_{z}(z - (1 +i))] * [product_z (z - (1 -i))] which is equal to ( (1 +i)^13 -1 )*( (1 -i)^13 -1 ). Correct. \n\nSo all steps check out. Therefore, the product is 8321, mod 1000 is 321. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the remainder when [...] is divided by 1000\". So 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement? Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: Let \u03c9 \u22601 be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. \n\nWait, note that when k=0, \u03c9^0 =1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 +1^2 = 2 -2 +1 =1. So the first term is 1, but in our calculation, we considered all roots including 1. But in the problem statement, it says \u03c9 \u22601, but the product is over k from 0 to12, which includes \u03c9^0=1. However, since \u03c9 is a primitive root, but even so, the product includes all 13th roots. The problem says \u03c9\u22601 is a 13th root, but the product is over all k from 0 to12, so all roots. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is 321. \n\nHmm, but let me just confirm once more that the product is indeed 8321. Let me compute 8321 mod 1000. 8000 + 321, so yes, remainder 321. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check with another approach. Maybe compute the product modulo 1000 directly? Although that might be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps check the product using another method?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2 z +2) is equal to [(1+i)^13 -1][(1 -i)^13 -1]. Let me see.\n\nWait, actually, the product over z^{13}=1 of (z^2 -2 z +2) = product_{z} (z - (1+i))(z - (1 -i)) = product_z(z - (1+i)) * product_z(z - (1 -i)). \n\nBut product_z(z - a) over all z^{13}=1 is equal to the value of the polynomial x^{13} -1 evaluated at x = a. Therefore, product_z(z -a) = a^{13} -1. Therefore, yes, that part is correct. So that gives ( (1+i)^13 -1 )*( (1 -i)^13 -1 ). Therefore, correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 321. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps check with small n? Let me see if the approach works for a smaller case. Let's take n=1, but 13 is prime. Maybe n=3?\n\nSuppose instead of 13th roots, take 3rd roots. Let me see if the formula works.\n\nSuppose the problem was for 3rd roots of unity. Let\u2019s test with n=3.\n\nLet\u2019s compute the product for 3rd roots. Let\u2019s see:\n\nLet \u03c9 be a primitive 3rd root of unity. The product over k=0,1,2 of (2 -2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFor k=0: 2 -2*1 +1 =1.\n\nFor k=1: 2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nFor k=2: 2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9^4. But \u03c9^3=1, so \u03c9^4=\u03c9.\n\nThus term for k=2: 2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9.\n\nTherefore, the product is 1*(2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2)*(2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9).\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, compute (2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2)*(2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9). Let me expand this:\n\nLet me denote A = 2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 and B =2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9.\n\nMultiply A*B:\n\nFirst, 2*(2) =4\n\n2*(-2\u03c9\u00b2) = -4\u03c9\u00b2\n\n2*(\u03c9) = 2\u03c9\n\n-2\u03c9*(2) = -4\u03c9\n\n-2\u03c9*(-2\u03c9\u00b2)= +4\u03c9^3. But \u03c9^3=1, so 4*1=4\n\n-2\u03c9*(\u03c9) = -2\u03c9\u00b2\n\n\u03c9\u00b2*(2) = 2\u03c9\u00b2\n\n\u03c9\u00b2*(-2\u03c9\u00b2) = -2\u03c9^4 = -2\u03c9 (since \u03c9^4=\u03c9)\n\n\u03c9\u00b2*(\u03c9) = \u03c9^3 =1\n\nNow, sum all terms:\n\n4 -4\u03c9\u00b2 +2\u03c9 -4\u03c9 +4 -2\u03c9\u00b2 +2\u03c9\u00b2 -2\u03c9 +1\n\nLet me group like terms:\n\nConstants: 4 +4 +1 =9\n\nTerms with \u03c9: 2\u03c9 -4\u03c9 -2\u03c9 = (2 -4 -2)\u03c9 = -4\u03c9\n\nTerms with \u03c9\u00b2: -4\u03c9\u00b2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 +2\u03c9\u00b2 = (-4 -2 +2)\u03c9\u00b2 = -4\u03c9\u00b2\n\nTherefore total expression: 9 -4\u03c9 -4\u03c9\u00b2\n\nBut in the field of 3rd roots, since 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 =0, so \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1. Therefore, substitute:\n\n9 -4(\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 9 -4*(-1) = 9 +4 =13. \n\nAlternatively, let me see if using the formula gives the same result. Let's apply the formula:\n\nThe product would be [(1+i)^3 -1][(1 -i)^3 -1].\n\nFirst compute (1+i)^3:\n\n(1+i)^3 = 1 + 3i + 3i\u00b2 + i\u00b3 = 1 +3i -3 -i = (1-3) + (3i -i) = -2 +2i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 -i)^3 =1 -3i +3i\u00b2 -i\u00b3 =1 -3i -3 +i = (1-3) + (-3i +i)= -2 -2i.\n\nTherefore, (1+i)^3 -1 = (-2 +2i) -1 = -3 +2i,\n\n(1 -i)^3 -1 = (-2 -2i) -1 = -3 -2i,\n\nMultiply them: (-3 +2i)(-3 -2i) =9 +6i -6i -4i\u00b2 =9 +4=13. Which matches. So the formula works here.\n\nTherefore, the formula is correct. So in the case of n=3, the product is 13, which mod 10 would be 3, but that's just a check. \n\nTherefore, this gives me more confidence that the formula is correct, so the original problem's answer is 8321 mod 1000 is 321. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 321.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{321}\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nGiven \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity, we need to find the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000.\n\nFirst, we note that \\(\\omega^k\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, \\ldots, 12\\) are all the 13th roots of unity. The product can be rewritten as \\(\\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\\), where \\(z\\) runs over all 13th roots of unity.\n\nThe quadratic \\(z^2 - 2z + 2\\) factors as \\((z - (1+i))(z - (1-i))\\), where \\(1+i\\) and \\(1-i\\) are the roots.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, since \\(\\omega\\) is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies \\(\\omega^{13} = 1\\). Also, the minimal polynomial for \\(\\omega\\) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, but maybe I can work with the equation \\(x^{13} - 1 = 0\\). The roots of this equation are all the 13th roots of unity, including 1 and the other primitive roots.\n\nThe problem is asking for the product over all \\(k\\) from 0 to 12 of \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\). That seems complicated, but maybe there's a way to rewrite the expression inside the product to make it more manageable.\n\nLet me consider each term in the product: \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\). Maybe I can factor this expression or relate it to some known polynomial. Let me try to manipulate the expression:\n\nFirst, notice that \\(\\omega^{2k}\\) is \\((\\omega^k)^2\\). Let me denote \\(z = \\omega^k\\), so each term becomes \\(2 - 2z + z^2\\). Therefore, each term is a quadratic in \\(z\\). So the product becomes \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\\) where \\(z\\) runs over all 13th roots of unity. Wait, actually, when \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 12, \\(\\omega^k\\) takes all the 13th roots of unity, including 1. So the product is over all 13th roots of unity \\(z\\), so the product is \\(\\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\\).\n\nHmm, that's an interesting way to think about it. So the problem reduces to evaluating the product of \\(z^2 - 2z + 2\\) over all 13th roots of unity \\(z\\).\n\nNow, products over roots of unity often relate to cyclotomic polynomials or to evaluating certain polynomials at roots. Let me recall that if I have a polynomial \\(P(x)\\) with roots \\(r_i\\), then \\(\\prod (x - r_i) = P(x)\\). But here, the product is over \\(z^2 - 2z + 2\\) where \\(z^{13}=1\\). Maybe I can consider this as evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the product over all roots \\(z\\) of \\(x^{13} - 1\\) of \\(z^2 - 2z + 2\\) can be related to the resultant or something else. Wait, maybe I can think of this product as the value of some polynomial evaluated at certain points?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the product \\(\\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\\) can be written as \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\\) where \\(z = \\omega^k\\). Let me consider substituting \\(z = \\omega^k\\) into the quadratic and then taking the product over all k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the product as the resultant of the polynomials \\(x^{13} - 1\\) and \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\). Wait, the resultant of two polynomials is the product of \\(f(a_i)\\) where \\(a_i\\) are the roots of the other polynomial. Hmm, not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the product over all roots z of \\(x^{13}-1\\) of (z^2 - 2 z + 2) is equal to the product of (z^2 - 2 z + 2) for each root z. Let me think of this as evaluating the product over all z such that z^13=1 of (z^2 - 2 z + 2). \n\nPerhaps I can write this product as the value of some polynomial at a specific point. Let me see.\n\nSuppose I have a polynomial whose roots are the z's. Since the roots z satisfy z^13 =1, then the minimal polynomial is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, but perhaps here we can use the factored form.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z - a) = z^{13} -1. But here the factors are quadratic in z, so perhaps we can consider a substitution.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2 z + 2) can be written as the product over all z^{13}=1 of ( (z - 1)^2 +1 ). Hmm, since \\( z^2 -2 z +2 = (z -1)^2 +1 \\). Maybe that helps?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that for each z, we can write (z^2 - 2 z +2) = (z^2 - 2 z +1) +1 = (z -1)^2 +1. So that's the same as (z -1)^2 +1. Not sure if that helps immediately, but maybe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that if I have a function f(z) = z^2 - 2 z +2, then the product over all 13th roots of unity of f(z) is equal to the resultant of x^{13}-1 and f(x). The resultant of two polynomials f and g is the product of f(a_i) where a_i are the roots of g. So here, since f(z) is quadratic and g(z)=z^{13}-1, then the resultant Res(g,f) is the product of f(z_i) over all roots z_i of g. So that is exactly the product we need. Therefore, the product is Res(z^{13}-1, z^2 - 2 z +2). \n\nNow, the resultant can be computed as the determinant of the Sylvester matrix, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe there is a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2 z +2) is equal to the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z - a)(z - b), where a and b are the roots of the quadratic equation z^2 -2 z +2 =0. Let me compute those roots. The roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 -8)] /2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So the quadratic factors as (z - (1+i))(z - (1 -i)). \n\nTherefore, the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 -2 z +2) is equal to the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z - (1+i))(z - (1 -i)). \n\nTherefore, this is equal to [product over z^{13}=1 of (z - (1+i))] multiplied by [product over z^{13}=1 of (z - (1 -i))].\n\nEach of those products is the value of the polynomial x^{13} -1 evaluated at x = 1 + i and x =1 -i respectively. Because if you have a polynomial P(x) = product_{k}(x - z_k), then product_{k}(a - z_k) = P(a).\n\nTherefore, the first product is ( (1 + i)^{13} -1 ) and the second product is ( (1 -i)^{13} -1 ). Therefore, the total product is [ ( (1 + i)^{13} -1 ) ( (1 -i)^{13} -1 ) ].\n\nSo that's a key insight. Therefore, the original product is equal to [(1 + i)^{13} -1][(1 -i)^{13} -1]. Therefore, now I can compute this expression and then take the result mod 1000.\n\nTherefore, my next step is to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 -i)^13, subtract 1 from each, multiply them, and then take modulo 1000.\n\nFirst, let me compute (1 + i)^n. Since 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2), and the angle is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. Therefore, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n \u03c0/4}. Similarly, (1 - i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{-i n \u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i 13\u03c0/4}, and (1 -i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{-i 13\u03c0/4}.\n\nLet me compute 13\u03c0/4. Since 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, so 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, so 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*2 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Wait, 3\u03c0 is 12\u03c0/4, so 13\u03c0/4 is \u03c0/4 more than 3\u03c0, which is equivalent to \u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = -7\u03c0/4? Wait, perhaps better to compute modulo 2\u03c0. Let's see:\n\n13\u03c0/4 divided by 2\u03c0 is 13/8, so subtract 2\u03c0 once (which is 8\u03c0/4) gives 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So the angle 13\u03c0/4 is equivalent to 5\u03c0/4. Therefore, e^{i 13\u03c0/4} = e^{i5\u03c0/4} = cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, e^{-i13\u03c0/4} = e^{-i5\u03c0/4} = cos(-5\u03c0/4) + i sin(-5\u03c0/4) = cos(5\u03c0/4) - i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nSimilarly, (1 -i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13}. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (sqrt(2))^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). Therefore, (sqrt(2))^{13} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nLet me compute the multiplication step by step:\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) multiplied by sqrt(2)/2 is (2)/2 = 1. Therefore, the terms:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64*(-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the second term:\n\n64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-i)*(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 = 64*(-i)*(2)/2 = 64*(-i).\n\nWait, wait, let me check that again:\n\nWait, actually, the first term:\n\nsqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) = (2)/2 = 1. So:\n\nFirst term: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64*(-2/2) = -64.\n\nSecond term: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * (-i) * (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 = 64*(-i)*(2)/2 = 64*(-i). Wait, that's correct. So the second term is -64i.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute (1 -i)^13.\n\nFollowing the same steps, (1 -i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) multiplied by [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nSo first term:\n\n64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = same as before, -64.\n\nSecond term:\n\n64*sqrt(2)*(i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*i*(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 = 64i*(2)/2 = 64i.\n\nTherefore, (1 -i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i, and (1 -i)^13 = -64 +64i.\n\nTherefore, now compute [(1 + i)^13 -1] and [(1 -i)^13 -1].\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 -i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nTherefore, the product of these two terms is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). Let me compute that.\n\nMultiply the two complex conjugates. Since (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, but here the terms are not exactly in that form. Wait, actually, let's compute it directly:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)(-65) + (-65)(64i) + (-64i)(-65) + (-64i)(64i)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-65)(-65) = 65\u00b2 = 4225\n\nSecond term: (-65)(64i) = -65*64 i\n\nThird term: (-64i)(-65) = 64*65 i\n\nFourth term: (-64i)(64i) = -64*64 i\u00b2 = -4096*(-1) because i\u00b2 = -1, so that's +4096.\n\nNow, notice that the second and third terms are -65*64i + 65*64i, which cancel each other out.\n\nTherefore, the total is 4225 + 4096 = 4225 + 4096.\n\nCompute that: 4225 + 4096. Let's see: 4000 + 4000 = 8000, and 225 + 96 = 321, so total is 8321? Wait, 4225 + 4096:\n\n4225 + 4000 = 8225, then +96 = 8321. Yes, so total is 8321.\n\nTherefore, the product [(1 + i)^13 -1][(1 -i)^13 -1] equals 8321. \n\nTherefore, the original product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is equal to 8321. Wait, but hold on, is that correct?\n\nWait a second, let me check again. Let me verify my steps again to be sure.\n\nFirst, the key steps were converting the product over roots into evaluating the polynomial at (1+i) and (1 -i). Let me confirm that:\n\nThe product over all z^{13}=1 of (z - a) is indeed equal to the value of the polynomial x^{13} -1 at x = a. Therefore, product_{z^{13}=1} (z - a) = a^{13} -1. So, yes, so that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 -2 z +2) = product_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 +i))(z - (1 -i)) = product_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 +i)) * product_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 -i)) = ( (1 +i)^{13} -1 )*( (1 -i)^{13} -1 ). That seems right.\n\nThen, computing (1 +i)^13 and (1 -i)^13.\n\nWe converted to polar form. Let me verify (1 +i)^13:\n\n1 + i has modulus sqrt(2), angle \u03c0/4. So, (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i 13*(\u03c0/4)}. 13*(\u03c0/4) is indeed 13\u03c0/4, which reduces to 13\u03c0/4 - 3*2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 6\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 24\u03c0/4 = -11\u03c0/4? Wait, but perhaps I should compute modulo 2\u03c0:\n\n13\u03c0/4 divided by 2\u03c0 is (13/4)/2 = 13/8. So subtract 2\u03c0 twice (since 2\u03c0 is 8\u03c0/4). 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So angle is 5\u03c0/4. So that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, (1 +i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i5\u03c0/4}. Then, sqrt(2)^13 is (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64*sqrt(2). So that is correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by e^{i5\u03c0/4} gives the components:\n\ne^{i5\u03c0/4} is cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2. So multiplying by 64*sqrt(2):\n\n64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(- (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 - i (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 )\n\nsqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so each term becomes:\n\n64*(-2/2 - i 2/2) = 64*(-1 -i) = -64 -64i. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for (1 -i)^13, same modulus, angle -5\u03c0/4 (or 7\u03c0/4?), but the calculation gives -64 +64i. So that's correct.\n\nThen, subtracting 1 gives:\n\n(1 +i)^13 -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i,\n\n(1 -i)^13 -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i,\n\nMultiplying these:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). Let me compute this again step by step:\n\nFirst, expand using FOIL:\n\nFirst: (-65)(-65) = 4225,\n\nOuter: (-65)(64i) = -4160i,\n\nInner: (-64i)(-65) = +4160i,\n\nLast: (-64i)(64i) = -4096i\u00b2 = -4096*(-1) = +4096.\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n4225 + (-4160i + 4160i) + 4096 = 4225 + 0 + 4096 = 8321. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the product is indeed 8321. So the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. Therefore, 8321 divided by 1000, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, 1000*8 = 8000, so 8321 - 8000 = 321, so the remainder is 321. Therefore, the answer is 321 mod 1000, so 321.\n\nBut hold on, let me confirm once more. Let me check all steps again because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers and exponents, there might be an error in calculation.\n\nWait, (sqrt(2))^{13} is 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64*sqrt(2). Correct. Then multiplied by e^{i5\u03c0/4} which has components (-sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)/2). So:\n\n64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(- (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64*(-2/2) = -64. Similarly for the imaginary part. So that's correct.\n\nThen subtracting 1 gives -65 -64i. Then the product with the conjugate gives 8321. So 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So the answer should be 321.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the remainder when [...] is divided by 1000\". So 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 + 321, so remainder is 321. Therefore, the answer is 321.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if I made any miscalculations in exponents or angles. Let me recompute (1 +i)^13 again, perhaps via binomial theorem?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute (1 +i)^2 = 2i,\n\n(1 +i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4,\n\n(1 +i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16,\n\nThen (1 +i)^13 = (1 +i)^8 * (1 +i)^4 * (1 +i)^1 = 16 * (-4) * (1 +i) = 16*(-4)*(1 +i) = -64*(1 +i) = -64 -64i. Which matches the previous result. So that's correct. Similarly, (1 -i)^13 = -64 +64i. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculations are correct. Thus the answer is 321. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me confirm once more the product [(1 +i)^13 -1][(1 -i)^13 -1] is indeed the product over all roots. Wait, the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 -2 z +2) equals [(1 +i)^13 -1][(1 -i)^13 -1]. Let me see:\n\nYes, because z^2 -2 z +2 factors into (z - (1 +i))(z - (1 -i)), so the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z - (1 +i))(z - (1 -i)) is equal to [product_{z}(z - (1 +i))] * [product_z (z - (1 -i))] which is equal to ( (1 +i)^13 -1 )*( (1 -i)^13 -1 ). Correct. \n\nSo all steps check out. Therefore, the product is 8321, mod 1000 is 321. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the remainder when [...] is divided by 1000\". So 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement? Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: Let \u03c9 \u22601 be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. \n\nWait, note that when k=0, \u03c9^0 =1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 +1^2 = 2 -2 +1 =1. So the first term is 1, but in our calculation, we considered all roots including 1. But in the problem statement, it says \u03c9 \u22601, but the product is over k from 0 to12, which includes \u03c9^0=1. However, since \u03c9 is a primitive root, but even so, the product includes all 13th roots. The problem says \u03c9\u22601 is a 13th root, but the product is over all k from 0 to12, so all roots. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is 321. \n\nHmm, but let me just confirm once more that the product is indeed 8321. Let me compute 8321 mod 1000. 8000 + 321, so yes, remainder 321. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check with another approach. Maybe compute the product modulo 1000 directly? Although that might be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps check the product using another method?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2 z +2) is equal to [(1+i)^13 -1][(1 -i)^13 -1]. Let me see.\n\nWait, actually, the product over z^{13}=1 of (z^2 -2 z +2) = product_{z} (z - (1+i))(z - (1 -i)) = product_z(z - (1+i)) * product_z(z - (1 -i)). \n\nBut product_z(z - a) over all z^{13}=1 is equal to the value of the polynomial x^{13} -1 evaluated at x = a. Therefore, product_z(z -a) = a^{13} -1. Therefore, yes, that part is correct. So that gives ( (1+i)^13 -1 )*( (1 -i)^13 -1 ). Therefore, correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 321. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps check with small n? Let me see if the approach works for a smaller case. Let's take n=1, but 13 is prime. Maybe n=3?\n\nSuppose instead of 13th roots, take 3rd roots. Let me see if the formula works.\n\nSuppose the problem was for 3rd roots of unity. Let\u2019s test with n=3.\n\nLet\u2019s compute the product for 3rd roots. Let\u2019s see:\n\nLet \u03c9 be a primitive 3rd root of unity. The product over k=0,1,2 of (2 -2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFor k=0: 2 -2*1 +1 =1.\n\nFor k=1: 2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nFor k=2: 2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9^4. But \u03c9^3=1, so \u03c9^4=\u03c9.\n\nThus term for k=2: 2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9.\n\nTherefore, the product is 1*(2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2)*(2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9).\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, compute (2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2)*(2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9). Let me expand this:\n\nLet me denote A = 2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 and B =2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9.\n\nMultiply A*B:\n\nFirst, 2*(2) =4\n\n2*(-2\u03c9\u00b2) = -4\u03c9\u00b2\n\n2*(\u03c9) = 2\u03c9\n\n-2\u03c9*(2) = -4\u03c9\n\n-2\u03c9*(-2\u03c9\u00b2)= +4\u03c9^3. But \u03c9^3=1, so 4*1=4\n\n-2\u03c9*(\u03c9) = -2\u03c9\u00b2\n\n\u03c9\u00b2*(2) = 2\u03c9\u00b2\n\n\u03c9\u00b2*(-2\u03c9\u00b2) = -2\u03c9^4 = -2\u03c9 (since \u03c9^4=\u03c9)\n\n\u03c9\u00b2*(\u03c9) = \u03c9^3 =1\n\nNow, sum all terms:\n\n4 -4\u03c9\u00b2 +2\u03c9 -4\u03c9 +4 -2\u03c9\u00b2 +2\u03c9\u00b2 -2\u03c9 +1\n\nLet me group like terms:\n\nConstants: 4 +4 +1 =9\n\nTerms with \u03c9: 2\u03c9 -4\u03c9 -2\u03c9 = (2 -4 -2)\u03c9 = -4\u03c9\n\nTerms with \u03c9\u00b2: -4\u03c9\u00b2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 +2\u03c9\u00b2 = (-4 -2 +2)\u03c9\u00b2 = -4\u03c9\u00b2\n\nTherefore total expression: 9 -4\u03c9 -4\u03c9\u00b2\n\nBut in the field of 3rd roots, since 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 =0, so \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1. Therefore, substitute:\n\n9 -4(\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 9 -4*(-1) = 9 +4 =13. \n\nAlternatively, let me see if using the formula gives the same result. Let's apply the formula:\n\nThe product would be [(1+i)^3 -1][(1 -i)^3 -1].\n\nFirst compute (1+i)^3:\n\n(1+i)^3 = 1 + 3i + 3i\u00b2 + i\u00b3 = 1 +3i -3 -i = (1-3) + (3i -i) = -2 +2i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 -i)^3 =1 -3i +3i\u00b2 -i\u00b3 =1 -3i -3 +i = (1-3) + (-3i +i)= -2 -2i.\n\nTherefore, (1+i)^3 -1 = (-2 +2i) -1 = -3 +2i,\n\n(1 -i)^3 -1 = (-2 -2i) -1 = -3 -2i,\n\nMultiply them: (-3 +2i)(-3 -2i) =9 +6i -6i -4i\u00b2 =9 +4=13. Which matches. So the formula works here.\n\nTherefore, the formula is correct. So in the case of n=3, the product is 13, which mod 10 would be 3, but that's just a check. \n\nTherefore, this gives me more confidence that the formula is correct, so the original problem's answer is 8321 mod 1000 is 321. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 321.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{321}\n\n\nGiven \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity, we need to find the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000.\n\nFirst, we note that \\(\\omega^k\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, \\ldots, 12\\) are all the 13th roots of unity. The product can be rewritten as \\(\\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\\), where \\(z\\) runs over all 13th roots of unity.\n\nThe quadratic \\(z^2 - 2z + 2\\) factors as \\((z - (1+i))(z - (1-i))\\), where \\(1+i\\) and \\(1-i\\) are the roots. Therefore, the product becomes:\n\\[\n\\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1+i)) \\cdot \\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1-i))\n\\]\n\nEach product is the value of the polynomial \\(x^{13} - 1\\) evaluated at \\(x = 1+i\\) and \\(x = 1-i\\), respectively. Thus, we need to compute:\n\\[\n\\left((1+i)^{13} - 1\\right) \\left((1-i)^{13} - 1\\right)\n\\]\n\nUsing polar form, \\(1+i = \\sqrt{2} e^{i\\pi/4}\\) and \\(1-i = \\sqrt{2} e^{-i\\pi/4}\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, roots of unity, products... I remember that products over roots of unity can sometimes be related to cyclotomic polynomials, but I need to think carefully here.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. So, \u03c9^13 = 1, and since \u03c9 \u2260 1, it's one of the other roots. The problem is asking for the product over all k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Since \u03c9^13 = 1, the exponents can be simplified modulo 13, but maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nLet me first see if I can rewrite the term inside the product. The term is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow? Let's see:\n\nLooking at 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}, perhaps factor out a 2? That would give 2(1 - \u03c9^k) + \u03c9^{2k}. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe consider it as a quadratic in \u03c9^k?\n\nLet me think of it as a quadratic in terms of z = \u03c9^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2z + z\u00b2. So that's z\u00b2 - 2z + 2. Hmm, so maybe the product over k from 0 to 12 of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2) where z = \u03c9^k? Wait, but actually each term in the product is (z^2 - 2z + 2) where z is each 13th root of unity. So the product is over all 13th roots of unity of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2). But since we have all roots except 1? Wait, actually, the roots include \u03c9^0 = 1 as well. Wait, the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, but the product is over k from 0 to 12, so that includes k=0 where \u03c9^0=1. So actually, the product includes all 13th roots of unity, but the problem states \u03c9 \u2260 1, but maybe that's just to indicate that we're not considering the trivial root?\n\nAnyway, proceeding: the product over all 13th roots of unity z of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2). Hmm, so maybe I can relate this product to the value of some polynomial evaluated at certain points?\n\nI recall that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over all primitive nth roots of unity of (x - \u03b6) is the nth cyclotomic polynomial. But here, the product is over all 13th roots of unity (since 13 is prime, all roots except 1 are primitive). Wait, but the term here is (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2), not (z - something). So perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the product over all z (the 13th roots of unity) of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2). Since z^13 = 1, maybe we can find a polynomial whose roots are these z's, and then evaluate the product as the value of some related polynomial?\n\nThe minimal polynomial for the 13th roots of unity is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1, since \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1). But how does that help here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that for any polynomial P(z), the product over all roots z of P(z) of (Q(z)) is equal to the resultant of P(z) and Q(z), or something like that. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, here's an idea: Let me consider the product over all 13th roots of unity z of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2). Let me denote this product as \u03a0_{z^{13}=1} (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2). To compute this, perhaps consider the polynomial f(z) = z^13 - 1, whose roots are all the 13th roots of unity. Then, the product over all roots z of f(z) of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2) is equal to the resultant of f(z) and (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2), but I might be getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Let me consider that if I have a function Q(z) = z\u00b2 - 2z + 2, then the product over all 13th roots of unity of Q(z) is equal to the product over all z with z^13 = 1 of Q(z). Maybe this can be written as the product over z of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2) = product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nHmm, maybe I can write this as product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Let me consider substituting variables here. Let me let y = \u03c9^k. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, as k runs from 0 to 12, y runs through all 13th roots of unity. So the product becomes product_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2). \n\nHmm, so maybe I can write this as product_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2). Let me think of this as evaluating a certain product over roots. To compute this product, perhaps consider that the product over all roots y of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the product over all roots of (y - \u03b1)(y - \u03b2), where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are roots of the quadratic equation z\u00b2 - 2z + 2 = 0. Wait, so the product over all y of (y - \u03b1)(y - \u03b2) would be [product_{y}(y - \u03b1)] * [product_{y}(y - \u03b2)].\n\nTherefore, the total product is [product_{y^13=1} (y - \u03b1)] * [product_{y^13=1} (y - \u03b2)].\n\nSo, if I can compute each of these products separately, then multiply them together. The product over all y^13 = 1 of (y - \u03b1) is equal to the value of the polynomial f(y) = y^13 - 1 evaluated at y = \u03b1. Because f(y) = product_{y^13=1} (y - \u03b1) when \u03b1 is a root? Wait, no, actually, the polynomial f(y) = y^13 - 1 factors as product_{y^13=1} (y - \u03b1), so if we evaluate f(\u03b1') for some \u03b1', then it's product_{y^13=1} (\u03b1' - y). Wait, actually, that's the same as product_{y} (y - \u03b1') with a sign change depending on the degree. Let me check:\n\nThe polynomial f(y) = y^13 - 1 has roots at all 13th roots of unity. So, if I plug in some value \u03b1 into f(y), I get f(\u03b1) = \u03b1^13 - 1, which is equal to product_{y^13=1} (\u03b1 - y). Therefore, product_{y^13=1} (y - \u03b1) = (-1)^13 product_{y^13=1} (\u03b1 - y) = - (\u03b1^13 - 1). Since 13 is odd, so (-1)^13 = -1. Therefore, product_{y^13=1} (y - \u03b1) = - (\u03b1^13 - 1).\n\nTherefore, similarly, product_{y^13=1} (y - \u03b1) = - (\u03b1^13 - 1), and same for \u03b2. Therefore, the total product we need is [ - (\u03b1^13 - 1) ] * [ - (\u03b2^13 - 1) ] = [ (\u03b1^13 - 1)(\u03b2^13 - 1) ].\n\nWait, hold on, let me verify again:\n\nproduct_{y}(y - \u03b1) = - (\u03b1^13 - 1)\n\nTherefore, product_{y}(y - \u03b1) * product_{y}(y - \u03b2) = [ - (\u03b1^13 - 1) ] * [ - (\u03b2^13 - 1) ] = (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1).\n\nTherefore, the original product is (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1).\n\nBut \u03b1 and \u03b2 are roots of the quadratic equation z\u00b2 - 2z + 2 =0, so let me compute \u03b1^13 and \u03b2^13.\n\nFirst, let me find \u03b1 and \u03b2. The quadratic equation is z\u00b2 - 2 z + 2 =0, so the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 -8)] /2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] /2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So \u03b1 = 1 + i and \u03b2 = 1 - i.\n\nTherefore, \u03b1 = 1 + i, \u03b2 =1 - i.\n\nTherefore, \u03b1^13 and \u03b2^13. Hmm, complex numbers raised to the 13th power. Let me compute \u03b1^13 and \u03b2^13.\n\nFirst, note that \u03b1 = 1 + i. Let me write this in polar form. The modulus of \u03b1 is sqrt(1\u00b2 +1\u00b2)=sqrt(2). The angle (argument) is 45 degrees, or \u03c0/4 radians. So \u03b1 can be written as sqrt(2) e^{i \u03c0/4}. Similarly, \u03b2 is 1 - i, which is sqrt(2) e^{-i \u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, \u03b1^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i (13 * \u03c0/4)} and \u03b2^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i (13 * \u03c0/4)}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nThe angle 13 * \u03c0/4: Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0. 13 * \u03c0/4 = (12 +1)\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. Since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0). Wait, 13*(\u03c0/4) divided by 2\u03c0: 13/8, so 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*1 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Wait, let me see:\n\nAlternatively, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, but 3\u03c0 is \u03c0 more than 2\u03c0. So subtract 2\u03c0: 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So the angle for \u03b1^13 is 5\u03c0/4, and for \u03b2^13 it's -5\u03c0/4 (since it was -13\u03c0/4, which is equivalent to -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = ( -13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4, but wait, maybe I need to compute it properly.\n\nWait, let me do it again for \u03b2:\n\n\u03b2^13: the angle is -13\u03c0/4. Let's add 4\u03c0 (since angles are modulo 2\u03c0). So -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 +16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. Therefore, the angle for \u03b2^13 is 3\u03c0/4. Wait, but that seems inconsistent? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, original angle for \u03b2 is -\u03c0/4, so multiplying by 13 gives angle -13\u03c0/4. To get this within 0 to 2\u03c0, add 4\u03c0 (which is 16\u03c0/4):\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So the angle is 3\u03c0/4. So:\n\n\u03b1^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i 5\u03c0/4}\n\n\u03b2^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i 3\u03c0/4}\n\nTherefore, \u03b1^13 -1 and \u03b2^13 -1.\n\nFirst, let me compute \u03b1^13:\n\nCompute modulus: (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). The angle is 5\u03c0/4, so \u03b1^13 = 64\u221a2 [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)].\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2. So,\n\n\u03b1^13 = 64\u221a2 [ -\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2 ] = 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2)(1 + i) = 64\u221a2*(-\u221a2/2)*(1 +i)\n\nCompute \u221a2 * \u221a2 = 2, so:\n\n= 64 * (-2/2)*(1 +i) = 64*(-1)*(1 +i) = -64(1 +i)\n\nSimilarly, \u03b2^13:\n\n\u03b2^13 = 64\u221a2 [cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4)].\n\ncos(3\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2, sin(3\u03c0/4)=\u221a2/2.\n\nThus,\n\n\u03b2^13 = 64\u221a2 [ -\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2 ] = 64\u221a2*(-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2 )\n\nSame steps:\n\n= 64\u221a2*( -\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2 ) = 64*( - (\u221a2 * \u221a2)/2 + i (\u221a2 * \u221a2)/2 )\n\n= 64*(-2/2 + i 2/2) = 64*(-1 + i)\n\nTherefore, \u03b2^13 = 64(-1 + i)\n\nTherefore, \u03b1^13 -1 = -64(1 +i) -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i\n\nWait, wait, hold on. Wait, \u03b1^13 is -64(1 +i). Therefore, \u03b1^13 -1 is -64(1 +i) -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i. Similarly, \u03b2^13 -1 is 64(-1 +i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1) = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). Let me compute that.\n\nMultiply the two complex numbers:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 + terms with cross products? Wait, actually, using (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 if the terms are a and b, but here it's (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = [(-65) + (-64i)] * [(-65) + 64i] = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2. Wait, yes, because (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 where a = -65 and b = -64i? Wait, no, let me see:\n\nWait, actually, the first term is (-65 -64i) and the second is (-65 +64i). Let me write it as [(-65) -64i][(-65)+64i] = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2. Because (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 where a = -65, b =64i. Wait, but that would be ( (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 ). So yes.\n\nSo compute:\n\n(-65)^2 = 4225\n\n(64i)^2 = 64\u00b2 * i\u00b2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096\n\nThus, the expression becomes 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, so (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1) = 8321. Therefore, going back to the original product:\n\nThe product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y +2) = (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1) = 8321. Wait, but hold on, let me double-check the steps because this is critical.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\nproduct_{y}(y - \u03b1) * product_{y}(y - \u03b2) = [ - (\u03b1^13 -1) ] * [ - (\u03b2^13 -1) ] = (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1). Wait, but actually, product_{y}(y - \u03b1) = - (\u03b1^13 -1) as per earlier, so the product over (y - \u03b1) is - (\u03b1^13 -1), same for \u03b2. Therefore, their product is [ - (\u03b1^13 -1) ] * [ - (\u03b2^13 -1) ] = (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1). Therefore, yes, that gives 8321. So the total product is 8321.\n\nWait, so the problem is asking for the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), which is exactly this product, so the answer is 8321. Then, the problem asks for the remainder when this is divided by 1000. Therefore, compute 8321 mod 1000. 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 = 8000, so 8321 - 8000 = 321. So 8321 mod 1000 is 321. Therefore, the remainder is 321. Hmm, but wait, let me confirm all steps again because that seems straightforward but maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nLet me recap:\n\nWe needed to compute the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z\u00b2 - 2 z + 2). We considered that as the product over (z - \u03b1)(z - \u03b2) where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are roots of z\u00b2 - 2 z +2 =0, which are 1 \u00b1i. Then, the product over all roots z of (z - \u03b1)(z - \u03b2) is product_{z}(z - \u03b1) * product_{z}(z - \u03b2). Each product is - (\u03b1^13 -1) and - (\u03b2^13 -1). So their product is (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1). Then, we computed \u03b1^13 and \u03b2^13 as -64(1 +i) and -64(1 -i) ??? Wait, hold on, wait in my earlier calculation, I had:\n\nWait, let me check \u03b1^13 again:\n\n\u03b1 = 1 +i. Its modulus is sqrt(2), angle \u03c0/4. Then \u03b1^13 has modulus (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64*sqrt(2). The angle is 13*(\u03c0/4) = 13\u03c0/4. 13\u03c0/4 - 3*2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 6\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 24\u03c0/4 = -11\u03c0/4, but perhaps better to subtract 3*2\u03c0? Wait, 13\u03c0/4 divided by 2\u03c0 is 13/8, so subtract 2\u03c0 once (which is 8\u03c0/4), so 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So angle 5\u03c0/4. So \u03b1^13 is modulus 64\u221a2, angle 5\u03c0/4. So in rectangular coordinates, that is 64\u221a2*(cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)). cos(5\u03c0/4)= -\u221a2/2, sin(5\u03c0/4)= -\u221a2/2. So multiplying:\n\n64\u221a2*(-\u221a2/2) for the real part: 64\u221a2*(-\u221a2)/2 = 64*(-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64. Similarly, the imaginary part is the same: 64\u221a2*(-\u221a2/2)i = -64i. So altogether, \u03b1^13 = -64 -64i. Wait, so that's different from my previous conclusion. Wait, in my initial calculation, I had:\n\nWait, above I thought that \u03b1^13 = -64(1 +i), which is exactly that. So -64(1 +i) is -64 -64i. So then \u03b1^13 -1 is -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i. Similarly, \u03b2 is 1 -i, so \u03b2^13 would be:\n\n\u03b2 =1 -i, modulus sqrt(2), angle -\u03c0/4. So \u03b2^13 angle is -13\u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (since angles are modulo 2\u03c0) gives -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 +16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So angle 3\u03c0/4. So modulus same: 64\u221a2. Then, cos(3\u03c0/4)= -\u221a2/2, sin(3\u03c0/4)=\u221a2/2. So:\n\n\u03b2^13 = 64\u221a2*(-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2) = 64\u221a2*(-\u221a2)/2 + 64\u221a2*(i\u221a2)/2 = 64*(-2)/2 + 64i*(2)/2 = 64*(-1) + 64i*(1) = -64 +64i. Therefore, \u03b2^13 = -64 +64i. Thus \u03b2^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i. So then:\n\n(\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1) = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). Let's compute that again.\n\nMultiply the two complex numbers:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 + cross terms? Wait, actually, using (a + b)(a - b) where a = -65, b =64i:\n\nWait, no, the first term is (-65 -64i), second is (-65 +64i). So:\n\nLet me write as [(-65) + (-64i)] * [(-65) +64i] = (-65)^2 + (-65)(64i) + (-64i)(-65) + (-64i)(64i)\n\nWait, perhaps better to do it step by step:\n\nFirst, multiply -65 by -65: 4225\n\nThen -65 *64i: -4160i\n\nThen -64i * -65: +4160i\n\nThen -64i *64i: -4096 i\u00b2 = -4096*(-1) = +4096.\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n4225 + (-4160i +4160i) +4096 = 4225 +0 +4096 = 8321. So that's correct. So indeed, the product is 8321. So 8321 mod 1000 is 321, as 8000 + 321 = 8321, so 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with remainder 321. Therefore, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, hold on, before I get too confident, let me check if there was a miscalculation in the product steps. Let me recalculate (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1):\n\n\u03b1^13 = -64 -64i, so \u03b1^13 -1 = -65 -64i\n\n\u03b2^13 = -64 +64i, so \u03b2^13 -1 = -65 +64i\n\nMultiplying (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i):\n\nLet me consider it as (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 + cross terms?\n\nWait, actually, it's of the form (a - b)(a + b) where a = -65, b =64i. Wait no, because the first term is -65 -64i, so it's ( -65 -64i )*( -65 +64i ) = [(-65) + (-64i)] * [(-65) +64i] = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 + terms? Wait, actually, using (x + y)(x - y) = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2, where x = -65, y =64i:\n\nWait, yes, if you let x = -65, y =64i, then (x + y)(x - y) = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2.\n\nSo x + y = (-65) +64i, but that's not exactly the case here. Wait, actually, in our case:\n\nFirst term: (-65 -64i)\n\nSecond term: (-65 +64i)\n\nSo, if you factor out the -1 from the first term's imaginary part, it's -65 -64i = - (65 +64i). Hmm, perhaps another way: Let me think of it as:\n\nLet me denote A = -65, B = 64i. Then the first term is (A - B), the second term is (A + B). Wait, no:\n\nWait, first term is (-65 -64i) = A + B where A = -65 and B = -64i. Then second term is (-65 +64i)= A + (-B). So (A + B)(A - B) = A\u00b2 - B\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, yes, so A is -65, B is 64i. Wait, actually:\n\nWait, let me set A = -65, B = 64i. Then, (-65 -64i) = A - B, and (-65 +64i) = A + B. Wait, no:\n\nWait, (-65 -64i) = A + (-64i) where A = -65. Hmm, maybe better not to overcomplicate.\n\nBut in any case, the product is (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - ( -4096 ) = 4225 +4096 = 8321. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the product is indeed 8321, mod 1000 is 321. Therefore, the answer is 321. Hmm. But let me think again: the problem states \"the remainder when [the product] is divided by 1000\". So 8321 mod 1000 is 321. That seems straightforward. Wait, but let me check once more the entire logic.\n\nWait, the key step is interpreting the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z\u00b2 -2 z + 2) as (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1). Let me verify that step again. Because product_{z}(z - \u03b1) * product_{z}(z - \u03b2) equals [product_{z}(z - \u03b1)] [product_{z}(z - \u03b2)]. And each of these products is equal to - (\u03b1^13 -1) and - (\u03b2^13 -1). \n\nWait, let me recall that for a polynomial f(z) = product_{roots} (z - root), then product_{roots} (root - a) = f(a). Wait, actually, if f(z) = product_{k} (z - root_k), then product_{k} (root_k - a) = f(a) ?\n\nWait, no, actually, f(a) = product_{k} (a - root_k). So product_{k} (root_k - a) = (-1)^{deg f} f(a).\n\nTherefore, if f(z) = z^13 -1, then product_{roots} (root - a) = (-1)^13 * f(a) = - (a^13 -1). So yes, exactly as before. Therefore, product_{z}(z - \u03b1) = product_{roots} (root - \u03b1) = - (\u03b1^13 -1). So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the product over (z\u00b2 -2 z +2) is equal to [ - (\u03b1^13 -1) ] * [ - (\u03b2^13 -1) ] = (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1). So that's solid. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is 8321 mod 1000 is 321. Therefore, the answer is 321. Wait, but hold on, before I conclude, perhaps check with a small example? Let me see if I can test this method with a smaller root of unity?\n\nSuppose instead of 13, take n=1, but that's trivial. Let me try n=3. Suppose we have third roots of unity. Let me compute the product over k=0,1,2 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nFirst, third roots of unity: 1, \u03c9, \u03c9\u00b2 where \u03c9\u00b3=1. Let me compute the product:\n\nFirst term (k=0): 2 - 2*1 +1\u00b2=2-2+1=1.\n\nSecond term (k=1): 2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nThird term (k=2): 2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9^4. But \u03c9^4=\u03c9.\n\nSo the third term is 2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9.\n\nSo total product is 1*(2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2)*(2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9).\n\nLet me compute (2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2)(2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9). Let me compute this:\n\nLet me denote A =2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2, B=2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9.\n\nMultiply A and B:\n\nFirst, expand term by term:\n\n2*2 =4\n\n2*(-2\u03c9\u00b2) = -4\u03c9\u00b2\n\n2*\u03c9 =2\u03c9\n\n-2\u03c9*2 = -4\u03c9\n\n-2\u03c9*(-2\u03c9\u00b2)= +4\u03c9^3. But \u03c9^3=1, so 4*1=4\n\n-2\u03c9*\u03c9 = -2\u03c9\u00b2\n\n\u03c9\u00b2*2 =2\u03c9\u00b2\n\n\u03c9\u00b2*(-2\u03c9\u00b2)= -2\u03c9^4= -2\u03c9\n\n\u03c9\u00b2*\u03c9 = \u03c9^3 =1.\n\nWait, this is getting messy, maybe better to do step by step:\n\nA*B = (2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2)(2 + \u03c9 -2\u03c9\u00b2)\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nLet me denote terms:\n\nFirst polynomial: 2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2\n\nSecond: 2 + \u03c9 -2\u03c9\u00b2\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n2*2 =4\n\n2*\u03c9 =2\u03c9\n\n2*(-2\u03c9\u00b2)= -4\u03c9\u00b2\n\n(-2\u03c9)*2 = -4\u03c9\n\n(-2\u03c9)*\u03c9 = -2\u03c9\u00b2\n\n(-2\u03c9)*(-2\u03c9\u00b2)= +4\u03c9^3 =4*1=4 (since \u03c9\u00b3=1)\n\n\u03c9\u00b2*2 =2\u03c9\u00b2\n\n\u03c9\u00b2*\u03c9 = \u03c9\u00b3=1\n\n\u03c9\u00b2*(-2\u03c9\u00b2)= -2\u03c9^4= -2\u03c9^(3+1)= -2\u03c9\n\nSo summing all terms:\n\nConstants: 4 +4 (from the 4\u03c9^3 term) +1 (from \u03c9^3)= 4+4+1=9?\n\nWait:\n\nWait, let me list all terms:\n\n1. 4 (from 2*2)\n\n2. 2\u03c9 (from 2*\u03c9)\n\n3. -4\u03c9\u00b2 (from 2*(-2\u03c9\u00b2))\n\n4. -4\u03c9 (from -2\u03c9 *2)\n\n5. -2\u03c9\u00b2 (from -2\u03c9*\u03c9)\n\n6. +4 (from -2\u03c9*(-2\u03c9\u00b2)= +4\u03c9^3=4)\n\n7. 2\u03c9\u00b2 (from \u03c9\u00b2*2)\n\n8. 1 (from \u03c9\u00b2*\u03c9 = \u03c9^3=1)\n\n9. -2\u03c9 (from \u03c9\u00b2*(-2\u03c9\u00b2)= -2\u03c9^4= -2\u03c9)\n\nSo let's collect like terms:\n\nConstants: 4 (term1) +4 (term6) +1 (term8) = 4 +4 +1 =9\n\n\u03c9 terms: 2\u03c9 (term2) -4\u03c9 (term4) -2\u03c9 (term9) = (2 -4 -2)\u03c9 = (-4\u03c9)\n\n\u03c9\u00b2 terms: -4\u03c9\u00b2 (term3) -2\u03c9\u00b2 (term5) +2\u03c9\u00b2 (term7) = (-4 -2 +2)\u03c9\u00b2 = (-4\u03c9\u00b2)\n\nSo total expression is 9 -4\u03c9 -4\u03c9\u00b2.\n\nHmm, but in the third roots of unity, 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 =0, so \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1. Therefore, substituting:\n\n9 -4(\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2) =9 -4*(-1)=9 +4=13. So the product is 13.\n\nAlternatively, using my formula:\n\nThe quadratic equation z\u00b2 -2 z +2 has roots \u03b1 and \u03b2. Then, the product over all 3rd roots of unity of (z\u00b2 -2 z +2) would be (\u03b1^3 -1)(\u03b2^3 -1). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, \u03b1=1+i, \u03b2=1\u2212i. Then \u03b1\u00b3 and \u03b2\u00b3.\n\nCompute \u03b1\u00b3: (1+i)^3 =1 +3i +3i\u00b2 +i\u00b3 =1 +3i -3 -i = (-2 +2i). Similarly, \u03b2\u00b3=(1\u2212i)^3 =1 -3i +3i\u00b2 -i\u00b3=1 -3i -3 +i= (-2 -2i). Then, \u03b1\u00b3\u22121 = (-2 +2i)\u22121= -3 +2i, \u03b2\u00b3\u22121=(-2 -2i)\u22121= -3\u22122i. Then, their product is (-3+2i)(-3\u22122i)=9 +6i -6i -4i\u00b2=9 +4=13. Which matches the direct calculation. So the formula works here. So in the case of n=3, the product is 13, which mod 1000 would be 13, which is correct. So the method works here.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem with n=13, the product is 8321, mod 1000 gives 321. Therefore, unless I made an arithmetic mistake in calculations, that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more the value of (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1)=8321. The steps all check out. The modulus and angles for \u03b1 and \u03b2 were correctly calculated, and the multiplication was correct. So I think this is right.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 321.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{321}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, roots of unity, products... I remember that products over roots of unity can sometimes be related to cyclotomic polynomials, but I need to think carefully here.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. So, \u03c9^13 = 1, and since \u03c9 \u2260 1, it's one of the other roots. The problem is asking for the product over all k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Since \u03c9^13 = 1, the exponents can be simplified modulo 13, but maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nLet me first see if I can rewrite the term inside the product. The term is 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow? Let's see:\n\nLooking at 2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}, perhaps factor out a 2? That would give 2(1 - \u03c9^k) + \u03c9^{2k}. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe consider it as a quadratic in \u03c9^k?\n\nLet me think of it as a quadratic in terms of z = \u03c9^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2z + z\u00b2. So that's z\u00b2 - 2z + 2. Hmm, so maybe the product over k from 0 to 12 of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2) where z = \u03c9^k? Wait, but actually each term in the product is (z^2 - 2z + 2) where z is each 13th root of unity. So the product is over all 13th roots of unity of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2). But since we have all roots except 1? Wait, actually, the roots include \u03c9^0 = 1 as well. Wait, the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1, but the product is over k from 0 to 12, so that includes k=0 where \u03c9^0=1. So actually, the product includes all 13th roots of unity, but the problem states \u03c9 \u2260 1, but maybe that's just to indicate that we're not considering the trivial root?\n\nAnyway, proceeding: the product over all 13th roots of unity z of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2). Hmm, so maybe I can relate this product to the value of some polynomial evaluated at certain points?\n\nI recall that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over all primitive nth roots of unity of (x - \u03b6) is the nth cyclotomic polynomial. But here, the product is over all 13th roots of unity (since 13 is prime, all roots except 1 are primitive). Wait, but the term here is (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2), not (z - something). So perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the product over all z (the 13th roots of unity) of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2). Since z^13 = 1, maybe we can find a polynomial whose roots are these z's, and then evaluate the product as the value of some related polynomial?\n\nThe minimal polynomial for the 13th roots of unity is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1, since \u03a6_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1). But how does that help here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that for any polynomial P(z), the product over all roots z of P(z) of (Q(z)) is equal to the resultant of P(z) and Q(z), or something like that. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, here's an idea: Let me consider the product over all 13th roots of unity z of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2). Let me denote this product as \u03a0_{z^{13}=1} (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2). To compute this, perhaps consider the polynomial f(z) = z^13 - 1, whose roots are all the 13th roots of unity. Then, the product over all roots z of f(z) of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2) is equal to the resultant of f(z) and (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2), but I might be getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Let me consider that if I have a function Q(z) = z\u00b2 - 2z + 2, then the product over all 13th roots of unity of Q(z) is equal to the product over all z with z^13 = 1 of Q(z). Maybe this can be written as the product over z of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2) = product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2).\n\nHmm, maybe I can write this as product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Let me consider substituting variables here. Let me let y = \u03c9^k. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, as k runs from 0 to 12, y runs through all 13th roots of unity. So the product becomes product_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2). \n\nHmm, so maybe I can write this as product_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2). Let me think of this as evaluating a certain product over roots. To compute this product, perhaps consider that the product over all roots y of (y^2 - 2y + 2) is equal to the product over all roots of (y - \u03b1)(y - \u03b2), where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are roots of the quadratic equation z\u00b2 - 2z + 2 = 0. Wait, so the product over all y of (y - \u03b1)(y - \u03b2) would be [product_{y}(y - \u03b1)] * [product_{y}(y - \u03b2)].\n\nTherefore, the total product is [product_{y^13=1} (y - \u03b1)] * [product_{y^13=1} (y - \u03b2)].\n\nSo, if I can compute each of these products separately, then multiply them together. The product over all y^13 = 1 of (y - \u03b1) is equal to the value of the polynomial f(y) = y^13 - 1 evaluated at y = \u03b1. Because f(y) = product_{y^13=1} (y - \u03b1) when \u03b1 is a root? Wait, no, actually, the polynomial f(y) = y^13 - 1 factors as product_{y^13=1} (y - \u03b1), so if we evaluate f(\u03b1') for some \u03b1', then it's product_{y^13=1} (\u03b1' - y). Wait, actually, that's the same as product_{y} (y - \u03b1') with a sign change depending on the degree. Let me check:\n\nThe polynomial f(y) = y^13 - 1 has roots at all 13th roots of unity. So, if I plug in some value \u03b1 into f(y), I get f(\u03b1) = \u03b1^13 - 1, which is equal to product_{y^13=1} (\u03b1 - y). Therefore, product_{y^13=1} (y - \u03b1) = (-1)^13 product_{y^13=1} (\u03b1 - y) = - (\u03b1^13 - 1). Since 13 is odd, so (-1)^13 = -1. Therefore, product_{y^13=1} (y - \u03b1) = - (\u03b1^13 - 1).\n\nTherefore, similarly, product_{y^13=1} (y - \u03b1) = - (\u03b1^13 - 1), and same for \u03b2. Therefore, the total product we need is [ - (\u03b1^13 - 1) ] * [ - (\u03b2^13 - 1) ] = [ (\u03b1^13 - 1)(\u03b2^13 - 1) ].\n\nWait, hold on, let me verify again:\n\nproduct_{y}(y - \u03b1) = - (\u03b1^13 - 1)\n\nTherefore, product_{y}(y - \u03b1) * product_{y}(y - \u03b2) = [ - (\u03b1^13 - 1) ] * [ - (\u03b2^13 - 1) ] = (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1).\n\nTherefore, the original product is (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1).\n\nBut \u03b1 and \u03b2 are roots of the quadratic equation z\u00b2 - 2z + 2 =0, so let me compute \u03b1^13 and \u03b2^13.\n\nFirst, let me find \u03b1 and \u03b2. The quadratic equation is z\u00b2 - 2 z + 2 =0, so the roots are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 -8)] /2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] /2 = [2 \u00b1 2i]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So \u03b1 = 1 + i and \u03b2 = 1 - i.\n\nTherefore, \u03b1 = 1 + i, \u03b2 =1 - i.\n\nTherefore, \u03b1^13 and \u03b2^13. Hmm, complex numbers raised to the 13th power. Let me compute \u03b1^13 and \u03b2^13.\n\nFirst, note that \u03b1 = 1 + i. Let me write this in polar form. The modulus of \u03b1 is sqrt(1\u00b2 +1\u00b2)=sqrt(2). The angle (argument) is 45 degrees, or \u03c0/4 radians. So \u03b1 can be written as sqrt(2) e^{i \u03c0/4}. Similarly, \u03b2 is 1 - i, which is sqrt(2) e^{-i \u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, \u03b1^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i (13 * \u03c0/4)} and \u03b2^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i (13 * \u03c0/4)}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nThe angle 13 * \u03c0/4: Let's compute that modulo 2\u03c0. 13 * \u03c0/4 = (12 +1)\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. Since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0). Wait, 13*(\u03c0/4) divided by 2\u03c0: 13/8, so 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0*1 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Wait, let me see:\n\nAlternatively, 13\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, but 3\u03c0 is \u03c0 more than 2\u03c0. So subtract 2\u03c0: 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So the angle for \u03b1^13 is 5\u03c0/4, and for \u03b2^13 it's -5\u03c0/4 (since it was -13\u03c0/4, which is equivalent to -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = ( -13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4, but wait, maybe I need to compute it properly.\n\nWait, let me do it again for \u03b2:\n\n\u03b2^13: the angle is -13\u03c0/4. Let's add 4\u03c0 (since angles are modulo 2\u03c0). So -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 +16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. Therefore, the angle for \u03b2^13 is 3\u03c0/4. Wait, but that seems inconsistent? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, original angle for \u03b2 is -\u03c0/4, so multiplying by 13 gives angle -13\u03c0/4. To get this within 0 to 2\u03c0, add 4\u03c0 (which is 16\u03c0/4):\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So the angle is 3\u03c0/4. So:\n\n\u03b1^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i 5\u03c0/4}\n\n\u03b2^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i 3\u03c0/4}\n\nTherefore, \u03b1^13 -1 and \u03b2^13 -1.\n\nFirst, let me compute \u03b1^13:\n\nCompute modulus: (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). The angle is 5\u03c0/4, so \u03b1^13 = 64\u221a2 [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)].\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2. So,\n\n\u03b1^13 = 64\u221a2 [ -\u221a2/2 - i\u221a2/2 ] = 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2)(1 + i) = 64\u221a2*(-\u221a2/2)*(1 +i)\n\nCompute \u221a2 * \u221a2 = 2, so:\n\n= 64 * (-2/2)*(1 +i) = 64*(-1)*(1 +i) = -64(1 +i)\n\nSimilarly, \u03b2^13:\n\n\u03b2^13 = 64\u221a2 [cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4)].\n\ncos(3\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2, sin(3\u03c0/4)=\u221a2/2.\n\nThus,\n\n\u03b2^13 = 64\u221a2 [ -\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2 ] = 64\u221a2*(-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2 )\n\nSame steps:\n\n= 64\u221a2*( -\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2 ) = 64*( - (\u221a2 * \u221a2)/2 + i (\u221a2 * \u221a2)/2 )\n\n= 64*(-2/2 + i 2/2) = 64*(-1 + i)\n\nTherefore, \u03b2^13 = 64(-1 + i)\n\nTherefore, \u03b1^13 -1 = -64(1 +i) -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i\n\nWait, wait, hold on. Wait, \u03b1^13 is -64(1 +i). Therefore, \u03b1^13 -1 is -64(1 +i) -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i. Similarly, \u03b2^13 -1 is 64(-1 +i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nSo (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1) = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). Let me compute that.\n\nMultiply the two complex numbers:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 + terms with cross products? Wait, actually, using (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 if the terms are a and b, but here it's (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = [(-65) + (-64i)] * [(-65) + 64i] = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2. Wait, yes, because (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 where a = -65 and b = -64i? Wait, no, let me see:\n\nWait, actually, the first term is (-65 -64i) and the second is (-65 +64i). Let me write it as [(-65) -64i][(-65)+64i] = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2. Because (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 where a = -65, b =64i. Wait, but that would be ( (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 ). So yes.\n\nSo compute:\n\n(-65)^2 = 4225\n\n(64i)^2 = 64\u00b2 * i\u00b2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096\n\nThus, the expression becomes 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, so (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1) = 8321. Therefore, going back to the original product:\n\nThe product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 - 2y +2) = (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1) = 8321. Wait, but hold on, let me double-check the steps because this is critical.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\nproduct_{y}(y - \u03b1) * product_{y}(y - \u03b2) = [ - (\u03b1^13 -1) ] * [ - (\u03b2^13 -1) ] = (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1). Wait, but actually, product_{y}(y - \u03b1) = - (\u03b1^13 -1) as per earlier, so the product over (y - \u03b1) is - (\u03b1^13 -1), same for \u03b2. Therefore, their product is [ - (\u03b1^13 -1) ] * [ - (\u03b2^13 -1) ] = (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1). Therefore, yes, that gives 8321. So the total product is 8321.\n\nWait, so the problem is asking for the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), which is exactly this product, so the answer is 8321. Then, the problem asks for the remainder when this is divided by 1000. Therefore, compute 8321 mod 1000. 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 = 8000, so 8321 - 8000 = 321. So 8321 mod 1000 is 321. Therefore, the remainder is 321. Hmm, but wait, let me confirm all steps again because that seems straightforward but maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nLet me recap:\n\nWe needed to compute the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z\u00b2 - 2 z + 2). We considered that as the product over (z - \u03b1)(z - \u03b2) where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are roots of z\u00b2 - 2 z +2 =0, which are 1 \u00b1i. Then, the product over all roots z of (z - \u03b1)(z - \u03b2) is product_{z}(z - \u03b1) * product_{z}(z - \u03b2). Each product is - (\u03b1^13 -1) and - (\u03b2^13 -1). So their product is (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1). Then, we computed \u03b1^13 and \u03b2^13 as -64(1 +i) and -64(1 -i) ??? Wait, hold on, wait in my earlier calculation, I had:\n\nWait, let me check \u03b1^13 again:\n\n\u03b1 = 1 +i. Its modulus is sqrt(2), angle \u03c0/4. Then \u03b1^13 has modulus (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64*sqrt(2). The angle is 13*(\u03c0/4) = 13\u03c0/4. 13\u03c0/4 - 3*2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 6\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 24\u03c0/4 = -11\u03c0/4, but perhaps better to subtract 3*2\u03c0? Wait, 13\u03c0/4 divided by 2\u03c0 is 13/8, so subtract 2\u03c0 once (which is 8\u03c0/4), so 13\u03c0/4 - 2\u03c0 = 13\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. So angle 5\u03c0/4. So \u03b1^13 is modulus 64\u221a2, angle 5\u03c0/4. So in rectangular coordinates, that is 64\u221a2*(cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)). cos(5\u03c0/4)= -\u221a2/2, sin(5\u03c0/4)= -\u221a2/2. So multiplying:\n\n64\u221a2*(-\u221a2/2) for the real part: 64\u221a2*(-\u221a2)/2 = 64*(-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64. Similarly, the imaginary part is the same: 64\u221a2*(-\u221a2/2)i = -64i. So altogether, \u03b1^13 = -64 -64i. Wait, so that's different from my previous conclusion. Wait, in my initial calculation, I had:\n\nWait, above I thought that \u03b1^13 = -64(1 +i), which is exactly that. So -64(1 +i) is -64 -64i. So then \u03b1^13 -1 is -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i. Similarly, \u03b2 is 1 -i, so \u03b2^13 would be:\n\n\u03b2 =1 -i, modulus sqrt(2), angle -\u03c0/4. So \u03b2^13 angle is -13\u03c0/4. Adding 4\u03c0 (since angles are modulo 2\u03c0) gives -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0 +16\u03c0)/4 = 3\u03c0/4. So angle 3\u03c0/4. So modulus same: 64\u221a2. Then, cos(3\u03c0/4)= -\u221a2/2, sin(3\u03c0/4)=\u221a2/2. So:\n\n\u03b2^13 = 64\u221a2*(-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2) = 64\u221a2*(-\u221a2)/2 + 64\u221a2*(i\u221a2)/2 = 64*(-2)/2 + 64i*(2)/2 = 64*(-1) + 64i*(1) = -64 +64i. Therefore, \u03b2^13 = -64 +64i. Thus \u03b2^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i. So then:\n\n(\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1) = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). Let's compute that again.\n\nMultiply the two complex numbers:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 + cross terms? Wait, actually, using (a + b)(a - b) where a = -65, b =64i:\n\nWait, no, the first term is (-65 -64i), second is (-65 +64i). So:\n\nLet me write as [(-65) + (-64i)] * [(-65) +64i] = (-65)^2 + (-65)(64i) + (-64i)(-65) + (-64i)(64i)\n\nWait, perhaps better to do it step by step:\n\nFirst, multiply -65 by -65: 4225\n\nThen -65 *64i: -4160i\n\nThen -64i * -65: +4160i\n\nThen -64i *64i: -4096 i\u00b2 = -4096*(-1) = +4096.\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n4225 + (-4160i +4160i) +4096 = 4225 +0 +4096 = 8321. So that's correct. So indeed, the product is 8321. So 8321 mod 1000 is 321, as 8000 + 321 = 8321, so 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with remainder 321. Therefore, the remainder is 321.\n\nBut wait, hold on, before I get too confident, let me check if there was a miscalculation in the product steps. Let me recalculate (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1):\n\n\u03b1^13 = -64 -64i, so \u03b1^13 -1 = -65 -64i\n\n\u03b2^13 = -64 +64i, so \u03b2^13 -1 = -65 +64i\n\nMultiplying (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i):\n\nLet me consider it as (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 + cross terms?\n\nWait, actually, it's of the form (a - b)(a + b) where a = -65, b =64i. Wait no, because the first term is -65 -64i, so it's ( -65 -64i )*( -65 +64i ) = [(-65) + (-64i)] * [(-65) +64i] = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 + terms? Wait, actually, using (x + y)(x - y) = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2, where x = -65, y =64i:\n\nWait, yes, if you let x = -65, y =64i, then (x + y)(x - y) = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2.\n\nSo x + y = (-65) +64i, but that's not exactly the case here. Wait, actually, in our case:\n\nFirst term: (-65 -64i)\n\nSecond term: (-65 +64i)\n\nSo, if you factor out the -1 from the first term's imaginary part, it's -65 -64i = - (65 +64i). Hmm, perhaps another way: Let me think of it as:\n\nLet me denote A = -65, B = 64i. Then the first term is (A - B), the second term is (A + B). Wait, no:\n\nWait, first term is (-65 -64i) = A + B where A = -65 and B = -64i. Then second term is (-65 +64i)= A + (-B). So (A + B)(A - B) = A\u00b2 - B\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, yes, so A is -65, B is 64i. Wait, actually:\n\nWait, let me set A = -65, B = 64i. Then, (-65 -64i) = A - B, and (-65 +64i) = A + B. Wait, no:\n\nWait, (-65 -64i) = A + (-64i) where A = -65. Hmm, maybe better not to overcomplicate.\n\nBut in any case, the product is (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - ( -4096 ) = 4225 +4096 = 8321. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the product is indeed 8321, mod 1000 is 321. Therefore, the answer is 321. Hmm. But let me think again: the problem states \"the remainder when [the product] is divided by 1000\". So 8321 mod 1000 is 321. That seems straightforward. Wait, but let me check once more the entire logic.\n\nWait, the key step is interpreting the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z\u00b2 -2 z + 2) as (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1). Let me verify that step again. Because product_{z}(z - \u03b1) * product_{z}(z - \u03b2) equals [product_{z}(z - \u03b1)] [product_{z}(z - \u03b2)]. And each of these products is equal to - (\u03b1^13 -1) and - (\u03b2^13 -1). \n\nWait, let me recall that for a polynomial f(z) = product_{roots} (z - root), then product_{roots} (root - a) = f(a). Wait, actually, if f(z) = product_{k} (z - root_k), then product_{k} (root_k - a) = f(a) ?\n\nWait, no, actually, f(a) = product_{k} (a - root_k). So product_{k} (root_k - a) = (-1)^{deg f} f(a).\n\nTherefore, if f(z) = z^13 -1, then product_{roots} (root - a) = (-1)^13 * f(a) = - (a^13 -1). So yes, exactly as before. Therefore, product_{z}(z - \u03b1) = product_{roots} (root - \u03b1) = - (\u03b1^13 -1). So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the product over (z\u00b2 -2 z +2) is equal to [ - (\u03b1^13 -1) ] * [ - (\u03b2^13 -1) ] = (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1). So that's solid. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is 8321 mod 1000 is 321. Therefore, the answer is 321. Wait, but hold on, before I conclude, perhaps check with a small example? Let me see if I can test this method with a smaller root of unity?\n\nSuppose instead of 13, take n=1, but that's trivial. Let me try n=3. Suppose we have third roots of unity. Let me compute the product over k=0,1,2 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}).\n\nFirst, third roots of unity: 1, \u03c9, \u03c9\u00b2 where \u03c9\u00b3=1. Let me compute the product:\n\nFirst term (k=0): 2 - 2*1 +1\u00b2=2-2+1=1.\n\nSecond term (k=1): 2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nThird term (k=2): 2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9^4. But \u03c9^4=\u03c9.\n\nSo the third term is 2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9.\n\nSo total product is 1*(2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2)*(2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9).\n\nLet me compute (2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2)(2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9). Let me compute this:\n\nLet me denote A =2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2, B=2 -2\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9.\n\nMultiply A and B:\n\nFirst, expand term by term:\n\n2*2 =4\n\n2*(-2\u03c9\u00b2) = -4\u03c9\u00b2\n\n2*\u03c9 =2\u03c9\n\n-2\u03c9*2 = -4\u03c9\n\n-2\u03c9*(-2\u03c9\u00b2)= +4\u03c9^3. But \u03c9^3=1, so 4*1=4\n\n-2\u03c9*\u03c9 = -2\u03c9\u00b2\n\n\u03c9\u00b2*2 =2\u03c9\u00b2\n\n\u03c9\u00b2*(-2\u03c9\u00b2)= -2\u03c9^4= -2\u03c9\n\n\u03c9\u00b2*\u03c9 = \u03c9^3 =1.\n\nWait, this is getting messy, maybe better to do step by step:\n\nA*B = (2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2)(2 + \u03c9 -2\u03c9\u00b2)\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nLet me denote terms:\n\nFirst polynomial: 2 -2\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2\n\nSecond: 2 + \u03c9 -2\u03c9\u00b2\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n2*2 =4\n\n2*\u03c9 =2\u03c9\n\n2*(-2\u03c9\u00b2)= -4\u03c9\u00b2\n\n(-2\u03c9)*2 = -4\u03c9\n\n(-2\u03c9)*\u03c9 = -2\u03c9\u00b2\n\n(-2\u03c9)*(-2\u03c9\u00b2)= +4\u03c9^3 =4*1=4 (since \u03c9\u00b3=1)\n\n\u03c9\u00b2*2 =2\u03c9\u00b2\n\n\u03c9\u00b2*\u03c9 = \u03c9\u00b3=1\n\n\u03c9\u00b2*(-2\u03c9\u00b2)= -2\u03c9^4= -2\u03c9^(3+1)= -2\u03c9\n\nSo summing all terms:\n\nConstants: 4 +4 (from the 4\u03c9^3 term) +1 (from \u03c9^3)= 4+4+1=9?\n\nWait:\n\nWait, let me list all terms:\n\n1. 4 (from 2*2)\n\n2. 2\u03c9 (from 2*\u03c9)\n\n3. -4\u03c9\u00b2 (from 2*(-2\u03c9\u00b2))\n\n4. -4\u03c9 (from -2\u03c9 *2)\n\n5. -2\u03c9\u00b2 (from -2\u03c9*\u03c9)\n\n6. +4 (from -2\u03c9*(-2\u03c9\u00b2)= +4\u03c9^3=4)\n\n7. 2\u03c9\u00b2 (from \u03c9\u00b2*2)\n\n8. 1 (from \u03c9\u00b2*\u03c9 = \u03c9^3=1)\n\n9. -2\u03c9 (from \u03c9\u00b2*(-2\u03c9\u00b2)= -2\u03c9^4= -2\u03c9)\n\nSo let's collect like terms:\n\nConstants: 4 (term1) +4 (term6) +1 (term8) = 4 +4 +1 =9\n\n\u03c9 terms: 2\u03c9 (term2) -4\u03c9 (term4) -2\u03c9 (term9) = (2 -4 -2)\u03c9 = (-4\u03c9)\n\n\u03c9\u00b2 terms: -4\u03c9\u00b2 (term3) -2\u03c9\u00b2 (term5) +2\u03c9\u00b2 (term7) = (-4 -2 +2)\u03c9\u00b2 = (-4\u03c9\u00b2)\n\nSo total expression is 9 -4\u03c9 -4\u03c9\u00b2.\n\nHmm, but in the third roots of unity, 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 =0, so \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1. Therefore, substituting:\n\n9 -4(\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2) =9 -4*(-1)=9 +4=13. So the product is 13.\n\nAlternatively, using my formula:\n\nThe quadratic equation z\u00b2 -2 z +2 has roots \u03b1 and \u03b2. Then, the product over all 3rd roots of unity of (z\u00b2 -2 z +2) would be (\u03b1^3 -1)(\u03b2^3 -1). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, \u03b1=1+i, \u03b2=1\u2212i. Then \u03b1\u00b3 and \u03b2\u00b3.\n\nCompute \u03b1\u00b3: (1+i)^3 =1 +3i +3i\u00b2 +i\u00b3 =1 +3i -3 -i = (-2 +2i). Similarly, \u03b2\u00b3=(1\u2212i)^3 =1 -3i +3i\u00b2 -i\u00b3=1 -3i -3 +i= (-2 -2i). Then, \u03b1\u00b3\u22121 = (-2 +2i)\u22121= -3 +2i, \u03b2\u00b3\u22121=(-2 -2i)\u22121= -3\u22122i. Then, their product is (-3+2i)(-3\u22122i)=9 +6i -6i -4i\u00b2=9 +4=13. Which matches the direct calculation. So the formula works here. So in the case of n=3, the product is 13, which mod 1000 would be 13, which is correct. So the method works here.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem with n=13, the product is 8321, mod 1000 gives 321. Therefore, unless I made an arithmetic mistake in calculations, that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more the value of (\u03b1^13 -1)(\u03b2^13 -1)=8321. The steps all check out. The modulus and angles for \u03b1 and \u03b2 were correctly calculated, and the multiplication was correct. So I think this is right.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 321.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{321}\n\n\nGiven \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity, we need to find the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000.\n\nFirst, we recognize that the product can be rewritten in terms of the roots of unity. Let \\(z = \\omega^k\\), then the expression inside the product becomes \\(z^2 - 2z + 2\\). The product we need is over all 13th roots of unity \\(z\\), so we need to compute \\(\\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\\).\n\nThe quadratic \\(z^2 - 2z + 2\\) has roots \\(\\alpha = 1 + i\\) and \\(\\beta = 1 - i\\). The product over all 13th roots of unity can be expressed as \\(\\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - \\alpha) \\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - \\beta)\\).\n\nUsing the polynomial \\(f(z) = z^{13} - 1\\), which has roots at all 13th roots of unity, we know:\n\\[\n\\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - \\alpha) = -(\\alpha^{13} - 1) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - \\beta) = -(\\beta^{13} - 1)\n\\]\nThus, the product becomes:\n\\[\n\\left[ -(\\alpha^{13} - 1) \\right] \\left[ -(\\beta^{13} - 1) \\right] = (\\alpha^{13} - 1)(\\beta^{13} - 1)\n\\]\n\nNext, we compute \\(\\alpha^{13}\\) and \\(\\beta^{13}\\). Converting \\(\\alpha = 1 + i\\) and \\(\\beta = 1 - i\\) to polar form:\n- \\(\\alpha\\) has modulus \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and angle \\(\\pi/4\\), so \\(\\alpha^{13} = ( \\sqrt{2} )^{13} e^{i \\cdot 13\\pi/4} = 2^{13/2} e^{i \\cdot 5\\pi/4} = -64(1 + i)\\).\n- \\(\\beta\\) has modulus \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and angle \\(-\\pi/4\\), so \\(\\beta^{13} = ( \\sqrt{2} )^{13} e^{-i \\cdot 13\\pi/4} = 2^{13/2} e^{-i \\cdot 3\\pi/4} = -64(1 - i)\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\alpha^{13} - 1\\) and \\(\\beta^{13} - 1\\):\n- \\(\\alpha^{13} - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -65 - 64i\\)\n- \\(\\beta^{13} - 1 = -64(1 - i) - 1 = -65 + 64i\\)\n\nMultiplying these results:\n\\[\n(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321\n\\]\n\nFinally, finding the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000:\n\\[\n8321 \\mod 1000 = 321\n\\]\n\nThus, the remainder is \\(\\boxed{321}\\).",
