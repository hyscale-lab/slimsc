      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the distance from the incenter (I think that's what point I is) of a tetrahedron to each of its faces. The tetrahedron has edges with specific lengths given: AB=CD=\u221a41, AC=BD=\u221a80, and BC=AD=\u221a89. The answer needs to be in the form m\u221an / p, with m and p coprime and n square-free, then sum m + n + p.\n\nFirst, let me recall that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the distance from the incenter to each face) can be calculated by the formula 3 times the volume divided by the sum of the areas of the faces. Wait, actually, in 3D, the formula for the inradius r is Volume divided by the surface area (total surface area?), but let me confirm.\n\nWait, in a tetrahedron, the formula is similar to the 2D case but scaled. In 2D, inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. In 3D, the inradius is 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. Because the volume can be thought of as (1/3)*surface area * inradius. So yes, r = (3V)/A_total. Hmm, let me check that again.\n\nThe formula for the inradius of a tetrahedron is indeed r = 3V / A_total, where V is the volume and A_total is the sum of the areas of the four faces. So I need to compute the volume of the tetrahedron and the areas of all four faces, then plug into this formula.\n\nSo first, I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron. Given the edge lengths, but the edges are given in a symmetric way. The edges are AB=CD=\u221a41, AC=BD=\u221a80, and BC=AD=\u221a89. So this tetrahedron has opposite edges equal. That's interesting. Maybe this is a kind of \"isohedral\" tetrahedron, or maybe we can use some symmetry here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can assign coordinates to the vertices so that we can compute the volume.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the tetrahedron. Since the edges have this symmetric property, perhaps we can set it up in a coordinate system where the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nLet me think: Let me denote the vertices as A, B, C, D. Let me try to place the points in 3D space such that the coordinates can be set up in a way that the edge lengths correspond.\n\nGiven the symmetry in edge lengths, maybe the tetrahedron can be embedded in coordinates so that the coordinates of the four vertices are arranged symmetrically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, which is sometimes called a \"disphenoid\". A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. So this must be a disphenoid. In such a tetrahedron, all faces are congruent triangles, but here, let's see:\n\nWait, in our case, the edges are AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC. So the opposite edges are equal. So yes, this is a disphenoid. For a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula involving the edge lengths. Alternatively, maybe there is a formula for the volume of a disphenoid.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to set coordinates for a disphenoid.\n\nIn a disphenoid, you can set coordinates such that the vertices are (a, b, c), (-a, -b, c), (-a, b, -c), (a, -b, -c) or something similar. Wait, perhaps that's for a more symmetric case. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps we can place the vertices such that the coordinates are symmetric with respect to the origin?\n\nAlternatively, maybe let me set vertex A at (x, y, z), B at (-x, -y, z), C at (-x, y, -z), D at (x, -y, -z). Then the edges would be symmetric. Let me see if this would work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to place the points in such a way that calculations are easier. Let me try to place vertex A at (0,0,0). Let me see if I can assign coordinates step by step.\n\nLet me suppose point A is at the origin (0,0,0). Let me denote coordinates for points B, C, D as follows:\n\nLet me let point B be at (p, 0, 0), along the x-axis. Then point D can be placed somewhere, but since AD = BC = sqrt(89), which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this coordinate approach is going to be too tedious. Perhaps there's a formula for the volume of a disphenoid?\n\nWait, after a quick recall, for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated if we know the three pairs of opposite edges. Let me check if such a formula exists.\n\nYes, for a disphenoid with opposite edges a, b, c (so each pair of opposite edges equal to a, b, c respectively), the volume is (2/3) times the square root of (a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u00b2 - (sum of squares of edges)/something). Wait, perhaps I need to think more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the volume can be found using the formula involving the edge lengths. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Cayley-Menger determinant. Since we know all the edge lengths, the Cayley-Menger determinant can compute the volume.\n\nYes, that might be the way to go. Let me recall the formula.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:\n\nVolume\u00b2 = (1/288) * determinant of the matrix:\n\n0 1 1 1 1\n\n1 0  a\u00b2 b\u00b2 c\u00b2\n\n1  a\u00b2 0  d\u00b2 e\u00b2\n\n1  b\u00b2 d\u00b2 0  f\u00b2\n\n1  c\u00b2 e\u00b2 f\u00b2 0\n\nSo, if I can plug in the given edge lengths into this determinant, compute its value, take the square root, then divide by 288^(1/2), so Volume = sqrt(det)/sqrt(288). Hmm, but let me confirm the exact formula.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is:\n\nVolume\u00b2 = (1/288) * |CM|, where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant. So Volume is sqrt(|CM| / 288).\n\nSo, first, I need to assign the edges properly.\n\nLet me denote the edges:\n\nAB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89)\n\nBC = sqrt(89), BD = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41)\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check the given edges again:\n\nThe problem states:\n\nAB = CD = sqrt(41),\n\nAC = BD = sqrt(80),\n\nand BC = AD = sqrt(89).\n\nTherefore, edges:\n\nAB = sqrt(41),\n\nAC = sqrt(80),\n\nAD = sqrt(89),\n\nBC = sqrt(89),\n\nBD = sqrt(80),\n\nCD = sqrt(41).\n\nSo, in terms of the Cayley-Menger determinant, let me label the points as A, B, C, D.\n\nLet me assign:\n\nAB = sqrt(41),\n\nAC = sqrt(80),\n\nAD = sqrt(89),\n\nBC = sqrt(89),\n\nBD = sqrt(80),\n\nCD = sqrt(41).\n\nTherefore, in the Cayley-Menger matrix, the entries are as follows:\n\nThe first row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n\nSecond row: [1, 0, AB\u00b2, AC\u00b2, AD\u00b2] = [1, 0, 41, 80, 89].\n\nThird row: [1, AB\u00b2, 0, BC\u00b2, BD\u00b2] = [1, 41, 0, 89, 80].\n\nFourth row: [1, AC\u00b2, BC\u00b2, 0, CD\u00b2] = [1, 80, 89, 0, 41].\n\nFifth row: [1, AD\u00b2, BD\u00b2, CD\u00b2, 0] = [1, 89, 80, 41, 0].\n\nSo the Cayley-Menger determinant is the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. Let me write this out step by step.\n\nLet me denote the matrix as M:\n\nRow 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]\n\nRow 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]\n\nRow 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]\n\nRow 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]\n\nSo, we need to compute determinant(M).\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe there is some symmetry here to exploit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expanding the determinant would be tedious, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps first compute the volume using another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a disphenoid, maybe the volume can be calculated using another formula. Let me recall that in a disphenoid, the volume is given by (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / (  something )?\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since in a disphenoid, the faces are congruent triangles? Wait, in this case, let me check if all the faces are congruent.\n\nCompute the lengths of edges for each face.\n\nFace ABC: edges AB=\u221a41, BC=\u221a89, AC=\u221a80.\n\nFace ABD: edges AB=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89.\n\nFace ACD: edges AC=\u221a80, CD=\u221a41, AD=\u221a89.\n\nFace BCD: edges BC=\u221a89, CD=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80.\n\nSo each face has sides of length sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Therefore, all four faces are congruent triangles. So it is a disphenoid with congruent triangular faces. So each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Therefore, each face is congruent, so the tetrahedron is isohedral? Wait, but a disphenoid is a type of isohedral tetrahedron? Maybe. Anyway, since all the faces are congruent, perhaps the volume can be calculated using the formula for a disphenoid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in such a tetrahedron, the volume can be calculated as (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / (something). Wait, perhaps similar to the formula for a regular tetrahedron but generalized?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since all the faces are congruent, the area of each face can be calculated, and then the volume can be found via some relation.\n\nAlternatively, let me first compute the area of one face. Let's compute the area of triangle ABC with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Let me use Heron's formula.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter:\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2. Hmm, this might get messy, but perhaps squaring the area squared might help?\n\nAlternatively, Heron's formula says that area squared is s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c). But with square roots, this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps use coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, since all the edges of the face are known, perhaps compute the area via vectors?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that since all the faces are congruent, the tetrahedron is isohedral, so perhaps the volume can be calculated as 4 times the volume of a regular tetrahedron with edges adjusted? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, going back to the Cayley-Menger determinant. Let me try to compute the determinant step by step.\n\nThe determinant of a 5x5 matrix is going to be tedious, but maybe we can find some patterns or simplifications.\n\nLet me write the matrix again:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nHmm. Let me denote rows as R0 to R4. Maybe perform row operations to simplify.\n\nFirst, note that all the rows from R1 to R4 start with 1. Let me subtract R1 from R2, R3, R4.\n\nLet me compute R2' = R2 - R1:\n\nRow 2: [1-1, 41-0, 0-41, 89-80, 80-89] => [0, 41, -41, 9, -9]\n\nSimilarly, R3' = R3 - R1:\n\nRow3: [1-1, 80-0, 89-41, 0-80, 41-89] => [0, 80, 48, -80, -48]\n\nR4' = R4 - R1:\n\nRow4: [1-1, 89-0, 80-41, 41-80, 0-89] => [0, 89, 39, -39, -89]\n\nSo now the matrix becomes:\n\nRow0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow2: 0, 41, -41, 9, -9\n\nRow3: 0, 80, 48, -80, -48\n\nRow4: 0, 89, 39, -39, -89\n\nNow, the determinant remains the same (since we did row subtractions which don't change the determinant). Now, let me compute the determinant. Since the first column has a 0 in R0, 1 in R1, and 0s in R2-R4. Wait, actually, the first column is [0,1,0,0,0], except for the first entry. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the first column is:\n\nRow0: 0,\n\nRow1:1,\n\nRow2:0,\n\nRow3:0,\n\nRow4:0,\n\nWait, yes, exactly. So the first column is [0,1,0,0,0]. Therefore, when expanding the determinant along the first column, the only non-zero entry is the 1 in position (1,1) (the second row, first column? Wait, rows are 0 to 4, so the second entry is row1, column0. Hmm, maybe better to index from 1 to 5, but let me see.\n\nWait, the determinant of a 5x5 matrix can be expanded along the first column. Since only the second entry (row1, column0) is non-zero (the 1), the determinant will be equal to:\n\n(-1)^{1+0} * 1 * det(minor at row1, column0).\n\nWait, let me recall that the determinant when expanding along the first column (column 0):\n\nEach term is M[i][0] * (-1)^{i+0} * det(minor(i,0)).\n\nSince only M[1][0] is 1, the rest are 0, so the determinant is:\n\n(-1)^{1+0} * 1 * det(minor(1,0)).\n\nThe minor is the determinant of the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing row1 and column0.\n\nSo the minor matrix is:\n\nRows 0,2,3,4 and columns 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo the minor matrix entries:\n\nRow0 (original row0): columns 1-4: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow2 (original row2): columns1-4: [41, -41, 9, -9]\n\nRow3 (original row3): columns1-4: [80, 48, -80, -48]\n\nRow4 (original row4): columns1-4: [89, 39, -39, -89]\n\nTherefore, the minor matrix is:\n\nRow0: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow1: [41, -41, 9, -9]\n\nRow2: [80, 48, -80, -48]\n\nRow3: [89, 39, -39, -89]\n\nNow, need to compute the determinant of this 4x4 matrix.\n\nLet me denote this 4x4 matrix as M':\n\nRow0: 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow1:41, -41, 9, -9\n\nRow2:80, 48, -80, -48\n\nRow3:89, 39, -39, -89\n\nHmm. Let's see if there's some pattern here. Maybe rows 1,2,3 have some relations?\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow1: 41, -41, 9, -9 \u2192 notice that the first two entries are negatives of each other, and the last two entries are also negatives.\n\nSimilarly, Row2: 80, 48, -80, -48 \u2192 the first and third entries are negatives, the second and fourth are negatives (but 48 and -48).\n\nWait, actually, Row2: 80, 48, -80, -48 \u2192 first and third are -1 times each other, second and fourth are -1 times each other. Similarly for Row1 and Row3.\n\nRow3: 89, 39, -39, -89 \u2192 Wait, not exactly. Wait, first is 89, third is -39. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, perhaps there's a pattern here.\n\nWait, perhaps each of these rows (except Row0) has the form [a, b, -a, -b]?\n\nCheck Row1: 41, -41, 9, -9 \u2192 Not exactly, because the first entry is 41, the third is 9, so not -41. Wait, first entry 41, third entry 9. Hmm, not quite.\n\nWait Row1: 41, -41, 9, -9 \u2192 first two entries are 41 and -41, last two are 9 and -9. So yes, the first two entries are a and -a, and the last two are b and -b where a=41, b=9.\n\nSimilarly, Row2: 80, 48, -80, -48 \u2192 first two entries are 80 and 48, but not negatives. Wait no, first is 80, third is -80; second is 48, fourth is -48. So the first and third are negatives, second and fourth are negatives. So yes, it can be written as [a, b, -a, -b], where a=80, b=48.\n\nSimilarly, Row3: 89, 39, -39, -89 \u2192 Hmm, first is 89, third is -39. Wait, not exactly. Wait, first and third: 89 and -39, which are not negatives. Second is 39, fourth is -89. Hmm, that's different. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here?\n\nWait, original Row3 (from the minor matrix) was Row3 of the minor which came from original Row4 (since we removed row1). Let me check again:\n\nOriginal Row4 (before minor) was Row4 of the 5x5 matrix: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0], but when we took the minor, we removed column0, so the entries are columns1-4: [89, 80, 41, 0]? Wait no, hold on.\n\nWait, in the minor matrix, the original Row4 (from the 5x5 matrix) is [1,89,80,41,0], so removing column0 (the first column), the entries become [89,80,41,0]. Wait, but in the minor matrix above, I had written Row3 as [89, 39, -39, -89]. Wait that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here in transcribing the rows.\n\nWait let me go back step by step.\n\nOriginal 5x5 matrix after row operations:\n\nRow0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow2:0,41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow3:0,80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4:0,89,39,-39,-89\n\nWait, so the rows for the minor matrix (after removing row1 and column0):\n\nRow0 of minor is Row0 of original (excluding column0): [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow1 of minor is Row2 of original (excluding column0): [41, -41, 9, -9]\n\nRow2 of minor is Row3 of original (excluding column0): [80,48, -80, -48]\n\nRow3 of minor is Row4 of original (excluding column0): [89, 39, -39, -89]\n\nAh, okay, so Row3 (last row of minor matrix) is [89,39, -39, -89]. So first entry is 89, second 39, third -39, fourth -89. So first and fourth entries are 89 and -89, second and third are 39 and -39. So yes, that can be written as [a, b, -b, -a], where a=89 and b=39.\n\nTherefore, each of the rows (except the first) have the pattern [a, b, -b, -a]. That's interesting. So Rows 1,2,3 (of the minor matrix) are of the form [a, b, -b, -a].\n\nSo let me note that.\n\nLet me write the minor matrix as:\n\nRow0: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow1: [41, -41, 9, -9] \u2192 [a1, -a1, b1, -b1], where a1=41, b1=9\n\nRow2: [80, 48, -80, -48] \u2192 [a2, b2, -a2, -b2], where a2=80, b2=48\n\nRow3: [89, 39, -39, -89] \u2192 [a3, b3, -b3, -a3], where a3=89, b3=39\n\nHmm, this structure might help in computing the determinant.\n\nLet me denote variables for the rows:\n\nRow0: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow1: [a1, -a1, b1, -b1]\n\nRow2: [a2, b2, -a2, -b2]\n\nRow3: [a3, b3, -b3, -a3]\n\nPerhaps we can perform row operations to simplify this determinant.\n\nFirst, let's denote the rows as R0, R1, R2, R3.\n\nLet me try to add some rows to eliminate variables.\n\nFirst, perhaps adding R1 and R3?\n\nWait, but maybe let's consider the structure. Let me think of each row as vectors:\n\nRow1: [a1, -a1, b1, -b1]\n\nRow2: [a2, b2, -a2, -b2]\n\nRow3: [a3, b3, -b3, -a3]\n\nHmm, perhaps if I perform operations to make some columns zero.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that each of the rows after R0 can be written in terms of two parameters. Maybe express each row as a combination of two vectors?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables for the entries. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the determinant step by step.\n\nThe determinant of the 4x4 matrix can be expanded. Let me write the matrix again:\n\nRow0: 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow1:41, -41, 9, -9\n\nRow2:80, 48, -80, -48\n\nRow3:89, 39, -39, -89\n\nLet me denote this matrix as:\n\nM' = [\n[1, 1, 1, 1],\n[41, -41, 9, -9],\n[80, 48, -80, -48],\n[89, 39, -39, -89]\n]\n\nWe can compute the determinant by expanding along the first row since it has 1s which might be easier.\n\nThe determinant of M' is:\n\n1 * det( M11 ) - 1 * det( M12 ) + 1 * det( M13 ) - 1 * det( M14 )\n\nWhere M11 is the minor matrix for element (0,0), which is:\n\n[\n[-41, 9, -9],\n[48, -80, -48],\n[39, -39, -89]\n]\n\nSimilarly, M12 is the minor for (0,1):\n\n[\n[41, 9, -9],\n[80, -80, -48],\n[89, -39, -89]\n]\n\nM13 is minor for (0,2):\n\n[\n[41, -41, -9],\n[80, 48, -48],\n[89, 39, -89]\n]\n\nM14 is minor for (0,3):\n\n[\n[41, -41, 9],\n[80, 48, -80],\n[89, 39, -39]\n]\n\nThis is going to be a lot of computation. Let me try to compute each determinant step by step.\n\nFirst, compute det(M11):\n\nM11:\nRow1: -41, 9, -9\n\nRow2:48, -80, -48\n\nRow3:39, -39, -89\n\nCompute determinant:\n\n-41*( (-80)(-89) - (-48)(-39) ) - 9*(48*(-89) - (-48)*39 ) + (-9)*(48*(-39) - (-80)*39 )\n\nFirst term: -41*( 80*89 - 48*39 )\n\nWait let me compute each component:\n\nFirst term: -41 * [ (-80)(-89) - (-48)(-39) ] = -41 [ (80*89) - (48*39) ]\n\nCompute 80*89: 80*90=7200, minus 80 = 7120\n\n48*39: 48*40=1920 - 48 = 1872\n\nThus first term: -41*(7120 - 1872) = -41*(5248) = ?\n\nWait 7120 - 1872:\n\n7120 - 1800 = 5320, then -72 more: 5320 -72 = 5248. Yes.\n\nSo first term: -41 * 5248 = let's compute that:\n\n41*5000=205000, 41*248= 41*(200 + 48)= 8200 + 1968= 10168\n\nTotal: 205000 + 10168 = 215,168?

Wait the expansion is:\n\ndet(M') = 1*det(M11) -1*det(M12) +1*det(M13) -1*det(M14)\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\n= 1*(-204,800) -1*(204,800) +1*(-204,800) -1*(204,800)\n\nWait, but hold on:\n\nWait the terms are:\n\n+ det(M11) - det(M12) + det(M13) - det(M14)\n\n= (-204,800) - (204,800) + (-204,800) - (204,800)\n\nSo that's:\n\n-204,800 -204,800 -204,800 -204,800 = total of -819,200?\n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\nFirst term: -204,800\n\nSecond term: -204,800 \u2192 total so far: -409,600\n\nThird term: -204,800 \u2192 total: -614,400\n\nFourth term: -204,800 \u2192 total: -819,200.\n\nSo determinant of M' is -819,200.\n\nTherefore, going back to the Cayley-Menger determinant:\n\nThe determinant of the original 5x5 matrix was equal to (-1)^{1+0} * 1 * det(M') = (-1)^1 * (-819,200) = -1*(-819,200) = 819,200.\n\nWait, hold on, the expansion was:\n\nThe determinant of the original 5x5 matrix is equal to (-1)^{1+0} * 1 * det(M') where M' is the minor. Since the minor determinant was -819,200, so:\n\ndet(5x5) = (-1)^1 * 1 * (-819,200) = (-1)*(-819,200) = 819,200.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the sign again.\n\nThe expansion along the first column: the entry at (1,0) is 1, and the cofactor is (-1)^{row+col} = (-1)^{1+0} = -1. Then multiply by the minor determinant. So:\n\ndet = M[1][0] * (-1)^{1+0} * det(Minor) = 1 * (-1) * (-819,200) = 819,200.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nTherefore, the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix is 819,200.\n\nTherefore, the Volume squared is (1/288)*det = (1/288)*819,200.\n\nCompute that:\n\nFirst, divide 819,200 by 288.\n\nLet me compute 819,200 \u00f7 288.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16: 819,200 /16=51,200; 288/16=18.\n\nSo now 51,200 /18.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: 25,600 /9 \u2248 but keep it as fractions.\n\nThus, 51,200 /18 = (25,600)/9 \u2248 but let's see:\n\nWait 288 \u00d7 2847 = ?\n\nWait alternatively:\n\nLet me compute 288 \u00d7 2847.222... Not sure. Wait perhaps compute 819200 divided by 288:\n\nDivide 819200 \u00f7 288:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16: 51200 / 18 = (51200 \u00f7 2)/(18 \u00f72)=25600/9.\n\nThus Volume squared is (25600/9)/288? Wait no, wait:\n\nWait the formula is Volume squared = (1/288)*det, so det is 819200, so Volume squared = 819200 / 288.\n\nYes, which is 819,200 / 288 = (819200 \u00f7 32)/(288 \u00f732)=25600/9 \u2248 2844.444...\n\nWait 25600 divided by 9 is Volume squared. Therefore, Volume is sqrt(25600/9) = (160)/3, since sqrt(25600)=160, sqrt(9)=3.\n\nWait, wait, hold on:\n\nsqrt(25600/9) = sqrt(25600)/sqrt(9) = 160/3. So Volume = 160/3.\n\nWait that's a nice number! So the volume is 160/3. Let me check that again.\n\nYes, because 25600 divided by 9 is (160)^2 / 3^2, so sqrt of that is 160/3. So Volume is 160/3.\n\nAlright, so Volume V = 160/3.\n\nNow, need to compute the total surface area of the tetrahedron. Since all four faces are congruent triangles with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), each face has the same area. Therefore, total surface area is 4 times the area of one face.\n\nSo let me compute the area of one face, say triangle ABC with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).\n\nLet me use Heron's formula.\n\nFirst, compute semi-perimeter, s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nBut Heron's formula would require computing sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)], which might be messy with square roots. Alternatively, since all edges are known, maybe compute the area using vectors or coordinates?\n\nAlternatively, note that in a triangle with sides a,b,c, the area can also be calculated via the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4) )\n\nWait, let me verify that formula.\n\nAlternatively, another formula for area squared is:\n\n16A\u00b2 = 2(a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4)\n\nYes, that's the formula. Let me confirm:\n\nYes, the formula for the squared area is:\n\n16A\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2.\n\nAlternatively, let me look it up in my mind.\n\nAlternatively, use Heron's formula but with symbolic computation.\n\nLet me denote a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nCompute s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nThen area squared is s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c).\n\nBut this would involve square roots inside square roots, which might not be fun. Alternatively, let me compute using the formula with sides squared.\n\nLet me denote a\u00b2 = 41, b\u00b2=80, c\u00b2=89.\n\nThen using the formula:\n\n16A\u00b2 = 2(a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4)\n\nWait let me check this formula again.\n\nWait, actually, the correct formula is:\n\n16A\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2\n\nYes, let's compute that.\n\nCompute first term: 4*(a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2)\n\nSecond term: (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2\n\nCompute first:\n\nCompute a\u00b2b\u00b2: 41*80 = 3280\n\nb\u00b2c\u00b2:80*89=7120\n\nc\u00b2a\u00b2:89*41= 3649\n\nSum these: 3280 +7120 = 10400; 10400 + 3649 = 14049.\n\nMultiply by 4: 4*14049 = 56,196.\n\nSecond term: (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2 = (41 +80 +89)^2 = (210)^2 = 44,100.\n\nThus, 16A\u00b2 = 56,196 - 44,100 = 12,096.\n\nTherefore, A\u00b2 = 12,096 /16 = 756.\n\nThus, A = sqrt(756).\n\nSimplify sqrt(756):\n\nFactor 756: divide by 4: 756 = 4*189 = 4*9*21 = 4*9*3*7 \u2192 so sqrt(756)=sqrt(4*9*21)=2*3*sqrt(21)=6\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the area of one face is 6\u221a21. Therefore, total surface area is 4*6\u221a21 =24\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, total surface area A_total =24\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the inradius r = 3V / A_total = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = (160) / (24\u221a21).\n\nSimplify 160/24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20/3.\n\nThus, r = (20/3)/\u221a21 = 20/(3\u221a21).\n\nRationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21:\n\nr = (20\u221a21)/(3*21) = (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nSimplify the fraction: 20 and 63 have a common factor of 1, so it's reduced.\n\nTherefore, the distance is 20\u221a21 /63. So m=20, n=21, p=63. Check if they are co-prime: 20 and 63 share no common factors (20 is 2\u00b2\u00d75, 63 is 3\u00b2\u00d77). So yes, they are coprime. And 21 is square-free (3\u00d77), so n=21 is okay.\n\nTherefore, m + n + p =20 +21 +63=104.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again to make sure.\n\nFirst, Volume was 160/3, correct? From Cayley-Menger determinant, yes.\n\nSurface area: each face area was 6\u221a21, so 4*6\u221a21 is 24\u221a21. Correct.\n\nThen inradius r= 3V/A_total = 3*(160/3)/(24\u221a21) \u2192 the 3 cancels, so 160/(24\u221a21). 160 divided by 24 is indeed 20/3. So 20/(3\u221a21). Rationalizing gives 20\u221a21/(3*21) = 20\u221a21/63. So yes.\n\nThus m=20, n=21, p=63. 20+21+63=104. So the answer is 104. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the area computation again because that step was crucial.\n\nWe had sides squared: 41,80,89.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n16A\u00b2=4*(a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2\n\nPlugging in:\n\n4*(41\u00d780 + 80\u00d789 + 89\u00d741) - (41+80+89)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term inside first part:\n\n41\u00d780 = 3280,\n\n80\u00d789 = 7120,\n\n89\u00d741 = 3649,\n\nSum: 3280 + 7120 = 10,400; 10,400 + 3,649 = 14,049.\n\nMultiply by 4: 14,049 \u00d74= 56,196.\n\nSecond term: (210)^2 = 44,100.\n\nThus 56,196 -44,100 = 12,096.\n\nThen 16A\u00b2 =12,096 \u2192 A\u00b2 = 756 \u2192 A= sqrt(756)=sqrt(36\u00d721)=6\u221a21. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, all steps check out. So the inradius is 20\u221a21 /63, so 20+21+63=104.\n\nHence the answer is 104.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{104}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the distance from the incenter (I think that's what point I is) of a tetrahedron to each of its faces. The tetrahedron has edges with specific lengths given: AB=CD=\u221a41, AC=BD=\u221a80, and BC=AD=\u221a89. The answer needs to be in the form m\u221an / p, with m and p coprime and n square-free, then sum m + n + p.\n\nFirst, let me recall that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the distance from the incenter to each face) can be calculated by the formula 3 times the volume divided by the sum of the areas of the faces. Wait, actually, in 3D, the formula for the inradius r is Volume divided by the surface area (total surface area?), but let me confirm.\n\nWait, in a tetrahedron, the formula is similar to the 2D case but scaled. In 2D, inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. In 3D, the inradius is 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. Because the volume can be thought of as (1/3)*surface area * inradius. So yes, r = (3V)/A_total. Hmm, let me check that again.\n\nThe formula for the inradius of a tetrahedron is indeed r = 3V / A_total, where V is the volume and A_total is the sum of the areas of the four faces. So I need to compute the volume of the tetrahedron and the areas of all four faces, then plug into this formula.\n\nSo first, I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron. Given the edge lengths, but the edges are given in a symmetric way. The edges are AB=CD=\u221a41, AC=BD=\u221a80, and BC=AD=\u221a89. So this tetrahedron has opposite edges equal. That's interesting. Maybe this is a kind of \"isohedral\" tetrahedron, or maybe we can use some symmetry here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can assign coordinates to the vertices so that we can compute the volume.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the tetrahedron. Since the edges have this symmetric property, perhaps we can set it up in a coordinate system where the coordinates are symmetric.\n\nLet me think: Let me denote the vertices as A, B, C, D. Let me try to place the points in 3D space such that the coordinates can be set up in a way that the edge lengths correspond.\n\nGiven the symmetry in edge lengths, maybe the tetrahedron can be embedded in coordinates so that the coordinates of the four vertices are arranged symmetrically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, which is sometimes called a \"disphenoid\". A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. So this must be a disphenoid. In such a tetrahedron, all faces are congruent triangles, but here, let's see:\n\nWait, in our case, the edges are AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC. So the opposite edges are equal. So yes, this is a disphenoid. For a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula involving the edge lengths. Alternatively, maybe there is a formula for the volume of a disphenoid.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to set coordinates for a disphenoid.\n\nIn a disphenoid, you can set coordinates such that the vertices are (a, b, c), (-a, -b, c), (-a, b, -c), (a, -b, -c) or something similar. Wait, perhaps that's for a more symmetric case. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps we can place the vertices such that the coordinates are symmetric with respect to the origin?\n\nAlternatively, maybe let me set vertex A at (x, y, z), B at (-x, -y, z), C at (-x, y, -z), D at (x, -y, -z). Then the edges would be symmetric. Let me see if this would work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to place the points in such a way that calculations are easier. Let me try to place vertex A at (0,0,0). Let me see if I can assign coordinates step by step.\n\nLet me suppose point A is at the origin (0,0,0). Let me denote coordinates for points B, C, D as follows:\n\nLet me let point B be at (p, 0, 0), along the x-axis. Then point D can be placed somewhere, but since AD = BC = sqrt(89), which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this coordinate approach is going to be too tedious. Perhaps there's a formula for the volume of a disphenoid?\n\nWait, after a quick recall, for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated if we know the three pairs of opposite edges. Let me check if such a formula exists.\n\nYes, for a disphenoid with opposite edges a, b, c (so each pair of opposite edges equal to a, b, c respectively), the volume is (2/3) times the square root of (a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u00b2 - (sum of squares of edges)/something). Wait, perhaps I need to think more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the volume can be found using the formula involving the edge lengths. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Cayley-Menger determinant. Since we know all the edge lengths, the Cayley-Menger determinant can compute the volume.\n\nYes, that might be the way to go. Let me recall the formula.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:\n\nVolume\u00b2 = (1/288) * determinant of the matrix:\n\n0 1 1 1 1\n\n1 0  a\u00b2 b\u00b2 c\u00b2\n\n1  a\u00b2 0  d\u00b2 e\u00b2\n\n1  b\u00b2 d\u00b2 0  f\u00b2\n\n1  c\u00b2 e\u00b2 f\u00b2 0\n\nSo, if I can plug in the given edge lengths into this determinant, compute its value, take the square root, then divide by 288^(1/2), so Volume = sqrt(det)/sqrt(288). Hmm, but let me confirm the exact formula.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is:\n\nVolume\u00b2 = (1/288) * |CM|, where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant. So Volume is sqrt(|CM| / 288).\n\nSo, first, I need to assign the edges properly.\n\nLet me denote the edges:\n\nAB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89)\n\nBC = sqrt(89), BD = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41)\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check the given edges again:\n\nThe problem states:\n\nAB = CD = sqrt(41),\n\nAC = BD = sqrt(80),\n\nand BC = AD = sqrt(89).\n\nTherefore, edges:\n\nAB = sqrt(41),\n\nAC = sqrt(80),\n\nAD = sqrt(89),\n\nBC = sqrt(89),\n\nBD = sqrt(80),\n\nCD = sqrt(41).\n\nSo, in terms of the Cayley-Menger determinant, let me label the points as A, B, C, D.\n\nLet me assign:\n\nAB = sqrt(41),\n\nAC = sqrt(80),\n\nAD = sqrt(89),\n\nBC = sqrt(89),\n\nBD = sqrt(80),\n\nCD = sqrt(41).\n\nTherefore, in the Cayley-Menger matrix, the entries are as follows:\n\nThe first row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n\nSecond row: [1, 0, AB\u00b2, AC\u00b2, AD\u00b2] = [1, 0, 41, 80, 89].\n\nThird row: [1, AB\u00b2, 0, BC\u00b2, BD\u00b2] = [1, 41, 0, 89, 80].\n\nFourth row: [1, AC\u00b2, BC\u00b2, 0, CD\u00b2] = [1, 80, 89, 0, 41].\n\nFifth row: [1, AD\u00b2, BD\u00b2, CD\u00b2, 0] = [1, 89, 80, 41, 0].\n\nSo the Cayley-Menger determinant is the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. Let me write this out step by step.\n\nLet me denote the matrix as M:\n\nRow 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]\n\nRow 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]\n\nRow 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]\n\nRow 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]\n\nSo, we need to compute determinant(M).\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe there is some symmetry here to exploit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expanding the determinant would be tedious, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps first compute the volume using another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a disphenoid, maybe the volume can be calculated using another formula. Let me recall that in a disphenoid, the volume is given by (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / (  something )?\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since in a disphenoid, the faces are congruent triangles? Wait, in this case, let me check if all the faces are congruent.\n\nCompute the lengths of edges for each face.\n\nFace ABC: edges AB=\u221a41, BC=\u221a89, AC=\u221a80.\n\nFace ABD: edges AB=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89.\n\nFace ACD: edges AC=\u221a80, CD=\u221a41, AD=\u221a89.\n\nFace BCD: edges BC=\u221a89, CD=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80.\n\nSo each face has sides of length sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Therefore, all four faces are congruent triangles. So it is a disphenoid with congruent triangular faces. So each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Therefore, each face is congruent, so the tetrahedron is isohedral? Wait, but a disphenoid is a type of isohedral tetrahedron? Maybe. Anyway, since all the faces are congruent, perhaps the volume can be calculated using the formula for a disphenoid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in such a tetrahedron, the volume can be calculated as (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / (something). Wait, perhaps similar to the formula for a regular tetrahedron but generalized?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since all the faces are congruent, the area of each face can be calculated, and then the volume can be found via some relation.\n\nAlternatively, let me first compute the area of one face. Let's compute the area of triangle ABC with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Let me use Heron's formula.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter:\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2. Hmm, this might get messy, but perhaps squaring the area squared might help?\n\nAlternatively, Heron's formula says that area squared is s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c). But with square roots, this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps use coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, since all the edges of the face are known, perhaps compute the area via vectors?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that since all the faces are congruent, the tetrahedron is isohedral, so perhaps the volume can be calculated as 4 times the volume of a regular tetrahedron with edges adjusted? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, going back to the Cayley-Menger determinant. Let me try to compute the determinant step by step.\n\nThe determinant of a 5x5 matrix is going to be tedious, but maybe we can find some patterns or simplifications.\n\nLet me write the matrix again:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nHmm. Let me denote rows as R0 to R4. Maybe perform row operations to simplify.\n\nFirst, note that all the rows from R1 to R4 start with 1. Let me subtract R1 from R2, R3, R4.\n\nLet me compute R2' = R2 - R1:\n\nRow 2: [1-1, 41-0, 0-41, 89-80, 80-89] => [0, 41, -41, 9, -9]\n\nSimilarly, R3' = R3 - R1:\n\nRow3: [1-1, 80-0, 89-41, 0-80, 41-89] => [0, 80, 48, -80, -48]\n\nR4' = R4 - R1:\n\nRow4: [1-1, 89-0, 80-41, 41-80, 0-89] => [0, 89, 39, -39, -89]\n\nSo now the matrix becomes:\n\nRow0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow2: 0, 41, -41, 9, -9\n\nRow3: 0, 80, 48, -80, -48\n\nRow4: 0, 89, 39, -39, -89\n\nNow, the determinant remains the same (since we did row subtractions which don't change the determinant). Now, let me compute the determinant. Since the first column has a 0 in R0, 1 in R1, and 0s in R2-R4. Wait, actually, the first column is [0,1,0,0,0], except for the first entry. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the first column is:\n\nRow0: 0,\n\nRow1:1,\n\nRow2:0,\n\nRow3:0,\n\nRow4:0,\n\nWait, yes, exactly. So the first column is [0,1,0,0,0]. Therefore, when expanding the determinant along the first column, the only non-zero entry is the 1 in position (1,1) (the second row, first column? Wait, rows are 0 to 4, so the second entry is row1, column0. Hmm, maybe better to index from 1 to 5, but let me see.\n\nWait, the determinant of a 5x5 matrix can be expanded along the first column. Since only the second entry (row1, column0) is non-zero (the 1), the determinant will be equal to:\n\n(-1)^{1+0} * 1 * det(minor at row1, column0).\n\nWait, let me recall that the determinant when expanding along the first column (column 0):\n\nEach term is M[i][0] * (-1)^{i+0} * det(minor(i,0)).\n\nSince only M[1][0] is 1, the rest are 0, so the determinant is:\n\n(-1)^{1+0} * 1 * det(minor(1,0)).\n\nThe minor is the determinant of the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing row1 and column0.\n\nSo the minor matrix is:\n\nRows 0,2,3,4 and columns 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo the minor matrix entries:\n\nRow0 (original row0): columns 1-4: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow2 (original row2): columns1-4: [41, -41, 9, -9]\n\nRow3 (original row3): columns1-4: [80, 48, -80, -48]\n\nRow4 (original row4): columns1-4: [89, 39, -39, -89]\n\nTherefore, the minor matrix is:\n\nRow0: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow1: [41, -41, 9, -9]\n\nRow2: [80, 48, -80, -48]\n\nRow3: [89, 39, -39, -89]\n\nNow, need to compute the determinant of this 4x4 matrix.\n\nLet me denote this 4x4 matrix as M':\n\nRow0: 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow1:41, -41, 9, -9\n\nRow2:80, 48, -80, -48\n\nRow3:89, 39, -39, -89\n\nHmm. Let's see if there's some pattern here. Maybe rows 1,2,3 have some relations?\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow1: 41, -41, 9, -9 \u2192 notice that the first two entries are negatives of each other, and the last two entries are also negatives.\n\nSimilarly, Row2: 80, 48, -80, -48 \u2192 the first and third entries are negatives, the second and fourth are negatives (but 48 and -48).\n\nWait, actually, Row2: 80, 48, -80, -48 \u2192 first and third are -1 times each other, second and fourth are -1 times each other. Similarly for Row1 and Row3.\n\nRow3: 89, 39, -39, -89 \u2192 Wait, not exactly. Wait, first is 89, third is -39. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, perhaps there's a pattern here.\n\nWait, perhaps each of these rows (except Row0) has the form [a, b, -a, -b]?\n\nCheck Row1: 41, -41, 9, -9 \u2192 Not exactly, because the first entry is 41, the third is 9, so not -41. Wait, first entry 41, third entry 9. Hmm, not quite.\n\nWait Row1: 41, -41, 9, -9 \u2192 first two entries are 41 and -41, last two are 9 and -9. So yes, the first two entries are a and -a, and the last two are b and -b where a=41, b=9.\n\nSimilarly, Row2: 80, 48, -80, -48 \u2192 first two entries are 80 and 48, but not negatives. Wait no, first is 80, third is -80; second is 48, fourth is -48. So the first and third are negatives, second and fourth are negatives. So yes, it can be written as [a, b, -a, -b], where a=80, b=48.\n\nSimilarly, Row3: 89, 39, -39, -89 \u2192 Hmm, first is 89, third is -39. Wait, not exactly. Wait, first and third: 89 and -39, which are not negatives. Second is 39, fourth is -89. Hmm, that's different. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here?\n\nWait, original Row3 (from the minor matrix) was Row3 of the minor which came from original Row4 (since we removed row1). Let me check again:\n\nOriginal Row4 (before minor) was Row4 of the 5x5 matrix: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0], but when we took the minor, we removed column0, so the entries are columns1-4: [89, 80, 41, 0]? Wait no, hold on.\n\nWait, in the minor matrix, the original Row4 (from the 5x5 matrix) is [1,89,80,41,0], so removing column0 (the first column), the entries become [89,80,41,0]. Wait, but in the minor matrix above, I had written Row3 as [89, 39, -39, -89]. Wait that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here in transcribing the rows.\n\nWait let me go back step by step.\n\nOriginal 5x5 matrix after row operations:\n\nRow0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow1:1,0,41,80,89\n\nRow2:0,41,-41,9,-9\n\nRow3:0,80,48,-80,-48\n\nRow4:0,89,39,-39,-89\n\nWait, so the rows for the minor matrix (after removing row1 and column0):\n\nRow0 of minor is Row0 of original (excluding column0): [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow1 of minor is Row2 of original (excluding column0): [41, -41, 9, -9]\n\nRow2 of minor is Row3 of original (excluding column0): [80,48, -80, -48]\n\nRow3 of minor is Row4 of original (excluding column0): [89, 39, -39, -89]\n\nAh, okay, so Row3 (last row of minor matrix) is [89,39, -39, -89]. So first entry is 89, second 39, third -39, fourth -89. So first and fourth entries are 89 and -89, second and third are 39 and -39. So yes, that can be written as [a, b, -b, -a], where a=89 and b=39.\n\nTherefore, each of the rows (except the first) have the pattern [a, b, -b, -a]. That's interesting. So Rows 1,2,3 (of the minor matrix) are of the form [a, b, -b, -a].\n\nSo let me note that.\n\nLet me write the minor matrix as:\n\nRow0: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow1: [41, -41, 9, -9] \u2192 [a1, -a1, b1, -b1], where a1=41, b1=9\n\nRow2: [80, 48, -80, -48] \u2192 [a2, b2, -a2, -b2], where a2=80, b2=48\n\nRow3: [89, 39, -39, -89] \u2192 [a3, b3, -b3, -a3], where a3=89, b3=39\n\nHmm, this structure might help in computing the determinant.\n\nLet me denote variables for the rows:\n\nRow0: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow1: [a1, -a1, b1, -b1]\n\nRow2: [a2, b2, -a2, -b2]\n\nRow3: [a3, b3, -b3, -a3]\n\nPerhaps we can perform row operations to simplify this determinant.\n\nFirst, let's denote the rows as R0, R1, R2, R3.\n\nLet me try to add some rows to eliminate variables.\n\nFirst, perhaps adding R1 and R3?\n\nWait, but maybe let's consider the structure. Let me think of each row as vectors:\n\nRow1: [a1, -a1, b1, -b1]\n\nRow2: [a2, b2, -a2, -b2]\n\nRow3: [a3, b3, -b3, -a3]\n\nHmm, perhaps if I perform operations to make some columns zero.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that each of the rows after R0 can be written in terms of two parameters. Maybe express each row as a combination of two vectors?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables for the entries. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the determinant step by step.\n\nThe determinant of the 4x4 matrix can be expanded. Let me write the matrix again:\n\nRow0: 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow1:41, -41, 9, -9\n\nRow2:80, 48, -80, -48\n\nRow3:89, 39, -39, -89\n\nLet me denote this matrix as:\n\nM' = [\n[1, 1, 1, 1],\n[41, -41, 9, -9],\n[80, 48, -80, -48],\n[89, 39, -39, -89]\n]\n\nWe can compute the determinant by expanding along the first row since it has 1s which might be easier.\n\nThe determinant of M' is:\n\n1 * det( M11 ) - 1 * det( M12 ) + 1 * det( M13 ) - 1 * det( M14 )\n\nWhere M11 is the minor matrix for element (0,0), which is:\n\n[\n[-41, 9, -9],\n[48, -80, -48],\n[39, -39, -89]\n]\n\nSimilarly, M12 is the minor for (0,1):\n\n[\n[41, 9, -9],\n[80, -80, -48],\n[89, -39, -89]\n]\n\nM13 is minor for (0,2):\n\n[\n[41, -41, -9],\n[80, 48, -48],\n[89, 39, -89]\n]\n\nM14 is minor for (0,3):\n\n[\n[41, -41, 9],\n[80, 48, -80],\n[89, 39, -39]\n]\n\nThis is going to be a lot of computation. Let me try to compute each determinant step by step.\n\nFirst, compute det(M11):\n\nM11:\nRow1: -41, 9, -9\n\nRow2:48, -80, -48\n\nRow3:39, -39, -89\n\nCompute determinant:\n\n-41*( (-80)(-89) - (-48)(-39) ) - 9*(48*(-89) - (-48)*39 ) + (-9)*(48*(-39) - (-80)*39 )\n\nFirst term: -41*( 80*89 - 48*39 )\n\nWait let me compute each component:\n\nFirst term: -41 * [ (-80)(-89) - (-48)(-39) ] = -41 [ (80*89) - (48*39) ]\n\nCompute 80*89: 80*90=7200, minus 80 = 7120\n\n48*39: 48*40=1920 - 48 = 1872\n\nThus first term: -41*(7120 - 1872) = -41*(5248) = ?\n\nWait 7120 - 1872:\n\n7120 - 1800 = 5320, then -72 more: 5320 -72 = 5248. Yes.\n\nSo first term: -41 * 5248 = let's compute that:\n\n41*5000=205000, 41*248= 41*(200 + 48)= 8200 + 1968= 10168\n\nTotal: 205000 + 10168 = 215,168? Wait, no, wait 41*5248:\n\nWait actually, 5248 * 40 = 209,920; plus 5248*1 = 5,248 \u2192 total 215,168.

Wait the expansion is:\n\ndet(M') = 1*det(M11) -1*det(M12) +1*det(M13) -1*det(M14)\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\n= 1*(-204,800) -1*(204,800) +1*(-204,800) -1*(204,800)\n\nWait, but hold on:\n\nWait the terms are:\n\n+ det(M11) - det(M12) + det(M13) - det(M14)\n\n= (-204,800) - (204,800) + (-204,800) - (204,800)\n\nSo that's:\n\n-204,800 -204,800 -204,800 -204,800 = total of -819,200?\n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\nFirst term: -204,800\n\nSecond term: -204,800 \u2192 total so far: -409,600\n\nThird term: -204,800 \u2192 total: -614,400\n\nFourth term: -204,800 \u2192 total: -819,200.\n\nSo determinant of M' is -819,200.\n\nTherefore, going back to the Cayley-Menger determinant:\n\nThe determinant of the original 5x5 matrix was equal to (-1)^{1+0} * 1 * det(M') = (-1)^1 * (-819,200) = -1*(-819,200) = 819,200.\n\nWait, hold on, the expansion was:\n\nThe determinant of the original 5x5 matrix is equal to (-1)^{1+0} * 1 * det(M') where M' is the minor. Since the minor determinant was -819,200, so:\n\ndet(5x5) = (-1)^1 * 1 * (-819,200) = (-1)*(-819,200) = 819,200.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the sign again.\n\nThe expansion along the first column: the entry at (1,0) is 1, and the cofactor is (-1)^{row+col} = (-1)^{1+0} = -1. Then multiply by the minor determinant. So:\n\ndet = M[1][0] * (-1)^{1+0} * det(Minor) = 1 * (-1) * (-819,200) = 819,200.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nTherefore, the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix is 819,200.\n\nTherefore, the Volume squared is (1/288)*det = (1/288)*819,200.\n\nCompute that:\n\nFirst, divide 819,200 by 288.\n\nLet me compute 819,200 \u00f7 288.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16: 819,200 /16=51,200; 288/16=18.\n\nSo now 51,200 /18.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: 25,600 /9 \u2248 but keep it as fractions.\n\nThus, 51,200 /18 = (25,600)/9 \u2248 but let's see:\n\nWait 288 \u00d7 2847 = ?\n\nWait alternatively:\n\nLet me compute 288 \u00d7 2847.222... Not sure. Wait perhaps compute 819200 divided by 288:\n\nDivide 819200 \u00f7 288:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16: 51200 / 18 = (51200 \u00f7 2)/(18 \u00f72)=25600/9.\n\nThus Volume squared is (25600/9)/288? Wait no, wait:\n\nWait the formula is Volume squared = (1/288)*det, so det is 819200, so Volume squared = 819200 / 288.\n\nYes, which is 819,200 / 288 = (819200 \u00f7 32)/(288 \u00f732)=25600/9 \u2248 2844.444...\n\nWait 25600 divided by 9 is Volume squared. Therefore, Volume is sqrt(25600/9) = (160)/3, since sqrt(25600)=160, sqrt(9)=3.\n\nWait, wait, hold on:\n\nsqrt(25600/9) = sqrt(25600)/sqrt(9) = 160/3. So Volume = 160/3.\n\nWait that's a nice number! So the volume is 160/3. Let me check that again.\n\nYes, because 25600 divided by 9 is (160)^2 / 3^2, so sqrt of that is 160/3. So Volume is 160/3.\n\nAlright, so Volume V = 160/3.\n\nNow, need to compute the total surface area of the tetrahedron. Since all four faces are congruent triangles with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), each face has the same area. Therefore, total surface area is 4 times the area of one face.\n\nSo let me compute the area of one face, say triangle ABC with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).\n\nLet me use Heron's formula.\n\nFirst, compute semi-perimeter, s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nBut Heron's formula would require computing sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)], which might be messy with square roots. Alternatively, since all edges are known, maybe compute the area using vectors or coordinates?\n\nAlternatively, note that in a triangle with sides a,b,c, the area can also be calculated via the formula:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4) )\n\nWait, let me verify that formula.\n\nAlternatively, another formula for area squared is:\n\n16A\u00b2 = 2(a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4)\n\nYes, that's the formula. Let me confirm:\n\nYes, the formula for the squared area is:\n\n16A\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2.\n\nAlternatively, let me look it up in my mind.\n\nAlternatively, use Heron's formula but with symbolic computation.\n\nLet me denote a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nCompute s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nThen area squared is s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c).\n\nBut this would involve square roots inside square roots, which might not be fun. Alternatively, let me compute using the formula with sides squared.\n\nLet me denote a\u00b2 = 41, b\u00b2=80, c\u00b2=89.\n\nThen using the formula:\n\n16A\u00b2 = 2(a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4)\n\nWait let me check this formula again.\n\nWait, actually, the correct formula is:\n\n16A\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2\n\nYes, let's compute that.\n\nCompute first term: 4*(a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2)\n\nSecond term: (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2\n\nCompute first:\n\nCompute a\u00b2b\u00b2: 41*80 = 3280\n\nb\u00b2c\u00b2:80*89=7120\n\nc\u00b2a\u00b2:89*41= 3649\n\nSum these: 3280 +7120 = 10400; 10400 + 3649 = 14049.\n\nMultiply by 4: 4*14049 = 56,196.\n\nSecond term: (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2 = (41 +80 +89)^2 = (210)^2 = 44,100.\n\nThus, 16A\u00b2 = 56,196 - 44,100 = 12,096.\n\nTherefore, A\u00b2 = 12,096 /16 = 756.\n\nThus, A = sqrt(756).\n\nSimplify sqrt(756):\n\nFactor 756: divide by 4: 756 = 4*189 = 4*9*21 = 4*9*3*7 \u2192 so sqrt(756)=sqrt(4*9*21)=2*3*sqrt(21)=6\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the area of one face is 6\u221a21. Therefore, total surface area is 4*6\u221a21 =24\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, total surface area A_total =24\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the inradius r = 3V / A_total = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = (160) / (24\u221a21).\n\nSimplify 160/24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20/3.\n\nThus, r = (20/3)/\u221a21 = 20/(3\u221a21).\n\nRationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21:\n\nr = (20\u221a21)/(3*21) = (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nSimplify the fraction: 20 and 63 have a common factor of 1, so it's reduced.\n\nTherefore, the distance is 20\u221a21 /63. So m=20, n=21, p=63. Check if they are co-prime: 20 and 63 share no common factors (20 is 2\u00b2\u00d75, 63 is 3\u00b2\u00d77). So yes, they are coprime. And 21 is square-free (3\u00d77), so n=21 is okay.\n\nTherefore, m + n + p =20 +21 +63=104.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again to make sure.\n\nFirst, Volume was 160/3, correct? From Cayley-Menger determinant, yes.\n\nSurface area: each face area was 6\u221a21, so 4*6\u221a21 is 24\u221a21. Correct.\n\nThen inradius r= 3V/A_total = 3*(160/3)/(24\u221a21) \u2192 the 3 cancels, so 160/(24\u221a21). 160 divided by 24 is indeed 20/3. So 20/(3\u221a21). Rationalizing gives 20\u221a21/(3*21) = 20\u221a21/63. So yes.\n\nThus m=20, n=21, p=63. 20+21+63=104. So the answer is 104. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the area computation again because that step was crucial.\n\nWe had sides squared: 41,80,89.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n16A\u00b2=4*(a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2\n\nPlugging in:\n\n4*(41\u00d780 + 80\u00d789 + 89\u00d741) - (41+80+89)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term inside first part:\n\n41\u00d780 = 3280,\n\n80\u00d789 = 7120,\n\n89\u00d741 = 3649,\n\nSum: 3280 + 7120 = 10,400; 10,400 + 3,649 = 14,049.\n\nMultiply by 4: 14,049 \u00d74= 56,196.\n\nSecond term: (210)^2 = 44,100.\n\nThus 56,196 -44,100 = 12,096.\n\nThen 16A\u00b2 =12,096 \u2192 A\u00b2 = 756 \u2192 A= sqrt(756)=sqrt(36\u00d721)=6\u221a21. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, all steps check out. So the inradius is 20\u221a21 /63, so 20+21+63=104.\n\nHence the answer is 104.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{104}\n\n\nTo find the distance from the incenter to each face of the tetrahedron \\(ABCD\\) with given edge lengths, we use the formula for the inradius \\(r\\) of a tetrahedron, which is \\(r = \\frac{3V}{A_{\\text{total}}}\\), where \\(V\\) is the volume and \\(A_{\\text{total}}\\) is the total surface area.\n\nFirst, we compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem about a tetrahedron with specific edge lengths, and find the distance from the incenter to the faces. Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of tetrahedrons and their inradius. \n\nFirst, the inradius of a tetrahedron is the radius of the sphere inscribed within the tetrahedron that is tangent to all four faces. The formula for the inradius (r) is the volume (V) divided by the surface area (A), but actually, wait, in 3D, it's 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. Let me confirm that. Yes, for a tetrahedron, the formula is r = 3V / A_total, where A_total is the sum of the areas of the four faces. So I need to compute the volume and the surface area of this tetrahedron.\n\nGiven the edge lengths, but since it's a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal (AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD), this might be a special kind of tetrahedron. Maybe it's isohedral or something? Wait, in an isohedral tetrahedron, all faces are the same, but here the edges are in pairs. This might be a \"disphenoid\", which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. Yes, that's right. A disphenoid has AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC, so exactly the given conditions here. So maybe this is a disphenoid. That might help because disphenoids have some symmetry properties which can be exploited.\n\nI should recall that in a disphenoid, the three edges from each vertex are all of different lengths, but opposite edges are equal. Also, disphenoids can be inscribed in a rectangular box in a certain way. Maybe I can model this tetrahedron as part of a box? Let me think. If I can assign coordinates to the vertices such that the edges correspond to the edges of the box, then perhaps I can compute the volume and areas more easily.\n\nLet me try setting up coordinates. Let me suppose that the tetrahedron can be placed in a coordinate system so that the vertices are at (a, b, c), (-a, -b, c), (-a, b, -c), (a, -b, -c) or something like that. Wait, perhaps that's the way to go. For a disphenoid, there is a coordinate system where the vertices are of the form (\u00b1p, \u00b1q, \u00b1r) with some sign combinations, but maybe I need to think more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, since opposite edges are equal, perhaps the centroid is at the origin, and the coordinates can be arranged symmetrically. Let me see. Let me denote the four vertices as A, B, C, D. Since AB = CD, AC = BD, AD = BC, so the edges opposite each other are equal. \n\nI remember that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula involving the edges. Let me check if there's a formula for the volume of a disphenoid. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant, which is a way to compute the volume of a tetrahedron given all edge lengths.\n\nYes, the Cayley-Menger determinant is a good approach here. The formula is:\n\nVolume\u00b2 = (1/288) * determinant of the matrix:\n\n0 1 1 1 1\n\n1 0 AB\u00b2 AC\u00b2 AD\u00b2\n\n1 AB\u00b2 0 BC\u00b2 BD\u00b2\n\n1 AC\u00b2 BC\u00b2 0 CD\u00b2\n\n1 AD\u00b2 BD\u00b2 CD\u00b2 0\n\nWait, let me confirm the Cayley-Menger determinant setup. The Cayley-Menger matrix for points A,B,C,D in 3D space is a 5x5 matrix where the first row and column are [0,1,1,1,1], and the rest are squared distances between points. The determinant divided by 288 gives the square of the volume. So yes, that's correct. Let me write down the entries.\n\nLet me label the vertices as A,B,C,D. The edges given are:\n\nAB = sqrt(41), so AB\u00b2 = 41\n\nCD = sqrt(41), so CD\u00b2 =41\n\nAC = sqrt(80), so AC\u00b2 =80\n\nBD = sqrt(80), so BD\u00b2=80\n\nAD = sqrt(89), so AD\u00b2=89\n\nBC = sqrt(89), so BC\u00b2=89\n\nSo the squared distances between all pairs:\n\nAB\u00b2 =41, AC\u00b2=80, AD\u00b2=89,\n\nBC\u00b2=89, BD\u00b2=80, CD\u00b2=41,\n\nand then the other distances, like CA\u00b2=80, etc., but we need all pairs. Wait, actually, the Cayley-Menger determinant requires all pairwise squared distances. Let me list all the edges:\n\nAB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD are given. The other edges are BA, CA, DA, CB, DB, DC which are same as the given. So all the squared distances are covered. So the Cayley-Menger matrix is:\n\nRow 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow 1: [1, 0, AB\u00b2, AC\u00b2, AD\u00b2] = [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]\n\nRow 2: [1, AB\u00b2, 0, BC\u00b2, BD\u00b2] = [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]\n\nRow 3: [1, AC\u00b2, BC\u00b2, 0, CD\u00b2] = [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]\n\nRow 4: [1, AD\u00b2, BD\u00b2, CD\u00b2, 0] = [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]\n\nSo the determinant of this 5x5 matrix divided by 288 gives Volume squared.\n\nHmm, calculating a 5x5 determinant by hand might be tedious, but maybe there's some symmetry here. Let me see if I can compute this determinant step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Since it's a disphenoid, maybe the volume can be found more easily?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can assign coordinates to the vertices. Let me try that approach.\n\nSuppose we place the tetrahedron in coordinate system such that the centroid is at the origin, and exploit symmetry.\n\nSince it's a disphenoid, perhaps we can set coordinates such that:\n\nLet me think of the vertices as (a, b, c), (-a, -b, c), (-a, b, -c), (a, -b, -c). Wait, maybe this will work. Let me see. Let me suppose that the four vertices are arranged so that each coordinate is either (x,y,z), (-x,-y,z), (-x,y,-z), (x,-y,-z). Then, the edges between these points can be computed.\n\nLet me try that. Let me denote the coordinates as follows:\n\nLet A = (x, y, z)\n\nB = (-x, -y, z)\n\nC = (-x, y, -z)\n\nD = (x, -y, -z)\n\nThen, compute the distances between each pair.\n\nCompute AB:\n\nDistance between A and B: sqrt[(x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - (-y))\u00b2 + (z - z)^2] = sqrt[(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0] = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Similarly, CD would be the distance between C and D:\n\nDistance between C (-x,y,-z) and D (x,-y,-z): sqrt[( -x - x)^2 + (y - (-y))^2 + (-z - (-z))^2] = sqrt[(-2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0] = same as AB, so 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). So AB = CD, which matches the given condition.\n\nSimilarly, AC is distance between A (x,y,z) and C (-x,y,-z):\n\nsqrt[(x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - y)^2 + (z - (-z))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2] = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2). Similarly, BD is between B (-x,-y,z) and D (x,-y,-z):\n\nsqrt[(-x - x)^2 + (-y - (-y))^2 + (z - (-z))^2] = sqrt[(-2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2] = same as AC, so AC = BD, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, AD is the distance between A (x,y,z) and D (x,-y,-z):\n\nsqrt[(x - x)^2 + (y - (-y))^2 + (z - (-z))^2] = sqrt[0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2] = 2*sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). Similarly, BC is between B (-x,-y,z) and C (-x,y,-z):\n\nsqrt[(-x - (-x))^2 + (-y - y)^2 + (z - (-z))^2] = sqrt[0 + (-2y)^2 + (2z)^2] = same as AD, so AD = BC. Perfect, that matches all the given edge conditions.\n\nTherefore, this coordinate system works. Now, let me denote AB\u00b2 = (2 sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 41. Similarly, AC\u00b2 = 4(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = 80, and AD\u00b2 = 4(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = 89.\n\nSo, let me set up equations:\n\nEquation 1: 4(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 41 \u2192 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n\nEquation 2: 4(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = 80 \u2192 x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n\nEquation 3: 4(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = 89 \u2192 y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nSo, we have three equations with variables x\u00b2, y\u00b2, z\u00b2.\n\nLet me denote a = x\u00b2, b = y\u00b2, c = z\u00b2. Then,\n\nEquation 1: a + b = 41/4\n\nEquation 2: a + c = 20\n\nEquation 3: b + c = 89/4\n\nSo, solving for a, b, c.\n\nFirst, subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(a + c) - (a + b) = 20 - 41/4 \u2192 c - b = 20 - 10.25 = 9.75 = 39/4\n\nSimilarly, equation 3 is b + c = 89/4\n\nSo, we have:\n\nc - b = 39/4\n\nc + b = 89/4\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n2c = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32 \u2192 c = 16\n\nThen, substituting back into equation 3: b + 16 = 89/4 \u2192 b = 89/4 - 16 = 89/4 - 64/4 = 25/4\n\nThen, from equation 1: a + 25/4 = 41/4 \u2192 a = (41 -25)/4 = 16/4 = 4\n\nTherefore, a = x\u00b2 = 4, so x = 2 or -2; but since we can choose coordinates, let's take x=2.\n\nSimilarly, b = y\u00b2 = 25/4 \u2192 y = 5/2 or -5/2. Let's take y = 5/2.\n\nc = z\u00b2 = 16 \u2192 z = 4 or -4. Let's take z =4.\n\nTherefore, coordinates can be set as:\n\nA = (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB = (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC = (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD = (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nLet me check AB distance. Between A (2, 5/2,4) and B (-2, -5/2,4):\n\ndx = 4, dy = 5, dz=0. So squared distance: (4)^2 + (5)^2 +0= 16 +25=41. That's correct. \n\nAC is between A (2,5/2,4) and C (-2,5/2,-4):\n\ndx= -4, dy=0, dz= -8. Squared distance: 16 + 0 +64=80. Correct.\n\nAD between A (2,5/2,4) and D (2,-5/2,-4):\n\ndx=0, dy= -5, dz= -8. Squared distance: 0 +25 +64=89. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, other edges should work out. Good.\n\nNow, with coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron. Since we have coordinates for all four vertices, the volume can be found using the scalar triple product formula. \n\nThe formula for the volume is (1/6) | (AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)) |, where AB, AC, AD are vectors from point A to points B, C, D.\n\nLet me choose point A as the origin for vectors. Wait, actually, let me use coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates for all four points, let me use the determinant formula. \n\nThe volume can be calculated by the determinant of the matrix formed by vectors AB, AC, AD divided by 6.\n\nFirst, let's compute vectors from A to B, A to C, A to D.\n\nVector AB = B - A = (-2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, 4 -4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nVector AC = C - A = (-2 -2, 5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nVector AD = D - A = (2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, compute the scalar triple product AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD).\n\nFirst, compute the cross product AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nLet me compute AC \u00d7 AD:\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCross product components:\n\ni component: (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nj component: - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = - [32 - 0] = -32\n\nk component: (-4*(-5) - 0*0 ) = 20 - 0 =20\n\nSo AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nThen, take the dot product with AB = (-4, -5, 0):\n\nDot product = (-4)(-40) + (-5)(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320\n\nTherefore, the scalar triple product is 320. So the volume is |320| /6 = 320/6 = 160/3 \u2248 53.333...\n\nWait, let me confirm the cross product again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAC is (-4, 0, -8), AD is (0, -5, -8).\n\nCross product formula:\n\nIf vector1 = (a1, a2, a3), vector2 = (b1, b2, b3),\n\nthen cross product is:\n\n(a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1)\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I used a different convention earlier. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, standard cross product components:\n\ni component: (AC_y * AD_z - AC_z * AD_y) = (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nj component: -(AC_x * AD_z - AC_z * AD_x) = -[ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = -[32 - 0] = -32\n\nk component: (AC_x * AD_y - AC_y * AD_x) = (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 =20\n\nYes, that's correct. So cross product is (-40, -32, 20). Then dot product with AB's components (-4, -5, 0):\n\n(-4)(-40) = 160\n\n(-5)(-32) = 160\n\n0*20 =0\n\nTotal 320. So Volume is 320/6 = 160/3. That's correct.\n\nSo Volume V = 160/3.\n\nNow, need to compute the total surface area. Since the tetrahedron has four triangular faces. Each face is a triangle with sides given by the edges.\n\nThe faces are:\n\nFace ABC: with edges AB, BC, AC. Their lengths are sqrt(41), sqrt(89), sqrt(80).\n\nWait, let me list all four faces:\n\nFace ABC: edges AB=\u221a41, BC=\u221a89, AC=\u221a80\n\nFace ABD: edges AB=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89\n\nFace ACD: edges AC=\u221a80, CD=\u221a41, AD=\u221a89\n\nFace BCD: edges BC=\u221a89, CD=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80\n\nSo each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. Wait a second! All four faces are congruent triangles?\n\nWait, since each face has sides of lengths sqrt41, sqrt80, sqrt89. Let me check:\n\nFace ABC has sides AB=\u221a41, BC=\u221a89, AC=\u221a80.\n\nFace ABD has sides AB=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89.\n\nSo the sides are the same as the first face but in different order. Since triangle sides are unordered, each face is congruent. So all four faces are congruent triangles. That's a property of a disphenoid. So each face is congruent, so the surface area is 4 times the area of one face.\n\nTherefore, if I can compute the area of one face, multiply by 4, and that's the total surface area.\n\nLet me compute the area of triangle with sides sqrt41, sqrt80, sqrt89.\n\nLet me denote the sides as a = sqrt41, b = sqrt80, c = sqrt89.\n\nWe can use Heron's formula. First compute the semi-perimeter:\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2 = (sqrt41 + sqrt80 + sqrt89)/2\n\nBut Heron's formula might get messy with square roots. Alternatively, perhaps compute the area using vectors or coordinates?\n\nAlternatively, since the triangle sides are given, let's see if it's a right triangle. Let me check if (sqrt41)^2 + (sqrt80)^2 = (sqrt89)^2?\n\n41 + 80 = 121, and 89 is 89, so 121 \u226089. Not a right triangle. Hmm.\n\nWait, 41 + 80 = 121, but 89 is less than that. Alternatively, maybe another combination?\n\nsqrt80^2 + sqrt89^2 = 80 +89=169=13\u00b2, which is bigger than sqrt41 squared. Hmm, not a right triangle. Hmm. Maybe compute using Heron's formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since all faces are congruent, and given the coordinates, compute the area of one face using coordinates.\n\nLet me pick face ABC. The coordinates of A, B, C are:\n\nA = (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB = (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC = (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nWait, actually, let me confirm coordinates again.\n\nWait, in my coordinate setup earlier, A was (2, 5/2, 4), B was (-2, -5/2, 4), C was (-2, 5/2, -4), D was (2, -5/2, -4). So yes.\n\nSo to compute area of triangle ABC, perhaps compute vectors AB and AC, then take half the magnitude of their cross product.\n\nVectors AB = B - A = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nVector AC = C - A = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nWait, that's the same as before. Wait, but the cross product of AB and AC would give the area of the parallelogram, so half of that is the area of the triangle.\n\nEarlier, we computed AC \u00d7 AD for the volume, but here, for the area of ABC, we can compute AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nWait, let me compute AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nAB is (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC is (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCross product AB \u00d7 AC:\n\ni component: (-5)(-8) - 0*0 = 40 -0 =40\n\nj component: - [ (-4)(-8) - 0*(-4) ] = - [32 -0] = -32\n\nk component: (-4)(0) - (-5)(-4) = 0 -20 = -20\n\nSo AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024). Let's factor 3024:\n\n3024 divided by 16 is 189. 189 is 9*21, so sqrt(16*189) =4*sqrt(189). 189 is 9*21, so sqrt(189)=3*sqrt(21). Therefore sqrt(3024)=4*3*sqrt21=12\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude is 12\u221a21, so the area of triangle ABC is half that, so 6\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, each face has area 6\u221a21, so total surface area is 4*6\u221a21 =24\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the inradius r = 3V / A_total = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = (160) / (24\u221a21).\n\nSimplify 160/24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20/3. So 20/(3\u221a21). Then rationalize the denominator:\n\n20/(3\u221a21) * \u221a21/\u221a21 = 20\u221a21 / (3*21) = 20\u221a21 /63.\n\nSo the inradius is (20\u221a21)/63. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the steps again to make sure.\n\nFirst, Volume V = 160/3. \n\nSurface area A_total = 24\u221a21. \n\nThus, r = 3*(160/3) divided by 24\u221a21. \n\nYes, the 3 and 1/3 cancel, so 160 / (24\u221a21). \n\n160 divided by 24: 160 /24 = 20/3. So 20/(3\u221a21). \n\nThen rationalizing:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21:\n\n20\u221a21 / (3*21) = 20\u221a21 / 63. \n\nYes, since 3*21 is 63. \n\nTherefore, the inradius is (20\u221a21)/63. \n\nNow, check if this is in the required form m\u221an / p, where m and p are coprime, and n square-free. \n\n20 and 63: factors of 20 are 2\u00b2*5, factors of 63 are 3\u00b2*7. They share no common factors, so 20 and 63 are coprime? Wait 20 and 63: gcd(20,63). 20 divides 2\u00b2*5, 63 is 3\u00b2*7. So yes, gcd is 1. \n\nn is 21, which factors into 3*7, neither of which is squared, so it's square-free. \n\nTherefore, m=20, n=21, p=63. \n\nThus, m + n + p = 20 +21 +63 = 104. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check again my calculations for the cross product when computing the area. \n\nWait, when I computed the cross product AB \u00d7 AC, I got (40, -32, -20). Let me check that again. \n\nAB is (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC is (-4, 0, -8)\n\nThe cross product components:\n\ni component: (AB_y * AC_z - AB_z * AC_y) = (-5)(-8) - (0)(0) = 40 -0 =40\n\nj component: -(AB_x * AC_z - AB_z * AC_x) = -[ (-4)(-8) - 0*(-4) ] = -[32 -0] = -32\n\nk component: (AB_x * AC_y - AB_y * AC_x) = (-4)(0) - (-5)(-4) = 0 - 20 = -20\n\nYes, that's correct. So cross product is (40, -32, -20). The magnitude squared is 40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 + 1024 +400 = 3024. \n\nsqrt(3024). Let me see: 3024 divided by 144 is 21, so sqrt(144*21) = 12\u221a21. So the magnitude is 12\u221a21, so half is 6\u221a21. So area of triangle is correct. \n\nTotal surface area is 4*6\u221a21 =24\u221a21. That's correct. \n\nVolume is 160/3. So 3V/A_total = (3*(160/3))/24\u221a21 = 160/(24\u221a21). \n\nYes, simplifying gives 20/(3\u221a21), then rationalized to 20\u221a21/63. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 20+21+63 = 104. \n\nWait, but let me just check once more if there was any miscalculation in the cross product for the volume. \n\nEarlier, when computing the scalar triple product AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD), we had vectors:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC \u00d7 AD was (-40, -32, 20). Then the dot product was (-4)(-40) + (-5)(-32) +0*20 = 160 +160 +0=320. So 320/6 =160/3. Correct. \n\nYes, so all steps check out. Therefore, the answer is 104.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{104}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem about a tetrahedron with specific edge lengths, and find the distance from the incenter to the faces. Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of tetrahedrons and their inradius. \n\nFirst, the inradius of a tetrahedron is the radius of the sphere inscribed within the tetrahedron that is tangent to all four faces. The formula for the inradius (r) is the volume (V) divided by the surface area (A), but actually, wait, in 3D, it's 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. Let me confirm that. Yes, for a tetrahedron, the formula is r = 3V / A_total, where A_total is the sum of the areas of the four faces. So I need to compute the volume and the surface area of this tetrahedron.\n\nGiven the edge lengths, but since it's a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal (AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD), this might be a special kind of tetrahedron. Maybe it's isohedral or something? Wait, in an isohedral tetrahedron, all faces are the same, but here the edges are in pairs. This might be a \"disphenoid\", which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. Yes, that's right. A disphenoid has AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC, so exactly the given conditions here. So maybe this is a disphenoid. That might help because disphenoids have some symmetry properties which can be exploited.\n\nI should recall that in a disphenoid, the three edges from each vertex are all of different lengths, but opposite edges are equal. Also, disphenoids can be inscribed in a rectangular box in a certain way. Maybe I can model this tetrahedron as part of a box? Let me think. If I can assign coordinates to the vertices such that the edges correspond to the edges of the box, then perhaps I can compute the volume and areas more easily.\n\nLet me try setting up coordinates. Let me suppose that the tetrahedron can be placed in a coordinate system so that the vertices are at (a, b, c), (-a, -b, c), (-a, b, -c), (a, -b, -c) or something like that. Wait, perhaps that's the way to go. For a disphenoid, there is a coordinate system where the vertices are of the form (\u00b1p, \u00b1q, \u00b1r) with some sign combinations, but maybe I need to think more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, since opposite edges are equal, perhaps the centroid is at the origin, and the coordinates can be arranged symmetrically. Let me see. Let me denote the four vertices as A, B, C, D. Since AB = CD, AC = BD, AD = BC, so the edges opposite each other are equal. \n\nI remember that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula involving the edges. Let me check if there's a formula for the volume of a disphenoid. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant, which is a way to compute the volume of a tetrahedron given all edge lengths.\n\nYes, the Cayley-Menger determinant is a good approach here. The formula is:\n\nVolume\u00b2 = (1/288) * determinant of the matrix:\n\n0 1 1 1 1\n\n1 0 AB\u00b2 AC\u00b2 AD\u00b2\n\n1 AB\u00b2 0 BC\u00b2 BD\u00b2\n\n1 AC\u00b2 BC\u00b2 0 CD\u00b2\n\n1 AD\u00b2 BD\u00b2 CD\u00b2 0\n\nWait, let me confirm the Cayley-Menger determinant setup. The Cayley-Menger matrix for points A,B,C,D in 3D space is a 5x5 matrix where the first row and column are [0,1,1,1,1], and the rest are squared distances between points. The determinant divided by 288 gives the square of the volume. So yes, that's correct. Let me write down the entries.\n\nLet me label the vertices as A,B,C,D. The edges given are:\n\nAB = sqrt(41), so AB\u00b2 = 41\n\nCD = sqrt(41), so CD\u00b2 =41\n\nAC = sqrt(80), so AC\u00b2 =80\n\nBD = sqrt(80), so BD\u00b2=80\n\nAD = sqrt(89), so AD\u00b2=89\n\nBC = sqrt(89), so BC\u00b2=89\n\nSo the squared distances between all pairs:\n\nAB\u00b2 =41, AC\u00b2=80, AD\u00b2=89,\n\nBC\u00b2=89, BD\u00b2=80, CD\u00b2=41,\n\nand then the other distances, like CA\u00b2=80, etc., but we need all pairs. Wait, actually, the Cayley-Menger determinant requires all pairwise squared distances. Let me list all the edges:\n\nAB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD are given. The other edges are BA, CA, DA, CB, DB, DC which are same as the given. So all the squared distances are covered. So the Cayley-Menger matrix is:\n\nRow 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow 1: [1, 0, AB\u00b2, AC\u00b2, AD\u00b2] = [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]\n\nRow 2: [1, AB\u00b2, 0, BC\u00b2, BD\u00b2] = [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]\n\nRow 3: [1, AC\u00b2, BC\u00b2, 0, CD\u00b2] = [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]\n\nRow 4: [1, AD\u00b2, BD\u00b2, CD\u00b2, 0] = [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]\n\nSo the determinant of this 5x5 matrix divided by 288 gives Volume squared.\n\nHmm, calculating a 5x5 determinant by hand might be tedious, but maybe there's some symmetry here. Let me see if I can compute this determinant step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Since it's a disphenoid, maybe the volume can be found more easily?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can assign coordinates to the vertices. Let me try that approach.\n\nSuppose we place the tetrahedron in coordinate system such that the centroid is at the origin, and exploit symmetry.\n\nSince it's a disphenoid, perhaps we can set coordinates such that:\n\nLet me think of the vertices as (a, b, c), (-a, -b, c), (-a, b, -c), (a, -b, -c). Wait, maybe this will work. Let me see. Let me suppose that the four vertices are arranged so that each coordinate is either (x,y,z), (-x,-y,z), (-x,y,-z), (x,-y,-z). Then, the edges between these points can be computed.\n\nLet me try that. Let me denote the coordinates as follows:\n\nLet A = (x, y, z)\n\nB = (-x, -y, z)\n\nC = (-x, y, -z)\n\nD = (x, -y, -z)\n\nThen, compute the distances between each pair.\n\nCompute AB:\n\nDistance between A and B: sqrt[(x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - (-y))\u00b2 + (z - z)^2] = sqrt[(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0] = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Similarly, CD would be the distance between C and D:\n\nDistance between C (-x,y,-z) and D (x,-y,-z): sqrt[( -x - x)^2 + (y - (-y))^2 + (-z - (-z))^2] = sqrt[(-2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0] = same as AB, so 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). So AB = CD, which matches the given condition.\n\nSimilarly, AC is distance between A (x,y,z) and C (-x,y,-z):\n\nsqrt[(x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - y)^2 + (z - (-z))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2] = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2). Similarly, BD is between B (-x,-y,z) and D (x,-y,-z):\n\nsqrt[(-x - x)^2 + (-y - (-y))^2 + (z - (-z))^2] = sqrt[(-2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2] = same as AC, so AC = BD, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, AD is the distance between A (x,y,z) and D (x,-y,-z):\n\nsqrt[(x - x)^2 + (y - (-y))^2 + (z - (-z))^2] = sqrt[0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2] = 2*sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). Similarly, BC is between B (-x,-y,z) and C (-x,y,-z):\n\nsqrt[(-x - (-x))^2 + (-y - y)^2 + (z - (-z))^2] = sqrt[0 + (-2y)^2 + (2z)^2] = same as AD, so AD = BC. Perfect, that matches all the given edge conditions.\n\nTherefore, this coordinate system works. Now, let me denote AB\u00b2 = (2 sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 41. Similarly, AC\u00b2 = 4(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = 80, and AD\u00b2 = 4(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = 89.\n\nSo, let me set up equations:\n\nEquation 1: 4(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 41 \u2192 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 41/4\n\nEquation 2: 4(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = 80 \u2192 x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 20\n\nEquation 3: 4(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = 89 \u2192 y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 89/4\n\nSo, we have three equations with variables x\u00b2, y\u00b2, z\u00b2.\n\nLet me denote a = x\u00b2, b = y\u00b2, c = z\u00b2. Then,\n\nEquation 1: a + b = 41/4\n\nEquation 2: a + c = 20\n\nEquation 3: b + c = 89/4\n\nSo, solving for a, b, c.\n\nFirst, subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(a + c) - (a + b) = 20 - 41/4 \u2192 c - b = 20 - 10.25 = 9.75 = 39/4\n\nSimilarly, equation 3 is b + c = 89/4\n\nSo, we have:\n\nc - b = 39/4\n\nc + b = 89/4\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n2c = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32 \u2192 c = 16\n\nThen, substituting back into equation 3: b + 16 = 89/4 \u2192 b = 89/4 - 16 = 89/4 - 64/4 = 25/4\n\nThen, from equation 1: a + 25/4 = 41/4 \u2192 a = (41 -25)/4 = 16/4 = 4\n\nTherefore, a = x\u00b2 = 4, so x = 2 or -2; but since we can choose coordinates, let's take x=2.\n\nSimilarly, b = y\u00b2 = 25/4 \u2192 y = 5/2 or -5/2. Let's take y = 5/2.\n\nc = z\u00b2 = 16 \u2192 z = 4 or -4. Let's take z =4.\n\nTherefore, coordinates can be set as:\n\nA = (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB = (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC = (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nD = (2, -5/2, -4)\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nLet me check AB distance. Between A (2, 5/2,4) and B (-2, -5/2,4):\n\ndx = 4, dy = 5, dz=0. So squared distance: (4)^2 + (5)^2 +0= 16 +25=41. That's correct. \n\nAC is between A (2,5/2,4) and C (-2,5/2,-4):\n\ndx= -4, dy=0, dz= -8. Squared distance: 16 + 0 +64=80. Correct.\n\nAD between A (2,5/2,4) and D (2,-5/2,-4):\n\ndx=0, dy= -5, dz= -8. Squared distance: 0 +25 +64=89. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, other edges should work out. Good.\n\nNow, with coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron. Since we have coordinates for all four vertices, the volume can be found using the scalar triple product formula. \n\nThe formula for the volume is (1/6) | (AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)) |, where AB, AC, AD are vectors from point A to points B, C, D.\n\nLet me choose point A as the origin for vectors. Wait, actually, let me use coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates for all four points, let me use the determinant formula. \n\nThe volume can be calculated by the determinant of the matrix formed by vectors AB, AC, AD divided by 6.\n\nFirst, let's compute vectors from A to B, A to C, A to D.\n\nVector AB = B - A = (-2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, 4 -4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nVector AC = C - A = (-2 -2, 5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nVector AD = D - A = (2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, compute the scalar triple product AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD).\n\nFirst, compute the cross product AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nLet me compute AC \u00d7 AD:\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCross product components:\n\ni component: (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nj component: - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = - [32 - 0] = -32\n\nk component: (-4*(-5) - 0*0 ) = 20 - 0 =20\n\nSo AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nThen, take the dot product with AB = (-4, -5, 0):\n\nDot product = (-4)(-40) + (-5)(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320\n\nTherefore, the scalar triple product is 320. So the volume is |320| /6 = 320/6 = 160/3 \u2248 53.333...\n\nWait, let me confirm the cross product again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAC is (-4, 0, -8), AD is (0, -5, -8).\n\nCross product formula:\n\nIf vector1 = (a1, a2, a3), vector2 = (b1, b2, b3),\n\nthen cross product is:\n\n(a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1)\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I used a different convention earlier. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, standard cross product components:\n\ni component: (AC_y * AD_z - AC_z * AD_y) = (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nj component: -(AC_x * AD_z - AC_z * AD_x) = -[ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = -[32 - 0] = -32\n\nk component: (AC_x * AD_y - AC_y * AD_x) = (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 =20\n\nYes, that's correct. So cross product is (-40, -32, 20). Then dot product with AB's components (-4, -5, 0):\n\n(-4)(-40) = 160\n\n(-5)(-32) = 160\n\n0*20 =0\n\nTotal 320. So Volume is 320/6 = 160/3. That's correct.\n\nSo Volume V = 160/3.\n\nNow, need to compute the total surface area. Since the tetrahedron has four triangular faces. Each face is a triangle with sides given by the edges.\n\nThe faces are:\n\nFace ABC: with edges AB, BC, AC. Their lengths are sqrt(41), sqrt(89), sqrt(80).\n\nWait, let me list all four faces:\n\nFace ABC: edges AB=\u221a41, BC=\u221a89, AC=\u221a80\n\nFace ABD: edges AB=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89\n\nFace ACD: edges AC=\u221a80, CD=\u221a41, AD=\u221a89\n\nFace BCD: edges BC=\u221a89, CD=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80\n\nSo each face is a triangle with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. Wait a second! All four faces are congruent triangles?\n\nWait, since each face has sides of lengths sqrt41, sqrt80, sqrt89. Let me check:\n\nFace ABC has sides AB=\u221a41, BC=\u221a89, AC=\u221a80.\n\nFace ABD has sides AB=\u221a41, BD=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89.\n\nSo the sides are the same as the first face but in different order. Since triangle sides are unordered, each face is congruent. So all four faces are congruent triangles. That's a property of a disphenoid. So each face is congruent, so the surface area is 4 times the area of one face.\n\nTherefore, if I can compute the area of one face, multiply by 4, and that's the total surface area.\n\nLet me compute the area of triangle with sides sqrt41, sqrt80, sqrt89.\n\nLet me denote the sides as a = sqrt41, b = sqrt80, c = sqrt89.\n\nWe can use Heron's formula. First compute the semi-perimeter:\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2 = (sqrt41 + sqrt80 + sqrt89)/2\n\nBut Heron's formula might get messy with square roots. Alternatively, perhaps compute the area using vectors or coordinates?\n\nAlternatively, since the triangle sides are given, let's see if it's a right triangle. Let me check if (sqrt41)^2 + (sqrt80)^2 = (sqrt89)^2?\n\n41 + 80 = 121, and 89 is 89, so 121 \u226089. Not a right triangle. Hmm.\n\nWait, 41 + 80 = 121, but 89 is less than that. Alternatively, maybe another combination?\n\nsqrt80^2 + sqrt89^2 = 80 +89=169=13\u00b2, which is bigger than sqrt41 squared. Hmm, not a right triangle. Hmm. Maybe compute using Heron's formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since all faces are congruent, and given the coordinates, compute the area of one face using coordinates.\n\nLet me pick face ABC. The coordinates of A, B, C are:\n\nA = (2, 5/2, 4)\n\nB = (-2, -5/2, 4)\n\nC = (-2, 5/2, -4)\n\nWait, actually, let me confirm coordinates again.\n\nWait, in my coordinate setup earlier, A was (2, 5/2, 4), B was (-2, -5/2, 4), C was (-2, 5/2, -4), D was (2, -5/2, -4). So yes.\n\nSo to compute area of triangle ABC, perhaps compute vectors AB and AC, then take half the magnitude of their cross product.\n\nVectors AB = B - A = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nVector AC = C - A = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nWait, that's the same as before. Wait, but the cross product of AB and AC would give the area of the parallelogram, so half of that is the area of the triangle.\n\nEarlier, we computed AC \u00d7 AD for the volume, but here, for the area of ABC, we can compute AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nWait, let me compute AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nAB is (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC is (-4, 0, -8)\n\nCross product AB \u00d7 AC:\n\ni component: (-5)(-8) - 0*0 = 40 -0 =40\n\nj component: - [ (-4)(-8) - 0*(-4) ] = - [32 -0] = -32\n\nk component: (-4)(0) - (-5)(-4) = 0 -20 = -20\n\nSo AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024). Let's factor 3024:\n\n3024 divided by 16 is 189. 189 is 9*21, so sqrt(16*189) =4*sqrt(189). 189 is 9*21, so sqrt(189)=3*sqrt(21). Therefore sqrt(3024)=4*3*sqrt21=12\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude is 12\u221a21, so the area of triangle ABC is half that, so 6\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, each face has area 6\u221a21, so total surface area is 4*6\u221a21 =24\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the inradius r = 3V / A_total = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = (160) / (24\u221a21).\n\nSimplify 160/24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20/3. So 20/(3\u221a21). Then rationalize the denominator:\n\n20/(3\u221a21) * \u221a21/\u221a21 = 20\u221a21 / (3*21) = 20\u221a21 /63.\n\nSo the inradius is (20\u221a21)/63. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the steps again to make sure.\n\nFirst, Volume V = 160/3. \n\nSurface area A_total = 24\u221a21. \n\nThus, r = 3*(160/3) divided by 24\u221a21. \n\nYes, the 3 and 1/3 cancel, so 160 / (24\u221a21). \n\n160 divided by 24: 160 /24 = 20/3. So 20/(3\u221a21). \n\nThen rationalizing:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21:\n\n20\u221a21 / (3*21) = 20\u221a21 / 63. \n\nYes, since 3*21 is 63. \n\nTherefore, the inradius is (20\u221a21)/63. \n\nNow, check if this is in the required form m\u221an / p, where m and p are coprime, and n square-free. \n\n20 and 63: factors of 20 are 2\u00b2*5, factors of 63 are 3\u00b2*7. They share no common factors, so 20 and 63 are coprime? Wait 20 and 63: gcd(20,63). 20 divides 2\u00b2*5, 63 is 3\u00b2*7. So yes, gcd is 1. \n\nn is 21, which factors into 3*7, neither of which is squared, so it's square-free. \n\nTherefore, m=20, n=21, p=63. \n\nThus, m + n + p = 20 +21 +63 = 104. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check again my calculations for the cross product when computing the area. \n\nWait, when I computed the cross product AB \u00d7 AC, I got (40, -32, -20). Let me check that again. \n\nAB is (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC is (-4, 0, -8)\n\nThe cross product components:\n\ni component: (AB_y * AC_z - AB_z * AC_y) = (-5)(-8) - (0)(0) = 40 -0 =40\n\nj component: -(AB_x * AC_z - AB_z * AC_x) = -[ (-4)(-8) - 0*(-4) ] = -[32 -0] = -32\n\nk component: (AB_x * AC_y - AB_y * AC_x) = (-4)(0) - (-5)(-4) = 0 - 20 = -20\n\nYes, that's correct. So cross product is (40, -32, -20). The magnitude squared is 40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 + 1024 +400 = 3024. \n\nsqrt(3024). Let me see: 3024 divided by 144 is 21, so sqrt(144*21) = 12\u221a21. So the magnitude is 12\u221a21, so half is 6\u221a21. So area of triangle is correct. \n\nTotal surface area is 4*6\u221a21 =24\u221a21. That's correct. \n\nVolume is 160/3. So 3V/A_total = (3*(160/3))/24\u221a21 = 160/(24\u221a21). \n\nYes, simplifying gives 20/(3\u221a21), then rationalized to 20\u221a21/63. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 20+21+63 = 104. \n\nWait, but let me just check once more if there was any miscalculation in the cross product for the volume. \n\nEarlier, when computing the scalar triple product AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD), we had vectors:\n\nAB = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC \u00d7 AD was (-40, -32, 20). Then the dot product was (-4)(-40) + (-5)(-32) +0*20 = 160 +160 +0=320. So 320/6 =160/3. Correct. \n\nYes, so all steps check out. Therefore, the answer is 104.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{104}\n\n\nGiven a tetrahedron \\(ABCD\\) with edges \\(AB = CD = \\sqrt{41}\\), \\(AC = BD = \\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(BC = AD = \\sqrt{89}\\), we need to find the distance from the incenter to each face, expressed in the form \\(\\frac{m \\sqrt{n}}{p}\\), and compute \\(m + n + p\\).\n\nFirst, we recognize the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, allowing us to use coordinates for vertices. We set coordinates as follows:\n- \\(A = (2, \\frac{5}{2}, 4)\\)\n- \\(B = (-2, -\\frac{5}{2}, 4)\\)\n- \\(C = (-2, \\frac{5}{2}, -4)\\)\n- \\(D = (2, -\\frac{5}{2}, -4)\\)\n\nWe compute the volume using the scalar triple product:\n- Vectors: \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = (-4, -5, 0)\\), \\(\\overrightarrow{AC} = (-4, 0, -8)\\), \\(\\overrightarrow{AD} = (0, -5, -8)\\)\n- Cross product \\(\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD} = (-40, -32, 20)\\)\n- Dot product \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} \\cdot (\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD}) = 320\\)\n- Volume \\(V = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 320 = \\frac{160}{3}\\)\n\nNext, we calculate the surface area. Each face is a triangle with sides \\(\\sqrt{41}\\), \\(\\sqrt{80}\\), \\(\\sqrt{89}\\). Using vectors for face \\(ABC\\):\n- Cross product \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} \\times \\overrightarrow{AC} = (40, -32, -20)\\)\n- Magnitude: \\(\\sqrt{3024} = 12\\sqrt{21}\\)\n- Area of one face: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 12\\sqrt{21} = 6\\sqrt{21}\\)\n- Total surface area: \\(4 \\times 6\\sqrt{21} = 24\\sqrt{21}\\)\n\nThe inradius \\(r\\) is given by:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3V}{\\text{Surface Area}} = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{160}{3}}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{160}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20}{3\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(m = 20\\), \\(n = 21\\), and \\(p = 63\\). Therefore, \\(m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{104}\n\\]",
