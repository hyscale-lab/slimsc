      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem about triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The given conditions are that IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. The question asks for the product of AB and AC. Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of circumcenters, incenters, and maybe some formulas that relate these elements.\n\nFirst, let me jot down what I know:\n\n1. The circumradius (R) is 13. So, the distance from the circumcenter O to any vertex (A, B, C) is 13.\n2. The inradius (r) is 6. The inradius formula is related to the area (\u0394) and semiperimeter (s) by r = \u0394/s.\n3. The incenter I is the intersection of angle bisectors, and the circumcenter O is the intersection of perpendicular bisectors.\n4. The key condition here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line segment IA is perpendicular to the line segment OI. That probably gives a relationship between the coordinates or distances of these points.\n\nHmm, maybe coordinate geometry could work here? Let me think. If I can set up coordinates such that calculations are manageable. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula that relates R, r, and the distance between O and I when IA is perpendicular to OI?\n\nI recall there's a formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter: \n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r cos A) ?\n\nWait, no, maybe that's not exactly right. Let me check. Alternatively, the formula for OI\u00b2 is R\u00b2 - 2Rr, but that might be under specific conditions. Wait, actually, the formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius is given by:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in some cases, like an equilateral triangle, O and I coincide, so OI would be zero. Let me verify.\n\nWait, actually, the correct formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Let me see: in an equilateral triangle, R = 2r, so OI\u00b2 = (2r)^2 - 2*(2r)*r = 4r\u00b2 - 4r\u00b2 = 0, which works. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. Wait, but let me confirm with another case. Suppose a right-angled triangle. Let's take a right-angled triangle with legs 3,4,5. Then the inradius r = (a + b - c)/2 = (3 +4 -5)/2 = 1. The circumradius R is half the hypotenuse, which is 2.5. Then OI\u00b2 would be (2.5)^2 - 2*(2.5)*(1) = 6.25 - 5 = 1.25. Let me compute the actual OI distance. In a right-angled triangle, the circumcenter is at the midpoint of the hypotenuse. The inradius is 1, so coordinates might help here. Let me set coordinates: let\u2019s place the right angle at (0,0), legs along axes: A(0,0), B(3,0), C(0,4). The inradius is 1, so incenter is at (r, r) = (1,1). The circumradius is at the midpoint of hypotenuse: midpoint of BC is (1.5, 2). So distance between (1,1) and (1.5, 2) is sqrt( (0.5)^2 + (1)^2 ) = sqrt(1.25), so squared is 1.25, which matches the formula. So yes, OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So that formula seems correct.\n\nBut in our problem, we have an additional condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, so perhaps we can use vector approaches or coordinate geometry here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a relation in triangle involving the inradius, circumradius, and the sides when IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nLet me think of using coordinate geometry. Let me try to set up coordinates so that calculations are manageable. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Let me denote coordinates:\n\nLet\u2019s let point A be at (0,0). Let\u2019s suppose that the incenter I is located somewhere, and O is the circumradius center. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe we can set coordinates such that IA is along some axis, making OI perpendicular to that. Hmm, perhaps aligning the coordinate system so that IA is along the x-axis? Let me try.\n\nLet me suppose that point A is at (0,0), and the line IA is along the x-axis. Let me set the coordinates such that the incenter I is at (d, 0), so along the x-axis. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, then the line OI must be vertical? Wait, because IA is along the x-axis, so perpendicular to it would be the y-axis direction. Therefore, OI is vertical. Therefore, the circumcenter O lies along the y-axis. So, if I is at (d, 0), then O is at (d, k) for some k. Since O is on the y-axis relative to IA's direction? Wait, maybe my coordinate system is getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to set point A at (0,0), and let the incenter I be at (r, 0), but not sure. Wait, inradius is 6, so coordinates might not directly relate to that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use barycentric coordinates, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, use vector methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use trigonometric identities. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance between incenter and circumradius is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, but in this case, since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe there is a relation here.\n\nLet me think of vectors. Let me denote vectors from point A. Let me suppose that point A is the origin. Let me denote vectors:\n\nLet\u2019s set coordinate system with A at (0,0). Let me denote vector AI and vector OI. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product is zero. Wait, but OI is the vector from O to I, right? Wait, actually, IA is a vector from I to A or from A to I? The problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So IA is the vector from I to A, and OI is the vector from O to I. Wait, actually, the problem says \"the line segment IA is perpendicular to the line segment OI\". So the lines IA and OI are perpendicular. So the direction vectors of IA and OI must be perpendicular. Therefore, the vector from I to A is IA, and the vector from O to I is OI, so their dot product is zero.\n\nWait, actually, the direction of IA is from I to A, and direction of OI is from O to I. So the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular. Therefore, (A - I) \u22c5 (I - O) = 0. So that's the condition.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me write that down:\n\n(A - I) \u00b7 (I - O) = 0.\n\nExpressing this in vectors. Let me consider coordinates. Let me set coordinate system such that point A is at (0,0). Let me denote coordinates for O and I as (Ox, Oy) and (Ix, Iy). Then the vector IA is A - I = (-Ix, -Iy). The vector OI is I - O = (Ix - Ox, Iy - Oy). Their dot product is (-Ix)(Ix - Ox) + (-Iy)(Iy - Oy) = 0.\n\nHmm, that might be a bit messy, but perhaps manageable with other relations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using trigonometric identities in triangle. Let me recall that in a triangle, the inradius r = \u0394/s, where \u0394 is area and s is semiperimeter. The circumradius R = (a b c)/(4\u0394). So maybe combining these with some relations?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a formula involving the distance OI and angle at A. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe in triangle AIO, we can apply Pythagoras?\n\nWait, in triangle AIO, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then angle at I is 90 degrees? Wait, no. Wait, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then the lines IA and OI are perpendicular, so angle between them is 90 degrees. So triangle AIO has a right angle at I? Wait, yes, exactly. Because IA is perpendicular to OI, so the angle at I between IA and IO is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle AIO is right-angled at I.\n\nTherefore, by Pythagoras, AI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = AO\u00b2.\n\nBut AO is the circumradius, which is given as 13. Therefore, AI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169.\n\nBut we also have another formula for OI\u00b2, which is OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). Wait, let me recall that formula again. Wait, I think the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, let me confirm that.\n\nYes, in general, the formula for the distance between incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, so substituting that into the equation above:\n\nAI\u00b2 + (R\u00b2 - 2Rr) = R\u00b2 \u21d2 AI\u00b2 - 2Rr = 0 \u21d2 AI\u00b2 = 2Rr.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So if in triangle AIO, since it's right-angled at I, then AI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = AO\u00b2. But OI\u00b2 is R\u00b2 - 2Rr, so substituting:\n\nAI\u00b2 + (R\u00b2 - 2Rr) = R\u00b2 \u21d2 AI\u00b2 = 2Rr.\n\nTherefore, AI = sqrt(2Rr). Given R =13 and r=6, so AI = sqrt(2*13*6)= sqrt(156)= 2*sqrt(39). Hmm, okay. So that gives us the length of AI in terms of R and r.\n\nBut how does that help us find AB * AC?\n\nHmm. Maybe we can relate AI to the sides of the triangle. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the angles and sides.\n\nAlternatively, there is a formula for AI in terms of the sides. Let me recall that in a triangle, the inradius is r, and the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be given by:\n\nAI = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nYes, actually, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is indeed given by AI = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nLet me verify this formula. The incenter is located at distances from the sides, so considering the angle bisector, the distance along the angle bisector from vertex A to the incenter I can be found using trigonometry. In triangle A, the inradius is the distance from I to any side, say BC. The angle at A is split into two angles of A/2. So, in the right triangle formed by the inradius, the angle at I is A/2, and the adjacent side is r, so the hypotenuse AI is r / sin(A/2). Wait, actually, maybe it's r / sin(A/2). Let me see:\n\nImagine the incenter I. From I, drop a perpendicular to side BC, which has length r. The distance from A to I can be found by considering the angle bisector. The angle between AI and the angle bisector direction would be A/2, so in that right triangle, sin(A/2) = opposite over hypotenuse = r / AI \u21d2 AI = r / sin(A/2). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo AI = r / sin(A/2). From earlier, we have AI\u00b2 = 2Rr. So,\n\n(r / sin(A/2))\u00b2 = 2 R r \u21d2 r\u00b2 / sin\u00b2(A/2) = 2 R r \u21d2 r / sin\u00b2(A/2) = 2 R \u21d2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = r / (2 R).\n\nSo sin(A/2) = sqrt( r / (2 R) )\n\nPlugging in the given values, r =6, R=13,\n\nsin(A/2) = sqrt(6 / (2*13)) = sqrt(3/13).\n\nTherefore, sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13). Let me note that.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, perhaps we can find angle A from this? Since sin(A/2) is sqrt(3/13), so cos(A/2) would be sqrt(1 - 3/13) = sqrt(10/13). Therefore, cos(A/2) = sqrt(10/13).\n\nThen, angle A can be found via double angle formulas. Let me see:\n\ncos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(3/13) = 1 - 6/13 = 7/13.\n\nAlternatively, cos A = 2 cos\u00b2(A/2) - 1 = 2*(10/13) -1 = 20/13 -1 = 7/13. So angle A has cosine 7/13. So cos A =7/13.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, perhaps we can use the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC? But to do that, we need more information. Alternatively, maybe use the formula involving the sides and the inradius and circumradius.\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that in any triangle,\n\na = BC, b = AC, c = AB.\n\nWe need to find AB * AC, which is c * b.\n\nWe know the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nArea \u0394 = r * s = 6s,\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed as (a b c)/(4 R) = (a b c)/(52).\n\nSo, 6s = (a b c)/52 \u21d2 a b c = 312 s.\n\nHmm, but I don't know the sides yet. Alternatively, perhaps use the formula for area in terms of angle A:\n\n\u0394 = (1/2) * AB * AC * sin A = (1/2) b c sin A.\n\nWe know sin A, since we know cos A =7/13, so sin A = sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = (2*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nTherefore, sin A = 2\u221a30 /13.\n\nSo, \u0394 = (1/2)*b*c*(2\u221a30/13) = (b c \u221a30)/13.\n\nBut also, \u0394 = 6s, so:\n\n(b c \u221a30)/13 = 6s \u21d2 b c \u221a30 = 78 s \u21d2 bc = (78 / \u221a30) s. Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, let's also recall that in triangle ABC, the Law of Sines gives a / sin A = 2R = 26. Since a is BC, so a = 26 sin A = 26*(2\u221a30/13) = 4\u221a30.\n\nWait, hold on, Law of Sines says a / sin A = 2R. So a = 2R sin A. Let me compute that:\n\na = 2*13*(2\u221a30/13) = 4\u221a30. Wait, actually, sin A is 2\u221a30/13, so 2R sin A = 26*(2\u221a30/13) = 4\u221a30. So BC = a = 4\u221a30. Okay, so we found side BC.\n\nSo now we know side a = BC = 4\u221a30. Now, the problem asks for AB * AC, which is c*b. Let me see if we can find expressions for b and c.\n\nWe need more relations. Let me think. Let me recall that in a triangle, the inradius is r = (\u0394)/s, so we can write s = \u0394 / r = (6s)/6 = s? Wait, no, that just loops back. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula that relates the sides with the inradius and angles. Wait, perhaps using formula for AI again.\n\nWe had AI = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). Earlier, we found sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13). Therefore, AI = 6 / sqrt(3/13) = 6 * sqrt(13/3) = 6*(sqrt(39)/3) = 2*sqrt(39). Which matches the earlier result AI\u00b2 = 2Rr = 2*13*6=156, so AI is sqrt(156)=2*sqrt(39). So that's consistent.\n\nIs there a way to express AI in terms of the sides? Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can also be expressed via the formula:\n\nAI = \\sqrt{r^2 + \\left( s - a \\right)^2 }.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. The coordinates of the inradius: in some coordinate systems, but perhaps another formula. Alternatively, in terms of the sides:\n\nYes, actually, the formula for the length of the angle bisector from A to the inradius can be given by:\n\nAI = \\frac{\\sqrt{bc s (s - a)}}{bc} ?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recall the formula correctly. Alternatively, here's a formula for the length of AI:\n\nIn triangle ABC, AI = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}} as we had before, which we already used.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula involving sides:\n\nAI^2 = \\frac{bc(s - a)}{s}\n\nWait, let me check. Let me see if I can derive it.\n\nIn triangle A, the inradius is r, and the distance from A to I can be found via coordinates. Alternatively, in terms of the sides:\n\nLet me consider the formula for AI\u00b2. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be given by:\n\nAI\u00b2 = \\frac{(b c)}{(b + c)^2} \\times [(b + c)^2 - a^2]\n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities.\n\nWe know that in triangle A, the inradius is r, and the ex-radii, but maybe that's complicating.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for AI in terms of the sides. Let me see:\n\nWe can use the formula that in any triangle,\n\nAI = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nWe already have AI = 2\u221a39, and sin(A/2)=\u221a(3/13). So,\n\nAI = 6 / (\u221a(3/13)) = 6 * \u221a(13/3) = 2\u221a39, which is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nAI\u00b2 = ( (b c) / ( (a + b + c)/2 )) * ( ( (a + b + c)/2 - a ) / sin\u00b2(A/2) )\n\nHmm, perhaps not. Let me think differently.\n\nWe know angle A, side BC = a =4\u221a30, and we need to find AB * AC = c * b.\n\nWe can use the Law of Cosines on angle A:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c cos A.\n\nWe have a =4\u221a30, so a\u00b2 = 16*30 = 480.\n\ncos A =7/13, so:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c*(7/13).\n\nWe need another equation involving b and c. Let me think. Since we also have the inradius formula.\n\nThe semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nArea \u0394 = r*s =6s,\n\nAlso, the area is (1/2) b c sin A = (1/2) b c*(2\u221a30/13) = (b c \u221a30)/13.\n\nTherefore, equate:\n\n(b c \u221a30)/13 =6s \u21d2 bc \u221a30 =78 s.\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2, so substituting,\n\nbc \u221a30 =78*( (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2 )\n\nLet me simplify that:\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n2 bc \u221a30 = 78*(4\u221a30 + b + c)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nbc \u221a30 = 39*(4\u221a30 + b + c)\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe we can find another relation. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the inradius:\n\nr = (\u0394)/s \u21d2 6 = \u0394/s \u21d2 \u0394 =6s.\n\nAlso, we can use the formula that relates the inradius with the sides:\n\nr = (b + c - a)/2 * tan(A/2). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the formula for r is (\u0394)/s, which we already used.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that we have two equations:\n\n1) From the Law of Cosines:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) b c = 480.\n\nWait, let me re-arrange the Law of Cosines equation:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) b c \u21d2 b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) b c = 480. (Equation 1)\n\n2) From the area and semiperimeter relation:\n\nbc \u221a30 =78 s, where s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2. (Equation 2)\n\nHmm. Let me see if I can express s in terms of b and c and substitute into Equation 2.\n\nLet me write Equation 2 as:\n\nbc \u221a30 =78*( (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2 ) \u21d2 bc \u221a30 = 39*(4\u221a30 + b + c )\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\nbc \u221a30 -39 b -39 c = 39*4\u221a30 \u21d2 bc \u221a30 -39b -39c = 156\u221a30 (Equation 2a)\n\nHmm, this is one equation with two variables, b and c. The other equation is Equation 1, which is quadratic in b and c. So, perhaps we can solve these equations together.\n\nLet me consider introducing variables x = b + c and y = b c. Then, perhaps express equations in terms of x and y.\n\nLet me let x = b + c and y = b c. Then Equation 1:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13)y = 480.\n\nBut b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (b + c)^2 - 2 b c = x\u00b2 - 2y. So substituting:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2y - (14/13)y =480 \u21d2 x\u00b2 - 2y - (14/13)y = x\u00b2 - y(2 +14/13)=x\u00b2 - y*(30/13)=480. (Equation 1a)\n\nEquation 2a:\n\ny \u221a30 -39x =156\u221a30 \u21d2 y \u221a30 -39x =156\u221a30 (Equation 2b)\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1) x\u00b2 - (30/13)y =480,\n\n2) y \u221a30 -39x =156\u221a30.\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Let me solve Equation 2b for y:\n\nFrom Equation 2b:\n\ny \u221a30 =39x +156\u221a30 \u21d2 y = (39x +156\u221a30)/\u221a30 = 39x/\u221a30 + 156\u221a30 /\u221a30 = 39x/\u221a30 +156.\n\nHmm, let me rationalize denominators:\n\n39x /\u221a30 = (39x\u221a30)/30 = (13x\u221a30)/10,\n\nand 156 is just 156. So,\n\ny = (13x\u221a30)/10 + 156.\n\nNow, substitute this into Equation 1a:\n\nx\u00b2 - (30/13)*[ (13x\u221a30)/10 + 156 ] =480.\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: x\u00b2,\n\nSecond term: - (30/13)*(13x\u221a30)/10 = - (30/13)*(13/10) x\u221a30 = -3 x\u221a30,\n\nThird term: - (30/13)*156 = - (30/13)*156 = -30*(12) = -360,\n\nSo altogether,\n\nx\u00b2 -3x\u221a30 -360 =480 \u21d2 x\u00b2 -3x\u221a30 = 840 \u21d2 x\u00b2 -3x\u221a30 -840 =0.\n\nHmm, now we have a quadratic in x. Let me write it as:\n\nx\u00b2 -3\u221a30 x -840 =0.\n\nLet me solve this quadratic equation for x.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [3\u221a30 \u00b1 \u221a( (3\u221a30)^2 + 4*840 ) ] /2.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n(3\u221a30)^2 = 9*30=270,\n\n4*840=3360,\n\nTotal discriminant =270 +3360= 3630.\n\nSo,\n\nx = [3\u221a30 \u00b1 \u221a3630 ] /2.\n\nHmm, \u221a3630. Let me see if this simplifies:\n\n3630 = 10*363 =10*3*121= 10*3*11\u00b2. So \u221a3630 = \u221a(10*3*11\u00b2)=11\u221a(30). Because 10*3 is 30. So \u221a3630=11\u221a30.\n\nTherefore,\n\nx= [3\u221a30 \u00b111\u221a30]/2 = [ (3 \u00b111)\u221a30 ] /2.\n\nSo two solutions:\n\nx = (14\u221a30)/2 =7\u221a30,\n\nor x= (-8\u221a30)/2= -4\u221a30.\n\nSince x = b + c is a length, it must be positive. So x =7\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, x =7\u221a30. Now, substitute back into the expression for y:\n\ny = (13x\u221a30)/10 +156.\n\nPlugging x =7\u221a30,\n\nFirst term:13*(7\u221a30)*\u221a30 /10 =13*7*(30)/10 =13*7*3= 273,\n\nSecond term:156,\n\nThus, y =273 +156=429.\n\nTherefore, y = b c =429.\n\nSo the product AB * AC = bc = y =429. So the answer is 429.\n\nWait, let me verify that again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nSo, after solving the quadratic equation, we found x =7\u221a30, then y = (13x\u221a30)/10 +156.\n\nCalculating first term:\n\n13 * 7\u221a30 * \u221a30 =13*7*(\u221a30)^2 =13*7*30= 13*210=2730,\n\nThen divided by 10: 2730/10 =273,\n\nPlus 156: 273 +156 =429. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, bc = y =429. Therefore, the answer is 429. Let me check if this makes sense with other equations.\n\nLet me check Equation 1a:\n\nx\u00b2 - (30/13)y = (7\u221a30)^2 - (30/13)*429.\n\nCompute (7\u221a30)^2 =49*30=1470,\n\n(30/13)*429= 30*(429/13)=30*33= 990,\n\nSo 1470 -990=480, which matches Equation 1a. So that's correct.\n\nAlso, Equation 2b:\n\ny\u221a30 -39x =429\u221a30 -39*(7\u221a30)=429\u221a30 -273\u221a30=156\u221a30, which is equal to the RHS. So that's also correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculations are consistent. Therefore, the product AB * AC is indeed 429.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{429}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem about triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The given conditions are that IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. The question asks for the product of AB and AC. Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of circumcenters, incenters, and maybe some formulas that relate these elements.\n\nFirst, let me jot down what I know:\n\n1. The circumradius (R) is 13. So, the distance from the circumcenter O to any vertex (A, B, C) is 13.\n2. The inradius (r) is 6. The inradius formula is related to the area (\u0394) and semiperimeter (s) by r = \u0394/s.\n3. The incenter I is the intersection of angle bisectors, and the circumcenter O is the intersection of perpendicular bisectors.\n4. The key condition here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line segment IA is perpendicular to the line segment OI. That probably gives a relationship between the coordinates or distances of these points.\n\nHmm, maybe coordinate geometry could work here? Let me think. If I can set up coordinates such that calculations are manageable. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula that relates R, r, and the distance between O and I when IA is perpendicular to OI?\n\nI recall there's a formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter: \n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r cos A) ?\n\nWait, no, maybe that's not exactly right. Let me check. Alternatively, the formula for OI\u00b2 is R\u00b2 - 2Rr, but that might be under specific conditions. Wait, actually, the formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius is given by:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in some cases, like an equilateral triangle, O and I coincide, so OI would be zero. Let me verify.\n\nWait, actually, the correct formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Let me see: in an equilateral triangle, R = 2r, so OI\u00b2 = (2r)^2 - 2*(2r)*r = 4r\u00b2 - 4r\u00b2 = 0, which works. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. Wait, but let me confirm with another case. Suppose a right-angled triangle. Let's take a right-angled triangle with legs 3,4,5. Then the inradius r = (a + b - c)/2 = (3 +4 -5)/2 = 1. The circumradius R is half the hypotenuse, which is 2.5. Then OI\u00b2 would be (2.5)^2 - 2*(2.5)*(1) = 6.25 - 5 = 1.25. Let me compute the actual OI distance. In a right-angled triangle, the circumcenter is at the midpoint of the hypotenuse. The inradius is 1, so coordinates might help here. Let me set coordinates: let\u2019s place the right angle at (0,0), legs along axes: A(0,0), B(3,0), C(0,4). The inradius is 1, so incenter is at (r, r) = (1,1). The circumradius is at the midpoint of hypotenuse: midpoint of BC is (1.5, 2). So distance between (1,1) and (1.5, 2) is sqrt( (0.5)^2 + (1)^2 ) = sqrt(1.25), so squared is 1.25, which matches the formula. So yes, OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So that formula seems correct.\n\nBut in our problem, we have an additional condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, so perhaps we can use vector approaches or coordinate geometry here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a relation in triangle involving the inradius, circumradius, and the sides when IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nLet me think of using coordinate geometry. Let me try to set up coordinates so that calculations are manageable. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Let me denote coordinates:\n\nLet\u2019s let point A be at (0,0). Let\u2019s suppose that the incenter I is located somewhere, and O is the circumradius center. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe we can set coordinates such that IA is along some axis, making OI perpendicular to that. Hmm, perhaps aligning the coordinate system so that IA is along the x-axis? Let me try.\n\nLet me suppose that point A is at (0,0), and the line IA is along the x-axis. Let me set the coordinates such that the incenter I is at (d, 0), so along the x-axis. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, then the line OI must be vertical? Wait, because IA is along the x-axis, so perpendicular to it would be the y-axis direction. Therefore, OI is vertical. Therefore, the circumcenter O lies along the y-axis. So, if I is at (d, 0), then O is at (d, k) for some k. Since O is on the y-axis relative to IA's direction? Wait, maybe my coordinate system is getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to set point A at (0,0), and let the incenter I be at (r, 0), but not sure. Wait, inradius is 6, so coordinates might not directly relate to that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use barycentric coordinates, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, use vector methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use trigonometric identities. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance between incenter and circumradius is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, but in this case, since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe there is a relation here.\n\nLet me think of vectors. Let me denote vectors from point A. Let me suppose that point A is the origin. Let me denote vectors:\n\nLet\u2019s set coordinate system with A at (0,0). Let me denote vector AI and vector OI. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product is zero. Wait, but OI is the vector from O to I, right? Wait, actually, IA is a vector from I to A or from A to I? The problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So IA is the vector from I to A, and OI is the vector from O to I. Wait, actually, the problem says \"the line segment IA is perpendicular to the line segment OI\". So the lines IA and OI are perpendicular. So the direction vectors of IA and OI must be perpendicular. Therefore, the vector from I to A is IA, and the vector from O to I is OI, so their dot product is zero.\n\nWait, actually, the direction of IA is from I to A, and direction of OI is from O to I. So the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular. Therefore, (A - I) \u22c5 (I - O) = 0. So that's the condition.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me write that down:\n\n(A - I) \u00b7 (I - O) = 0.\n\nExpressing this in vectors. Let me consider coordinates. Let me set coordinate system such that point A is at (0,0). Let me denote coordinates for O and I as (Ox, Oy) and (Ix, Iy). Then the vector IA is A - I = (-Ix, -Iy). The vector OI is I - O = (Ix - Ox, Iy - Oy). Their dot product is (-Ix)(Ix - Ox) + (-Iy)(Iy - Oy) = 0.\n\nHmm, that might be a bit messy, but perhaps manageable with other relations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using trigonometric identities in triangle. Let me recall that in a triangle, the inradius r = \u0394/s, where \u0394 is area and s is semiperimeter. The circumradius R = (a b c)/(4\u0394). So maybe combining these with some relations?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a formula involving the distance OI and angle at A. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe in triangle AIO, we can apply Pythagoras?\n\nWait, in triangle AIO, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then angle at I is 90 degrees? Wait, no. Wait, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then the lines IA and OI are perpendicular, so angle between them is 90 degrees. So triangle AIO has a right angle at I? Wait, yes, exactly. Because IA is perpendicular to OI, so the angle at I between IA and IO is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle AIO is right-angled at I.\n\nTherefore, by Pythagoras, AI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = AO\u00b2.\n\nBut AO is the circumradius, which is given as 13. Therefore, AI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169.\n\nBut we also have another formula for OI\u00b2, which is OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). Wait, let me recall that formula again. Wait, I think the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, let me confirm that.\n\nYes, in general, the formula for the distance between incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, so substituting that into the equation above:\n\nAI\u00b2 + (R\u00b2 - 2Rr) = R\u00b2 \u21d2 AI\u00b2 - 2Rr = 0 \u21d2 AI\u00b2 = 2Rr.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So if in triangle AIO, since it's right-angled at I, then AI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = AO\u00b2. But OI\u00b2 is R\u00b2 - 2Rr, so substituting:\n\nAI\u00b2 + (R\u00b2 - 2Rr) = R\u00b2 \u21d2 AI\u00b2 = 2Rr.\n\nTherefore, AI = sqrt(2Rr). Given R =13 and r=6, so AI = sqrt(2*13*6)= sqrt(156)= 2*sqrt(39). Hmm, okay. So that gives us the length of AI in terms of R and r.\n\nBut how does that help us find AB * AC?\n\nHmm. Maybe we can relate AI to the sides of the triangle. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the angles and sides.\n\nAlternatively, there is a formula for AI in terms of the sides. Let me recall that in a triangle, the inradius is r, and the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be given by:\n\nAI = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nYes, actually, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is indeed given by AI = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nLet me verify this formula. The incenter is located at distances from the sides, so considering the angle bisector, the distance along the angle bisector from vertex A to the incenter I can be found using trigonometry. In triangle A, the inradius is the distance from I to any side, say BC. The angle at A is split into two angles of A/2. So, in the right triangle formed by the inradius, the angle at I is A/2, and the adjacent side is r, so the hypotenuse AI is r / sin(A/2). Wait, actually, maybe it's r / sin(A/2). Let me see:\n\nImagine the incenter I. From I, drop a perpendicular to side BC, which has length r. The distance from A to I can be found by considering the angle bisector. The angle between AI and the angle bisector direction would be A/2, so in that right triangle, sin(A/2) = opposite over hypotenuse = r / AI \u21d2 AI = r / sin(A/2). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo AI = r / sin(A/2). From earlier, we have AI\u00b2 = 2Rr. So,\n\n(r / sin(A/2))\u00b2 = 2 R r \u21d2 r\u00b2 / sin\u00b2(A/2) = 2 R r \u21d2 r / sin\u00b2(A/2) = 2 R \u21d2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = r / (2 R).\n\nSo sin(A/2) = sqrt( r / (2 R) )\n\nPlugging in the given values, r =6, R=13,\n\nsin(A/2) = sqrt(6 / (2*13)) = sqrt(3/13).\n\nTherefore, sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13). Let me note that.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, perhaps we can find angle A from this? Since sin(A/2) is sqrt(3/13), so cos(A/2) would be sqrt(1 - 3/13) = sqrt(10/13). Therefore, cos(A/2) = sqrt(10/13).\n\nThen, angle A can be found via double angle formulas. Let me see:\n\ncos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(3/13) = 1 - 6/13 = 7/13.\n\nAlternatively, cos A = 2 cos\u00b2(A/2) - 1 = 2*(10/13) -1 = 20/13 -1 = 7/13. So angle A has cosine 7/13. So cos A =7/13.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, perhaps we can use the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC? But to do that, we need more information. Alternatively, maybe use the formula involving the sides and the inradius and circumradius.\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that in any triangle,\n\na = BC, b = AC, c = AB.\n\nWe need to find AB * AC, which is c * b.\n\nWe know the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nArea \u0394 = r * s = 6s,\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed as (a b c)/(4 R) = (a b c)/(52).\n\nSo, 6s = (a b c)/52 \u21d2 a b c = 312 s.\n\nHmm, but I don't know the sides yet. Alternatively, perhaps use the formula for area in terms of angle A:\n\n\u0394 = (1/2) * AB * AC * sin A = (1/2) b c sin A.\n\nWe know sin A, since we know cos A =7/13, so sin A = sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = (2*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nTherefore, sin A = 2\u221a30 /13.\n\nSo, \u0394 = (1/2)*b*c*(2\u221a30/13) = (b c \u221a30)/13.\n\nBut also, \u0394 = 6s, so:\n\n(b c \u221a30)/13 = 6s \u21d2 b c \u221a30 = 78 s \u21d2 bc = (78 / \u221a30) s. Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, let's also recall that in triangle ABC, the Law of Sines gives a / sin A = 2R = 26. Since a is BC, so a = 26 sin A = 26*(2\u221a30/13) = 4\u221a30.\n\nWait, hold on, Law of Sines says a / sin A = 2R. So a = 2R sin A. Let me compute that:\n\na = 2*13*(2\u221a30/13) = 4\u221a30. Wait, actually, sin A is 2\u221a30/13, so 2R sin A = 26*(2\u221a30/13) = 4\u221a30. So BC = a = 4\u221a30. Okay, so we found side BC.\n\nSo now we know side a = BC = 4\u221a30. Now, the problem asks for AB * AC, which is c*b. Let me see if we can find expressions for b and c.\n\nWe need more relations. Let me think. Let me recall that in a triangle, the inradius is r = (\u0394)/s, so we can write s = \u0394 / r = (6s)/6 = s? Wait, no, that just loops back. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula that relates the sides with the inradius and angles. Wait, perhaps using formula for AI again.\n\nWe had AI = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). Earlier, we found sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13). Therefore, AI = 6 / sqrt(3/13) = 6 * sqrt(13/3) = 6*(sqrt(39)/3) = 2*sqrt(39). Which matches the earlier result AI\u00b2 = 2Rr = 2*13*6=156, so AI is sqrt(156)=2*sqrt(39). So that's consistent.\n\nIs there a way to express AI in terms of the sides? Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can also be expressed via the formula:\n\nAI = \\sqrt{r^2 + \\left( s - a \\right)^2 }.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. The coordinates of the inradius: in some coordinate systems, but perhaps another formula. Alternatively, in terms of the sides:\n\nYes, actually, the formula for the length of the angle bisector from A to the inradius can be given by:\n\nAI = \\frac{\\sqrt{bc s (s - a)}}{bc} ?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recall the formula correctly. Alternatively, here's a formula for the length of AI:\n\nIn triangle ABC, AI = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}} as we had before, which we already used.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula involving sides:\n\nAI^2 = \\frac{bc(s - a)}{s}\n\nWait, let me check. Let me see if I can derive it.\n\nIn triangle A, the inradius is r, and the distance from A to I can be found via coordinates. Alternatively, in terms of the sides:\n\nLet me consider the formula for AI\u00b2. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be given by:\n\nAI\u00b2 = \\frac{(b c)}{(b + c)^2} \\times [(b + c)^2 - a^2]\n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities.\n\nWe know that in triangle A, the inradius is r, and the ex-radii, but maybe that's complicating.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for AI in terms of the sides. Let me see:\n\nWe can use the formula that in any triangle,\n\nAI = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nWe already have AI = 2\u221a39, and sin(A/2)=\u221a(3/13). So,\n\nAI = 6 / (\u221a(3/13)) = 6 * \u221a(13/3) = 2\u221a39, which is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nAI\u00b2 = ( (b c) / ( (a + b + c)/2 )) * ( ( (a + b + c)/2 - a ) / sin\u00b2(A/2) )\n\nHmm, perhaps not. Let me think differently.\n\nWe know angle A, side BC = a =4\u221a30, and we need to find AB * AC = c * b.\n\nWe can use the Law of Cosines on angle A:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c cos A.\n\nWe have a =4\u221a30, so a\u00b2 = 16*30 = 480.\n\ncos A =7/13, so:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c*(7/13).\n\nWe need another equation involving b and c. Let me think. Since we also have the inradius formula.\n\nThe semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nArea \u0394 = r*s =6s,\n\nAlso, the area is (1/2) b c sin A = (1/2) b c*(2\u221a30/13) = (b c \u221a30)/13.\n\nTherefore, equate:\n\n(b c \u221a30)/13 =6s \u21d2 bc \u221a30 =78 s.\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2, so substituting,\n\nbc \u221a30 =78*( (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2 )\n\nLet me simplify that:\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n2 bc \u221a30 = 78*(4\u221a30 + b + c)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nbc \u221a30 = 39*(4\u221a30 + b + c)\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe we can find another relation. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the inradius:\n\nr = (\u0394)/s \u21d2 6 = \u0394/s \u21d2 \u0394 =6s.\n\nAlso, we can use the formula that relates the inradius with the sides:\n\nr = (b + c - a)/2 * tan(A/2). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the formula for r is (\u0394)/s, which we already used.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that we have two equations:\n\n1) From the Law of Cosines:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) b c = 480.\n\nWait, let me re-arrange the Law of Cosines equation:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) b c \u21d2 b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) b c = 480. (Equation 1)\n\n2) From the area and semiperimeter relation:\n\nbc \u221a30 =78 s, where s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2. (Equation 2)\n\nHmm. Let me see if I can express s in terms of b and c and substitute into Equation 2.\n\nLet me write Equation 2 as:\n\nbc \u221a30 =78*( (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2 ) \u21d2 bc \u221a30 = 39*(4\u221a30 + b + c )\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\nbc \u221a30 -39 b -39 c = 39*4\u221a30 \u21d2 bc \u221a30 -39b -39c = 156\u221a30 (Equation 2a)\n\nHmm, this is one equation with two variables, b and c. The other equation is Equation 1, which is quadratic in b and c. So, perhaps we can solve these equations together.\n\nLet me consider introducing variables x = b + c and y = b c. Then, perhaps express equations in terms of x and y.\n\nLet me let x = b + c and y = b c. Then Equation 1:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13)y = 480.\n\nBut b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (b + c)^2 - 2 b c = x\u00b2 - 2y. So substituting:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2y - (14/13)y =480 \u21d2 x\u00b2 - 2y - (14/13)y = x\u00b2 - y(2 +14/13)=x\u00b2 - y*(30/13)=480. (Equation 1a)\n\nEquation 2a:\n\ny \u221a30 -39x =156\u221a30 \u21d2 y \u221a30 -39x =156\u221a30 (Equation 2b)\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1) x\u00b2 - (30/13)y =480,\n\n2) y \u221a30 -39x =156\u221a30.\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Let me solve Equation 2b for y:\n\nFrom Equation 2b:\n\ny \u221a30 =39x +156\u221a30 \u21d2 y = (39x +156\u221a30)/\u221a30 = 39x/\u221a30 + 156\u221a30 /\u221a30 = 39x/\u221a30 +156.\n\nHmm, let me rationalize denominators:\n\n39x /\u221a30 = (39x\u221a30)/30 = (13x\u221a30)/10,\n\nand 156 is just 156. So,\n\ny = (13x\u221a30)/10 + 156.\n\nNow, substitute this into Equation 1a:\n\nx\u00b2 - (30/13)*[ (13x\u221a30)/10 + 156 ] =480.\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: x\u00b2,\n\nSecond term: - (30/13)*(13x\u221a30)/10 = - (30/13)*(13/10) x\u221a30 = -3 x\u221a30,\n\nThird term: - (30/13)*156 = - (30/13)*156 = -30*(12) = -360,\n\nSo altogether,\n\nx\u00b2 -3x\u221a30 -360 =480 \u21d2 x\u00b2 -3x\u221a30 = 840 \u21d2 x\u00b2 -3x\u221a30 -840 =0.\n\nHmm, now we have a quadratic in x. Let me write it as:\n\nx\u00b2 -3\u221a30 x -840 =0.\n\nLet me solve this quadratic equation for x.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [3\u221a30 \u00b1 \u221a( (3\u221a30)^2 + 4*840 ) ] /2.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n(3\u221a30)^2 = 9*30=270,\n\n4*840=3360,\n\nTotal discriminant =270 +3360= 3630.\n\nSo,\n\nx = [3\u221a30 \u00b1 \u221a3630 ] /2.\n\nHmm, \u221a3630. Let me see if this simplifies:\n\n3630 = 10*363 =10*3*121= 10*3*11\u00b2. So \u221a3630 = \u221a(10*3*11\u00b2)=11\u221a(30). Because 10*3 is 30. So \u221a3630=11\u221a30.\n\nTherefore,\n\nx= [3\u221a30 \u00b111\u221a30]/2 = [ (3 \u00b111)\u221a30 ] /2.\n\nSo two solutions:\n\nx = (14\u221a30)/2 =7\u221a30,\n\nor x= (-8\u221a30)/2= -4\u221a30.\n\nSince x = b + c is a length, it must be positive. So x =7\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, x =7\u221a30. Now, substitute back into the expression for y:\n\ny = (13x\u221a30)/10 +156.\n\nPlugging x =7\u221a30,\n\nFirst term:13*(7\u221a30)*\u221a30 /10 =13*7*(30)/10 =13*7*3= 273,\n\nSecond term:156,\n\nThus, y =273 +156=429.\n\nTherefore, y = b c =429.\n\nSo the product AB * AC = bc = y =429. So the answer is 429.\n\nWait, let me verify that again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nSo, after solving the quadratic equation, we found x =7\u221a30, then y = (13x\u221a30)/10 +156.\n\nCalculating first term:\n\n13 * 7\u221a30 * \u221a30 =13*7*(\u221a30)^2 =13*7*30= 13*210=2730,\n\nThen divided by 10: 2730/10 =273,\n\nPlus 156: 273 +156 =429. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, bc = y =429. Therefore, the answer is 429. Let me check if this makes sense with other equations.\n\nLet me check Equation 1a:\n\nx\u00b2 - (30/13)y = (7\u221a30)^2 - (30/13)*429.\n\nCompute (7\u221a30)^2 =49*30=1470,\n\n(30/13)*429= 30*(429/13)=30*33= 990,\n\nSo 1470 -990=480, which matches Equation 1a. So that's correct.\n\nAlso, Equation 2b:\n\ny\u221a30 -39x =429\u221a30 -39*(7\u221a30)=429\u221a30 -273\u221a30=156\u221a30, which is equal to the RHS. So that's also correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculations are consistent. Therefore, the product AB * AC is indeed 429.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{429}\n\n\nGiven triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with circumcenter \\( O \\) and incenter \\( I \\), where \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), circumradius \\( R = 13 \\), and inradius \\( r = 6 \\), we need to find \\( AB \\cdot AC \\).\n\n1. **Key Relationships**:\n   - The distance between the incenter \\( I \\) and circumcenter \\( O \\) is given by \\( OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \\).\n   - Since \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), triangle \\( AIO \\) is right-angled at \\( I \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find AB multiplied by AC in triangle ABC where the circumradius is 13, inradius is 6, and the line IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, let me recall some properties related to circumcenters, incenters, and the relations between them. \n\nFirst, let me note down the given information:\n\n- Triangle ABC with circumradius R = 13, so the distance from the circumcenter O to any vertex is 13.\n- Inradius r = 6, so the area can also be expressed as r times the semiperimeter: Area = r * s, where s = (a + b + c)/2.\n- The line segment IA (from the incenter I to vertex A) is perpendicular to the line segment OI (from the incenter I to the circumcenter O). So, IA \u22a5 OI.\n\nI need to find AB \u00b7 AC. Let me denote the sides as follows: let AB = c, BC = a, and AC = b. Wait, actually, standard notation is usually opposite: a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So let me stick with that. So sides are BC = a, AC = b, AB = c. The semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nThe inradius formula is Area = r * s = 6s. The circumradius formula is Area = (a b c)/(4 R) = (a b c)/52. So, setting these equal: (a b c)/52 = 6s \u2192 a b c = 312 s. Hmm, not sure if that's immediately helpful, but maybe later.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe there's a relation between the distances and coordinates? Maybe coordinate geometry could help here? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using vector approaches or trigonometric identities. Wait, maybe there's a formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, and when they are perpendicular?\n\nI recall that in some triangles, the distance between O and I can be expressed as sqrt(R(R - 2r)), but that might be only in certain cases. Wait, actually, the formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius is:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r cos \u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle between OI and some line? Wait, maybe I need to recall the exact formula.\n\nActually, the formula for OI\u00b2 is R\u00b2 - 2 R r. Wait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2 R r. Let me confirm. Hmm, perhaps not exactly. Let me recall Euler's formula, which states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2 R r. Yes, Euler's formula! So OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2 R r. \n\nWait, so if that's the case, then OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13). Hmm, but how does that relate to IA being perpendicular to OI?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to use the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. So the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. Maybe setting coordinates would help here.\n\nLet me try to set up coordinate system. Let me place the triangle in a coordinate system such that point A is at the origin, and side BC is in some position. Wait, maybe it's better to position point A at (0,0), and set coordinates such that calculations are easier. Alternatively, maybe place the circumcenter O at the origin? Hmm, perhaps. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider coordinate system where point A is at (0,0), and let me set coordinates so that the incenter I is somewhere, and O is another point. But this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe use barycentric coordinates? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think of another approach.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, the line IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the direction vector of IA is perpendicular to the direction vector of OI. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities in triangle AIO. Since IA \u22a5 OI, then angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees, so triangle AIO is right-angled at I. Therefore, in triangle AIO, by Pythagoras:\n\nAI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = AO\u00b2.\n\nWait, yes! Because if IA is perpendicular to OI, then triangle AIO is right-angled at I, so AI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = AO\u00b2. That seems right. \n\nSo, let's note that:\n\nAI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = AO\u00b2.\n\nWe can express each of these terms in terms of the triangle's elements. \n\nFirst, AO is the distance from the circumcenter O to vertex A, which is equal to the circumradius R, so AO = 13. Therefore, AO\u00b2 = 169.\n\nOI\u00b2 is given by Euler's formula: OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*(1) = 13. Wait, hold on, Euler's formula says OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2 R r. Wait, let me confirm Euler's formula again.\n\nYes, Euler's formula states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2 R r. So with R = 13 and r = 6, this would be OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13). \n\nTherefore, substituting back into the equation from the right triangle AIO:\n\nAI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = AO\u00b2 \u2192 AI\u00b2 + 13 = 169 \u2192 AI\u00b2 = 169 - 13 = 156 \u2192 AI = sqrt(156). \n\nSo we now know AI = sqrt(156). \n\nNow, we need to relate AI to the sides of the triangle. There is a formula for the length of the inradius and the distances from the incenter to the vertices. \n\nThe formula for AI can be given in terms of the sides and angles. Specifically, in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A is given by:\n\nAI = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nAlternatively, another formula: AI = \\sqrt{r^2 + \\left( \\frac{a}{2} \\right)^2 }, but I might be misremembering. Wait, let me recall the formula properly.\n\nThe formula for the length of the angle bisector might not be directly helpful here. Alternatively, in terms of the sides:\n\nIn triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed as:\n\nAI = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{b c s (s - a)}}{b + c}\n\nwhere a, b, c are the sides opposite to angles A, B, C respectively, and s is the semiperimeter. Wait, I might need to verify this formula.\n\nAlternatively, another way: In triangle ABC, the inradius is r, and the distances from the incenter to the vertices can be expressed using trigonometric functions. \n\nSpecifically, in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A is given by:\n\nAI = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nYes, I think this is correct. Let me see. The inradius is the distance from I to each side, so in the angle bisector of angle A, the inradius is the distance from I to side BC, which is r. The distance from I to vertex A would then form a right triangle with angle A/2 at I, so AI is the hypotenuse. Therefore, sin(A/2) = r / AI \u21d2 AI = r / sin(A/2). \n\nYes, that formula seems correct. So AI = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). \n\nWe found earlier that AI = sqrt(156). Therefore:\n\nsqrt(156) = 6 / sin(A/2) \u21d2 sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(156).\n\nSimplify sqrt(156): sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore,\n\nsin(A/2) = 6 / (2 sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13. Wait, let me compute that again.\n\nWait, 3 divided by sqrt(39) can be rationalized as 3 sqrt(39)/39 = sqrt(39)/13. So yes, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. \n\nHmm, okay. So sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. Let me note that down. Let me also recall that cos(A/2) can be found via Pythagorean identity: since sin\u00b2(A/2) + cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1,\n\ncos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 1 - (sqrt(39)/13)^2 = 1 - 39/169 = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169. So cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13. \n\nSo now, perhaps we can relate angle A to the sides of the triangle. \n\nAlternatively, let's recall that in triangle ABC, the circumradius R is given by the formula:\n\na / (2 sin A) = 2R \u21d2 a = 2R sin A. Wait, actually, the Law of Sines says a / sin A = 2R, so a = 2R sin A. Similarly for the other sides. \n\nSo, sides:\n\na = 2R sin A,\n\nb = 2R sin B,\n\nc = 2R sin C.\n\nSince R = 13, so a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nAlso, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = 13 (sin A + sin B + sin C).\n\nThe inradius is given by r = (Area)/s. The area can also be expressed as (a b c)/(4 R). \n\nAlternatively, the area can be expressed using the inradius: Area = r s = 6 s.\n\nSo, equate the two expressions for area: (a b c)/(4 R) = 6 s. \n\nPlugging R =13, so (a b c)/52 = 6 s \u21d2 a b c = 312 s. \n\nHmm, so we have a relation between sides a, b, c and semiperimeter s. \n\nBut perhaps we can find angle A first, then relate to sides. Since we have expressions involving angle A. Let me think.\n\nWe have angle A, and expressions for sin(A/2) and cos(A/2). Let's see if we can find sin A. \n\nUsing the double-angle formula: sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2). \n\nWe have sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13. Therefore,\n\nsin A = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*sqrt(39*130)/(13^2).\n\nSimplify sqrt(39*130): 39*130 = 39*(13*10) = 39*13*10. 39 is 3*13, so 3*13*13*10 = 3*10*13\u00b2. Therefore sqrt(3*10*13\u00b2) = 13*sqrt(30). \n\nTherefore, sin A = 2*(13 sqrt(30)) / (169) ) = (26 sqrt(30))/169 = (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo sin A = (2 sqrt(30))/13. Therefore, side a = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 4 sqrt(30). Wait, let me compute that again:\n\nWait, Law of Sines says a = 2R sin A. Since R =13,\n\na = 2*13*sin A = 26*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = (26/13)*2 sqrt(30) = 2*2 sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30). \n\nWait, that seems okay. So side BC (which is a) is 4\u221a30. \n\nSo a = 4\u221a30. \n\nHmm, that's one side. Now, we need more relations. Let me see.\n\nWe also have the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2. But since we know a, maybe we can find expressions for b and c. But we need more information. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the formula for the inradius:\n\nr = (Area)/s. Since r =6, Area =6s. \n\nAlso, Area can be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A. Because in triangle ABC, area is (1/2)*AB*AC*sin A = (1/2)*c*b*sin A. \n\nTherefore, Area = (1/2) b c sin A =6 s.\n\nWe already have sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13, so:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*(2 sqrt(30)/13) =6 s \u21d2 (b c sqrt(30)/13 ) =6 s \u21d2 b c = (6 *13 / sqrt(30)) s. \n\nHmm, but I don't know s yet. Alternatively, perhaps express s in terms of a, b, c. Since s = (a + b + c)/2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use another formula involving the inradius and the distances.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the formula for AI again. Since AI = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / (sqrt(39)/13) ) = 6*13/sqrt(39) = 78/sqrt(39) = 78 sqrt(39)/39 = 2 sqrt(39). Wait, but earlier we had AI = sqrt(156). Let me check that:\n\nsqrt(156) is sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). Yes, so that's consistent. So AI = 2 sqrt(39). \n\nIs there another formula for AI in terms of the sides? Let me recall.\n\nYes, the formula for the length of AI is:\n\nAI = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}} = \\frac{2 \\Delta}{(a + b + c) \\sin \\frac{A}{2}} }, but maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, another formula is:\n\nAI = \\sqrt{r^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{2} (b + c - a) \\right)^2 }.\n\nWait, let me check. \n\nIn triangle ABC, the distance from the inradius to vertex A can be expressed using the formula:\n\nAI = \\sqrt{r^2 + \\left( \\frac{b + c - a}{2} \\right)^2 }.\n\nIs this correct? Let me see.\n\nYes, I think so. Since the inradius is at distance r from each side, and in the angle bisector, the distance along the angle bisector to the vertex can be found via Pythagoras if we consider the inradius and the ex-radius? Wait, perhaps. Let me think of coordinates.\n\nSuppose we place the incenter I at coordinates (0,0), and the side BC is tangent to the incircle at some point. But maybe this is getting too involved. Alternatively, the formula is known as:\n\nIn any triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by:\n\nAI = \\frac{\\sqrt{bc(s - a)}}{s}\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me check a reference formula.\n\nAlternatively, according to some sources, the formula for AI is:\n\nAI = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{b c s (s - a)}}{b + c}\n\nHmm, perhaps that's the formula. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, since we have AI = 2\u221a39, and we can relate this to sides b and c. Let me see if I can use that formula.\n\nAssuming AI = (2 sqrt{b c s (s - a)})/(b + c). Let me check dimensions. The numerator would have sqrt(b c s (s - a)), which would be in terms of length squared under the root, so overall sqrt gives length, times 2/(b + c). Hmm, perhaps not sure. Alternatively, maybe another approach.\n\nWait, let's see. Since we have angle A, and sides b and c, perhaps we can use the Law of Cosines. \n\nWe know that in triangle ABC,\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c cos A.\n\nWe have a =4\u221a30, so a\u00b2 = 16*30 = 480.\n\nAlso, cos A can be found from angle A. Since we have sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13, so cos A = sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2 A) = sqrt(1 - (4*30)/169) = sqrt( (169 - 120)/169 ) = sqrt(49/169) = 7/13.\n\nTherefore, cos A =7/13. \n\nTherefore, the Law of Cosines gives:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c*(7/13).\n\nSo, 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) b c. \n\nHmm, okay, so that's equation (1).\n\nNow, the area of the triangle can also be written as (1/2) b c sin A = (1/2)*b c*(2 sqrt(30)/13) ) = (b c sqrt(30))/13. \n\nBut the area is also equal to r*s = 6 s. \n\nTherefore, (b c sqrt(30))/13 = 6 s \u21d2 b c = (6 *13 / sqrt(30)) s = (78 / sqrt(30)) s. \n\nHmm, so that's equation (2): b c = (78 / sqrt(30)) s.\n\nAlso, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2. Let me denote b + c = x. Then s = (4\u221a30 + x)/2. \n\nTherefore, equation (2) becomes:\n\nb c = (78 / sqrt(30)) * (4\u221a30 + x)/2 \n\nSimplify numerator: 78 / sqrt(30) multiplied by (4\u221a30 + x):\n\nFirst, 78/sqrt(30) *4\u221a30 = 78*4*(sqrt(30)/sqrt(30)) = 78*4 = 312,\n\nand 78/sqrt(30) * x = (78 x)/sqrt(30). \n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes:\n\nb c = [312 + (78 x)/sqrt(30)] / 2 = 156 + (39 x)/sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, so that's equation (2a): bc = 156 + (39 x)/sqrt(30), where x = b + c.\n\nAdditionally, from equation (1):\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nBut b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 can be written as (b + c)^2 - 2 bc = x\u00b2 - 2 bc. \n\nTherefore, equation (1) becomes:\n\n480 = x\u00b2 - 2 bc - (14/13) bc = x\u00b2 - (2 + 14/13) bc = x\u00b2 - ( (26 +14)/13 ) bc = x\u00b2 - (40/13) bc.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 - (40/13) bc = 480. \u2192 equation (1a)\n\nNow, let me substitute bc from equation (2a) into equation (1a):\n\nx\u00b2 - (40/13)*(156 + (39 x)/sqrt(30)) ) = 480.\n\nLet me compute this step by step. \n\nFirst, compute (40/13)*(156):\n\n40/13 *156 = 40*(156/13) = 40*12 = 480, since 156 divided by 13 is 12. \n\nThen, (40/13)*( (39 x)/sqrt(30) ) = (40*39 x)/(13 sqrt(30)) ) = ( (40/13)*39 ) x / sqrt(30) )\n\nBut 39 divided by 13 is 3, so this becomes (40 * 3)x / sqrt(30) = 120 x / sqrt(30).\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nx\u00b2 - [480 + (120 x)/sqrt(30) ] = 480.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 - 480 - (120 x)/sqrt(30) = 480 \u21d2\n\nx\u00b2 - (120 x)/sqrt(30) - 480 -480 =0 \u21d2\n\nx\u00b2 - (120 / sqrt(30)) x - 960 =0.\n\nHmm, so quadratic equation in x:\n\nx\u00b2 - (120 / sqrt(30)) x - 960 =0.\n\nLet me simplify the coefficients. Let's rationalize 120/sqrt(30):\n\n120 / sqrt(30) = (120 sqrt(30))/30 = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4 sqrt(30) x - 960 =0.\n\nSo, solving for x:\n\nx = [4 sqrt(30) \u00b1 sqrt( (4 sqrt(30))\u00b2 + 4*1*960 )]/2\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\n(4 sqrt(30))\u00b2 + 4*1*960 = 16*30 + 3840 = 480 + 3840 = 4320.\n\nsqrt(D) = sqrt(4320). Let's simplify sqrt(4320):\n\n4320 = 64 * 67.5? Wait, 4320 = 64 * 67.5? Wait better to factor:\n\n4320 = 64 * 67.5? Hmm, maybe better as 4320 = 16 * 270 = 16 * 9 * 30 = 16*9*30. So sqrt(4320)=sqrt(16*9*30)=4*3*sqrt(30)=12 sqrt(30).\n\nTherefore sqrt(D) =12 sqrt(30). \n\nThus,\n\nx = [4 sqrt(30) \u00b112 sqrt(30)] / 2.\n\nWe can discard the negative solution since x = b + c must be positive.\n\nSo,\n\nx = [4 sqrt(30) + 12 sqrt(30)] /2 = (16 sqrt(30))/2 =8 sqrt(30),\n\nor the other solution would be [4 sqrt(30) -12 sqrt(30)] /2 = (-8 sqrt(30))/2= -4 sqrt(30), which is negative, so we discard.\n\nThus x =8 sqrt(30). \n\nTherefore, b + c =8 sqrt(30). \n\nNow, we can find bc from equation (2a):\n\nbc =156 + (39 x)/sqrt(30).\n\nPlugging x =8 sqrt(30):\n\n(39 *8 sqrt(30))/sqrt(30) = 39*8 =312. \n\nTherefore, bc =156 +312 =468.\n\nSo, bc =468. \n\nTherefore, AB\u00b7AC = c\u00b7b = bc =468. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward? Let me confirm.\n\nWait, the problem asks for AB\u00b7AC. In standard notation, AB is side c, AC is side b, so their product is bc. Since we found bc=468, that's the answer. \n\nBut let me double-check all steps to make sure there was no arithmetic mistake.\n\nStarting from the key steps:\n\nWe had AI perpendicular to OI, so triangle AIO is right-angled at I. Therefore, AI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = AO\u00b2. \n\nAI\u00b2 = 156, OI\u00b2 =13, so 156 +13=169=13\u00b2, which is correct. \n\nThen, AI = sqrt(156)=2*sqrt(39). \n\nThen, using AI = r / sin(A/2), we found sin(A/2)= 3/sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, AI = r / sin(A/2), so sin(A/2) = r/AI =6/(sqrt(156)) =6/(2*sqrt(39))=3/sqrt(39). Rationalizing, that's 3 sqrt(39)/39 = sqrt(39)/13. Correct.\n\nThen, cos(A/2)=sqrt(1 - (3/sqrt(39))\u00b2)=sqrt( (39 -9)/39 )=sqrt(30/39)=sqrt(10/13). Wait, wait, sqrt(30/39)=sqrt(10/13). Wait, but earlier I had sqrt(130)/13. Let me see:\n\nsqrt(30/39)=sqrt(10/13)=sqrt(130)/13. Because sqrt(10/13)=sqrt(10*13)/13=sqrt(130)/13. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, sin A = 2 sin(A/2)cos(A/2)= 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13)= 2*sqrt(39*130)/169.\n\n39*130 = 39*13*10 = 5070. Wait, 39*130: 39*100=3900, 39*30=1170, so total 5070. sqrt(5070). Wait but earlier I thought 39*130= 3*13*13*10. Wait 39 is 3*13, 130 is 10*13, so 3*13*10*13= 3*10*13\u00b2. So sqrt(3*10*13\u00b2)=13*sqrt(30). Therefore sqrt(39*130)=13*sqrt(30). So sin A=2*13 sqrt(30)/169=26 sqrt(30)/169=2 sqrt(30)/13. Correct. \n\nThen, a=2R sin A=2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13)=4 sqrt(30). Correct. \n\nLaw of cosines gives a\u00b2 =480, then expression for area as (1/2) b c sin A =6s, leading to bc sqrt(30)/13=6s. \n\nThen, semiperimeter s=(a +b +c)/2, set x =b +c, so s=(4 sqrt(30)+x)/2.\n\nThen, bc =156 + (39x)/sqrt(30). \n\nThen equation from Law of Cosines becomes x\u00b2 - (40/13) bc =480. \n\nSubstituting bc into that equation gives quadratic in x leading to x=8 sqrt(30). \n\nThen bc =468. \n\nTherefore, AB \u00b7 AC = bc=468. \n\nThis seems consistent. Let me check if 468 is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, let me check if Euler's formula was correctly applied. OI\u00b2=R(R-2r)=13*(13-12)=13. Correct. \n\nThen, the key step was using the right triangle AIO to get AI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2=AO\u00b2. \n\nAll steps seem okay. Therefore, the answer should be 468. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{468}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find AB multiplied by AC in triangle ABC where the circumradius is 13, inradius is 6, and the line IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, let me recall some properties related to circumcenters, incenters, and the relations between them. \n\nFirst, let me note down the given information:\n\n- Triangle ABC with circumradius R = 13, so the distance from the circumcenter O to any vertex is 13.\n- Inradius r = 6, so the area can also be expressed as r times the semiperimeter: Area = r * s, where s = (a + b + c)/2.\n- The line segment IA (from the incenter I to vertex A) is perpendicular to the line segment OI (from the incenter I to the circumcenter O). So, IA \u22a5 OI.\n\nI need to find AB \u00b7 AC. Let me denote the sides as follows: let AB = c, BC = a, and AC = b. Wait, actually, standard notation is usually opposite: a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So let me stick with that. So sides are BC = a, AC = b, AB = c. The semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nThe inradius formula is Area = r * s = 6s. The circumradius formula is Area = (a b c)/(4 R) = (a b c)/52. So, setting these equal: (a b c)/52 = 6s \u2192 a b c = 312 s. Hmm, not sure if that's immediately helpful, but maybe later.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe there's a relation between the distances and coordinates? Maybe coordinate geometry could help here? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using vector approaches or trigonometric identities. Wait, maybe there's a formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, and when they are perpendicular?\n\nI recall that in some triangles, the distance between O and I can be expressed as sqrt(R(R - 2r)), but that might be only in certain cases. Wait, actually, the formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius is:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r cos \u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle between OI and some line? Wait, maybe I need to recall the exact formula.\n\nActually, the formula for OI\u00b2 is R\u00b2 - 2 R r. Wait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2 R r. Let me confirm. Hmm, perhaps not exactly. Let me recall Euler's formula, which states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2 R r. Yes, Euler's formula! So OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2 R r. \n\nWait, so if that's the case, then OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13). Hmm, but how does that relate to IA being perpendicular to OI?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to use the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. So the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. Maybe setting coordinates would help here.\n\nLet me try to set up coordinate system. Let me place the triangle in a coordinate system such that point A is at the origin, and side BC is in some position. Wait, maybe it's better to position point A at (0,0), and set coordinates such that calculations are easier. Alternatively, maybe place the circumcenter O at the origin? Hmm, perhaps. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider coordinate system where point A is at (0,0), and let me set coordinates so that the incenter I is somewhere, and O is another point. But this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe use barycentric coordinates? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think of another approach.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, the line IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the direction vector of IA is perpendicular to the direction vector of OI. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities in triangle AIO. Since IA \u22a5 OI, then angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees, so triangle AIO is right-angled at I. Therefore, in triangle AIO, by Pythagoras:\n\nAI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = AO\u00b2.\n\nWait, yes! Because if IA is perpendicular to OI, then triangle AIO is right-angled at I, so AI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = AO\u00b2. That seems right. \n\nSo, let's note that:\n\nAI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = AO\u00b2.\n\nWe can express each of these terms in terms of the triangle's elements. \n\nFirst, AO is the distance from the circumcenter O to vertex A, which is equal to the circumradius R, so AO = 13. Therefore, AO\u00b2 = 169.\n\nOI\u00b2 is given by Euler's formula: OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*(1) = 13. Wait, hold on, Euler's formula says OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2 R r. Wait, let me confirm Euler's formula again.\n\nYes, Euler's formula states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2 R r. So with R = 13 and r = 6, this would be OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13). \n\nTherefore, substituting back into the equation from the right triangle AIO:\n\nAI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = AO\u00b2 \u2192 AI\u00b2 + 13 = 169 \u2192 AI\u00b2 = 169 - 13 = 156 \u2192 AI = sqrt(156). \n\nSo we now know AI = sqrt(156). \n\nNow, we need to relate AI to the sides of the triangle. There is a formula for the length of the inradius and the distances from the incenter to the vertices. \n\nThe formula for AI can be given in terms of the sides and angles. Specifically, in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A is given by:\n\nAI = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nAlternatively, another formula: AI = \\sqrt{r^2 + \\left( \\frac{a}{2} \\right)^2 }, but I might be misremembering. Wait, let me recall the formula properly.\n\nThe formula for the length of the angle bisector might not be directly helpful here. Alternatively, in terms of the sides:\n\nIn triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed as:\n\nAI = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{b c s (s - a)}}{b + c}\n\nwhere a, b, c are the sides opposite to angles A, B, C respectively, and s is the semiperimeter. Wait, I might need to verify this formula.\n\nAlternatively, another way: In triangle ABC, the inradius is r, and the distances from the incenter to the vertices can be expressed using trigonometric functions. \n\nSpecifically, in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A is given by:\n\nAI = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nYes, I think this is correct. Let me see. The inradius is the distance from I to each side, so in the angle bisector of angle A, the inradius is the distance from I to side BC, which is r. The distance from I to vertex A would then form a right triangle with angle A/2 at I, so AI is the hypotenuse. Therefore, sin(A/2) = r / AI \u21d2 AI = r / sin(A/2). \n\nYes, that formula seems correct. So AI = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). \n\nWe found earlier that AI = sqrt(156). Therefore:\n\nsqrt(156) = 6 / sin(A/2) \u21d2 sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(156).\n\nSimplify sqrt(156): sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore,\n\nsin(A/2) = 6 / (2 sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13. Wait, let me compute that again.\n\nWait, 3 divided by sqrt(39) can be rationalized as 3 sqrt(39)/39 = sqrt(39)/13. So yes, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. \n\nHmm, okay. So sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. Let me note that down. Let me also recall that cos(A/2) can be found via Pythagorean identity: since sin\u00b2(A/2) + cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1,\n\ncos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 1 - (sqrt(39)/13)^2 = 1 - 39/169 = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169. So cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13. \n\nSo now, perhaps we can relate angle A to the sides of the triangle. \n\nAlternatively, let's recall that in triangle ABC, the circumradius R is given by the formula:\n\na / (2 sin A) = 2R \u21d2 a = 2R sin A. Wait, actually, the Law of Sines says a / sin A = 2R, so a = 2R sin A. Similarly for the other sides. \n\nSo, sides:\n\na = 2R sin A,\n\nb = 2R sin B,\n\nc = 2R sin C.\n\nSince R = 13, so a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nAlso, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = 13 (sin A + sin B + sin C).\n\nThe inradius is given by r = (Area)/s. The area can also be expressed as (a b c)/(4 R). \n\nAlternatively, the area can be expressed using the inradius: Area = r s = 6 s.\n\nSo, equate the two expressions for area: (a b c)/(4 R) = 6 s. \n\nPlugging R =13, so (a b c)/52 = 6 s \u21d2 a b c = 312 s. \n\nHmm, so we have a relation between sides a, b, c and semiperimeter s. \n\nBut perhaps we can find angle A first, then relate to sides. Since we have expressions involving angle A. Let me think.\n\nWe have angle A, and expressions for sin(A/2) and cos(A/2). Let's see if we can find sin A. \n\nUsing the double-angle formula: sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2). \n\nWe have sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13. Therefore,\n\nsin A = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*sqrt(39*130)/(13^2).\n\nSimplify sqrt(39*130): 39*130 = 39*(13*10) = 39*13*10. 39 is 3*13, so 3*13*13*10 = 3*10*13\u00b2. Therefore sqrt(3*10*13\u00b2) = 13*sqrt(30). \n\nTherefore, sin A = 2*(13 sqrt(30)) / (169) ) = (26 sqrt(30))/169 = (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo sin A = (2 sqrt(30))/13. Therefore, side a = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 4 sqrt(30). Wait, let me compute that again:\n\nWait, Law of Sines says a = 2R sin A. Since R =13,\n\na = 2*13*sin A = 26*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = (26/13)*2 sqrt(30) = 2*2 sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30). \n\nWait, that seems okay. So side BC (which is a) is 4\u221a30. \n\nSo a = 4\u221a30. \n\nHmm, that's one side. Now, we need more relations. Let me see.\n\nWe also have the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2. But since we know a, maybe we can find expressions for b and c. But we need more information. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the formula for the inradius:\n\nr = (Area)/s. Since r =6, Area =6s. \n\nAlso, Area can be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A. Because in triangle ABC, area is (1/2)*AB*AC*sin A = (1/2)*c*b*sin A. \n\nTherefore, Area = (1/2) b c sin A =6 s.\n\nWe already have sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13, so:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*(2 sqrt(30)/13) =6 s \u21d2 (b c sqrt(30)/13 ) =6 s \u21d2 b c = (6 *13 / sqrt(30)) s. \n\nHmm, but I don't know s yet. Alternatively, perhaps express s in terms of a, b, c. Since s = (a + b + c)/2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use another formula involving the inradius and the distances.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the formula for AI again. Since AI = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / (sqrt(39)/13) ) = 6*13/sqrt(39) = 78/sqrt(39) = 78 sqrt(39)/39 = 2 sqrt(39). Wait, but earlier we had AI = sqrt(156). Let me check that:\n\nsqrt(156) is sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). Yes, so that's consistent. So AI = 2 sqrt(39). \n\nIs there another formula for AI in terms of the sides? Let me recall.\n\nYes, the formula for the length of AI is:\n\nAI = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}} = \\frac{2 \\Delta}{(a + b + c) \\sin \\frac{A}{2}} }, but maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, another formula is:\n\nAI = \\sqrt{r^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{2} (b + c - a) \\right)^2 }.\n\nWait, let me check. \n\nIn triangle ABC, the distance from the inradius to vertex A can be expressed using the formula:\n\nAI = \\sqrt{r^2 + \\left( \\frac{b + c - a}{2} \\right)^2 }.\n\nIs this correct? Let me see.\n\nYes, I think so. Since the inradius is at distance r from each side, and in the angle bisector, the distance along the angle bisector to the vertex can be found via Pythagoras if we consider the inradius and the ex-radius? Wait, perhaps. Let me think of coordinates.\n\nSuppose we place the incenter I at coordinates (0,0), and the side BC is tangent to the incircle at some point. But maybe this is getting too involved. Alternatively, the formula is known as:\n\nIn any triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by:\n\nAI = \\frac{\\sqrt{bc(s - a)}}{s}\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me check a reference formula.\n\nAlternatively, according to some sources, the formula for AI is:\n\nAI = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{b c s (s - a)}}{b + c}\n\nHmm, perhaps that's the formula. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, since we have AI = 2\u221a39, and we can relate this to sides b and c. Let me see if I can use that formula.\n\nAssuming AI = (2 sqrt{b c s (s - a)})/(b + c). Let me check dimensions. The numerator would have sqrt(b c s (s - a)), which would be in terms of length squared under the root, so overall sqrt gives length, times 2/(b + c). Hmm, perhaps not sure. Alternatively, maybe another approach.\n\nWait, let's see. Since we have angle A, and sides b and c, perhaps we can use the Law of Cosines. \n\nWe know that in triangle ABC,\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c cos A.\n\nWe have a =4\u221a30, so a\u00b2 = 16*30 = 480.\n\nAlso, cos A can be found from angle A. Since we have sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13, so cos A = sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2 A) = sqrt(1 - (4*30)/169) = sqrt( (169 - 120)/169 ) = sqrt(49/169) = 7/13.\n\nTherefore, cos A =7/13. \n\nTherefore, the Law of Cosines gives:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c*(7/13).\n\nSo, 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) b c. \n\nHmm, okay, so that's equation (1).\n\nNow, the area of the triangle can also be written as (1/2) b c sin A = (1/2)*b c*(2 sqrt(30)/13) ) = (b c sqrt(30))/13. \n\nBut the area is also equal to r*s = 6 s. \n\nTherefore, (b c sqrt(30))/13 = 6 s \u21d2 b c = (6 *13 / sqrt(30)) s = (78 / sqrt(30)) s. \n\nHmm, so that's equation (2): b c = (78 / sqrt(30)) s.\n\nAlso, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2. Let me denote b + c = x. Then s = (4\u221a30 + x)/2. \n\nTherefore, equation (2) becomes:\n\nb c = (78 / sqrt(30)) * (4\u221a30 + x)/2 \n\nSimplify numerator: 78 / sqrt(30) multiplied by (4\u221a30 + x):\n\nFirst, 78/sqrt(30) *4\u221a30 = 78*4*(sqrt(30)/sqrt(30)) = 78*4 = 312,\n\nand 78/sqrt(30) * x = (78 x)/sqrt(30). \n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes:\n\nb c = [312 + (78 x)/sqrt(30)] / 2 = 156 + (39 x)/sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, so that's equation (2a): bc = 156 + (39 x)/sqrt(30), where x = b + c.\n\nAdditionally, from equation (1):\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nBut b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 can be written as (b + c)^2 - 2 bc = x\u00b2 - 2 bc. \n\nTherefore, equation (1) becomes:\n\n480 = x\u00b2 - 2 bc - (14/13) bc = x\u00b2 - (2 + 14/13) bc = x\u00b2 - ( (26 +14)/13 ) bc = x\u00b2 - (40/13) bc.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 - (40/13) bc = 480. \u2192 equation (1a)\n\nNow, let me substitute bc from equation (2a) into equation (1a):\n\nx\u00b2 - (40/13)*(156 + (39 x)/sqrt(30)) ) = 480.\n\nLet me compute this step by step. \n\nFirst, compute (40/13)*(156):\n\n40/13 *156 = 40*(156/13) = 40*12 = 480, since 156 divided by 13 is 12. \n\nThen, (40/13)*( (39 x)/sqrt(30) ) = (40*39 x)/(13 sqrt(30)) ) = ( (40/13)*39 ) x / sqrt(30) )\n\nBut 39 divided by 13 is 3, so this becomes (40 * 3)x / sqrt(30) = 120 x / sqrt(30).\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nx\u00b2 - [480 + (120 x)/sqrt(30) ] = 480.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 - 480 - (120 x)/sqrt(30) = 480 \u21d2\n\nx\u00b2 - (120 x)/sqrt(30) - 480 -480 =0 \u21d2\n\nx\u00b2 - (120 / sqrt(30)) x - 960 =0.\n\nHmm, so quadratic equation in x:\n\nx\u00b2 - (120 / sqrt(30)) x - 960 =0.\n\nLet me simplify the coefficients. Let's rationalize 120/sqrt(30):\n\n120 / sqrt(30) = (120 sqrt(30))/30 = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4 sqrt(30) x - 960 =0.\n\nSo, solving for x:\n\nx = [4 sqrt(30) \u00b1 sqrt( (4 sqrt(30))\u00b2 + 4*1*960 )]/2\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\n(4 sqrt(30))\u00b2 + 4*1*960 = 16*30 + 3840 = 480 + 3840 = 4320.\n\nsqrt(D) = sqrt(4320). Let's simplify sqrt(4320):\n\n4320 = 64 * 67.5? Wait, 4320 = 64 * 67.5? Wait better to factor:\n\n4320 = 64 * 67.5? Hmm, maybe better as 4320 = 16 * 270 = 16 * 9 * 30 = 16*9*30. So sqrt(4320)=sqrt(16*9*30)=4*3*sqrt(30)=12 sqrt(30).\n\nTherefore sqrt(D) =12 sqrt(30). \n\nThus,\n\nx = [4 sqrt(30) \u00b112 sqrt(30)] / 2.\n\nWe can discard the negative solution since x = b + c must be positive.\n\nSo,\n\nx = [4 sqrt(30) + 12 sqrt(30)] /2 = (16 sqrt(30))/2 =8 sqrt(30),\n\nor the other solution would be [4 sqrt(30) -12 sqrt(30)] /2 = (-8 sqrt(30))/2= -4 sqrt(30), which is negative, so we discard.\n\nThus x =8 sqrt(30). \n\nTherefore, b + c =8 sqrt(30). \n\nNow, we can find bc from equation (2a):\n\nbc =156 + (39 x)/sqrt(30).\n\nPlugging x =8 sqrt(30):\n\n(39 *8 sqrt(30))/sqrt(30) = 39*8 =312. \n\nTherefore, bc =156 +312 =468.\n\nSo, bc =468. \n\nTherefore, AB\u00b7AC = c\u00b7b = bc =468. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward? Let me confirm.\n\nWait, the problem asks for AB\u00b7AC. In standard notation, AB is side c, AC is side b, so their product is bc. Since we found bc=468, that's the answer. \n\nBut let me double-check all steps to make sure there was no arithmetic mistake.\n\nStarting from the key steps:\n\nWe had AI perpendicular to OI, so triangle AIO is right-angled at I. Therefore, AI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = AO\u00b2. \n\nAI\u00b2 = 156, OI\u00b2 =13, so 156 +13=169=13\u00b2, which is correct. \n\nThen, AI = sqrt(156)=2*sqrt(39). \n\nThen, using AI = r / sin(A/2), we found sin(A/2)= 3/sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, AI = r / sin(A/2), so sin(A/2) = r/AI =6/(sqrt(156)) =6/(2*sqrt(39))=3/sqrt(39). Rationalizing, that's 3 sqrt(39)/39 = sqrt(39)/13. Correct.\n\nThen, cos(A/2)=sqrt(1 - (3/sqrt(39))\u00b2)=sqrt( (39 -9)/39 )=sqrt(30/39)=sqrt(10/13). Wait, wait, sqrt(30/39)=sqrt(10/13). Wait, but earlier I had sqrt(130)/13. Let me see:\n\nsqrt(30/39)=sqrt(10/13)=sqrt(130)/13. Because sqrt(10/13)=sqrt(10*13)/13=sqrt(130)/13. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, sin A = 2 sin(A/2)cos(A/2)= 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13)= 2*sqrt(39*130)/169.\n\n39*130 = 39*13*10 = 5070. Wait, 39*130: 39*100=3900, 39*30=1170, so total 5070. sqrt(5070). Wait but earlier I thought 39*130= 3*13*13*10. Wait 39 is 3*13, 130 is 10*13, so 3*13*10*13= 3*10*13\u00b2. So sqrt(3*10*13\u00b2)=13*sqrt(30). Therefore sqrt(39*130)=13*sqrt(30). So sin A=2*13 sqrt(30)/169=26 sqrt(30)/169=2 sqrt(30)/13. Correct. \n\nThen, a=2R sin A=2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13)=4 sqrt(30). Correct. \n\nLaw of cosines gives a\u00b2 =480, then expression for area as (1/2) b c sin A =6s, leading to bc sqrt(30)/13=6s. \n\nThen, semiperimeter s=(a +b +c)/2, set x =b +c, so s=(4 sqrt(30)+x)/2.\n\nThen, bc =156 + (39x)/sqrt(30). \n\nThen equation from Law of Cosines becomes x\u00b2 - (40/13) bc =480. \n\nSubstituting bc into that equation gives quadratic in x leading to x=8 sqrt(30). \n\nThen bc =468. \n\nTherefore, AB \u00b7 AC = bc=468. \n\nThis seems consistent. Let me check if 468 is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, let me check if Euler's formula was correctly applied. OI\u00b2=R(R-2r)=13*(13-12)=13. Correct. \n\nThen, the key step was using the right triangle AIO to get AI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2=AO\u00b2. \n\nAll steps seem okay. Therefore, the answer should be 468. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{468}\n\n\nGiven triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with circumradius \\( R = 13 \\), inradius \\( r = 6 \\), and \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), we need to find \\( AB \\cdot AC \\).\n\n1. **Using Euler's Formula**:\n   The distance between the incenter \\( I \\) and circumcenter \\( O \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   OI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13(13 - 2 \\cdot 6) = 13 \\cdot 1 = 13\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\( OI = \\sqrt{13} \\).\n\n2. **Right Triangle \\( \\triangle AIO \\)**:\n   Since \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), \\( \\triangle AIO \\) is a right triangle with:\n   \\[\n   AI^2 + OI^2 = AO^2\n   \\]\n   Given \\( AO = R = 13 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   AI^2 + 13 = 13^2 \\implies AI^2 = 169 - 13 = 156 \\implies AI = \\sqrt{156} = 2\\sqrt{39}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Relating \\( AI \\) to Angle \\( A \\)**:\n   Using the formula \\( AI = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}} \\):\n   \\[\n   2\\sqrt{39} = \\frac{6}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}} \\implies \\sin \\frac{A}{2} = \\frac{6}{2\\sqrt{39}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{39}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13}\n   \\]\n   Using the Pythagorean identity:\n   \\[\n   \\cos \\frac{A}{2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{130}{169}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{130}}{13}\n   \\]\n   Then, using double-angle formulas:\n   \\[\n   \\sin A = 2 \\sin \\frac{A}{2} \\cos \\frac{A}{2} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{130}}{13} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\cos A = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 A} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13} \\right)^2} = \\frac{7}{13}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Law of Sines and Cosines**:\n   Side \\( a \\) (opposite angle \\( A \\)):\n   \\[\n   a = 2R \\sin A = 2 \\cdot 13 \\cdot \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\\sqrt{30}\n   \\]\n   Using the Law of Cosines:\n   \\[\n   a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A \\implies 480 = b^2 + c^2 - \\frac{14}{13}bc\n   \\]\n\n5. **Semiperimeter and Area**:\n   Let \\( s \\) be the semiperimeter and \\( x = b + c \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. The problem states:\n\nLet triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. Find AB\u00b7AC.\n\nHmm, so we need to find the product of the lengths of sides AB and AC in triangle ABC given some conditions about its circumradius, inradius, and the perpendicularity of IA and OI.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties and formulas related to triangle centers, circumradius, inradius, and maybe some coordinate geometry.\n\nWe know that the circumradius (R) is given as 13, and the inradius (r) is 6. The key condition here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the circumcenter O to the incenter I. \n\nI need to find AB\u00b7AC. Maybe I can use some relations involving the sides of the triangle, the inradius, circumradius, and the given perpendicularity condition.\n\nLet me start by recalling some important formulas:\n\n1. In any triangle, the inradius r is related to the area (\u0394) and semiperimeter (s) by r = \u0394/s.\n\n2. The circumradius R is related to the sides a, b, c by the formula R = (a b c)/(4\u0394).\n\n3. The distance between the incenter (I) and circumcenter (O) can be given by the formula: OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that correct? Let me verify.\n\nHmm, actually, the formula for the distance between incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Yes, that's the formula. So OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Since R = 13 and r =6, then OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, OI = sqrt(13). Wait, but maybe that's not directly useful here yet.\n\nBut the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. Let me think how to use that condition.\n\nPerhaps we can use coordinate geometry here. Let me try setting up coordinates such that the triangle is placed in a coordinate system to simplify calculations. Let me consider placing point A at the origin, but maybe another configuration would be better. Alternatively, maybe using vector geometry?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using trigonometric relationships.\n\nAlternatively, since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. To use this, maybe we can express the coordinates of O and I in terms of the triangle's sides and angles?\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that in a triangle, the incenter, circumcenter, and centroid have certain relations, but maybe that's not directly helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula involving the distance between O and I and the angle at A?\n\nAlternatively, since IA is perpendicular to OI, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OIA. Let me see:\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, then triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at A. Wait, no, because IA is perpendicular to OI, so the right angle is at I? Wait, no, IA is perpendicular to OI, so the lines IA and OI are perpendicular. So the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle OIA has a right angle at A? Wait, no, the right angle would be where the two lines meet. Since IA and OI are lines, they meet at point I? Wait no, IA is the line from I to A, and OI is the line from O to I. So the two lines IA and OI meet at I. Therefore, the angle between them is at point I. Therefore, the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle OIA has a right angle at I. So, triangle OIA is right-angled at I. Therefore, by Pythagoras:\n\nOI\u00b2 + II\u00b2 = OA\u00b2? Wait, no. Wait, in triangle OIA right-angled at I, then:\n\nOI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2 ?\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nIf the right angle is at I, then the sides adjacent to the right angle are II? Wait, no, points are O, I, A. The right angle is at I, so the sides forming the right angle are IO and IA. Therefore, the hypotenuse is OA. Therefore, by Pythagoras:\n\nOI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2.\n\nYes, that's correct. So OI squared plus IA squared equals OA squared. \n\nWe know OA is the distance from the circumcenter O to vertex A. But the circumradius is 13, so OA = R = 13. Therefore, OA\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169.\n\nWe already found OI\u00b2 earlier as 13, right? Wait, OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 =13. So OI\u00b2 =13. \n\nTherefore, substituting into the equation:\n\n13 + IA\u00b2 = 169 \u21d2 IA\u00b2 = 169 -13 = 156 \u21d2 IA = sqrt(156). Hmm, so IA squared is 156, so IA is sqrt(156). \n\nBut maybe we can express IA in terms of the triangle's sides and angles. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed using formulae. \n\nThe formula for the length of IA is known. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by:\n\nIA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nWait, yes, that seems familiar. Let me confirm:\n\nIn triangle ABC, the inradius r is related to the distances from the incenter to the vertices. The distance from I to A can be found using trigonometric relations. \n\nIn the incenter, the angle at I between IA and the angle bisector would be... Hmm, maybe better to recall that in the formula:\n\nIn triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A is IA = \\frac{2R \\sin \\frac{A}{2}}{1} ?\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, in triangle A, the inradius is r, and the distance IA can be expressed as:\n\nIA = \\sqrt{r^2 + \\left( s - a \\right)^2 } where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite angle A. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for the length of the inradius to a vertex. \n\nYes, actually, the formula is:\n\nIA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nLet me verify this formula. Let me consider the incenter I. The distance from I to vertex A can be found by considering the angle bisector of angle A. In the triangle formed by vertex A, the inradius, and the incenter, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, in the exradius formulas, but maybe it's better to derive it.\n\nLet me consider the angle bisector of angle A. The inradius is the distance from I to side BC, which is r. The distance from I to vertex A can be found by considering the right triangle formed by I, the foot of the inradius on side BC, and vertex A. Wait, no, that might not be a right triangle. Alternatively, perhaps in the triangle formed by A, I, and the point where the incircle touches side BC.\n\nLet me denote the point where the incircle touches BC as D. Then AD is the angle bisector of angle A, and ID is perpendicular to BC (since it's the inradius). So, triangle AID is a right triangle at D? Wait, no, ID is perpendicular to BC, but AD is the angle bisector. Hmm, perhaps considering triangle AID.\n\nWait, in triangle AID, angle at D is right angle. So, we can write:\n\nIn triangle AID:\n\nIA\u00b2 = ID\u00b2 + AD\u00b2.\n\nBut ID is equal to the inradius r, so ID = 6. \n\nAD is the length from A to the point of tangency D on BC. The length AD can be expressed in terms of the semiperimeter.\n\nWait, the length from vertex A to the point where the incircle touches BC is equal to s - a, where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite angle A. Wait, yes:\n\nIn a triangle, the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency are given by:\n\nIf the incircle touches BC at D, AC at E, and AB at F, then:\n\nBD = s - b,\n\nDC = s - a,\n\nWait, actually, let me recall the exact formula: \n\nThe length from vertex A to the point of tangency on BC is s - a, where a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. Wait, actually:\n\nWait, the lengths are:\n\nBD = s - b,\n\nDC = s - c,\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check:\n\nWait, the standard formula is that the length from vertex B to the point where the incircle touches AC is s - BC. Wait, let me think again.\n\nLet me denote the sides as follows: Let BC = a, AC = b, AB = c. Then the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nThen the length from A to the point where the incircle touches BC is s - a? Wait, no, actually, the length from vertex A to the point of tangency on BC is s - a?\n\nWait, no, actually, the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency are:\n\nFrom A to the point on BC: s - a? Wait, no, let me recall:\n\nWait, the length from vertex A to the point where the incircle touches side BC is actually s - a? Hmm, perhaps I need to get this straight.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIn standard notation, the lengths are:\n\nBD = s - b,\n\nDC = s - c,\n\nWait, no, perhaps:\n\nWait, if the incircle touches BC at D, then BD = (AB + BC - AC)/2 ?\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me recall:\n\nThe length from vertex B to the touch point on side AC is equal to (AB + BC - AC)/2. Wait, perhaps:\n\nWait, the formula for the length from vertex A to the touch point on BC is (AB + AC - BC)/2. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, indeed, in triangle ABC, the length from vertex A to the touch point on BC is (AB + AC - BC)/2. Similarly, from B to touch point on AC is (AB + BC - AC)/2, and from C to touch point on AB is (BC + AC - AB)/2.\n\nTherefore, if we denote the touch point on BC as D, then:\n\nAD = (AB + AC - BC)/2 = (c + b - a)/2 = s - a,\n\nsince s = (a + b + c)/2, so s - a = (-a + b + c)/2 = (b + c - a)/2, which matches the above. So, yes, AD = s - a.\n\nTherefore, in triangle AID, which is a right triangle at D (since ID is the inradius and perpendicular to BC), we have:\n\nIA\u00b2 = ID\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nTherefore, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nSimilarly, this gives IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nAlternatively, another formula for IA is IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Let me see if these are consistent.\n\nSuppose we have IA = r / sin(A/2). Let me check with the previous formula.\n\nUsing IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a trigonometric identity that can relate these.\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\nIn triangle AID, angle at I between IA and ID is angle between IA and the inradius direction, which is angle between IA and ID, which is equal to angle between IA and the angle bisector? Hmm, maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider angle bisector. The incenter lies along the angle bisector of angle A. The distance from I to A can be related to the angle.\n\nLet me consider the angle bisector of angle A, which splits angle A into two angles of measure A/2. In the triangle AIO, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using trigonometric relations in triangle AIO. Wait, but we have triangle OIA right-angled at I. Let me think again.\n\nWe had earlier that OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2, which gave us IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2 - OI\u00b2 = 169 - 13 = 156. Therefore, IA = sqrt(156). \n\nSo, IA squared is 156. \n\nFrom the formula IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2, so:\n\n156 = 6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 \u21d2 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 \u21d2 (s - a)^2 = 120 \u21d2 s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30). Hmm, but maybe we can keep it as (s - a)^2 = 120 for now.\n\nAlternatively, using the other formula IA = r / sin(A/2). So, sqrt(156) = 6 / sin(A/2) \u21d2 sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(156) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13. Wait, let me compute that again:\n\nsqrt(156) is sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore,\n\nIA = 2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2)\n\nThus, sin(A/2) = 6/(2*sqrt(39)) = 3/sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13? Wait:\n\nWait, 3/sqrt(39) can be rationalized as 3*sqrt(39)/39 = sqrt(39)/13. Yes, so sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me note that down.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. Therefore, cos(A/2) can be found via Pythagorean identity:\n\ncos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169 \u21d2 cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nTherefore, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find angle A itself. Let me see:\n\nWe can use the double-angle formula:\n\ncos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 -78)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13 / 13\u00b2 = 7/13.\n\nTherefore, cos A = 7/13. Therefore, angle A has cosine 7/13, so angle A is arccos(7/13). Maybe that's useful later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can relate this to the sides of the triangle.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the circumradius R = a/(2 sin A), but actually, the formula is:\n\nIn any triangle, a / sin A = 2R.\n\nTherefore, a = 2R sin A. Similarly for other sides.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nLaw of sines: a / sin A = 2R. So, yes, a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.\n\nSince R is given as 13, so a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nHmm, that could be helpful.\n\nAlso, the inradius r is given by r = \u0394/s, where \u0394 is the area and s is the semiperimeter.\n\nWe know r =6, so 6 = \u0394/s \u21d2 \u0394 = 6s.\n\nAlso, area can be expressed via the formula \u0394 = (a b c)/(4R). Since R =13, so \u0394 = (a b c)/(52).\n\nTherefore, 6s = (a b c)/52 \u21d2 a b c = 6*52*s = 312 s.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can relate these equations.\n\nAlternatively, since we have angle A, which we found cos A = 7/13, so sin A can be found as sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nThus, sin A = 2\u221a30 /13.\n\nTherefore, side a = BC = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2\u221a30 /13) = 4\u221a30. Wait, let me compute that again:\n\nWait, a = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2\u221a30/13) = 2*13*(2\u221a30)/13 = 2*2\u221a30 = 4\u221a30. So BC = a =4\u221a30. Wait, that's interesting. So BC is known?\n\nWait, but BC is side a, which is opposite angle A. So, if angle A is known, then side a can be found via the Law of Sines. Since we have angle A, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, a = 4\u221a30. Okay, so that's one side.\n\nNow, perhaps we can express other sides in terms of angles. Let's denote sides as:\n\na = BC =4\u221a30,\n\nb = AC,\n\nc = AB.\n\nWe need to find AB * AC = c * b.\n\nSo, if we can find b and c, then we can compute their product.\n\nWe need more equations. Let's see.\n\nWe also know that the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nThe area \u0394 can be expressed as 6s (since r =6) and also as (a b c)/(4R) = (a b c)/52. So, 6s = (a b c)/52 \u21d2 a b c = 312 s.\n\nAdditionally, the Law of Cosines can be used for angle A:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c cos A.\n\nWe know a =4\u221a30, so a\u00b2 = 16*30 = 480,\n\ncos A =7/13,\n\nso,\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c*(7/13).\n\nHmm, that's one equation involving b and c.\n\nWe need another equation. Let's see if we can find another relation.\n\nRecall that the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nand we have the inradius formula. Also, perhaps the formula involving the inradius and the sides:\n\nr = (\u0394)/s \u21d2 \u0394 =6s,\n\nand \u0394 can also be expressed via other formulas, such as:\n\n\u0394 = (1/2) b c sin A,\n\nsince angle A is between sides b and c (sides AC and AB).\n\nTherefore, \u0394 = (1/2) b c sin A.\n\nWe know sin A = 2\u221a30 /13,\n\nso,\n\n\u0394 = (1/2) b c*(2\u221a30 /13) = (b c \u221a30)/13.\n\nBut also \u0394 =6s,\n\nso,\n\n(b c \u221a30)/13 =6s \u21d2 bc\u221a30 = 78 s \u21d2 bc = (78 /\u221a30) s = (78\u221a30)/30 s = (13\u221a30)/5 s.\n\nHmm, so bc = (13\u221a30 /5 ) s. \n\nHmm, but we need another equation. Let's see.\n\nWe also have the formula a b c = 312 s.\n\nWe can substitute bc from above into this equation. Let me see:\n\na b c = a * (bc) = a*(13\u221a30 /5 ) s = 312 s \u21d2\n\n(4\u221a30)*(13\u221a30 /5 ) s = 312 s \u21d2\n\nLet me compute the left-hand side:\n\n4\u221a30 *13\u221a30 /5 = (4*13)*(\u221a30 * \u221a30)/5 = 52*(30)/5 = 52*6 = 312.\n\nTherefore, 312 s = 312 s. Hmm, so that equation is just an identity, so it doesn't give new information. Therefore, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the semiperimeter s.\n\nWe can write s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2.\n\nWe can also use the formula for the inradius in terms of the sides and angles. Wait, perhaps using the formula for the distance IA.\n\nEarlier, we had IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2,\n\nand we found that IA\u00b2 =156, so 156 = 6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 \u21d2 (s - a)^2 = 156 - 36 = 120 \u21d2 s - a = sqrt(120).\n\nTherefore, s - a = 2*sqrt(30). \n\nSince a is 4\u221a30,\n\nthen s - 4\u221a30 = 2\u221a30 \u21d2 s = 4\u221a30 + 2\u221a30 = 6\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, the semiperimeter s is 6\u221a30. \n\nThat's a key piece of information. So s =6\u221a30. \n\nTherefore, the semiperimeter s =6\u221a30,\n\nso the perimeter is 12\u221a30,\n\nso a + b + c =12\u221a30,\n\nand since a =4\u221a30,\n\nthen b + c =12\u221a30 -4\u221a30 =8\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, b + c =8\u221a30.\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. From the Law of Cosines:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (2*(7/13)) b c,\n\n2. From the semiperimeter:\n\nb + c =8\u221a30.\n\nAlso, from the area formula:\n\n\u0394 = (1/2) b c sin A = (1/2) b c*(2\u221a30/13) = (b c \u221a30)/13,\n\nand since \u0394 =6s =6*(6\u221a30) =36\u221a30,\n\nso:\n\n(b c \u221a30)/13 =36\u221a30 \u21d2 bc /13 =36 \u21d2 bc =36*13 =468.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Let me check again:\n\n\u0394 = (b c \u221a30)/13 =6s =6*(6\u221a30)=36\u221a30,\n\nso (b c \u221a30)/13 =36\u221a30,\n\ndividing both sides by \u221a30,\n\n(b c)/13 =36,\n\nso bc= 36*13 = 468. \n\nSo, bc =468. Which is exactly the product we need to find, AB * AC = c * b = bc =468. Wait, so is that the answer? Wait, hold on. Wait, let me confirm:\n\nWait, in the problem, AB and AC are sides b and c? Let me check:\n\nWait, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So AC is b, AB is c. Therefore, AB * AC = c * b = bc. Which we just found as 468. Therefore, is the answer 468?\n\nWait, but let me confirm that all steps are correct.\n\nWait, so starting from \u0394 = (1/2)*b*c*sin A,\n\nsin A was found as 2\u221a30/13,\n\nso substituting,\n\n\u0394 = (1/2)*b*c*(2\u221a30/13) = (b c \u221a30)/13,\n\nand since \u0394 =6*s,\n\nand s =6\u221a30,\n\nso 6*s=36\u221a30,\n\nthus,\n\n(b c \u221a30)/13 =36\u221a30 \u21d2 bc= (36\u221a30 *13)/\u221a30 =36*13=468. \n\nYes, so bc=468. \n\nTherefore, the product AB * AC = bc =468.\n\nBut wait, let me check if all steps are valid.\n\nFirst, we found angle A had cos A=7/13, so sin A=2\u221a30/13,\n\nthen using Law of Sines, a=2R sin A,\n\nso a=2*13*(2\u221a30/13)=4\u221a30. Correct.\n\nThen, using the condition IA perpendicular to OI, we found IA\u00b2=156,\n\nthen using IA\u00b2 =r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2,\n\nso 156=36 + (s -a)^2 \u21d2 s -a= sqrt(120)=2*sqrt(30),\n\ntherefore s =a +2\u221a30=4\u221a30 +2\u221a30=6\u221a30,\n\nso s=6\u221a30,\n\nso perimeter is 12\u221a30,\n\nso b +c=8\u221a30,\n\nand then from area,\n\n\u0394= (b c \u221a30)/13=36\u221a30 \u21d2 bc=468.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 468. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure there are no errors here.\n\nWait, let me verify the key step where we used the right angle in triangle OIA leading to OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2.\n\nWe had OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r) =13*(13-12)=13,\n\nOA\u00b2 =13\u00b2=169,\n\nso 13 + IA\u00b2 =169 \u21d2 IA\u00b2=156,\n\nwhich led to IA =sqrt(156). \n\nThen, using IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2,\n\nso 156 =36 + (s -a)^2,\n\nso s -a =sqrt(120),\n\nthen s =a +sqrt(120)=4\u221a30 + 2*sqrt(30)=6\u221a30,\n\nso that's correct. \n\nThen, using area expressions, we arrived at bc=468. \n\nTherefore, unless there is a miscalculation here, the answer should be 468. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming which sides are a,b,c. Let me confirm:\n\nIn standard notation,\n\na is BC, opposite angle A,\n\nb is AC, opposite angle B,\n\nc is AB, opposite angle C.\n\nTherefore, AB is side c,\n\nAC is side b,\n\nso AB * AC = c * b = bc,\n\nso yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects an integer, which 468 is, so that's plausible.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 468. \n\nWait, but let me just check another equation to see if it's consistent.\n\nWe had from the Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A,\n\nwith a =4\u221a30, so a\u00b2 = 16*30 =480,\n\nand bc =468,\n\ncos A =7/13,\n\nso,\n\n480 = b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 - 2*(468)*(7/13).\n\nLet me compute 2*(468)*(7)/13.\n\nFirst, 468 divided by13 is 36 (since 13*36=468),\n\nso 2*36*7 = 2*252=504,\n\nso,\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -504 \u21d2\n\nb\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =480 +504 =984.\n\nBut also, since b + c =8\u221a30,\n\nthen (b +c)^2 = (8\u221a30)^2 =64*30=1920,\n\nso,\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2bc =1920,\n\ntherefore,\n\nb\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =1920 - 2*468 =1920 -936=984.\n\nWhich matches the previous result. Therefore, consistent.\n\nThus, everything checks out. Therefore, the answer is 468.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{468}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. The problem states:\n\nLet triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. Find AB\u00b7AC.\n\nHmm, so we need to find the product of the lengths of sides AB and AC in triangle ABC given some conditions about its circumradius, inradius, and the perpendicularity of IA and OI.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties and formulas related to triangle centers, circumradius, inradius, and maybe some coordinate geometry.\n\nWe know that the circumradius (R) is given as 13, and the inradius (r) is 6. The key condition here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the circumcenter O to the incenter I. \n\nI need to find AB\u00b7AC. Maybe I can use some relations involving the sides of the triangle, the inradius, circumradius, and the given perpendicularity condition.\n\nLet me start by recalling some important formulas:\n\n1. In any triangle, the inradius r is related to the area (\u0394) and semiperimeter (s) by r = \u0394/s.\n\n2. The circumradius R is related to the sides a, b, c by the formula R = (a b c)/(4\u0394).\n\n3. The distance between the incenter (I) and circumcenter (O) can be given by the formula: OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that correct? Let me verify.\n\nHmm, actually, the formula for the distance between incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Yes, that's the formula. So OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Since R = 13 and r =6, then OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, OI = sqrt(13). Wait, but maybe that's not directly useful here yet.\n\nBut the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. Let me think how to use that condition.\n\nPerhaps we can use coordinate geometry here. Let me try setting up coordinates such that the triangle is placed in a coordinate system to simplify calculations. Let me consider placing point A at the origin, but maybe another configuration would be better. Alternatively, maybe using vector geometry?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using trigonometric relationships.\n\nAlternatively, since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. To use this, maybe we can express the coordinates of O and I in terms of the triangle's sides and angles?\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that in a triangle, the incenter, circumcenter, and centroid have certain relations, but maybe that's not directly helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula involving the distance between O and I and the angle at A?\n\nAlternatively, since IA is perpendicular to OI, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OIA. Let me see:\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, then triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at A. Wait, no, because IA is perpendicular to OI, so the right angle is at I? Wait, no, IA is perpendicular to OI, so the lines IA and OI are perpendicular. So the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle OIA has a right angle at A? Wait, no, the right angle would be where the two lines meet. Since IA and OI are lines, they meet at point I? Wait no, IA is the line from I to A, and OI is the line from O to I. So the two lines IA and OI meet at I. Therefore, the angle between them is at point I. Therefore, the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle OIA has a right angle at I. So, triangle OIA is right-angled at I. Therefore, by Pythagoras:\n\nOI\u00b2 + II\u00b2 = OA\u00b2? Wait, no. Wait, in triangle OIA right-angled at I, then:\n\nOI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2 ?\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nIf the right angle is at I, then the sides adjacent to the right angle are II? Wait, no, points are O, I, A. The right angle is at I, so the sides forming the right angle are IO and IA. Therefore, the hypotenuse is OA. Therefore, by Pythagoras:\n\nOI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2.\n\nYes, that's correct. So OI squared plus IA squared equals OA squared. \n\nWe know OA is the distance from the circumcenter O to vertex A. But the circumradius is 13, so OA = R = 13. Therefore, OA\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169.\n\nWe already found OI\u00b2 earlier as 13, right? Wait, OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 =13. So OI\u00b2 =13. \n\nTherefore, substituting into the equation:\n\n13 + IA\u00b2 = 169 \u21d2 IA\u00b2 = 169 -13 = 156 \u21d2 IA = sqrt(156). Hmm, so IA squared is 156, so IA is sqrt(156). \n\nBut maybe we can express IA in terms of the triangle's sides and angles. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed using formulae. \n\nThe formula for the length of IA is known. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by:\n\nIA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nWait, yes, that seems familiar. Let me confirm:\n\nIn triangle ABC, the inradius r is related to the distances from the incenter to the vertices. The distance from I to A can be found using trigonometric relations. \n\nIn the incenter, the angle at I between IA and the angle bisector would be... Hmm, maybe better to recall that in the formula:\n\nIn triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A is IA = \\frac{2R \\sin \\frac{A}{2}}{1} ?\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, in triangle A, the inradius is r, and the distance IA can be expressed as:\n\nIA = \\sqrt{r^2 + \\left( s - a \\right)^2 } where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite angle A. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for the length of the inradius to a vertex. \n\nYes, actually, the formula is:\n\nIA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nLet me verify this formula. Let me consider the incenter I. The distance from I to vertex A can be found by considering the angle bisector of angle A. In the triangle formed by vertex A, the inradius, and the incenter, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, in the exradius formulas, but maybe it's better to derive it.\n\nLet me consider the angle bisector of angle A. The inradius is the distance from I to side BC, which is r. The distance from I to vertex A can be found by considering the right triangle formed by I, the foot of the inradius on side BC, and vertex A. Wait, no, that might not be a right triangle. Alternatively, perhaps in the triangle formed by A, I, and the point where the incircle touches side BC.\n\nLet me denote the point where the incircle touches BC as D. Then AD is the angle bisector of angle A, and ID is perpendicular to BC (since it's the inradius). So, triangle AID is a right triangle at D? Wait, no, ID is perpendicular to BC, but AD is the angle bisector. Hmm, perhaps considering triangle AID.\n\nWait, in triangle AID, angle at D is right angle. So, we can write:\n\nIn triangle AID:\n\nIA\u00b2 = ID\u00b2 + AD\u00b2.\n\nBut ID is equal to the inradius r, so ID = 6. \n\nAD is the length from A to the point of tangency D on BC. The length AD can be expressed in terms of the semiperimeter.\n\nWait, the length from vertex A to the point where the incircle touches BC is equal to s - a, where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite angle A. Wait, yes:\n\nIn a triangle, the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency are given by:\n\nIf the incircle touches BC at D, AC at E, and AB at F, then:\n\nBD = s - b,\n\nDC = s - a,\n\nWait, actually, let me recall the exact formula: \n\nThe length from vertex A to the point of tangency on BC is s - a, where a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. Wait, actually:\n\nWait, the lengths are:\n\nBD = s - b,\n\nDC = s - c,\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check:\n\nWait, the standard formula is that the length from vertex B to the point where the incircle touches AC is s - BC. Wait, let me think again.\n\nLet me denote the sides as follows: Let BC = a, AC = b, AB = c. Then the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nThen the length from A to the point where the incircle touches BC is s - a? Wait, no, actually, the length from vertex A to the point of tangency on BC is s - a?\n\nWait, no, actually, the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency are:\n\nFrom A to the point on BC: s - a? Wait, no, let me recall:\n\nWait, the length from vertex A to the point where the incircle touches side BC is actually s - a? Hmm, perhaps I need to get this straight.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIn standard notation, the lengths are:\n\nBD = s - b,\n\nDC = s - c,\n\nWait, no, perhaps:\n\nWait, if the incircle touches BC at D, then BD = (AB + BC - AC)/2 ?\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me recall:\n\nThe length from vertex B to the touch point on side AC is equal to (AB + BC - AC)/2. Wait, perhaps:\n\nWait, the formula for the length from vertex A to the touch point on BC is (AB + AC - BC)/2. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, indeed, in triangle ABC, the length from vertex A to the touch point on BC is (AB + AC - BC)/2. Similarly, from B to touch point on AC is (AB + BC - AC)/2, and from C to touch point on AB is (BC + AC - AB)/2.\n\nTherefore, if we denote the touch point on BC as D, then:\n\nAD = (AB + AC - BC)/2 = (c + b - a)/2 = s - a,\n\nsince s = (a + b + c)/2, so s - a = (-a + b + c)/2 = (b + c - a)/2, which matches the above. So, yes, AD = s - a.\n\nTherefore, in triangle AID, which is a right triangle at D (since ID is the inradius and perpendicular to BC), we have:\n\nIA\u00b2 = ID\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nTherefore, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nSimilarly, this gives IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nAlternatively, another formula for IA is IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Let me see if these are consistent.\n\nSuppose we have IA = r / sin(A/2). Let me check with the previous formula.\n\nUsing IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a trigonometric identity that can relate these.\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\nIn triangle AID, angle at I between IA and ID is angle between IA and the inradius direction, which is angle between IA and ID, which is equal to angle between IA and the angle bisector? Hmm, maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider angle bisector. The incenter lies along the angle bisector of angle A. The distance from I to A can be related to the angle.\n\nLet me consider the angle bisector of angle A, which splits angle A into two angles of measure A/2. In the triangle AIO, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using trigonometric relations in triangle AIO. Wait, but we have triangle OIA right-angled at I. Let me think again.\n\nWe had earlier that OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2, which gave us IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2 - OI\u00b2 = 169 - 13 = 156. Therefore, IA = sqrt(156). \n\nSo, IA squared is 156. \n\nFrom the formula IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2, so:\n\n156 = 6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 \u21d2 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 \u21d2 (s - a)^2 = 120 \u21d2 s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30). Hmm, but maybe we can keep it as (s - a)^2 = 120 for now.\n\nAlternatively, using the other formula IA = r / sin(A/2). So, sqrt(156) = 6 / sin(A/2) \u21d2 sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(156) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13. Wait, let me compute that again:\n\nsqrt(156) is sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore,\n\nIA = 2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2)\n\nThus, sin(A/2) = 6/(2*sqrt(39)) = 3/sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13? Wait:\n\nWait, 3/sqrt(39) can be rationalized as 3*sqrt(39)/39 = sqrt(39)/13. Yes, so sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me note that down.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. Therefore, cos(A/2) can be found via Pythagorean identity:\n\ncos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169 \u21d2 cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nTherefore, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find angle A itself. Let me see:\n\nWe can use the double-angle formula:\n\ncos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 -78)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13 / 13\u00b2 = 7/13.\n\nTherefore, cos A = 7/13. Therefore, angle A has cosine 7/13, so angle A is arccos(7/13). Maybe that's useful later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can relate this to the sides of the triangle.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the circumradius R = a/(2 sin A), but actually, the formula is:\n\nIn any triangle, a / sin A = 2R.\n\nTherefore, a = 2R sin A. Similarly for other sides.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nLaw of sines: a / sin A = 2R. So, yes, a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.\n\nSince R is given as 13, so a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nHmm, that could be helpful.\n\nAlso, the inradius r is given by r = \u0394/s, where \u0394 is the area and s is the semiperimeter.\n\nWe know r =6, so 6 = \u0394/s \u21d2 \u0394 = 6s.\n\nAlso, area can be expressed via the formula \u0394 = (a b c)/(4R). Since R =13, so \u0394 = (a b c)/(52).\n\nTherefore, 6s = (a b c)/52 \u21d2 a b c = 6*52*s = 312 s.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can relate these equations.\n\nAlternatively, since we have angle A, which we found cos A = 7/13, so sin A can be found as sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nThus, sin A = 2\u221a30 /13.\n\nTherefore, side a = BC = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2\u221a30 /13) = 4\u221a30. Wait, let me compute that again:\n\nWait, a = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2\u221a30/13) = 2*13*(2\u221a30)/13 = 2*2\u221a30 = 4\u221a30. So BC = a =4\u221a30. Wait, that's interesting. So BC is known?\n\nWait, but BC is side a, which is opposite angle A. So, if angle A is known, then side a can be found via the Law of Sines. Since we have angle A, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, a = 4\u221a30. Okay, so that's one side.\n\nNow, perhaps we can express other sides in terms of angles. Let's denote sides as:\n\na = BC =4\u221a30,\n\nb = AC,\n\nc = AB.\n\nWe need to find AB * AC = c * b.\n\nSo, if we can find b and c, then we can compute their product.\n\nWe need more equations. Let's see.\n\nWe also know that the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nThe area \u0394 can be expressed as 6s (since r =6) and also as (a b c)/(4R) = (a b c)/52. So, 6s = (a b c)/52 \u21d2 a b c = 312 s.\n\nAdditionally, the Law of Cosines can be used for angle A:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c cos A.\n\nWe know a =4\u221a30, so a\u00b2 = 16*30 = 480,\n\ncos A =7/13,\n\nso,\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c*(7/13).\n\nHmm, that's one equation involving b and c.\n\nWe need another equation. Let's see if we can find another relation.\n\nRecall that the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nand we have the inradius formula. Also, perhaps the formula involving the inradius and the sides:\n\nr = (\u0394)/s \u21d2 \u0394 =6s,\n\nand \u0394 can also be expressed via other formulas, such as:\n\n\u0394 = (1/2) b c sin A,\n\nsince angle A is between sides b and c (sides AC and AB).\n\nTherefore, \u0394 = (1/2) b c sin A.\n\nWe know sin A = 2\u221a30 /13,\n\nso,\n\n\u0394 = (1/2) b c*(2\u221a30 /13) = (b c \u221a30)/13.\n\nBut also \u0394 =6s,\n\nso,\n\n(b c \u221a30)/13 =6s \u21d2 bc\u221a30 = 78 s \u21d2 bc = (78 /\u221a30) s = (78\u221a30)/30 s = (13\u221a30)/5 s.\n\nHmm, so bc = (13\u221a30 /5 ) s. \n\nHmm, but we need another equation. Let's see.\n\nWe also have the formula a b c = 312 s.\n\nWe can substitute bc from above into this equation. Let me see:\n\na b c = a * (bc) = a*(13\u221a30 /5 ) s = 312 s \u21d2\n\n(4\u221a30)*(13\u221a30 /5 ) s = 312 s \u21d2\n\nLet me compute the left-hand side:\n\n4\u221a30 *13\u221a30 /5 = (4*13)*(\u221a30 * \u221a30)/5 = 52*(30)/5 = 52*6 = 312.\n\nTherefore, 312 s = 312 s. Hmm, so that equation is just an identity, so it doesn't give new information. Therefore, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the semiperimeter s.\n\nWe can write s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2.\n\nWe can also use the formula for the inradius in terms of the sides and angles. Wait, perhaps using the formula for the distance IA.\n\nEarlier, we had IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2,\n\nand we found that IA\u00b2 =156, so 156 = 6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 \u21d2 (s - a)^2 = 156 - 36 = 120 \u21d2 s - a = sqrt(120).\n\nTherefore, s - a = 2*sqrt(30). \n\nSince a is 4\u221a30,\n\nthen s - 4\u221a30 = 2\u221a30 \u21d2 s = 4\u221a30 + 2\u221a30 = 6\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, the semiperimeter s is 6\u221a30. \n\nThat's a key piece of information. So s =6\u221a30. \n\nTherefore, the semiperimeter s =6\u221a30,\n\nso the perimeter is 12\u221a30,\n\nso a + b + c =12\u221a30,\n\nand since a =4\u221a30,\n\nthen b + c =12\u221a30 -4\u221a30 =8\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, b + c =8\u221a30.\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. From the Law of Cosines:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (2*(7/13)) b c,\n\n2. From the semiperimeter:\n\nb + c =8\u221a30.\n\nAlso, from the area formula:\n\n\u0394 = (1/2) b c sin A = (1/2) b c*(2\u221a30/13) = (b c \u221a30)/13,\n\nand since \u0394 =6s =6*(6\u221a30) =36\u221a30,\n\nso:\n\n(b c \u221a30)/13 =36\u221a30 \u21d2 bc /13 =36 \u21d2 bc =36*13 =468.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Let me check again:\n\n\u0394 = (b c \u221a30)/13 =6s =6*(6\u221a30)=36\u221a30,\n\nso (b c \u221a30)/13 =36\u221a30,\n\ndividing both sides by \u221a30,\n\n(b c)/13 =36,\n\nso bc= 36*13 = 468. \n\nSo, bc =468. Which is exactly the product we need to find, AB * AC = c * b = bc =468. Wait, so is that the answer? Wait, hold on. Wait, let me confirm:\n\nWait, in the problem, AB and AC are sides b and c? Let me check:\n\nWait, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So AC is b, AB is c. Therefore, AB * AC = c * b = bc. Which we just found as 468. Therefore, is the answer 468?\n\nWait, but let me confirm that all steps are correct.\n\nWait, so starting from \u0394 = (1/2)*b*c*sin A,\n\nsin A was found as 2\u221a30/13,\n\nso substituting,\n\n\u0394 = (1/2)*b*c*(2\u221a30/13) = (b c \u221a30)/13,\n\nand since \u0394 =6*s,\n\nand s =6\u221a30,\n\nso 6*s=36\u221a30,\n\nthus,\n\n(b c \u221a30)/13 =36\u221a30 \u21d2 bc= (36\u221a30 *13)/\u221a30 =36*13=468. \n\nYes, so bc=468. \n\nTherefore, the product AB * AC = bc =468.\n\nBut wait, let me check if all steps are valid.\n\nFirst, we found angle A had cos A=7/13, so sin A=2\u221a30/13,\n\nthen using Law of Sines, a=2R sin A,\n\nso a=2*13*(2\u221a30/13)=4\u221a30. Correct.\n\nThen, using the condition IA perpendicular to OI, we found IA\u00b2=156,\n\nthen using IA\u00b2 =r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2,\n\nso 156=36 + (s -a)^2 \u21d2 s -a= sqrt(120)=2*sqrt(30),\n\ntherefore s =a +2\u221a30=4\u221a30 +2\u221a30=6\u221a30,\n\nso s=6\u221a30,\n\nso perimeter is 12\u221a30,\n\nso b +c=8\u221a30,\n\nand then from area,\n\n\u0394= (b c \u221a30)/13=36\u221a30 \u21d2 bc=468.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 468. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure there are no errors here.\n\nWait, let me verify the key step where we used the right angle in triangle OIA leading to OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2.\n\nWe had OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r) =13*(13-12)=13,\n\nOA\u00b2 =13\u00b2=169,\n\nso 13 + IA\u00b2 =169 \u21d2 IA\u00b2=156,\n\nwhich led to IA =sqrt(156). \n\nThen, using IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2,\n\nso 156 =36 + (s -a)^2,\n\nso s -a =sqrt(120),\n\nthen s =a +sqrt(120)=4\u221a30 + 2*sqrt(30)=6\u221a30,\n\nso that's correct. \n\nThen, using area expressions, we arrived at bc=468. \n\nTherefore, unless there is a miscalculation here, the answer should be 468. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming which sides are a,b,c. Let me confirm:\n\nIn standard notation,\n\na is BC, opposite angle A,\n\nb is AC, opposite angle B,\n\nc is AB, opposite angle C.\n\nTherefore, AB is side c,\n\nAC is side b,\n\nso AB * AC = c * b = bc,\n\nso yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects an integer, which 468 is, so that's plausible.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 468. \n\nWait, but let me just check another equation to see if it's consistent.\n\nWe had from the Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A,\n\nwith a =4\u221a30, so a\u00b2 = 16*30 =480,\n\nand bc =468,\n\ncos A =7/13,\n\nso,\n\n480 = b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 - 2*(468)*(7/13).\n\nLet me compute 2*(468)*(7)/13.\n\nFirst, 468 divided by13 is 36 (since 13*36=468),\n\nso 2*36*7 = 2*252=504,\n\nso,\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -504 \u21d2\n\nb\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =480 +504 =984.\n\nBut also, since b + c =8\u221a30,\n\nthen (b +c)^2 = (8\u221a30)^2 =64*30=1920,\n\nso,\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2bc =1920,\n\ntherefore,\n\nb\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =1920 - 2*468 =1920 -936=984.\n\nWhich matches the previous result. Therefore, consistent.\n\nThus, everything checks out. Therefore, the answer is 468.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{468}\n\n\nGiven triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with circumcenter \\( O \\), incenter \\( I \\), circumradius \\( R = 13 \\), inradius \\( r = 6 \\), and \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), we need to find \\( AB \\cdot AC \\).\n\n1. **Distance between \\( O \\) and \\( I \\)**:\n   \\[\n   OI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13(13 - 12) = 13\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\( OI = \\sqrt{13} \\).\n\n2. **Using the right triangle \\( \\triangle OIA \\)**:\n   Since \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), triangle \\( OIA \\) is right-angled at \\( I \\):\n   \\[\n   OI^2 + IA^2 = OA^2\n   \\]\n   Given \\( OA = R = 13 \\):\n   \\[\n   13 + IA^2 = 169 \\implies IA^2 = 156 \\implies IA = \\sqrt{156}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expressing \\( IA \\)**:\n   Using the formula \\( IA^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   156 = 6^2 + (s - a)^2 \\implies 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 \\implies (s - a)^2 = 120 \\implies s - a = 2\\sqrt{30}\n   \\]\n   where \\( s \\) is the semiperimeter and \\( a = BC \\).\n\n4. **Finding semiperimeter \\( s \\)**:\n   \\[\n   s = a + 2\\sqrt{30}\n   \\]\n   Given \\( a = 4\\sqrt{30} \\) (from the Law of Sines \\( a = 2R \\sin A \\) and \\( \\sin A = \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13} \\)):\n   \\[\n   s = 4\\sqrt{30} + 2\\sqrt{30} = 6\\sqrt{30}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculating sides \\( b \\) and \\( c \\)**:\n   - Perimeter: \\( a + b + c = 12\\sqrt{30} \\)\n   - \\( b + c = 12\\sqrt{30} - 4\\sqrt{30} = 8\\sqrt{30} \\)\n\n6. **Using area formulas**:\n   - Area \\( \\Delta = 6s = 6 \\times 6\\sqrt{30} = 36\\sqrt{30} \\)\n   - Area \\( \\Delta = \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A \\):\n     \\[\n     36\\sqrt{30} = \\frac{1}{2} bc \\left( \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13} \\right) \\implies bc = \\frac{36\\sqrt{30} \\times 13}{\\sqrt{30}} = 468\n     \\]\n\nThus, the product \\( AB \\cdot AC = bc = \\boxed{468} \\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The problem says that IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of the circumcenter and incenter. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle's sides, and it's equidistant from all three vertices, which is given here as 13 (the circumradius R = 13). The incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet, and it's equidistant from all sides of the triangle, with that distance being the inradius r = 6.\n\nThe key condition here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. Maybe I can use some coordinate geometry or vector methods? Or perhaps there's a theorem that relates these elements?\n\nLet me try to recall if there's a formula connecting the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. There is a formula: the distance squared between O and I is given byOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Wait, but is that always true? Let me check. Hmm, actually, I think that formula might be specific to certain triangles. Maybe I need to verify that.\n\nAlternatively, there's another formula: OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Yes, that sounds familiar. Let me confirm. Yes, in any triangle, the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So substituting the given values, OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). But how does that help with the given condition that IA is perpendicular to OI?\n\nHmm. The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line IA is perpendicular to the line OI. Let me think of this in terms of vectors or coordinates. Maybe setting up coordinate axes here would help.\n\nLet me try to set up coordinates. Let me place point A at the origin to simplify calculations, since we're dealing with IA and OI. Wait, but maybe it's better to place O at the origin? Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps place point A at (0,0), and set up coordinates so that IA is along a certain axis?\n\nAlternatively, since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe we can use some coordinate system where OI is along the x-axis and IA is along the y-axis? Let me try that.\n\nLet me suppose that point I is at (h, k), and point O is at (p, q). But maybe this is getting too vague. Let me think of a coordinate system where O is at the origin. Let me try that.\n\nWait, perhaps using vector approaches would be better. Let me denote vectors OA, OB, OC, and I. Since O is the circumcenter, OA, OB, OC all have length R = 13. The incenter I can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides. The coordinates of the incenter can be given by ( (aA + bB + cC)/(a + b + c) ), where a, b, c are the lengths of the sides opposite to A, B, C respectively. Hmm, but maybe that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities. Let me recall that in a triangle, the inradius r = (Area)/s, where s is the semiperimeter. The circumradius R = (a b c)/(4 Area). So maybe combining these with the given condition?\n\nWait, but the key is the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. Let me think of the vectors. Let me denote vector OI and vector IA. Since they are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.\n\nLet me denote vectors. Let me suppose that O is at the origin for simplicity, so the position vectors of A, B, C are vectors OA, OB, OC, each with magnitude R =13. Then the incenter I has position vector ( (aA + bB + cC ) / (a + b + c) ), where a, b, c are the lengths of the sides opposite to A, B, C respectively. Hmm, maybe this is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, since OA is a vector from O to A, and IA is a vector from I to A, which is A - I. The vector OI is I - O, but since O is the origin, it's just I. Wait, if O is at the origin, then vector OI is just the vector from O to I, which is I. Then the condition is that IA (which is A - I) is perpendicular to OI (which is I). So their dot product is zero:\n\n(A - I) \u00b7 I = 0\n\nExpanding that, A \u00b7 I - |I|\u00b2 = 0 => A \u00b7 I = |I|\u00b2.\n\nHmm, that might be a useful equation. Let me write that down.\n\nLet me note that if O is at the origin, then OA is the vector A with |A| = R =13. The inradius is 6, so the inradius formula is r = (Area)/s =6, where s is semiperimeter. The inradius is also related to coordinates?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use coordinates with O at the origin, and set up coordinates such that point A is along the x-axis. Let me try that.\n\nLet me place the circumcenter O at (0,0), and let me place point A at (R,0) = (13, 0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, which is the vector from O to I. So the vector IA is (A - I), and the vector OI is (I - O) = I. The dot product of IA and OI is (A - I) \u00b7 I =0.\n\nSo, (A - I) \u00b7 I =0 => A\u00b7I - |I|\u00b2 =0 => A\u00b7I = |I|\u00b2.\n\nLet me denote coordinates for I as (x,y). Since O is at (0,0), and A is at (13,0). Then vector A is (13,0), and vector I is (x,y). Then the equation becomes:\n\n(13,0) \u00b7 (x,y) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =0\n\nWhich is 13x - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =0.\n\nSo, 13x = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2. Let's note that equation (1).\n\nAlso, we know that the distance OI is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(13) from earlier? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the formula OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, plugging R =13, r=6, then OI\u00b2=13\u00b2 - 2*13*6= 169 - 156=13. So OI = sqrt(13). Therefore, sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=sqrt(13), so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=13. Wait, but from equation (1), 13x =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=13. Therefore, 13x=13 =>x=1. So x=1. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the incenter is 1, and y\u00b2=13 -x\u00b2=13-1=12, so y=\u00b12*sqrt(3). Hmm, so the incenter is at (1, 2\u221a3) or (1, -2\u221a3). Since triangles are typically considered in upper half-plane, maybe we can take y positive, so (1, 2\u221a3).\n\nSo coordinates of I are (1, 2\u221a3).\n\nNow, with O at (0,0), A at (13,0), and I at (1, 2\u221a3). Now, need to find coordinates of B and C such that I is the incenter, and then compute AB\u00b7AC.\n\nHmm, this might be a bit involved, but let's see.\n\nFirst, let me recall that in a triangle, the incenter coordinates can be given by ( (aA + bB + cC)/(a + b + c) ), where a, b, c are lengths of sides opposite to A, B, C. Wait, but in coordinate terms, if the coordinates of A, B, C are known, then the incenter can be found as a weighted average. But here, we have coordinates of A, O, I, but not B and C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for coordinates of the incenter in terms of the triangle's sides. Let me denote the sides opposite to A, B, C as a, b, c respectively. Wait, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So side a is opposite A, etc. Wait, actually, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So the incenter coordinates would be ( (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x )/(a + b + c), similar for y-coordinates). Since we placed A at (13,0), O at (0,0), and I at (1, 2\u221a3). Let me denote coordinates for B as (x_B, y_B) and C as (x_C, y_C). Then:\n\nThe incenter I has coordinates:\n\nI_x = (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x)/(a + b + c) =1,\n\nI_y = (a*A_y + b*B_y + c*C_y)/(a + b + c) =2\u221a3.\n\nBut since A is (13,0), so A_x=13, A_y=0. So:\n\nI_x = (a*13 + b x_B + c x_C)/(a + b + c) =1,\n\nI_y = (0 + b y_B + c y_C)/(a + b + c)=2\u221a3.\n\nHmm, this might get complicated with too many variables. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, since we know coordinates of O and I, perhaps we can use other properties. Let me recall that in any triangle, the inradius r = 6, so Area = r*s, where s is semiperimeter. Also, the circumradius R =13, so Area = (a b c)/(4 R). Therefore, equating these two expressions:\n\nr s = (a b c)/(4 R)\n\n=> 6 s = (a b c)/(4 *13)\n\n=> a b c = 6 s * 52 = 312 s\n\nHmm, but not sure how that helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using trigonometric identities. Let me denote angles at A, B, C as \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 respectively. Then, the inradius r = 4 R sin(\u03b1/2) sin(\u03b2/2) sin(\u03b3/2). Since r=6 and R=13,\n\n6 = 4*13 sin(\u03b1/2) sin(\u03b2/2) sin(\u03b3/2)\n\n=> sin(\u03b1/2) sin(\u03b2/2) sin(\u03b3/2)= 6/(52)= 3/26.\n\nHmm, but again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula involving the distance between incenter and circumcenter. We know OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r) =13*(13 -12)=13*1=13, which matches our previous calculation. Since OI is sqrt(13). The given condition is that IA is perpendicular to OI. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, so the line IA is tangent to the circle with diameter OI? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates is better. Let me try to proceed with coordinates.\n\nWe have O at (0,0), A at (13,0), I at (1, 2\u221a3). Let me consider coordinates of B and C. Since O is the circumcenter, points B and C lie on the circle of radius 13 centered at O. So their coordinates satisfy x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =13\u00b2.\n\nWe also know that I is the incenter. Let me recall that the incenter can be expressed as a weighted average. Let me denote sides:\n\nLet me denote the lengths:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the sides as follows:\n\na = BC, b = AC, c = AB.\n\nThen, the coordinates of the incenter I are:\n\nI_x = (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x)/(a + b + c),\n\nI_y = (a*A_y + b*B_y + c*C_y)/(a + b + c).\n\nSince A is (13,0), so A_x=13, A_y=0.\n\nSo,\n\nI_x = (a*13 + b B_x + c C_x)/(a + b + c) =1,\n\nI_y = (0 + b B_y + c C_y)/(a + b + c)=2\u221a3.\n\nHmm, but this is still complicated. Maybe we can use vector approaches. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the distance from I to O squared, which we know is 13, so OI\u00b2 =13. But we also have coordinates for I as (1, 2\u221a3), so indeed OI\u00b2 is 1\u00b2 + (2\u221a3)^2 =1 + 12=13, so that checks out.\n\nNow, perhaps we can use the fact that IA is perpendicular to OI. Since IA is the vector from I to A, which is (13 -1, 0 - 2\u221a3) = (12, -2\u221a3). The vector OI is from O to I, which is (1, 2\u221a3). The dot product should be zero:\n\n(12)(1) + (-2\u221a3)(2\u221a3) =12 - 2*2*3 =12 -12=0. Oh, that's a good check. So the coordinates are consistent with the given perpendicularity condition.\n\nSo the coordinates of I are correctly placed.\n\nNow, let me see if I can find coordinates for B and C such that I is the incenter. Let me consider that points B and C lie on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=169. Let me denote coordinates for B as (x_B, y_B) and C as (x_C, y_C). Then, since I is the incenter, the angle bisector of angle A should pass through I. Since point A is (13,0), and the incenter is (1,2\u221a3), the line from A to I is the angle bisector of angle A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the coordinates of the incenter in terms of the sides. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the lengths of the sides:\n\nLet me denote AB = c, AC = b, BC = a.\n\nWe need to find AB * AC = c * b. So if I can find b and c, then their product is the answer.\n\nWe know that the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nThe inradius r =6 = Area / s => Area =6s.\n\nThe circumradius R =13 = (a b c)/(4 Area). So substituting Area=6s,\n\n13 = (a b c)/(4 *6 s) = (a b c)/(24 s).\n\nThus, a b c = 24 s *13 = 312 s.\n\nHmm. So a b c =312 s. Not sure yet, but perhaps combining with other equations.\n\nAlso, from the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin \u03b1 = 26 sin \u03b1,\n\nSimilarly, b =26 sin \u03b2,\n\nc =26 sin \u03b3,\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are angles at A,B,C respectively.\n\nSince angles sum to \u03c0, \u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u03b3 = \u03c0.\n\nAlso, the inradius formula in terms of angles: r = 4 R sin(\u03b1/2) sin(\u03b2/2) sin(\u03b3/2) =6,\n\nSo 4*13 sin(\u03b1/2) sin(\u03b2/2) sin(\u03b3/2)=6,\n\nThus, sin(\u03b1/2) sin(\u03b2/2) sin(\u03b3/2)= 6/(52)= 3/26 \u2248 0.115.\n\nHmm, but not sure how helpful that is yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates to find relations between the sides. Let me think.\n\nWe can write the coordinates of B and C on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =169. The incenter coordinates must satisfy the weighted average condition. Let me see if I can set up equations for that.\n\nLet me denote coordinates for B as (x_B, y_B) and C as (x_C, y_C). Since they are on the circumcircle, x_B\u00b2 + y_B\u00b2 =169 and x_C\u00b2 + y_C\u00b2=169.\n\nThe incenter coordinates are given by:\n\nI_x = (a*13 + b x_B + c x_C)/(a + b + c) =1,\n\nI_y = (0 + b y_B + c y_C)/(a + b + c)=2\u221a3.\n\nLet me denote s = (a + b + c)/2, the semiperimeter. Then a + b + c = 2s.\n\nSo the equations become:\n\n13a + b x_B + c x_C = (a + b + c)*1 = 2s,\n\nand\n\nb y_B + c y_C = (a + b + c)*2\u221a3 = 2s *2\u221a3 =4 s \u221a3.\n\nHmm, but this is still complicated with multiple variables. Maybe there is a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps we can use the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex. The distance from I to A can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Let me recall that:\n\nThe distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = \u221a(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2),\n\nwhere r is the inradius, s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite angle A (BC).\n\nWait, let me check that formula. Yes, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2). Let me confirm:\n\nYes, in triangle, the formula for IA is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2). Similarly for IB and IC. So that's a useful formula here.\n\nGiven that, since IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OIA?\n\nWait, since IA is perpendicular to OI, then triangle OIA is right-angled at I. So, by Pythagoras:\n\nOI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2.\n\nWait, hold on, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then the triangle OIA has a right angle at I. So yes, OA is the hypotenuse, so OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nWe know OA is the circumradius, so OA =13. OI we found as sqrt(13). IA can be expressed via the formula above.\n\nTherefore:\n\n13\u00b2 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 + IA\u00b2,\n\n=> 169 =13 + IA\u00b2,\n\n=> IA\u00b2 =156,\n\n=> IA = sqrt(156)= 2*sqrt(39).\n\nAlternatively, using the formula IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2),\n\nSo IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2,\n\nSo 156 =6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2,\n\n=> (s - a)^2=156 -36=120,\n\n=> s - a = sqrt(120)= 2*sqrt(30). Hmm, but s -a is a length, so positive.\n\nWait, but s is the semiperimeter, so s = (a + b + c)/2. Therefore, s -a = (-a + b + c)/2.\n\nHmm, okay, so that gives us:\n\n( ( -a + b + c ) / 2 )\u00b2 = 120,\n\n=> ( -a + b + c )\u00b2 = 480,\n\nHmm, that's one equation.\n\nNow, perhaps we can find other equations.\n\nWe also know from the formula for the inradius:\n\nr = (Area)/s =6,\n\nand from the circumradius formula:\n\nR = (a b c)/(4 Area) =13,\n\nTherefore, combining these,\n\nFrom r = Area/s => Area =6s,\n\nSo substituting into the circumradius formula,\n\n13 = (a b c)/(4 *6 s),\n\n=> a b c = 312 s,\n\nSo that's another equation.\n\nAlso, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nTherefore, we have variables a,b,c and s with these equations:\n\n1. ( -a + b + c )\u00b2 = 480,\n\n2. a b c = 312 s,\n\n3. s = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nAdditionally, the triangle's sides must satisfy the triangle inequalities, but perhaps we can use more relations.\n\nPerhaps we can use the Law of Cosines on angle A? Since we know coordinates of A, O, I, but maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that in triangle OIA, which is right-angled at I, the coordinates we found earlier might give some relations. Wait, since we have coordinates for I and A, we can compute IA directly. Wait, IA was computed as sqrt( (13 -1)^2 + (0 - 2\u221a3)^2 ) = sqrt(144 + 12)= sqrt(156), which matches the previous result. So that's consistent.\n\nHmm. Let me see if I can find expressions for s and the sides in terms of variables. Let me denote variables:\n\nLet me let x = s - a = ( -a + b + c ) /2,\n\nthen from above, x\u00b2 =120,\n\nso x= sqrt(120)= 2*sqrt(30). Since x is positive.\n\nThus,\n\n( -a + b + c ) /2 = 2\u221a30,\n\n=> -a + b + c =4\u221a30,\n\nSimilarly, let me denote other terms:\n\nSimilarly, s - b = (a - b + c)/2,\n\nand s - c = (a + b - c)/2,\n\nBut perhaps we can express b + c in terms of a:\n\nFrom -a + b + c =4\u221a30,\n\nthen b + c =a +4\u221a30.\n\nAlso, since s = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nthen s = (a + (a +4\u221a30))/2 = (2a +4\u221a30)/2 =a +2\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, s =a + 2\u221a30.\n\nSo s is expressed in terms of a. That's useful.\n\nNow, let's see equation 2: a b c =312 s =312*(a +2\u221a30).\n\nHmm. Also, we need expressions for b and c in terms of a? Maybe using other relations.\n\nWe have from the sides:\n\nWe know that in any triangle, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c cos \u03b1,\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the angle at A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for the area. Since Area =6s,\n\nand also Area can be expressed as (1/2)ab sin C etc., but perhaps using the formula with sides and angles.\n\nAlternatively, using Heron's formula: Area = sqrt( s (s -a)(s -b)(s -c) ).\n\nGiven that Area =6s,\n\nso,\n\n6s = sqrt( s (s -a)(s -b)(s -c) )\n\nSquaring both sides,\n\n36 s\u00b2 = s (s -a)(s -b)(s -c)\n\nDivide both sides by s (assuming s \u22600),\n\n36 s = (s -a)(s -b)(s -c)\n\nWe already know that s -a =2\u221a30,\n\nand s -b and s -c are other terms. Let me denote s -b = y, s -c = z.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n36 s = (2\u221a30)(y)(z).\n\nAlso, since s -b = y => b = s - y,\n\nand s -c = z => c =s - z,\n\nand since a + b + c =2s,\n\nthen a + (s - y) + (s - z) =2s,\n\nso a +2s - y - z =2s,\n\n=> a = y + z.\n\nHmm, so a = y + z,\n\nand also, from the earlier equation:\n\nb + c = a +4\u221a30,\n\nbut b +c = (s - y) + (s - z) =2s - (y + z) =2s -a,\n\nso 2s -a =a +4\u221a30,\n\n=> 2s =2a +4\u221a30,\n\n=> s =a +2\u221a30,\n\nwhich matches our previous result. So that's consistent.\n\nHmm, so the variables y and z are related through the equation:\n\n36 s = (2\u221a30)(y z),\n\nand since s =a +2\u221a30, and a = y + z,\n\nthen,\n\n36(a +2\u221a30) =2\u221a30 * y z,\n\n=> 18(a +2\u221a30)=\u221a30 y z,\n\n=> y z =18(a +2\u221a30)/\u221a30,\n\nHmm, but this might not be helpful yet. Maybe we need another relation between y and z.\n\nAlternatively, since b = s - y,\n\nand c =s - z,\n\nand a = y + z,\n\nso the sides are:\n\na = y + z,\n\nb = s - y = (a +2\u221a30) - y,\n\nc = s - z = (a +2\u221a30) - z,\n\nHmm, perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express the product b c in terms of a, y, z?\n\nWait, since we need to find AB * AC, which is c * b. Since AB = c, AC = b.\n\nYes, so AB * AC =b c.\n\nHmm. Let me see:\n\nWe can write b c = (s - y)(s - z).\n\nBut s =a +2\u221a30,\n\nso,\n\nb c = (a +2\u221a30 - y)(a +2\u221a30 - z).\n\nHmm, but since a = y + z,\n\nso substituting a = y + z,\n\nthen,\n\nb c = ( (y + z) +2\u221a30 - y )( (y + z) +2\u221a30 - z )\n\n= ( z +2\u221a30 )( y +2\u221a30 )\n\n= y z +2\u221a30 y +2\u221a30 z + (2\u221a30)^2\n\n= y z +2\u221a30 (y + z) +4*30\n\n= y z +2\u221a30 a +120.\n\nHmm, so bc = y z +2\u221a30 a +120.\n\nBut from the previous equation,\n\ny z = 18(a +2\u221a30)/\u221a30,\n\nso substituting,\n\nbc = [18(a +2\u221a30)/\u221a30] +2\u221a30 a +120.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but let's try to compute this expression:\n\nFirst, let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 18(a +2\u221a30)/\u221a30,\n\nSecond term: 2\u221a30 a,\n\nThird term: 120.\n\nLet me combine the first and second terms:\n\n18(a +2\u221a30)/\u221a30 +2\u221a30 a = [18a/\u221a30 + (36\u221a30)/\u221a30] +2\u221a30 a\n\nSimplify:\n\n18a/\u221a30 + 36 +2\u221a30 a,\n\n= (18a)/\u221a30 + 2\u221a30 a +36,\n\nLet me factor a:\n\na [18/\u221a30 + 2\u221a30] +36,\n\nCompute the terms inside the bracket:\n\n18/\u221a30 + 2\u221a30 = (18 + 2*30)/\u221a30 = (18 +60)/\u221a30 =78/\u221a30,\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, that step is incorrect. Let me redo:\n\nWait, 18/\u221a30 + 2\u221a30,\n\nTo combine them, we need a common denominator.\n\nLet me write 2\u221a30 as (2\u221a30)*(\u221a30/\u221a30)= 2*30/\u221a30=60/\u221a30.\n\nWait, no, that's not the way. Alternatively, express both terms with denominator \u221a30:\n\n18/\u221a30 + 2\u221a30 = (18 + 2\u221a30 * \u221a30)/\u221a30,\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let me compute each term numerically:\n\n18/\u221a30 = (18\u221a30)/30 = (3\u221a30)/5,\n\n2\u221a30 is just 2\u221a30,\n\nSo total:\n\n(3\u221a30)/5 + 2\u221a30 = (3\u221a30 +10\u221a30)/5 =13\u221a30/5,\n\nTherefore,\n\nthe first two terms give a*(13\u221a30/5) +36,\n\nTherefore, bc = (13\u221a30 a)/5 +36 +120,\n\nWait, no, wait, bc = first two terms plus 120:\n\nWait, the expression was bc = [18(a +2\u221a30)/\u221a30] +2\u221a30 a +120,\n\nso after combining first two terms, it's (13\u221a30 a)/5 +36 +120,\n\nWait, no, let me track again:\n\nWait, the first term after combining was [18/\u221a30 +2\u221a30] a + 36,\n\nWait, no, actually, let me recast:\n\nWait, when I had:\n\nFirst term + second term = (13\u221a30 a)/5 +36,\n\nthen adding the third term (120):\n\nTotal bc = (13\u221a30 a)/5 +36 +120 = (13\u221a30 a)/5 +156.\n\nHmm, okay, so bc = (13\u221a30 a)/5 +156.\n\nHmm, but we also have from equation 2: a b c =312 s,\n\nsince s =a +2\u221a30,\n\nthen a b c =312(a +2\u221a30).\n\nBut bc is expressed in terms of a, so substituting bc into this equation:\n\na * [ (13\u221a30 a)/5 +156 ] =312(a +2\u221a30).\n\nLet me write that out:\n\na*(13\u221a30 a /5 +156) = 312(a +2\u221a30).\n\nMultiply through:\n\n(13\u221a30 /5 )a\u00b2 +156 a =312a +624\u221a30.\n\nBring all terms to left-hand side:\n\n(13\u221a30 /5 )a\u00b2 +156a -312a -624\u221a30=0,\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n(13\u221a30 /5 )a\u00b2 -156a -624\u221a30=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 to eliminate denominator:\n\n13\u221a30 a\u00b2 -780a -3120\u221a30=0.\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic equation in terms of a, but with coefficients involving \u221a30. Let me see if I can factor out \u221a30 or something.\n\nLet me write:\n\n13\u221a30 a\u00b2 -780a -3120\u221a30 =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor out 13?\n\nWait, 13*(\u221a30 a\u00b2) -780a -13*240\u221a30=0,\n\nHmm, 780 is 13*60, and 3120 is 13*240,\n\nYes:\n\n13*(\u221a30 a\u00b2 -60a -240\u221a30)=0,\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n13\u221a30 a\u00b2 - 13*60 a -13*240\u221a30 =0,\n\nYes, so factoring 13:\n\n13[ \u221a30 a\u00b2 -60a -240\u221a30 ]=0,\n\nThus,\n\n\u221a30 a\u00b2 -60a -240\u221a30 =0,\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n\u221a30 a\u00b2 -60 a -240\u221a30 =0,\n\nLet me divide both sides by \u221a30 to simplify:\n\na\u00b2 - (60/\u221a30) a -240 =0,\n\nSimplify 60/\u221a30:\n\n60/\u221a30 = (60\u221a30)/30 =2\u221a30,\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2 -2\u221a30 a -240 =0,\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in a:\n\na\u00b2 -2\u221a30 a -240 =0,\n\nLet me solve this quadratic for a.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\na = [2\u221a30 \u00b1 sqrt( (2\u221a30)^2 +4*1*240 )]/2,\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n(2\u221a30)^2 + 960 =4*30 +960=120+960=1080,\n\nsqrt(1080)=sqrt(36*30)=6*sqrt(30),\n\nThus,\n\na = [2\u221a30 \u00b16\u221a30]/2,\n\nSo,\n\nFirst solution:\n\n[2\u221a30 +6\u221a30]/2 =8\u221a30/2=4\u221a30,\n\nSecond solution:\n\n[2\u221a30 -6\u221a30]/2= (-4\u221a30)/2= -2\u221a30,\n\nSince a is a length, it must be positive. So a=4\u221a30.\n\nOkay, so a=4\u221a30.\n\nNow, since a=4\u221a30,\n\nthen s =a +2\u221a30=4\u221a30 +2\u221a30=6\u221a30,\n\nSo semiperimeter s=6\u221a30,\n\nNow, we can compute bc from the earlier expression:\n\nbc = (13\u221a30 a)/5 +156,\n\nPlugging a=4\u221a30,\n\nbc = (13\u221a30 *4\u221a30)/5 +156,\n\nCompute \u221a30 *\u221a30=30,\n\nThus,\n\nbc = (13*4*30)/5 +156,\n\n13*4=52,\n\n52*30=1560,\n\n1560/5=312,\n\nSo,\n\nbc =312 +156=468.\n\nTherefore, AB * AC =c*b= bc=468.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check the steps again to be sure.\n\nSo, we found a=4\u221a30,\n\ns=6\u221a30,\n\nthen bc was calculated as (13\u221a30 *a)/5 +156,\n\nWith a=4\u221a30,\n\nso 13\u221a30*(4\u221a30)=13*4*(\u221a30)^2=13*4*30=13*120=1560,\n\nthen 1560/5=312,\n\nplus 156 gives 468. Yes.\n\nAlternatively, let me check using the other equation a b c =312 s,\n\nsince a b c =312 s,\n\nthen bc = (312 s)/a,\n\nsince s=6\u221a30, a=4\u221a30,\n\nso,\n\n312*6\u221a30 /4\u221a30 = (312*6)/4 = (312/4)*6=78*6=468. Perfect, same result.\n\nTherefore, the product AB\u00b7AC is 468.\n\nHmm, so that should be the answer.\n\nBut let me just verify with the coordinates approach to ensure there's no mistake.\n\nEarlier, we had coordinates for I as (1, 2\u221a3). Let me see if with a=4\u221a30, the coordinates of B and C can be found, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, since all equations led us to bc=468, which is consistent with the two different methods (direct substitution and the a b c equation), I think that's solid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 468. I'll put that in a box.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{468}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The problem says that IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of the circumcenter and incenter. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle's sides, and it's equidistant from all three vertices, which is given here as 13 (the circumradius R = 13). The incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet, and it's equidistant from all sides of the triangle, with that distance being the inradius r = 6.\n\nThe key condition here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. Maybe I can use some coordinate geometry or vector methods? Or perhaps there's a theorem that relates these elements?\n\nLet me try to recall if there's a formula connecting the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. There is a formula: the distance squared between O and I is given byOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Wait, but is that always true? Let me check. Hmm, actually, I think that formula might be specific to certain triangles. Maybe I need to verify that.\n\nAlternatively, there's another formula: OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Yes, that sounds familiar. Let me confirm. Yes, in any triangle, the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So substituting the given values, OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). But how does that help with the given condition that IA is perpendicular to OI?\n\nHmm. The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line IA is perpendicular to the line OI. Let me think of this in terms of vectors or coordinates. Maybe setting up coordinate axes here would help.\n\nLet me try to set up coordinates. Let me place point A at the origin to simplify calculations, since we're dealing with IA and OI. Wait, but maybe it's better to place O at the origin? Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps place point A at (0,0), and set up coordinates so that IA is along a certain axis?\n\nAlternatively, since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe we can use some coordinate system where OI is along the x-axis and IA is along the y-axis? Let me try that.\n\nLet me suppose that point I is at (h, k), and point O is at (p, q). But maybe this is getting too vague. Let me think of a coordinate system where O is at the origin. Let me try that.\n\nWait, perhaps using vector approaches would be better. Let me denote vectors OA, OB, OC, and I. Since O is the circumcenter, OA, OB, OC all have length R = 13. The incenter I can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides. The coordinates of the incenter can be given by ( (aA + bB + cC)/(a + b + c) ), where a, b, c are the lengths of the sides opposite to A, B, C respectively. Hmm, but maybe that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities. Let me recall that in a triangle, the inradius r = (Area)/s, where s is the semiperimeter. The circumradius R = (a b c)/(4 Area). So maybe combining these with the given condition?\n\nWait, but the key is the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. Let me think of the vectors. Let me denote vector OI and vector IA. Since they are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.\n\nLet me denote vectors. Let me suppose that O is at the origin for simplicity, so the position vectors of A, B, C are vectors OA, OB, OC, each with magnitude R =13. Then the incenter I has position vector ( (aA + bB + cC ) / (a + b + c) ), where a, b, c are the lengths of the sides opposite to A, B, C respectively. Hmm, maybe this is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, since OA is a vector from O to A, and IA is a vector from I to A, which is A - I. The vector OI is I - O, but since O is the origin, it's just I. Wait, if O is at the origin, then vector OI is just the vector from O to I, which is I. Then the condition is that IA (which is A - I) is perpendicular to OI (which is I). So their dot product is zero:\n\n(A - I) \u00b7 I = 0\n\nExpanding that, A \u00b7 I - |I|\u00b2 = 0 => A \u00b7 I = |I|\u00b2.\n\nHmm, that might be a useful equation. Let me write that down.\n\nLet me note that if O is at the origin, then OA is the vector A with |A| = R =13. The inradius is 6, so the inradius formula is r = (Area)/s =6, where s is semiperimeter. The inradius is also related to coordinates?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use coordinates with O at the origin, and set up coordinates such that point A is along the x-axis. Let me try that.\n\nLet me place the circumcenter O at (0,0), and let me place point A at (R,0) = (13, 0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, which is the vector from O to I. So the vector IA is (A - I), and the vector OI is (I - O) = I. The dot product of IA and OI is (A - I) \u00b7 I =0.\n\nSo, (A - I) \u00b7 I =0 => A\u00b7I - |I|\u00b2 =0 => A\u00b7I = |I|\u00b2.\n\nLet me denote coordinates for I as (x,y). Since O is at (0,0), and A is at (13,0). Then vector A is (13,0), and vector I is (x,y). Then the equation becomes:\n\n(13,0) \u00b7 (x,y) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =0\n\nWhich is 13x - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =0.\n\nSo, 13x = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2. Let's note that equation (1).\n\nAlso, we know that the distance OI is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(13) from earlier? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the formula OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, plugging R =13, r=6, then OI\u00b2=13\u00b2 - 2*13*6= 169 - 156=13. So OI = sqrt(13). Therefore, sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=sqrt(13), so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=13. Wait, but from equation (1), 13x =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=13. Therefore, 13x=13 =>x=1. So x=1. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the incenter is 1, and y\u00b2=13 -x\u00b2=13-1=12, so y=\u00b12*sqrt(3). Hmm, so the incenter is at (1, 2\u221a3) or (1, -2\u221a3). Since triangles are typically considered in upper half-plane, maybe we can take y positive, so (1, 2\u221a3).\n\nSo coordinates of I are (1, 2\u221a3).\n\nNow, with O at (0,0), A at (13,0), and I at (1, 2\u221a3). Now, need to find coordinates of B and C such that I is the incenter, and then compute AB\u00b7AC.\n\nHmm, this might be a bit involved, but let's see.\n\nFirst, let me recall that in a triangle, the incenter coordinates can be given by ( (aA + bB + cC)/(a + b + c) ), where a, b, c are lengths of sides opposite to A, B, C. Wait, but in coordinate terms, if the coordinates of A, B, C are known, then the incenter can be found as a weighted average. But here, we have coordinates of A, O, I, but not B and C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for coordinates of the incenter in terms of the triangle's sides. Let me denote the sides opposite to A, B, C as a, b, c respectively. Wait, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So side a is opposite A, etc. Wait, actually, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So the incenter coordinates would be ( (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x )/(a + b + c), similar for y-coordinates). Since we placed A at (13,0), O at (0,0), and I at (1, 2\u221a3). Let me denote coordinates for B as (x_B, y_B) and C as (x_C, y_C). Then:\n\nThe incenter I has coordinates:\n\nI_x = (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x)/(a + b + c) =1,\n\nI_y = (a*A_y + b*B_y + c*C_y)/(a + b + c) =2\u221a3.\n\nBut since A is (13,0), so A_x=13, A_y=0. So:\n\nI_x = (a*13 + b x_B + c x_C)/(a + b + c) =1,\n\nI_y = (0 + b y_B + c y_C)/(a + b + c)=2\u221a3.\n\nHmm, this might get complicated with too many variables. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, since we know coordinates of O and I, perhaps we can use other properties. Let me recall that in any triangle, the inradius r = 6, so Area = r*s, where s is semiperimeter. Also, the circumradius R =13, so Area = (a b c)/(4 R). Therefore, equating these two expressions:\n\nr s = (a b c)/(4 R)\n\n=> 6 s = (a b c)/(4 *13)\n\n=> a b c = 6 s * 52 = 312 s\n\nHmm, but not sure how that helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using trigonometric identities. Let me denote angles at A, B, C as \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 respectively. Then, the inradius r = 4 R sin(\u03b1/2) sin(\u03b2/2) sin(\u03b3/2). Since r=6 and R=13,\n\n6 = 4*13 sin(\u03b1/2) sin(\u03b2/2) sin(\u03b3/2)\n\n=> sin(\u03b1/2) sin(\u03b2/2) sin(\u03b3/2)= 6/(52)= 3/26.\n\nHmm, but again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula involving the distance between incenter and circumcenter. We know OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r) =13*(13 -12)=13*1=13, which matches our previous calculation. Since OI is sqrt(13). The given condition is that IA is perpendicular to OI. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, so the line IA is tangent to the circle with diameter OI? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates is better. Let me try to proceed with coordinates.\n\nWe have O at (0,0), A at (13,0), I at (1, 2\u221a3). Let me consider coordinates of B and C. Since O is the circumcenter, points B and C lie on the circle of radius 13 centered at O. So their coordinates satisfy x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =13\u00b2.\n\nWe also know that I is the incenter. Let me recall that the incenter can be expressed as a weighted average. Let me denote sides:\n\nLet me denote the lengths:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the sides as follows:\n\na = BC, b = AC, c = AB.\n\nThen, the coordinates of the incenter I are:\n\nI_x = (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x)/(a + b + c),\n\nI_y = (a*A_y + b*B_y + c*C_y)/(a + b + c).\n\nSince A is (13,0), so A_x=13, A_y=0.\n\nSo,\n\nI_x = (a*13 + b B_x + c C_x)/(a + b + c) =1,\n\nI_y = (0 + b B_y + c C_y)/(a + b + c)=2\u221a3.\n\nHmm, but this is still complicated. Maybe we can use vector approaches. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the distance from I to O squared, which we know is 13, so OI\u00b2 =13. But we also have coordinates for I as (1, 2\u221a3), so indeed OI\u00b2 is 1\u00b2 + (2\u221a3)^2 =1 + 12=13, so that checks out.\n\nNow, perhaps we can use the fact that IA is perpendicular to OI. Since IA is the vector from I to A, which is (13 -1, 0 - 2\u221a3) = (12, -2\u221a3). The vector OI is from O to I, which is (1, 2\u221a3). The dot product should be zero:\n\n(12)(1) + (-2\u221a3)(2\u221a3) =12 - 2*2*3 =12 -12=0. Oh, that's a good check. So the coordinates are consistent with the given perpendicularity condition.\n\nSo the coordinates of I are correctly placed.\n\nNow, let me see if I can find coordinates for B and C such that I is the incenter. Let me consider that points B and C lie on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=169. Let me denote coordinates for B as (x_B, y_B) and C as (x_C, y_C). Then, since I is the incenter, the angle bisector of angle A should pass through I. Since point A is (13,0), and the incenter is (1,2\u221a3), the line from A to I is the angle bisector of angle A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the coordinates of the incenter in terms of the sides. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the lengths of the sides:\n\nLet me denote AB = c, AC = b, BC = a.\n\nWe need to find AB * AC = c * b. So if I can find b and c, then their product is the answer.\n\nWe know that the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nThe inradius r =6 = Area / s => Area =6s.\n\nThe circumradius R =13 = (a b c)/(4 Area). So substituting Area=6s,\n\n13 = (a b c)/(4 *6 s) = (a b c)/(24 s).\n\nThus, a b c = 24 s *13 = 312 s.\n\nHmm. So a b c =312 s. Not sure yet, but perhaps combining with other equations.\n\nAlso, from the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin \u03b1 = 26 sin \u03b1,\n\nSimilarly, b =26 sin \u03b2,\n\nc =26 sin \u03b3,\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are angles at A,B,C respectively.\n\nSince angles sum to \u03c0, \u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u03b3 = \u03c0.\n\nAlso, the inradius formula in terms of angles: r = 4 R sin(\u03b1/2) sin(\u03b2/2) sin(\u03b3/2) =6,\n\nSo 4*13 sin(\u03b1/2) sin(\u03b2/2) sin(\u03b3/2)=6,\n\nThus, sin(\u03b1/2) sin(\u03b2/2) sin(\u03b3/2)= 6/(52)= 3/26 \u2248 0.115.\n\nHmm, but not sure how helpful that is yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates to find relations between the sides. Let me think.\n\nWe can write the coordinates of B and C on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =169. The incenter coordinates must satisfy the weighted average condition. Let me see if I can set up equations for that.\n\nLet me denote coordinates for B as (x_B, y_B) and C as (x_C, y_C). Since they are on the circumcircle, x_B\u00b2 + y_B\u00b2 =169 and x_C\u00b2 + y_C\u00b2=169.\n\nThe incenter coordinates are given by:\n\nI_x = (a*13 + b x_B + c x_C)/(a + b + c) =1,\n\nI_y = (0 + b y_B + c y_C)/(a + b + c)=2\u221a3.\n\nLet me denote s = (a + b + c)/2, the semiperimeter. Then a + b + c = 2s.\n\nSo the equations become:\n\n13a + b x_B + c x_C = (a + b + c)*1 = 2s,\n\nand\n\nb y_B + c y_C = (a + b + c)*2\u221a3 = 2s *2\u221a3 =4 s \u221a3.\n\nHmm, but this is still complicated with multiple variables. Maybe there is a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps we can use the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex. The distance from I to A can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Let me recall that:\n\nThe distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = \u221a(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2),\n\nwhere r is the inradius, s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite angle A (BC).\n\nWait, let me check that formula. Yes, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2). Let me confirm:\n\nYes, in triangle, the formula for IA is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2). Similarly for IB and IC. So that's a useful formula here.\n\nGiven that, since IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OIA?\n\nWait, since IA is perpendicular to OI, then triangle OIA is right-angled at I. So, by Pythagoras:\n\nOI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2.\n\nWait, hold on, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then the triangle OIA has a right angle at I. So yes, OA is the hypotenuse, so OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nWe know OA is the circumradius, so OA =13. OI we found as sqrt(13). IA can be expressed via the formula above.\n\nTherefore:\n\n13\u00b2 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 + IA\u00b2,\n\n=> 169 =13 + IA\u00b2,\n\n=> IA\u00b2 =156,\n\n=> IA = sqrt(156)= 2*sqrt(39).\n\nAlternatively, using the formula IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2),\n\nSo IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2,\n\nSo 156 =6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2,\n\n=> (s - a)^2=156 -36=120,\n\n=> s - a = sqrt(120)= 2*sqrt(30). Hmm, but s -a is a length, so positive.\n\nWait, but s is the semiperimeter, so s = (a + b + c)/2. Therefore, s -a = (-a + b + c)/2.\n\nHmm, okay, so that gives us:\n\n( ( -a + b + c ) / 2 )\u00b2 = 120,\n\n=> ( -a + b + c )\u00b2 = 480,\n\nHmm, that's one equation.\n\nNow, perhaps we can find other equations.\n\nWe also know from the formula for the inradius:\n\nr = (Area)/s =6,\n\nand from the circumradius formula:\n\nR = (a b c)/(4 Area) =13,\n\nTherefore, combining these,\n\nFrom r = Area/s => Area =6s,\n\nSo substituting into the circumradius formula,\n\n13 = (a b c)/(4 *6 s),\n\n=> a b c = 312 s,\n\nSo that's another equation.\n\nAlso, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nTherefore, we have variables a,b,c and s with these equations:\n\n1. ( -a + b + c )\u00b2 = 480,\n\n2. a b c = 312 s,\n\n3. s = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nAdditionally, the triangle's sides must satisfy the triangle inequalities, but perhaps we can use more relations.\n\nPerhaps we can use the Law of Cosines on angle A? Since we know coordinates of A, O, I, but maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that in triangle OIA, which is right-angled at I, the coordinates we found earlier might give some relations. Wait, since we have coordinates for I and A, we can compute IA directly. Wait, IA was computed as sqrt( (13 -1)^2 + (0 - 2\u221a3)^2 ) = sqrt(144 + 12)= sqrt(156), which matches the previous result. So that's consistent.\n\nHmm. Let me see if I can find expressions for s and the sides in terms of variables. Let me denote variables:\n\nLet me let x = s - a = ( -a + b + c ) /2,\n\nthen from above, x\u00b2 =120,\n\nso x= sqrt(120)= 2*sqrt(30). Since x is positive.\n\nThus,\n\n( -a + b + c ) /2 = 2\u221a30,\n\n=> -a + b + c =4\u221a30,\n\nSimilarly, let me denote other terms:\n\nSimilarly, s - b = (a - b + c)/2,\n\nand s - c = (a + b - c)/2,\n\nBut perhaps we can express b + c in terms of a:\n\nFrom -a + b + c =4\u221a30,\n\nthen b + c =a +4\u221a30.\n\nAlso, since s = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nthen s = (a + (a +4\u221a30))/2 = (2a +4\u221a30)/2 =a +2\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, s =a + 2\u221a30.\n\nSo s is expressed in terms of a. That's useful.\n\nNow, let's see equation 2: a b c =312 s =312*(a +2\u221a30).\n\nHmm. Also, we need expressions for b and c in terms of a? Maybe using other relations.\n\nWe have from the sides:\n\nWe know that in any triangle, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c cos \u03b1,\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the angle at A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for the area. Since Area =6s,\n\nand also Area can be expressed as (1/2)ab sin C etc., but perhaps using the formula with sides and angles.\n\nAlternatively, using Heron's formula: Area = sqrt( s (s -a)(s -b)(s -c) ).\n\nGiven that Area =6s,\n\nso,\n\n6s = sqrt( s (s -a)(s -b)(s -c) )\n\nSquaring both sides,\n\n36 s\u00b2 = s (s -a)(s -b)(s -c)\n\nDivide both sides by s (assuming s \u22600),\n\n36 s = (s -a)(s -b)(s -c)\n\nWe already know that s -a =2\u221a30,\n\nand s -b and s -c are other terms. Let me denote s -b = y, s -c = z.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n36 s = (2\u221a30)(y)(z).\n\nAlso, since s -b = y => b = s - y,\n\nand s -c = z => c =s - z,\n\nand since a + b + c =2s,\n\nthen a + (s - y) + (s - z) =2s,\n\nso a +2s - y - z =2s,\n\n=> a = y + z.\n\nHmm, so a = y + z,\n\nand also, from the earlier equation:\n\nb + c = a +4\u221a30,\n\nbut b +c = (s - y) + (s - z) =2s - (y + z) =2s -a,\n\nso 2s -a =a +4\u221a30,\n\n=> 2s =2a +4\u221a30,\n\n=> s =a +2\u221a30,\n\nwhich matches our previous result. So that's consistent.\n\nHmm, so the variables y and z are related through the equation:\n\n36 s = (2\u221a30)(y z),\n\nand since s =a +2\u221a30, and a = y + z,\n\nthen,\n\n36(a +2\u221a30) =2\u221a30 * y z,\n\n=> 18(a +2\u221a30)=\u221a30 y z,\n\n=> y z =18(a +2\u221a30)/\u221a30,\n\nHmm, but this might not be helpful yet. Maybe we need another relation between y and z.\n\nAlternatively, since b = s - y,\n\nand c =s - z,\n\nand a = y + z,\n\nso the sides are:\n\na = y + z,\n\nb = s - y = (a +2\u221a30) - y,\n\nc = s - z = (a +2\u221a30) - z,\n\nHmm, perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express the product b c in terms of a, y, z?\n\nWait, since we need to find AB * AC, which is c * b. Since AB = c, AC = b.\n\nYes, so AB * AC =b c.\n\nHmm. Let me see:\n\nWe can write b c = (s - y)(s - z).\n\nBut s =a +2\u221a30,\n\nso,\n\nb c = (a +2\u221a30 - y)(a +2\u221a30 - z).\n\nHmm, but since a = y + z,\n\nso substituting a = y + z,\n\nthen,\n\nb c = ( (y + z) +2\u221a30 - y )( (y + z) +2\u221a30 - z )\n\n= ( z +2\u221a30 )( y +2\u221a30 )\n\n= y z +2\u221a30 y +2\u221a30 z + (2\u221a30)^2\n\n= y z +2\u221a30 (y + z) +4*30\n\n= y z +2\u221a30 a +120.\n\nHmm, so bc = y z +2\u221a30 a +120.\n\nBut from the previous equation,\n\ny z = 18(a +2\u221a30)/\u221a30,\n\nso substituting,\n\nbc = [18(a +2\u221a30)/\u221a30] +2\u221a30 a +120.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but let's try to compute this expression:\n\nFirst, let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 18(a +2\u221a30)/\u221a30,\n\nSecond term: 2\u221a30 a,\n\nThird term: 120.\n\nLet me combine the first and second terms:\n\n18(a +2\u221a30)/\u221a30 +2\u221a30 a = [18a/\u221a30 + (36\u221a30)/\u221a30] +2\u221a30 a\n\nSimplify:\n\n18a/\u221a30 + 36 +2\u221a30 a,\n\n= (18a)/\u221a30 + 2\u221a30 a +36,\n\nLet me factor a:\n\na [18/\u221a30 + 2\u221a30] +36,\n\nCompute the terms inside the bracket:\n\n18/\u221a30 + 2\u221a30 = (18 + 2*30)/\u221a30 = (18 +60)/\u221a30 =78/\u221a30,\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, that step is incorrect. Let me redo:\n\nWait, 18/\u221a30 + 2\u221a30,\n\nTo combine them, we need a common denominator.\n\nLet me write 2\u221a30 as (2\u221a30)*(\u221a30/\u221a30)= 2*30/\u221a30=60/\u221a30.\n\nWait, no, that's not the way. Alternatively, express both terms with denominator \u221a30:\n\n18/\u221a30 + 2\u221a30 = (18 + 2\u221a30 * \u221a30)/\u221a30,\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let me compute each term numerically:\n\n18/\u221a30 = (18\u221a30)/30 = (3\u221a30)/5,\n\n2\u221a30 is just 2\u221a30,\n\nSo total:\n\n(3\u221a30)/5 + 2\u221a30 = (3\u221a30 +10\u221a30)/5 =13\u221a30/5,\n\nTherefore,\n\nthe first two terms give a*(13\u221a30/5) +36,\n\nTherefore, bc = (13\u221a30 a)/5 +36 +120,\n\nWait, no, wait, bc = first two terms plus 120:\n\nWait, the expression was bc = [18(a +2\u221a30)/\u221a30] +2\u221a30 a +120,\n\nso after combining first two terms, it's (13\u221a30 a)/5 +36 +120,\n\nWait, no, let me track again:\n\nWait, the first term after combining was [18/\u221a30 +2\u221a30] a + 36,\n\nWait, no, actually, let me recast:\n\nWait, when I had:\n\nFirst term + second term = (13\u221a30 a)/5 +36,\n\nthen adding the third term (120):\n\nTotal bc = (13\u221a30 a)/5 +36 +120 = (13\u221a30 a)/5 +156.\n\nHmm, okay, so bc = (13\u221a30 a)/5 +156.\n\nHmm, but we also have from equation 2: a b c =312 s,\n\nsince s =a +2\u221a30,\n\nthen a b c =312(a +2\u221a30).\n\nBut bc is expressed in terms of a, so substituting bc into this equation:\n\na * [ (13\u221a30 a)/5 +156 ] =312(a +2\u221a30).\n\nLet me write that out:\n\na*(13\u221a30 a /5 +156) = 312(a +2\u221a30).\n\nMultiply through:\n\n(13\u221a30 /5 )a\u00b2 +156 a =312a +624\u221a30.\n\nBring all terms to left-hand side:\n\n(13\u221a30 /5 )a\u00b2 +156a -312a -624\u221a30=0,\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n(13\u221a30 /5 )a\u00b2 -156a -624\u221a30=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 to eliminate denominator:\n\n13\u221a30 a\u00b2 -780a -3120\u221a30=0.\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic equation in terms of a, but with coefficients involving \u221a30. Let me see if I can factor out \u221a30 or something.\n\nLet me write:\n\n13\u221a30 a\u00b2 -780a -3120\u221a30 =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor out 13?\n\nWait, 13*(\u221a30 a\u00b2) -780a -13*240\u221a30=0,\n\nHmm, 780 is 13*60, and 3120 is 13*240,\n\nYes:\n\n13*(\u221a30 a\u00b2 -60a -240\u221a30)=0,\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n13\u221a30 a\u00b2 - 13*60 a -13*240\u221a30 =0,\n\nYes, so factoring 13:\n\n13[ \u221a30 a\u00b2 -60a -240\u221a30 ]=0,\n\nThus,\n\n\u221a30 a\u00b2 -60a -240\u221a30 =0,\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n\u221a30 a\u00b2 -60 a -240\u221a30 =0,\n\nLet me divide both sides by \u221a30 to simplify:\n\na\u00b2 - (60/\u221a30) a -240 =0,\n\nSimplify 60/\u221a30:\n\n60/\u221a30 = (60\u221a30)/30 =2\u221a30,\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2 -2\u221a30 a -240 =0,\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in a:\n\na\u00b2 -2\u221a30 a -240 =0,\n\nLet me solve this quadratic for a.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\na = [2\u221a30 \u00b1 sqrt( (2\u221a30)^2 +4*1*240 )]/2,\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n(2\u221a30)^2 + 960 =4*30 +960=120+960=1080,\n\nsqrt(1080)=sqrt(36*30)=6*sqrt(30),\n\nThus,\n\na = [2\u221a30 \u00b16\u221a30]/2,\n\nSo,\n\nFirst solution:\n\n[2\u221a30 +6\u221a30]/2 =8\u221a30/2=4\u221a30,\n\nSecond solution:\n\n[2\u221a30 -6\u221a30]/2= (-4\u221a30)/2= -2\u221a30,\n\nSince a is a length, it must be positive. So a=4\u221a30.\n\nOkay, so a=4\u221a30.\n\nNow, since a=4\u221a30,\n\nthen s =a +2\u221a30=4\u221a30 +2\u221a30=6\u221a30,\n\nSo semiperimeter s=6\u221a30,\n\nNow, we can compute bc from the earlier expression:\n\nbc = (13\u221a30 a)/5 +156,\n\nPlugging a=4\u221a30,\n\nbc = (13\u221a30 *4\u221a30)/5 +156,\n\nCompute \u221a30 *\u221a30=30,\n\nThus,\n\nbc = (13*4*30)/5 +156,\n\n13*4=52,\n\n52*30=1560,\n\n1560/5=312,\n\nSo,\n\nbc =312 +156=468.\n\nTherefore, AB * AC =c*b= bc=468.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check the steps again to be sure.\n\nSo, we found a=4\u221a30,\n\ns=6\u221a30,\n\nthen bc was calculated as (13\u221a30 *a)/5 +156,\n\nWith a=4\u221a30,\n\nso 13\u221a30*(4\u221a30)=13*4*(\u221a30)^2=13*4*30=13*120=1560,\n\nthen 1560/5=312,\n\nplus 156 gives 468. Yes.\n\nAlternatively, let me check using the other equation a b c =312 s,\n\nsince a b c =312 s,\n\nthen bc = (312 s)/a,\n\nsince s=6\u221a30, a=4\u221a30,\n\nso,\n\n312*6\u221a30 /4\u221a30 = (312*6)/4 = (312/4)*6=78*6=468. Perfect, same result.\n\nTherefore, the product AB\u00b7AC is 468.\n\nHmm, so that should be the answer.\n\nBut let me just verify with the coordinates approach to ensure there's no mistake.\n\nEarlier, we had coordinates for I as (1, 2\u221a3). Let me see if with a=4\u221a30, the coordinates of B and C can be found, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, since all equations led us to bc=468, which is consistent with the two different methods (direct substitution and the a b c equation), I think that's solid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 468. I'll put that in a box.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{468}\n\n\nGiven triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with circumcenter \\( O \\) and incenter \\( I \\), where \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), circumradius \\( R = 13 \\), and inradius \\( r = 6 \\). We need to find \\( AB \\cdot AC \\).\n\n1. **Distance between \\( O \\) and \\( I \\)**:\n   \\[\n   OI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13(13 - 12) = 13 \\implies OI = \\sqrt{13}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Using the condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\)**:\n   - \\( IA \\) is perpendicular to \\( OI \\), forming a right triangle \\( \\triangle OIA \\).\n   - By Pythagoras:\n     \\[\n     OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \\implies 13^2 = (\\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \\implies IA^2 = 169 - 13 = 156 \\implies IA = \\sqrt{156}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Using the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex**:\n   \\[\n   IA^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2 \\implies 156 = 6^2 + (s - a)^2 \\implies (s - a)^2 = 120 \\implies s - a = 2\\sqrt{30}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Semiperimeter \\( s \\)**:\n   - Let \\( s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2} \\). Then:\n     \\[\n     s - a = \\frac{-a + b + c}{2} = 2\\sqrt{30} \\implies -a + b + c = 4\\sqrt{30}\n     \\]\n   - Expressing \\( s \\) in terms of \\( a \\):\n     \\[\n     s = a + 2\\sqrt{30}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Using the relationship between sides and semiperimeter**:\n   - From the product of sides and semiperimeter:\n     \\[\n     abc = 312s\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( a \\):\n     \\[\n     a^2 - 2\\sqrt{30}a - 240 = 0 \\implies a = 4\\sqrt{30}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( a = 4\\sqrt{30} \\) into \\( s \\):\n     \\[\n     s = 6\\sqrt{30}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculating \\( AB \\cdot AC \\)**:\n   - Using \\( abc = 312s \\):\n     \\[\n     bc = \\frac{312s}{a} = \\frac{312 \\cdot 6\\sqrt{30}}{4\\sqrt{30}} = 468\n     \\]\n\nThus, the product \\( AB \\cdot AC \\) is \\(\\boxed{468}\\).",
