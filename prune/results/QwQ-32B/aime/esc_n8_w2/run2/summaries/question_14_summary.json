      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once I find N, I have to compute Q + R where N divided by 1000 gives quotient Q and remainder R. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since N is a four-digit number, it can be written as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A \u2260 0. The problem states that changing any one digit to 1 should make the number divisible by 7. So, changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.\n\nOur goal is to find the largest possible N (so we want the largest four-digit number possible) that satisfies this condition. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nMaybe I can express each of these modified numbers in terms of N and then set up equations based on their divisibility by 7. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. Then:\n\n1. Changing the first digit (A) to 1: The number becomes 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Let's call this number N1. So N1 = N - (A - 1)*1000. Since N1 must be divisible by 7, that means (N - (A - 1)*1000) \u2261 0 mod 7. So N \u2261 (A - 1)*1000 mod 7.\n\n2. Changing the second digit (B) to 1: The number becomes 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. Let's call this N2. So N2 = N - (B - 1)*100. Similarly, N2 \u2261 0 mod7 \u21d2 N \u2261 (B - 1)*100 mod7.\n\n3. Changing the third digit (C) to 1: The number becomes 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. Let's call this N3. So N3 = N - (C - 1)*10. Hence, N \u2261 (C - 1)*10 mod7.\n\n4. Changing the fourth digit (D) to 1: The number becomes 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. Let's call this N4. So N4 = N - (D - 1). Therefore, N \u2261 (D - 1) mod7.\n\nSo, summarizing the four congruences:\n\n1. N \u2261 (A - 1)*1000 mod7\n\n2. N \u2261 (B - 1)*100 mod7\n\n3. N \u2261 (C - 1)*10 mod7\n\n4. N \u2261 (D - 1) mod7\n\nHmm, so all four of these must hold simultaneously. Since N is the same number, these four congruences must all be compatible. That means that (A - 1)*1000 \u2261 (B - 1)*100 \u2261 (C - 1)*10 \u2261 (D - 1) mod7.\n\nTherefore, each of these expressions must be congruent modulo 7. Let me write down each term mod7.\n\nFirst, let's compute the coefficients modulo 7:\n\n- 1000 mod7: Let's see, 7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6 \u21d2 1000 \u22616 mod7.\n\n- 100 mod7: 7*14=98 \u21d2 100 -98=2 \u21d2 100\u22612 mod7.\n\n- 10 mod7: 10-7=3 \u21d2 10\u22613 mod7.\n\n- 1 mod7 is 1.\n\nTherefore, substituting these into the congruences:\n\n1. N \u2261 6*(A -1) mod7\n\n2. N \u2261 2*(B -1) mod7\n\n3. N \u2261 3*(C -1) mod7\n\n4. N \u2261 (D -1) mod7\n\nTherefore, all four expressions must be equal mod7:\n\n6(A -1) \u2261 2(B -1) \u2261 3(C -1) \u2261 (D -1) mod7.\n\nTherefore, we can set them all equal to some common value, say K mod7. Let me write that:\n\nLet K \u2261 N mod7. Then:\n\n6(A -1) \u2261 K mod7,\n\n2(B -1) \u2261 K mod7,\n\n3(C -1) \u2261 K mod7,\n\n(D -1) \u2261 K mod7.\n\nTherefore, each of these equations must hold for the same K. So for each digit, we can express the digit in terms of K. Let me see:\n\nStarting with the fourth equation: D \u2261 K +1 mod7. Since D is a digit (0-9), D can be written as (K +1) +7m, but m must be such that D is between 0 and 9. Similarly for other digits.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nFrom the third equation: 3(C -1) \u2261 K mod7 \u21d2 3C -3 \u2261 K \u21d2 3C \u2261 K +3 \u21d2 C \u2261 (K +3)/3 mod7. But division in mod7 requires that 3 has an inverse. Since 3*5=15\u22611 mod7, so inverse of 3 mod7 is 5. Therefore, C \u2261 (K +3)*5 mod7.\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation: 2(B -1) \u2261 K \u21d2 2B -2 \u2261 K \u21d2 2B \u2261 K +2 \u21d2 B \u2261 (K +2)/2 mod7. Since 2 inverse mod7 is 4 because 2*4=8\u22611 mod7. So B \u2261 (K +2)*4 mod7.\n\nFrom the first equation: 6(A -1) \u2261 K \u21d2 6A -6 \u2261 K \u21d2 6A \u2261 K +6 \u21d2 A \u2261 (K +6)/6 mod7. The inverse of 6 mod7 is 6 because 6*6=36\u22611 mod7. So A \u2261 (K +6)*6 mod7.\n\nTherefore, each digit is determined modulo7 based on K. Since digits A,B,C,D are integers from 0-9 (with A from 1-9), we can express each digit in terms of K and some multiple of 7. Let's note that:\n\nLet me write each digit as:\n\nA \u2261 [(K +6)*6] mod7,\n\nB \u2261 [(K +2)*4] mod7,\n\nC \u2261 [(K +3)*5] mod7,\n\nD \u2261 (K +1) mod7.\n\nBut each digit must also be a single digit (0-9), so for each digit, there are possible values that satisfy the congruence. Since we are looking for the maximum N, which is a four-digit number, we need the largest possible A (thousands digit), so A should be as large as possible (9 if possible), then B, etc., but subject to the congruence conditions.\n\nOur approach might be to iterate over possible K values (since K is N mod7, which can be 0 to 6). For each K, we can compute possible digits A,B,C,D based on the congruences, then check if there's a four-digit number with those digits (with A from 1-9, others 0-9) which also satisfies that changing any digit to 1 gives a number divisible by7. Wait, but perhaps with the congruences, we can structure this better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since all congruences must hold, the digits can be expressed in terms of K. Let me see:\n\nLet me note that K can be from 0 to 6. Let me consider each possible K and see what digits A,B,C,D can be, then find the maximum N possible.\n\nBut since we want the maximum N, perhaps starting from K=0 upwards and see which gives the highest N? Not sure. Alternatively, since K is N mod7, perhaps the maximum N would correspond to the highest possible N such that when you set all the congruences, it works. Alternatively, perhaps starting from 9999 downwards and check the condition? But that might take too long.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the equations:\n\nSince each digit's possible values depend on K, perhaps we can find for each K, the maximum possible digits A,B,C,D.\n\nLet me try to formalize this:\n\nFor a given K (0 \u2264 K \u22646), compute:\n\nA \u2261 [(K+6)*6] mod7. Let me compute [(K+6)*6 mod7]. Let me compute this step by step:\n\nFirst, compute (K +6) mod7, then multiply by 6 mod7.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is [(K +6) *6] mod7? Wait, no: Wait the expression was A \u2261 (K +6)/6 mod7, but we had to invert 6 mod7. Wait let's retrace:\n\nWait, original equation was 6(A -1) \u2261 K mod7.\n\nSo solving for A:\n\n6(A -1) \u2261 K mod7 \u21d2 A -1 \u2261 K * 6^{-1} mod7 \u21d2 since 6^{-1} is 6, as 6*6=36\u22611 mod7.\n\nThus, A -1 \u2261 6K mod7 \u21d2 A \u2261 6K +1 mod7.\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the algebra. Let me redo that step.\n\nStarting over:\n\nFirst equation: 6(A -1) \u2261 K mod7 \u21d2 A -1 \u2261 K * (6^{-1}) mod7.\n\nSince 6^{-1} is 6 mod7 (because 6*6=36\u22611 mod7), so:\n\nA -1 \u2261 6K mod7 \u21d2 A \u2261 6K +1 mod7.\n\nSimilarly, second equation:\n\n2(B -1) \u2261 K mod7 \u21d2 B -1 \u2261 (K)*(2^{-1}) mod7. 2^{-1} is 4 mod7 (since 2*4=8\u22611 mod7). So:\n\nB -1 \u2261 4K mod7 \u21d2 B \u22614K +1 mod7.\n\nThird equation:\n\n3(C -1) \u2261 K mod7 \u21d2 C -1 \u2261 (K)*(3^{-1}) mod7. 3^{-1}=5 mod7 (since 3*5=15\u22611 mod7).\n\nSo C -1 \u22615K mod7 \u21d2 C\u22615K +1 mod7.\n\nFourth equation:\n\nD -1 \u2261 K mod7 \u21d2 D\u2261K +1 mod7.\n\nAh, that's better. So each digit is congruent to:\n\nA \u2261 (6K +1) mod7,\n\nB \u2261 (4K +1) mod7,\n\nC \u2261 (5K +1) mod7,\n\nD \u2261 (K +1) mod7.\n\nTherefore, for each K from 0 to 6, we can compute the possible residues for each digit modulo7. Then, the actual digits must satisfy these congruences, but also be digits (0-9 for B,C,D; 1-9 for A). Since we want the largest possible N, we want the largest possible thousands digit A, then hundreds digit B, etc., so for each K, we can compute the maximum possible digits under these congruences.\n\nTherefore, for each K from 0 to6, let's compute the possible digits:\n\nLet me make a table for each K (0-6), compute A mod7, B mod7, C mod7, D mod7, then find the maximum possible digits.\n\nStarting with K=0:\n\nK=0:\n\nA \u22616*0 +1=1 mod7 \u21d2 A \u22611 mod7. So possible A values are 1,8 (since A is 1-9). To maximize, pick A=8 (since 8 is the largest \u22649 congruent to 1 mod7? Wait 8 mod7 is 1, yes. So A=8.\n\nB\u22614*0 +1=1 mod7 \u21d2 B\u22611 mod7. B can be 1,8. To maximize, pick 8.\n\nC\u22615*0 +1=1 mod7 \u21d2 C=1 or 8. Max is 8.\n\nD\u22610+1=1 mod7 \u21d2 D=1 or 8. Max is 8.\n\nThus, with K=0, the digits would be A=8, B=8, C=8, D=8 \u21d2 N=8888.\n\nWait but we need to check if this actually satisfies the original condition. Because even if the congruences are satisfied, maybe changing a digit to 1 might not actually give a multiple of7. Let me verify with N=8888.\n\nChanging first digit to 1: 1888. Let's divide by7: 1888 \u00f77. 7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5 \u21d2 remainder 5. Not divisible. Hmm, that's a problem. So even though the congruences are set up, maybe there's an error in the approach.\n\nWait, so my mistake must be here. Because when I set up the equations, I assumed that N \u2261 K mod7 where K is the same for all equations, but perhaps the way I derived the equations is incorrect?\n\nWait let me check the equations again. Let me recast the problem.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\nAfter changing each digit to 1, the resulting number must be divisible by7. Let me re-derive the congruences properly.\n\nLet me denote N = 1000A + 100B +10C + D.\n\nWhen we change the first digit to 1, the new number is 1000*1 + 100B +10C + D = 1000 + 100B +10C + D. This must be divisible by7. So:\n\n(1000 + 100B +10C + D) \u22610 mod7.\n\nSimilarly, original N =1000A +100B +10C +D. So subtract these two equations:\n\n(N - (A-1)*1000) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N \u2261 (A -1)*1000 mod7. Wait that's what I had before.\n\nBut 1000 mod7 is 6, so N \u22616(A-1) mod7.\n\nSimilarly for the others:\n\nChanging B to1: 1000A +100*1 +10C + D \u22610 mod7. So N - (B-1)*100 \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N \u2261(B-1)*100 mod7. Since 100 mod7 is 2, so N\u22612(B-1) mod7.\n\nSimilarly, changing C to1 gives N \u226110(C-1) mod7 (since 10 mod7 is3, so 3(C-1)), and changing D to1 gives N\u2261(D -1) mod7.\n\nThus, the four congruences are correct. So N must be congruent to each of these expressions mod7. Therefore, they must all be congruent to each other mod7, so:\n\n6(A -1) \u22612(B -1)\u22613(C -1)\u2261(D -1) mod7.\n\nTherefore, the equations are correct. So when K is set as N mod7, then all the expressions must be equal to K mod7. So K = N mod7, so all the expressions above must equal K mod7. Therefore, my previous steps are correct.\n\nBut when K=0, the digits A=8, B=8, C=8, D=8 gives N=8888, but when we check changing the first digit to 1, we get 1888, which is not divisible by7, which contradicts. So something is wrong here. Maybe my mistake is in the calculation of N mod7?\n\nWait, if K = N mod7, then N \u2261 K mod7. Let me compute N mod7 for N=8888:\n\n8888 divided by7. Let me compute 8888 \u00f77: 7*1269=8883, so 8888-8883=5 \u21d2 8888\u22615 mod7. Therefore K would be5 mod7. Wait, so if K is supposed to be N mod7, but in my earlier approach I set K=0, but in reality, N=8888 has K=5. Therefore, my mistake was in the initial assumption. The K here is N mod7, so for K=0, the number N must be \u22610 mod7. However, when I set K=0, I was choosing digits such that A\u22611 mod7, etc., but that would not necessarily make N\u22610 mod7. Wait, perhaps I messed up the substitution.\n\nWait let's clarify:\n\nLet me retrace:\n\nWe have four congruences:\n\n6(A -1) \u2261 K mod7,\n\n2(B -1) \u2261 K mod7,\n\n3(C -1) \u2261 K mod7,\n\n(D -1) \u2261 K mod7,\n\nand also N \u2261 K mod7.\n\nWait, so all those expressions must equal K mod7. But N itself must also be \u2261 K mod7. Therefore, the equations are:\n\n6(A-1) \u2261 K mod7,\n\n2(B-1)\u2261K mod7,\n\n3(C-1)\u2261K mod7,\n\n(D-1)\u2261K mod7,\n\nand also N \u2261 K mod7.\n\nTherefore, the first four equations define K in terms of the digits, but also N must \u2261 K mod7. Therefore, K must be consistent with N mod7. Therefore, perhaps the approach should be to first express each digit in terms of K, then ensure that when you compute N =1000A +100B +10C +D, then N mod7 = K.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the way I approached before was missing that N mod7 must also equal K, so there's an additional equation.\n\nAlternatively, since N mod7 is K, and also N is expressed as 1000A +100B +10C + D, so substituting the expressions for A,B,C,D in terms of K, we can write N mod7 in terms of K and set it equal to K mod7, thereby getting an equation for K.\n\nHmm, maybe that's the missing link.\n\nLet me try this approach. Let me express each digit in terms of K, then compute N mod7 and set it equal to K mod7. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, for each digit:\n\nA \u22616K +1 mod7 \u21d2 A =7a + (6K +1 mod7). But A must be between 1 and 9.\n\nSimilarly, B=7b + (4K +1 mod7), between0-9,\n\nC=7c + (5K +1 mod7), 0-9,\n\nD=7d + (K +1 mod7), 0-9,\n\nwhere a,b,c,d are integers such that the digits stay within their ranges.\n\nTherefore, the exact value of each digit can be written as:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nA = 7a + a0,\n\nwhere a0 = (6K +1) mod7,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nB =7b + b0,\n\nwhere b0 = (4K +1) mod7,\n\nC=7c + c0,\n\nc0=(5K +1) mod7,\n\nD=7d + d0,\n\nd0=(K +1) mod7.\n\nThus, the number N can be written as:\n\nN = 1000*(7a + a0) + 100*(7b + b0) +10*(7c +c0) + (7d +d0)\n\n= 7*(1000a + 100b +10c +d) + (1000a0 + 100b0 +10c0 +d0)\n\nTherefore, N mod7 is equal to (1000a0 + 100b0 +10c0 +d0) mod7,\n\nsince 7*(...) is 0 mod7.\n\nBut N \u2261 K mod7, so:\n\n(1000a0 + 100b0 +10c0 +d0) \u2261 K mod7.\n\nBut since a0, b0, c0, d0 are all functions of K, this gives an equation in K.\n\nTherefore, let's compute this expression mod7 for each K from 0 to6.\n\nLet me compute for each K from 0 to6:\n\nFirst, compute a0, b0, c0, d0 for each K:\n\nLet me make a table:\n\nFor K=0:\n\na0 = (6*0 +1) mod7=1 mod7 \u21d2 a0=1,\n\nb0=(4*0 +1)=1 mod7 \u21d21,\n\nc0=(5*0 +1)=1 mod7 \u21d21,\n\nd0=(0 +1)=1 mod7 \u21d21,\n\nThus, the expression 1000a0 +100b0 +10c0 +d0 = 1000*1 +100*1 +10*1 +1 = 1000 +100 +10 +1 =1111.\n\n1111 mod7: Let's compute:\n\n7*158=1106, so 1111-1106=5 \u21d2 1111\u22615 mod7.\n\nThus, the equation is 5 \u2261 K mod7 (since K=0 here). But 5\u22610 mod7? No, 5\u22615\u22600. Thus, inconsistency. Therefore, K=0 is invalid.\n\nWait that's a problem. So K=0 cannot be a solution because when K=0, the expression evaluates to 5 mod7, but K is supposed to be 0. Therefore, K=0 is invalid.\n\nHmm, so K must satisfy:\n\nFor each K, compute 1000a0 +100b0 +10c0 +d0 mod7 and set equal to K mod7.\n\nTherefore, let's compute this for each K from 0 to6:\n\nLet me compute each step:\n\nFirst, compute a0, b0, c0, d0 for each K:\n\nK=0:\n\na0=1, b0=1, c0=1, d0=1,\n\nExpression: 1000+100+10+1=1111\u22615 mod7. So 5\u22610? No.\n\nK=1:\n\na0=(6*1+1)=7\u22610 mod7 \u21d2a0=0,\n\nWait wait, wait:\n\nWait a0 is (6K +1) mod7. For K=1:\n\na0 =6*1 +1=7\u22610 mod7 \u21d2 a0=0,\n\nb0=4*1 +1=5 mod7 \u21d25,\n\nc0=5*1 +1=6 mod7 \u21d26,\n\nd0=1+1=2 mod7 \u21d22,\n\nThus expression:\n\n1000*a0 +100*b0 +10*c0 +d0 = 1000*0 +100*5 +10*6 +2 =0 +500 +60 +2=562.\n\n562 mod7: 7*80=560, so 562-560=2 \u21d2562\u22612 mod7.\n\nSet equal to K=1 \u21d2 2\u22611 mod7? No. Not valid.\n\nK=2:\n\na0=(6*2 +1)=13\u22616 mod7 \u21d26,\n\nb0=(4*2 +1)=9\u22612 mod7 \u21d22,\n\nc0=(5*2 +1)=11\u22614 mod7 \u21d24,\n\nd0=(2+1)=3 mod7 \u21d23,\n\nExpression:\n\n1000*6 +100*2 +10*4 +3 =6000 +200 +40 +3=6243.\n\n6243 mod7. Let me compute:\n\nDivide 6243 by7:\n\n7*891=6237, 6243-6237=6 \u21d26243\u22616 mod7.\n\nSet equal to K=2: 6\u22612? No.\n\nK=3:\n\na0=6*3 +1=19\u22615 mod7 (since 19-14=5),\n\nb0=4*3 +1=13\u22616 mod7,\n\nc0=5*3 +1=16\u22612 mod7,\n\nd0=3+1=4 mod7,\n\nExpression:\n\n1000*5 +100*6 +10*2 +4=5000+600+20+4=5624.\n\n5624 mod7:\n\n7*803=5621, 5624-5621=3 \u21d25624\u22613 mod7.\n\nSet equal to K=3 \u21d23\u22613.

No.\n\nK=5 invalid.\n\nK=6:\n\na0=6*6 +1=37\u226137 mod7: 7*5=35, 37-35=2 \u21d22 mod7,\n\nb0=4*6 +1=25\u22614 mod7 (25-21=4),\n\nc0=5*6 +1=31\u22613 mod7 (31-28=3),\n\nd0=6+1=7\u22610 mod7,\n\nExpression:\n\n1000*2 +100*4 +10*3 +0=2000 +400 +30 +0=2430.\n\n2430 mod7:\n\n7*347=2429, so 2430\u22611 mod7.\n\nSet equal to K=6 \u21d21\u22616 mod7? No.\n\nThus, only K=3 satisfies the condition that the expression \u2261 K mod7.\n\nTherefore, the only valid K is K=3. Thus, we must have K=3.\n\nTherefore, now, with K=3, we can compute the digits A,B,C,D.\n\nRecall:\n\nA \u22616K +1 mod7 \u21d26*3+1=19\u22615 mod7 \u21d2a0=5,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nB\u22614K +1 mod7 \u21d24*3+1=13\u22616 mod7 \u21d2b0=6,\n\nC\u22615K +1 mod7 \u21d25*3+1=16\u22612 mod7 \u21d2c0=2,\n\nD\u2261K +1 mod7 \u21d23+1=4 mod7 \u21d2d0=4.\n\nTherefore, the digits are:\n\nA: must be \u22615 mod7. Since A is a digit from1-9, possible values are 5, 12 (but 12 is too big), so A=5 or 5+7=12 invalid. So only A=5? Wait wait, no:\n\nWait A is 7a + a0, where a0=5, so A can be 5, 5+7=12 (invalid), so only A=5? Wait but that would restrict A to 5. But perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait earlier, when I expressed A =7a + a0, where a0 is (6K+1) mod7. Since a0=5 here (for K=3), A can be 5, 12 (too big), so only 5. So A must be 5.\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\nB=7b +b0, where b0=6 (since b0=6 mod7). So possible B values: 6,13 (invalid), so B=6.\n\nC=7c +c0, c0=2 mod7 \u21d2 C can be 2 or 9 (2+7=9). Since we want maximum N, we should choose the largest possible digits. So for C, choose 9.\n\nSimilarly, D=7d +d0, d0=4 mod7 \u21d2 D can be 4, 11 (invalid), so only D=4. Wait 4+7=11, which is invalid, so D=4.\n\nWait but hold on:\n\nWait, for C: c0=2, so C can be 2, 9 (since 2+7=9). Since 9 is a valid digit (0-9), so C=9 is possible.\n\nSimilarly for B: b0=6 \u21d2 B=6 or 13 invalid, so only 6.\n\nFor D: d0=4 \u21d2 D=4 or 11 invalid, so D=4.\n\nFor A: a0=5 \u21d2 A=5 or 12 invalid, so A=5.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible digits are A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4 \u21d2 N=5694.\n\nWait but we need to check if this is the maximum possible. Let me see if there are higher digits possible by choosing different a,b,c,d coefficients. Wait but in the expressions above, A is 7a + a0, with a0=5. Since a must be an integer such that A is between 1-9, the only possible a is 0, giving A=5. Because if a=1, then 7*1 +5=12 which is too big. So A must be 5.\n\nSimilarly, B is 7b +6. The possible B digits:\n\nIf b=0 \u21d26,\n\nb=1 \u21d213 invalid, so only 6.\n\nC is 7c +2. To maximize C, set c=1 \u21d27+2=9,\n\nc=0 \u21d22,\n\nso 9 is the maximum.\n\nD is 7d +4. d=0 \u21d24,\n\nd=1 \u21d211 invalid. So D=4.\n\nTherefore, the maximum N possible with K=3 is 5694.\n\nBut wait, but we need the greatest four-digit number possible. Maybe there's a higher N with a different K? Wait but we saw that only K=3 works. So 5694 is the only candidate? Hmm, but perhaps I made a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, but let me verify if N=5694 actually satisfies the condition.\n\nCheck each digit change to 1:\n\n1. Change first digit (5) to 1: 1694. Check divisibility by7:\n\n1694 \u00f77: 7*242=1694. Exactly divisible. Good.\n\n2. Change second digit (6) to1: 5194.\n\n5194 \u00f77: 7*742=5194. Exactly divisible. Good.\n\n3. Change third digit (9) to1: 5614.\n\n5614 \u00f77: Let's compute 7*802=5614? 7*800=5600, plus 7*2=14 \u21d2 5614. Yes. So divisible.\n\n4. Change fourth digit (4) to1: 5691.\n\n5691 \u00f77: 7*813=5691 (7*800=5600, 7*13=91 \u21d2 total 5691). Yes, divisible.\n\nSo N=5694 works. But is there a higher N?\n\nWait, since K=3 is the only possible K, but maybe with different choices for the digits? For example, for C, we chose 9 (the maximum possible), but maybe there are other digits with higher values? Wait in this case, C can only be 2 or 9, so 9 is the max. Similarly for other digits.\n\nBut 5694 is the number. Wait, but is there a higher number with K=3? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps my mistake is in the calculation for K=3.\n\nWait let me check again for K=3, the digits:\n\nA must be \u22615 mod7. So A can be 5 or 12 (invalid). So only 5.\n\nB must be \u22616 mod7. So B=6 or 13 (invalid). So only 6.\n\nC must be \u22612 mod7. So C=2 or 9 (since 2+7=9). So 9 is the max.\n\nD must be \u22614 mod7. So D=4 or 11 (invalid). So 4 is only.\n\nThus, the maximum possible N is 5694. But 5694 is a four-digit number, but maybe there is a larger number where digits can be higher but still satisfy the congruences?\n\nWait, but according to the constraints from K=3, those are the only possibilities. Hmm.\n\nWait but maybe I made a mistake in assuming that a0, b0, etc. must be exactly the residues. Let me check again.\n\nWait the equations are:\n\nA \u22616K +1 mod7,\n\nBut A is a digit from1-9. So A can be any number \u2261 (6K+1) mod7, but not necessarily exactly equal to (6K+1). For example, for K=3, 6*3+1=19\u22615 mod7, so A must \u22615 mod7. So A can be 5 or 12, but 12 is too big, so only 5. So that's correct.\n\nWait but is there a way to have a higher digit? For example, if A is allowed to be higher by adding 7? But that would go over 9. So no.\n\nSimilarly for B, which must be \u22616 mod7. So 6 or 13, but 13 is too big, so only 6.\n\nHmm. So 5694 is the only possible N for K=3.\n\nBut 5694 is a four-digit number, but the problem asks for the greatest four-digit number with this property. So maybe 5694 is the answer? Wait, but 5694 is not the largest four-digit number. Maybe there is a higher number?\n\nWait, but according to the constraints, only K=3 works, so perhaps 5694 is the maximum. But let me see if there is a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for K=3's expression. Let me recheck.\n\nWhen K=3:\n\nThe expression 1000a0 + 100b0 +10c0 +d0 where a0=5, b0=6, c0=2, d0=4.\n\nWait, 1000*5 +100*6 +10*2 +4 = 5000 +600 +20 +4 =5624.\n\nWait earlier I computed this as 5624 mod7 \u22613 mod7, which matches K=3. So that's correct.\n\nWait but then when I constructed the number N=5694, how does that relate?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that when we write N=1000A +100B +10C +D, with A,B,C,D as 5,6,9,4, then N=5694. But according to the earlier expression, the minimal N would be 5624 (from the expression with a0,b0,c0,d0). But we can choose higher digits by adding multiples of7 to each digit (as long as they stay within 0-9 for B,C,D and 1-9 for A). So for example, A is 5 mod7, so the next possible A is 5+7=12 which is invalid. So A must stay at 5. B is 6 mod7, so next is 13 invalid. C is 2 mod7, so can be 2 or 9. We choose 9. D is4 mod7, so only 4. So the maximum possible is indeed 5694. So that's the maximum.\n\nBut 5694 seems low for the greatest four-digit number. Maybe there's an error in my approach?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that when setting the digits to their maximum possible values under the congruence, but also allowing the other digits to be as high as possible. Wait, let's see.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let me try to find the maximum N by starting from 9999 and going downward, checking the condition. Since the problem might have a higher number than 5694.\n\nLet me test N=9999:\n\nCheck changing each digit to1:\n\n1) 1999: 1999 \u00f77. 7*285=1995, 1999-1995=4 \u21d2 remainder4 \u21d2 not divisible.\n\nAlready fails. So 9999 invalid.\n\nNext, 9998:\n\nChange first digit to1: 1998. 1998 \u00f77: 7*285=1995, 1998-1995=3 \u21d2 no.\n\nSimilarly, any number starting with 9 will fail when changing first digit to1 unless 1BCD is divisible by7. But 1BCD is a four-digit number starting with1, so between 1000-1999. The maximum such number divisible by7 is 1995 (7*285). So to have 1BCD divisible by7, the number after changing first digit must be \u22641995. But original N is 9999, so changing first digit to1 gives 1999 which is higher than1995 \u21d2 not divisible. So any number with A=9 will fail when changing first digit to1, since 1 followed by the other digits would be 1BCD which is over 1995. Wait, unless B,C,D are smaller?\n\nWait but if the original number is 9XYZ, changing the first digit to1 gives 1XYZ. To have 1XYZ divisible by7, then 1XYZ must be divisible by7. But 1XYZ can be as high as 1999, but to be divisible by7, it must be 1995 or less. So if XYZ is such that 1XYZ is divisible by7, but original number is 9XYZ. But the problem is that for the number to satisfy the condition, changing any digit to1 must result in divisible by7, so even the first digit. So for N=9XYZ, 1XYZ must be divisible by7. So 1XYZ \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 XYZ \u2261-1000 mod7. Since 1000\u22616 mod7, so XYZ \u2261-6 mod7 \u21d2 XYZ\u22611 mod7 (since -6 mod7 is1).\n\nSimilarly, changing other digits must also result in divisible numbers. But this approach might take too long. Alternatively, since my previous method yielded N=5694 as the only possible number with K=3, maybe that is indeed the maximum?\n\nWait but let me check with K=3, if there is a higher N possible with different digit choices. For instance, if we can choose a higher digit for A by taking a different residue?\n\nWait A must be \u22615 mod7. The next possible A above 5 would be 12, which is invalid. So A must be 5. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed another K?\n\nWait when I checked K=0 to6, only K=3 worked. So that must be the only possibility. Therefore, the maximum N is 5694. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me test another number. Let's try 5714.\n\nWait, let me see. Suppose N=5714.\n\nCheck the conditions:\n\nChanging first digit to1:1714. 1714 \u00f77: 7*245=1715 \u21d2 1714 is 1 less \u21d2 remainder6. Not divisible. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 5714 is not constructed properly.\n\nWait going back, maybe I made a mistake in the K=3 calculation. Let me check N=5694 again:\n\nChanging third digit (9) to1:5614. 5614 \u00f77= 5614/7=802 exactly. Yes.\n\nChanging second digit (6) to1:5194. 5194/7=742, exactly.\n\nChanging first digit (5) to1:1694/7=242, exactly.\n\nChanging fourth digit (4) to1:5691/7=813, exactly. So yes, it works.\n\nIs there a larger N?\n\nSuppose I try 6394. Let me see:\n\nWait but according to the constraints, A must be 5 mod7. So 6 mod7 is 6, which isn't 5 mod7. So 6 would not satisfy the congruence for A.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's another number with higher thousands digit. Let's suppose A=6. Then, for A=6, which is 6 mod7. Let's see what K would that require.\n\nFrom the equation A \u22616K +1 mod7 \u21d26 \u22616K +1 mod7 \u21d26K\u22615 mod7 \u21d26K\u22615 mod7 \u21d2Multiply both sides by 6^{-1}=6 \u21d2K\u22615*6=30\u22612 mod7.\n\nSo K\u22612 mod7. Let's see if K=2 is valid.\n\nWait earlier when K=2, the equation gave us inconsistency, but let's check again.\n\nWait for K=2:\n\nThe expression 1000a0 + ... \u22616 mod7, which should equal K=2. Wait no, earlier when K=2, the expression mod7 was 6, which should equal K=2 \u21d26\u22612 mod7 \u21d2invalid. So K=2 is invalid. Therefore, A=6 would require K=2 which is invalid. So no.\n\nSimilarly, trying A=7:\n\nA=7. Then,\n\nA\u22617 mod7=0\u22616K +1 mod7 \u21d26K +1 \u22610 mod7 \u21d26K\u2261-1\u22616 mod7 \u21d2K\u22611 mod7 (since 6/6=1 mod7? Wait 6K\u22616 mod7 \u21d2 divide both sides by6: K\u22611 mod7.\n\nSo K=1. Let's see K=1:\n\nFor K=1, we had the expression mod7=2, which should equal K=1 \u21d2 invalid. So no.\n\nA=4:\n\nA=4. Then,\n\n4\u22616K +1 mod7 \u21d26K\u22613 mod7 \u21d2K\u22613*6^{-1} mod7 \u21d26^{-1}=6 \u21d23*6=18\u22614 mod7 \u21d2K=4.\n\nCheck K=4:\n\nFor K=4, the expression mod7 was0, but K=4 \u21d20\u22614 mod7 \u21d2invalid.\n\nA=3:\n\nA=3 \u21d23\u22616K+1 \u21d26K\u22612 \u21d2K\u22612*6^{-1}=2*6=12\u22615 mod7 \u21d2K=5.\n\nCheck K=5:\n\nExpression mod7=4 vs K=5 \u21d2 no.\n\nA=2:\n\nA=2 \u21d22\u22616K+1 \u21d26K\u22611 \u21d2K\u22611*6^{-1}=6 mod7 \u21d2K=6.\n\nCheck K=6:\n\nExpression mod7=1 vs K=6 \u21d21\u22616 \u21d2 no.\n\nA=1:\n\nA=1 \u21d21\u22616K+1 \u21d26K\u22610 \u21d2K\u22610 mod7 \u21d2K=0.\n\nCheck K=0:\n\nExpression mod7=5 vs K=0 \u21d2 no.\n\nTherefore, only when A=5 (which requires K=3) is valid, giving N=5694.\n\nTherefore, indeed 5694 is the only possible number. Thus, the answer should be N=5694.\n\nWait but 5694 divided by1000 is 5 with remainder 694. Therefore Q=5 and R=694 \u21d2 Q+R=5+694=699.\n\nBut before finalizing, let me check if there is another number higher than 5694 that could satisfy the conditions. Let me see:\n\nSuppose there is a number like 6394. Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, A must be 5. So any number with A>5 would require an invalid K. So the thousands digit can't be higher than5.\n\nWait, but what if there is a number where the thousands digit is 5, but the hundreds digit is higher than6? Let me see.\n\nWait in the K=3 case, B must be \u22616 mod7. So B can only be 6 or 13 (invalid). So B=6 is maximum.\n\nSimilarly, C can be 9, which is the maximum possible for C\u22612 mod7.\n\nD is 4.\n\nTherefore, 5694 is indeed the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe choosing different digits with the same congruence but different values? For example, C can be 2 or9. If we choose C=2 instead of9, then the number would be smaller (5624). So 5694 is the largest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Q + R =5 +694=699.\n\nWait, but just to confirm once more with another example. Suppose N=5694. Then Q=5, R=694. 5+694=699. So the final answer is 699. But let me check once more if 5694 is indeed the maximum.\n\nWait, what if there is a number like 5714? Let me see:\n\nWait, but A=5 is okay. Let me see if such a number could exist. Let me check if 5714 can satisfy the conditions.\n\nChanging first digit to1:1714. 1714/7=244.857\u2026 Not integer. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another number like 5700-something. But since the digits must follow the congruences, probably not.\n\nAlternatively, suppose someone constructs another number with A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4, which is 5694, which works. There's no higher four-digit number with A=5 and the other digits at their maximum under the constraints. So I think that is indeed the maximum.\n\nThus, the final answer should be 5+694=699.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{699}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once I find N, I have to compute Q + R where N divided by 1000 gives quotient Q and remainder R. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since N is a four-digit number, it can be written as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A \u2260 0. The problem states that changing any one digit to 1 should make the number divisible by 7. So, changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.\n\nOur goal is to find the largest possible N (so we want the largest four-digit number possible) that satisfies this condition. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nMaybe I can express each of these modified numbers in terms of N and then set up equations based on their divisibility by 7. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. Then:\n\n1. Changing the first digit (A) to 1: The number becomes 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Let's call this number N1. So N1 = N - (A - 1)*1000. Since N1 must be divisible by 7, that means (N - (A - 1)*1000) \u2261 0 mod 7. So N \u2261 (A - 1)*1000 mod 7.\n\n2. Changing the second digit (B) to 1: The number becomes 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. Let's call this N2. So N2 = N - (B - 1)*100. Similarly, N2 \u2261 0 mod7 \u21d2 N \u2261 (B - 1)*100 mod7.\n\n3. Changing the third digit (C) to 1: The number becomes 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. Let's call this N3. So N3 = N - (C - 1)*10. Hence, N \u2261 (C - 1)*10 mod7.\n\n4. Changing the fourth digit (D) to 1: The number becomes 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. Let's call this N4. So N4 = N - (D - 1). Therefore, N \u2261 (D - 1) mod7.\n\nSo, summarizing the four congruences:\n\n1. N \u2261 (A - 1)*1000 mod7\n\n2. N \u2261 (B - 1)*100 mod7\n\n3. N \u2261 (C - 1)*10 mod7\n\n4. N \u2261 (D - 1) mod7\n\nHmm, so all four of these must hold simultaneously. Since N is the same number, these four congruences must all be compatible. That means that (A - 1)*1000 \u2261 (B - 1)*100 \u2261 (C - 1)*10 \u2261 (D - 1) mod7.\n\nTherefore, each of these expressions must be congruent modulo 7. Let me write down each term mod7.\n\nFirst, let's compute the coefficients modulo 7:\n\n- 1000 mod7: Let's see, 7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6 \u21d2 1000 \u22616 mod7.\n\n- 100 mod7: 7*14=98 \u21d2 100 -98=2 \u21d2 100\u22612 mod7.\n\n- 10 mod7: 10-7=3 \u21d2 10\u22613 mod7.\n\n- 1 mod7 is 1.\n\nTherefore, substituting these into the congruences:\n\n1. N \u2261 6*(A -1) mod7\n\n2. N \u2261 2*(B -1) mod7\n\n3. N \u2261 3*(C -1) mod7\n\n4. N \u2261 (D -1) mod7\n\nTherefore, all four expressions must be equal mod7:\n\n6(A -1) \u2261 2(B -1) \u2261 3(C -1) \u2261 (D -1) mod7.\n\nTherefore, we can set them all equal to some common value, say K mod7. Let me write that:\n\nLet K \u2261 N mod7. Then:\n\n6(A -1) \u2261 K mod7,\n\n2(B -1) \u2261 K mod7,\n\n3(C -1) \u2261 K mod7,\n\n(D -1) \u2261 K mod7.\n\nTherefore, each of these equations must hold for the same K. So for each digit, we can express the digit in terms of K. Let me see:\n\nStarting with the fourth equation: D \u2261 K +1 mod7. Since D is a digit (0-9), D can be written as (K +1) +7m, but m must be such that D is between 0 and 9. Similarly for other digits.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nFrom the third equation: 3(C -1) \u2261 K mod7 \u21d2 3C -3 \u2261 K \u21d2 3C \u2261 K +3 \u21d2 C \u2261 (K +3)/3 mod7. But division in mod7 requires that 3 has an inverse. Since 3*5=15\u22611 mod7, so inverse of 3 mod7 is 5. Therefore, C \u2261 (K +3)*5 mod7.\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation: 2(B -1) \u2261 K \u21d2 2B -2 \u2261 K \u21d2 2B \u2261 K +2 \u21d2 B \u2261 (K +2)/2 mod7. Since 2 inverse mod7 is 4 because 2*4=8\u22611 mod7. So B \u2261 (K +2)*4 mod7.\n\nFrom the first equation: 6(A -1) \u2261 K \u21d2 6A -6 \u2261 K \u21d2 6A \u2261 K +6 \u21d2 A \u2261 (K +6)/6 mod7. The inverse of 6 mod7 is 6 because 6*6=36\u22611 mod7. So A \u2261 (K +6)*6 mod7.\n\nTherefore, each digit is determined modulo7 based on K. Since digits A,B,C,D are integers from 0-9 (with A from 1-9), we can express each digit in terms of K and some multiple of 7. Let's note that:\n\nLet me write each digit as:\n\nA \u2261 [(K +6)*6] mod7,\n\nB \u2261 [(K +2)*4] mod7,\n\nC \u2261 [(K +3)*5] mod7,\n\nD \u2261 (K +1) mod7.\n\nBut each digit must also be a single digit (0-9), so for each digit, there are possible values that satisfy the congruence. Since we are looking for the maximum N, which is a four-digit number, we need the largest possible A (thousands digit), so A should be as large as possible (9 if possible), then B, etc., but subject to the congruence conditions.\n\nOur approach might be to iterate over possible K values (since K is N mod7, which can be 0 to 6). For each K, we can compute possible digits A,B,C,D based on the congruences, then check if there's a four-digit number with those digits (with A from 1-9, others 0-9) which also satisfies that changing any digit to 1 gives a number divisible by7. Wait, but perhaps with the congruences, we can structure this better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since all congruences must hold, the digits can be expressed in terms of K. Let me see:\n\nLet me note that K can be from 0 to 6. Let me consider each possible K and see what digits A,B,C,D can be, then find the maximum N possible.\n\nBut since we want the maximum N, perhaps starting from K=0 upwards and see which gives the highest N? Not sure. Alternatively, since K is N mod7, perhaps the maximum N would correspond to the highest possible N such that when you set all the congruences, it works. Alternatively, perhaps starting from 9999 downwards and check the condition? But that might take too long.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the equations:\n\nSince each digit's possible values depend on K, perhaps we can find for each K, the maximum possible digits A,B,C,D.\n\nLet me try to formalize this:\n\nFor a given K (0 \u2264 K \u22646), compute:\n\nA \u2261 [(K+6)*6] mod7. Let me compute [(K+6)*6 mod7]. Let me compute this step by step:\n\nFirst, compute (K +6) mod7, then multiply by 6 mod7.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is [(K +6) *6] mod7? Wait, no: Wait the expression was A \u2261 (K +6)/6 mod7, but we had to invert 6 mod7. Wait let's retrace:\n\nWait, original equation was 6(A -1) \u2261 K mod7.\n\nSo solving for A:\n\n6(A -1) \u2261 K mod7 \u21d2 A -1 \u2261 K * 6^{-1} mod7 \u21d2 since 6^{-1} is 6, as 6*6=36\u22611 mod7.\n\nThus, A -1 \u2261 6K mod7 \u21d2 A \u2261 6K +1 mod7.\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the algebra. Let me redo that step.\n\nStarting over:\n\nFirst equation: 6(A -1) \u2261 K mod7 \u21d2 A -1 \u2261 K * (6^{-1}) mod7.\n\nSince 6^{-1} is 6 mod7 (because 6*6=36\u22611 mod7), so:\n\nA -1 \u2261 6K mod7 \u21d2 A \u2261 6K +1 mod7.\n\nSimilarly, second equation:\n\n2(B -1) \u2261 K mod7 \u21d2 B -1 \u2261 (K)*(2^{-1}) mod7. 2^{-1} is 4 mod7 (since 2*4=8\u22611 mod7). So:\n\nB -1 \u2261 4K mod7 \u21d2 B \u22614K +1 mod7.\n\nThird equation:\n\n3(C -1) \u2261 K mod7 \u21d2 C -1 \u2261 (K)*(3^{-1}) mod7. 3^{-1}=5 mod7 (since 3*5=15\u22611 mod7).\n\nSo C -1 \u22615K mod7 \u21d2 C\u22615K +1 mod7.\n\nFourth equation:\n\nD -1 \u2261 K mod7 \u21d2 D\u2261K +1 mod7.\n\nAh, that's better. So each digit is congruent to:\n\nA \u2261 (6K +1) mod7,\n\nB \u2261 (4K +1) mod7,\n\nC \u2261 (5K +1) mod7,\n\nD \u2261 (K +1) mod7.\n\nTherefore, for each K from 0 to 6, we can compute the possible residues for each digit modulo7. Then, the actual digits must satisfy these congruences, but also be digits (0-9 for B,C,D; 1-9 for A). Since we want the largest possible N, we want the largest possible thousands digit A, then hundreds digit B, etc., so for each K, we can compute the maximum possible digits under these congruences.\n\nTherefore, for each K from 0 to6, let's compute the possible digits:\n\nLet me make a table for each K (0-6), compute A mod7, B mod7, C mod7, D mod7, then find the maximum possible digits.\n\nStarting with K=0:\n\nK=0:\n\nA \u22616*0 +1=1 mod7 \u21d2 A \u22611 mod7. So possible A values are 1,8 (since A is 1-9). To maximize, pick A=8 (since 8 is the largest \u22649 congruent to 1 mod7? Wait 8 mod7 is 1, yes. So A=8.\n\nB\u22614*0 +1=1 mod7 \u21d2 B\u22611 mod7. B can be 1,8. To maximize, pick 8.\n\nC\u22615*0 +1=1 mod7 \u21d2 C=1 or 8. Max is 8.\n\nD\u22610+1=1 mod7 \u21d2 D=1 or 8. Max is 8.\n\nThus, with K=0, the digits would be A=8, B=8, C=8, D=8 \u21d2 N=8888.\n\nWait but we need to check if this actually satisfies the original condition. Because even if the congruences are satisfied, maybe changing a digit to 1 might not actually give a multiple of7. Let me verify with N=8888.\n\nChanging first digit to 1: 1888. Let's divide by7: 1888 \u00f77. 7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5 \u21d2 remainder 5. Not divisible. Hmm, that's a problem. So even though the congruences are set up, maybe there's an error in the approach.\n\nWait, so my mistake must be here. Because when I set up the equations, I assumed that N \u2261 K mod7 where K is the same for all equations, but perhaps the way I derived the equations is incorrect?\n\nWait let me check the equations again. Let me recast the problem.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\nAfter changing each digit to 1, the resulting number must be divisible by7. Let me re-derive the congruences properly.\n\nLet me denote N = 1000A + 100B +10C + D.\n\nWhen we change the first digit to 1, the new number is 1000*1 + 100B +10C + D = 1000 + 100B +10C + D. This must be divisible by7. So:\n\n(1000 + 100B +10C + D) \u22610 mod7.\n\nSimilarly, original N =1000A +100B +10C +D. So subtract these two equations:\n\n(N - (A-1)*1000) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N \u2261 (A -1)*1000 mod7. Wait that's what I had before.\n\nBut 1000 mod7 is 6, so N \u22616(A-1) mod7.\n\nSimilarly for the others:\n\nChanging B to1: 1000A +100*1 +10C + D \u22610 mod7. So N - (B-1)*100 \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N \u2261(B-1)*100 mod7. Since 100 mod7 is 2, so N\u22612(B-1) mod7.\n\nSimilarly, changing C to1 gives N \u226110(C-1) mod7 (since 10 mod7 is3, so 3(C-1)), and changing D to1 gives N\u2261(D -1) mod7.\n\nThus, the four congruences are correct. So N must be congruent to each of these expressions mod7. Therefore, they must all be congruent to each other mod7, so:\n\n6(A -1) \u22612(B -1)\u22613(C -1)\u2261(D -1) mod7.\n\nTherefore, the equations are correct. So when K is set as N mod7, then all the expressions must be equal to K mod7. So K = N mod7, so all the expressions above must equal K mod7. Therefore, my previous steps are correct.\n\nBut when K=0, the digits A=8, B=8, C=8, D=8 gives N=8888, but when we check changing the first digit to 1, we get 1888, which is not divisible by7, which contradicts. So something is wrong here. Maybe my mistake is in the calculation of N mod7?\n\nWait, if K = N mod7, then N \u2261 K mod7. Let me compute N mod7 for N=8888:\n\n8888 divided by7. Let me compute 8888 \u00f77: 7*1269=8883, so 8888-8883=5 \u21d2 8888\u22615 mod7. Therefore K would be5 mod7. Wait, so if K is supposed to be N mod7, but in my earlier approach I set K=0, but in reality, N=8888 has K=5. Therefore, my mistake was in the initial assumption. The K here is N mod7, so for K=0, the number N must be \u22610 mod7. However, when I set K=0, I was choosing digits such that A\u22611 mod7, etc., but that would not necessarily make N\u22610 mod7. Wait, perhaps I messed up the substitution.\n\nWait let's clarify:\n\nLet me retrace:\n\nWe have four congruences:\n\n6(A -1) \u2261 K mod7,\n\n2(B -1) \u2261 K mod7,\n\n3(C -1) \u2261 K mod7,\n\n(D -1) \u2261 K mod7,\n\nand also N \u2261 K mod7.\n\nWait, so all those expressions must equal K mod7. But N itself must also be \u2261 K mod7. Therefore, the equations are:\n\n6(A-1) \u2261 K mod7,\n\n2(B-1)\u2261K mod7,\n\n3(C-1)\u2261K mod7,\n\n(D-1)\u2261K mod7,\n\nand also N \u2261 K mod7.\n\nTherefore, the first four equations define K in terms of the digits, but also N must \u2261 K mod7. Therefore, K must be consistent with N mod7. Therefore, perhaps the approach should be to first express each digit in terms of K, then ensure that when you compute N =1000A +100B +10C +D, then N mod7 = K.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the way I approached before was missing that N mod7 must also equal K, so there's an additional equation.\n\nAlternatively, since N mod7 is K, and also N is expressed as 1000A +100B +10C + D, so substituting the expressions for A,B,C,D in terms of K, we can write N mod7 in terms of K and set it equal to K mod7, thereby getting an equation for K.\n\nHmm, maybe that's the missing link.\n\nLet me try this approach. Let me express each digit in terms of K, then compute N mod7 and set it equal to K mod7. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, for each digit:\n\nA \u22616K +1 mod7 \u21d2 A =7a + (6K +1 mod7). But A must be between 1 and 9.\n\nSimilarly, B=7b + (4K +1 mod7), between0-9,\n\nC=7c + (5K +1 mod7), 0-9,\n\nD=7d + (K +1 mod7), 0-9,\n\nwhere a,b,c,d are integers such that the digits stay within their ranges.\n\nTherefore, the exact value of each digit can be written as:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nA = 7a + a0,\n\nwhere a0 = (6K +1) mod7,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nB =7b + b0,\n\nwhere b0 = (4K +1) mod7,\n\nC=7c + c0,\n\nc0=(5K +1) mod7,\n\nD=7d + d0,\n\nd0=(K +1) mod7.\n\nThus, the number N can be written as:\n\nN = 1000*(7a + a0) + 100*(7b + b0) +10*(7c +c0) + (7d +d0)\n\n= 7*(1000a + 100b +10c +d) + (1000a0 + 100b0 +10c0 +d0)\n\nTherefore, N mod7 is equal to (1000a0 + 100b0 +10c0 +d0) mod7,\n\nsince 7*(...) is 0 mod7.\n\nBut N \u2261 K mod7, so:\n\n(1000a0 + 100b0 +10c0 +d0) \u2261 K mod7.\n\nBut since a0, b0, c0, d0 are all functions of K, this gives an equation in K.\n\nTherefore, let's compute this expression mod7 for each K from 0 to6.\n\nLet me compute for each K from 0 to6:\n\nFirst, compute a0, b0, c0, d0 for each K:\n\nLet me make a table:\n\nFor K=0:\n\na0 = (6*0 +1) mod7=1 mod7 \u21d2 a0=1,\n\nb0=(4*0 +1)=1 mod7 \u21d21,\n\nc0=(5*0 +1)=1 mod7 \u21d21,\n\nd0=(0 +1)=1 mod7 \u21d21,\n\nThus, the expression 1000a0 +100b0 +10c0 +d0 = 1000*1 +100*1 +10*1 +1 = 1000 +100 +10 +1 =1111.\n\n1111 mod7: Let's compute:\n\n7*158=1106, so 1111-1106=5 \u21d2 1111\u22615 mod7.\n\nThus, the equation is 5 \u2261 K mod7 (since K=0 here). But 5\u22610 mod7? No, 5\u22615\u22600. Thus, inconsistency. Therefore, K=0 is invalid.\n\nWait that's a problem. So K=0 cannot be a solution because when K=0, the expression evaluates to 5 mod7, but K is supposed to be 0. Therefore, K=0 is invalid.\n\nHmm, so K must satisfy:\n\nFor each K, compute 1000a0 +100b0 +10c0 +d0 mod7 and set equal to K mod7.\n\nTherefore, let's compute this for each K from 0 to6:\n\nLet me compute each step:\n\nFirst, compute a0, b0, c0, d0 for each K:\n\nK=0:\n\na0=1, b0=1, c0=1, d0=1,\n\nExpression: 1000+100+10+1=1111\u22615 mod7. So 5\u22610? No.\n\nK=1:\n\na0=(6*1+1)=7\u22610 mod7 \u21d2a0=0,\n\nWait wait, wait:\n\nWait a0 is (6K +1) mod7. For K=1:\n\na0 =6*1 +1=7\u22610 mod7 \u21d2 a0=0,\n\nb0=4*1 +1=5 mod7 \u21d25,\n\nc0=5*1 +1=6 mod7 \u21d26,\n\nd0=1+1=2 mod7 \u21d22,\n\nThus expression:\n\n1000*a0 +100*b0 +10*c0 +d0 = 1000*0 +100*5 +10*6 +2 =0 +500 +60 +2=562.\n\n562 mod7: 7*80=560, so 562-560=2 \u21d2562\u22612 mod7.\n\nSet equal to K=1 \u21d2 2\u22611 mod7? No. Not valid.\n\nK=2:\n\na0=(6*2 +1)=13\u22616 mod7 \u21d26,\n\nb0=(4*2 +1)=9\u22612 mod7 \u21d22,\n\nc0=(5*2 +1)=11\u22614 mod7 \u21d24,\n\nd0=(2+1)=3 mod7 \u21d23,\n\nExpression:\n\n1000*6 +100*2 +10*4 +3 =6000 +200 +40 +3=6243.\n\n6243 mod7. Let me compute:\n\nDivide 6243 by7:\n\n7*891=6237, 6243-6237=6 \u21d26243\u22616 mod7.\n\nSet equal to K=2: 6\u22612? No.\n\nK=3:\n\na0=6*3 +1=19\u22615 mod7 (since 19-14=5),\n\nb0=4*3 +1=13\u22616 mod7,\n\nc0=5*3 +1=16\u22612 mod7,\n\nd0=3+1=4 mod7,\n\nExpression:\n\n1000*5 +100*6 +10*2 +4=5000+600+20+4=5624.\n\n5624 mod7:\n\n7*803=5621, 5624-5621=3 \u21d25624\u22613 mod7.\n\nSet equal to K=3 \u21d23\u22613. Yes! So K=3 is valid.\n\nProceeding.\n\nK=3 is a possible candidate.\n\nNow check K=4:\n\na0=6*4 +1=25\u22614 mod7 (25-21=4),\n\nb0=4*4 +1=17\u22613 mod7 (17-14=3),\n\nc0=5*4 +1=21\u22610 mod7,\n\nd0=4+1=5 mod7,\n\nExpression:\n\n1000*4 +100*3 +10*0 +5 =4000+300+0+5=4305.\n\n4305 mod7:\n\n7*615=4305 \u21d24305\u22610 mod7.\n\nSet equal to K=4 \u21d20\u22614 mod7? No.\n\nK=4 invalid.\n\nK=5:\n\na0=6*5 +1=31\u22613 mod7 (31-28=3),\n\nb0=4*5 +1=21\u22610 mod7,\n\nc0=5*5 +1=26\u22615 mod7 (26-21=5),\n\nd0=5+1=6 mod7,\n\nExpression:\n\n1000*3 +100*0 +10*5 +6=3000 +0 +50 +6=3056.\n\n3056 mod7:\n\n7*436=3052, 3056-3052=4 \u21d23056\u22614 mod7.\n\nSet equal to K=5 \u21d24\u22615 mod7? No.\n\nK=5 invalid.\n\nK=6:\n\na0=6*6 +1=37\u226137 mod7: 7*5=35, 37-35=2 \u21d22 mod7,\n\nb0=4*6 +1=25\u22614 mod7 (25-21=4),\n\nc0=5*6 +1=31\u22613 mod7 (31-28=3),\n\nd0=6+1=7\u22610 mod7,\n\nExpression:\n\n1000*2 +100*4 +10*3 +0=2000 +400 +30 +0=2430.\n\n2430 mod7:\n\n7*347=2429, so 2430\u22611 mod7.\n\nSet equal to K=6 \u21d21\u22616 mod7? No.\n\nThus, only K=3 satisfies the condition that the expression \u2261 K mod7.\n\nTherefore, the only valid K is K=3. Thus, we must have K=3.\n\nTherefore, now, with K=3, we can compute the digits A,B,C,D.\n\nRecall:\n\nA \u22616K +1 mod7 \u21d26*3+1=19\u22615 mod7 \u21d2a0=5,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nB\u22614K +1 mod7 \u21d24*3+1=13\u22616 mod7 \u21d2b0=6,\n\nC\u22615K +1 mod7 \u21d25*3+1=16\u22612 mod7 \u21d2c0=2,\n\nD\u2261K +1 mod7 \u21d23+1=4 mod7 \u21d2d0=4.\n\nTherefore, the digits are:\n\nA: must be \u22615 mod7. Since A is a digit from1-9, possible values are 5, 12 (but 12 is too big), so A=5 or 5+7=12 invalid. So only A=5? Wait wait, no:\n\nWait A is 7a + a0, where a0=5, so A can be 5, 5+7=12 (invalid), so only A=5? Wait but that would restrict A to 5. But perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait earlier, when I expressed A =7a + a0, where a0 is (6K+1) mod7. Since a0=5 here (for K=3), A can be 5, 12 (too big), so only 5. So A must be 5.\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\nB=7b +b0, where b0=6 (since b0=6 mod7). So possible B values: 6,13 (invalid), so B=6.\n\nC=7c +c0, c0=2 mod7 \u21d2 C can be 2 or 9 (2+7=9). Since we want maximum N, we should choose the largest possible digits. So for C, choose 9.\n\nSimilarly, D=7d +d0, d0=4 mod7 \u21d2 D can be 4, 11 (invalid), so only D=4. Wait 4+7=11, which is invalid, so D=4.\n\nWait but hold on:\n\nWait, for C: c0=2, so C can be 2, 9 (since 2+7=9). Since 9 is a valid digit (0-9), so C=9 is possible.\n\nSimilarly for B: b0=6 \u21d2 B=6 or 13 invalid, so only 6.\n\nFor D: d0=4 \u21d2 D=4 or 11 invalid, so D=4.\n\nFor A: a0=5 \u21d2 A=5 or 12 invalid, so A=5.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible digits are A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4 \u21d2 N=5694.\n\nWait but we need to check if this is the maximum possible. Let me see if there are higher digits possible by choosing different a,b,c,d coefficients. Wait but in the expressions above, A is 7a + a0, with a0=5. Since a must be an integer such that A is between 1-9, the only possible a is 0, giving A=5. Because if a=1, then 7*1 +5=12 which is too big. So A must be 5.\n\nSimilarly, B is 7b +6. The possible B digits:\n\nIf b=0 \u21d26,\n\nb=1 \u21d213 invalid, so only 6.\n\nC is 7c +2. To maximize C, set c=1 \u21d27+2=9,\n\nc=0 \u21d22,\n\nso 9 is the maximum.\n\nD is 7d +4. d=0 \u21d24,\n\nd=1 \u21d211 invalid. So D=4.\n\nTherefore, the maximum N possible with K=3 is 5694.\n\nBut wait, but we need the greatest four-digit number possible. Maybe there's a higher N with a different K? Wait but we saw that only K=3 works. So 5694 is the only candidate? Hmm, but perhaps I made a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, but let me verify if N=5694 actually satisfies the condition.\n\nCheck each digit change to 1:\n\n1. Change first digit (5) to 1: 1694. Check divisibility by7:\n\n1694 \u00f77: 7*242=1694. Exactly divisible. Good.\n\n2. Change second digit (6) to1: 5194.\n\n5194 \u00f77: 7*742=5194. Exactly divisible. Good.\n\n3. Change third digit (9) to1: 5614.\n\n5614 \u00f77: Let's compute 7*802=5614? 7*800=5600, plus 7*2=14 \u21d2 5614. Yes. So divisible.\n\n4. Change fourth digit (4) to1: 5691.\n\n5691 \u00f77: 7*813=5691 (7*800=5600, 7*13=91 \u21d2 total 5691). Yes, divisible.\n\nSo N=5694 works. But is there a higher N?\n\nWait, since K=3 is the only possible K, but maybe with different choices for the digits? For example, for C, we chose 9 (the maximum possible), but maybe there are other digits with higher values? Wait in this case, C can only be 2 or 9, so 9 is the max. Similarly for other digits.\n\nBut 5694 is the number. Wait, but is there a higher number with K=3? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps my mistake is in the calculation for K=3.\n\nWait let me check again for K=3, the digits:\n\nA must be \u22615 mod7. So A can be 5 or 12 (invalid). So only 5.\n\nB must be \u22616 mod7. So B=6 or 13 (invalid). So only 6.\n\nC must be \u22612 mod7. So C=2 or 9 (since 2+7=9). So 9 is the max.\n\nD must be \u22614 mod7. So D=4 or 11 (invalid). So 4 is only.\n\nThus, the maximum possible N is 5694. But 5694 is a four-digit number, but maybe there is a larger number where digits can be higher but still satisfy the congruences?\n\nWait, but according to the constraints from K=3, those are the only possibilities. Hmm.\n\nWait but maybe I made a mistake in assuming that a0, b0, etc. must be exactly the residues. Let me check again.\n\nWait the equations are:\n\nA \u22616K +1 mod7,\n\nBut A is a digit from1-9. So A can be any number \u2261 (6K+1) mod7, but not necessarily exactly equal to (6K+1). For example, for K=3, 6*3+1=19\u22615 mod7, so A must \u22615 mod7. So A can be 5 or 12, but 12 is too big, so only 5. So that's correct.\n\nWait but is there a way to have a higher digit? For example, if A is allowed to be higher by adding 7? But that would go over 9. So no.\n\nSimilarly for B, which must be \u22616 mod7. So 6 or 13, but 13 is too big, so only 6.\n\nHmm. So 5694 is the only possible N for K=3.\n\nBut 5694 is a four-digit number, but the problem asks for the greatest four-digit number with this property. So maybe 5694 is the answer? Wait, but 5694 is not the largest four-digit number. Maybe there is a higher number?\n\nWait, but according to the constraints, only K=3 works, so perhaps 5694 is the maximum. But let me see if there is a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for K=3's expression. Let me recheck.\n\nWhen K=3:\n\nThe expression 1000a0 + 100b0 +10c0 +d0 where a0=5, b0=6, c0=2, d0=4.\n\nWait, 1000*5 +100*6 +10*2 +4 = 5000 +600 +20 +4 =5624.\n\nWait earlier I computed this as 5624 mod7 \u22613 mod7, which matches K=3. So that's correct.\n\nWait but then when I constructed the number N=5694, how does that relate?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that when we write N=1000A +100B +10C +D, with A,B,C,D as 5,6,9,4, then N=5694. But according to the earlier expression, the minimal N would be 5624 (from the expression with a0,b0,c0,d0). But we can choose higher digits by adding multiples of7 to each digit (as long as they stay within 0-9 for B,C,D and 1-9 for A). So for example, A is 5 mod7, so the next possible A is 5+7=12 which is invalid. So A must stay at 5. B is 6 mod7, so next is 13 invalid. C is 2 mod7, so can be 2 or 9. We choose 9. D is4 mod7, so only 4. So the maximum possible is indeed 5694. So that's the maximum.\n\nBut 5694 seems low for the greatest four-digit number. Maybe there's an error in my approach?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that when setting the digits to their maximum possible values under the congruence, but also allowing the other digits to be as high as possible. Wait, let's see.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let me try to find the maximum N by starting from 9999 and going downward, checking the condition. Since the problem might have a higher number than 5694.\n\nLet me test N=9999:\n\nCheck changing each digit to1:\n\n1) 1999: 1999 \u00f77. 7*285=1995, 1999-1995=4 \u21d2 remainder4 \u21d2 not divisible.\n\nAlready fails. So 9999 invalid.\n\nNext, 9998:\n\nChange first digit to1: 1998. 1998 \u00f77: 7*285=1995, 1998-1995=3 \u21d2 no.\n\nSimilarly, any number starting with 9 will fail when changing first digit to1 unless 1BCD is divisible by7. But 1BCD is a four-digit number starting with1, so between 1000-1999. The maximum such number divisible by7 is 1995 (7*285). So to have 1BCD divisible by7, the number after changing first digit must be \u22641995. But original N is 9999, so changing first digit to1 gives 1999 which is higher than1995 \u21d2 not divisible. So any number with A=9 will fail when changing first digit to1, since 1 followed by the other digits would be 1BCD which is over 1995. Wait, unless B,C,D are smaller?\n\nWait but if the original number is 9XYZ, changing the first digit to1 gives 1XYZ. To have 1XYZ divisible by7, then 1XYZ must be divisible by7. But 1XYZ can be as high as 1999, but to be divisible by7, it must be 1995 or less. So if XYZ is such that 1XYZ is divisible by7, but original number is 9XYZ. But the problem is that for the number to satisfy the condition, changing any digit to1 must result in divisible by7, so even the first digit. So for N=9XYZ, 1XYZ must be divisible by7. So 1XYZ \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 XYZ \u2261-1000 mod7. Since 1000\u22616 mod7, so XYZ \u2261-6 mod7 \u21d2 XYZ\u22611 mod7 (since -6 mod7 is1).\n\nSimilarly, changing other digits must also result in divisible numbers. But this approach might take too long. Alternatively, since my previous method yielded N=5694 as the only possible number with K=3, maybe that is indeed the maximum?\n\nWait but let me check with K=3, if there is a higher N possible with different digit choices. For instance, if we can choose a higher digit for A by taking a different residue?\n\nWait A must be \u22615 mod7. The next possible A above 5 would be 12, which is invalid. So A must be 5. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed another K?\n\nWait when I checked K=0 to6, only K=3 worked. So that must be the only possibility. Therefore, the maximum N is 5694. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me test another number. Let's try 5714.\n\nWait, let me see. Suppose N=5714.\n\nCheck the conditions:\n\nChanging first digit to1:1714. 1714 \u00f77: 7*245=1715 \u21d2 1714 is 1 less \u21d2 remainder6. Not divisible. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 5714 is not constructed properly.\n\nWait going back, maybe I made a mistake in the K=3 calculation. Let me check N=5694 again:\n\nChanging third digit (9) to1:5614. 5614 \u00f77= 5614/7=802 exactly. Yes.\n\nChanging second digit (6) to1:5194. 5194/7=742, exactly.\n\nChanging first digit (5) to1:1694/7=242, exactly.\n\nChanging fourth digit (4) to1:5691/7=813, exactly. So yes, it works.\n\nIs there a larger N?\n\nSuppose I try 6394. Let me see:\n\nWait but according to the constraints, A must be 5 mod7. So 6 mod7 is 6, which isn't 5 mod7. So 6 would not satisfy the congruence for A.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's another number with higher thousands digit. Let's suppose A=6. Then, for A=6, which is 6 mod7. Let's see what K would that require.\n\nFrom the equation A \u22616K +1 mod7 \u21d26 \u22616K +1 mod7 \u21d26K\u22615 mod7 \u21d26K\u22615 mod7 \u21d2Multiply both sides by 6^{-1}=6 \u21d2K\u22615*6=30\u22612 mod7.\n\nSo K\u22612 mod7. Let's see if K=2 is valid.\n\nWait earlier when K=2, the equation gave us inconsistency, but let's check again.\n\nWait for K=2:\n\nThe expression 1000a0 + ... \u22616 mod7, which should equal K=2. Wait no, earlier when K=2, the expression mod7 was 6, which should equal K=2 \u21d26\u22612 mod7 \u21d2invalid. So K=2 is invalid. Therefore, A=6 would require K=2 which is invalid. So no.\n\nSimilarly, trying A=7:\n\nA=7. Then,\n\nA\u22617 mod7=0\u22616K +1 mod7 \u21d26K +1 \u22610 mod7 \u21d26K\u2261-1\u22616 mod7 \u21d2K\u22611 mod7 (since 6/6=1 mod7? Wait 6K\u22616 mod7 \u21d2 divide both sides by6: K\u22611 mod7.\n\nSo K=1. Let's see K=1:\n\nFor K=1, we had the expression mod7=2, which should equal K=1 \u21d2 invalid. So no.\n\nA=4:\n\nA=4. Then,\n\n4\u22616K +1 mod7 \u21d26K\u22613 mod7 \u21d2K\u22613*6^{-1} mod7 \u21d26^{-1}=6 \u21d23*6=18\u22614 mod7 \u21d2K=4.\n\nCheck K=4:\n\nFor K=4, the expression mod7 was0, but K=4 \u21d20\u22614 mod7 \u21d2invalid.\n\nA=3:\n\nA=3 \u21d23\u22616K+1 \u21d26K\u22612 \u21d2K\u22612*6^{-1}=2*6=12\u22615 mod7 \u21d2K=5.\n\nCheck K=5:\n\nExpression mod7=4 vs K=5 \u21d2 no.\n\nA=2:\n\nA=2 \u21d22\u22616K+1 \u21d26K\u22611 \u21d2K\u22611*6^{-1}=6 mod7 \u21d2K=6.\n\nCheck K=6:\n\nExpression mod7=1 vs K=6 \u21d21\u22616 \u21d2 no.\n\nA=1:\n\nA=1 \u21d21\u22616K+1 \u21d26K\u22610 \u21d2K\u22610 mod7 \u21d2K=0.\n\nCheck K=0:\n\nExpression mod7=5 vs K=0 \u21d2 no.\n\nTherefore, only when A=5 (which requires K=3) is valid, giving N=5694.\n\nTherefore, indeed 5694 is the only possible number. Thus, the answer should be N=5694.\n\nWait but 5694 divided by1000 is 5 with remainder 694. Therefore Q=5 and R=694 \u21d2 Q+R=5+694=699.\n\nBut before finalizing, let me check if there is another number higher than 5694 that could satisfy the conditions. Let me see:\n\nSuppose there is a number like 6394. Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, A must be 5. So any number with A>5 would require an invalid K. So the thousands digit can't be higher than5.\n\nWait, but what if there is a number where the thousands digit is 5, but the hundreds digit is higher than6? Let me see.\n\nWait in the K=3 case, B must be \u22616 mod7. So B can only be 6 or 13 (invalid). So B=6 is maximum.\n\nSimilarly, C can be 9, which is the maximum possible for C\u22612 mod7.\n\nD is 4.\n\nTherefore, 5694 is indeed the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe choosing different digits with the same congruence but different values? For example, C can be 2 or9. If we choose C=2 instead of9, then the number would be smaller (5624). So 5694 is the largest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Q + R =5 +694=699.\n\nWait, but just to confirm once more with another example. Suppose N=5694. Then Q=5, R=694. 5+694=699. So the final answer is 699. But let me check once more if 5694 is indeed the maximum.\n\nWait, what if there is a number like 5714? Let me see:\n\nWait, but A=5 is okay. Let me see if such a number could exist. Let me check if 5714 can satisfy the conditions.\n\nChanging first digit to1:1714. 1714/7=244.857\u2026 Not integer. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another number like 5700-something. But since the digits must follow the congruences, probably not.\n\nAlternatively, suppose someone constructs another number with A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4, which is 5694, which works. There's no higher four-digit number with A=5 and the other digits at their maximum under the constraints. So I think that is indeed the maximum.\n\nThus, the final answer should be 5+694=699.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{699}\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \\( N \\) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully to make sure I understand what's being asked. \n\nThe problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, we need to find Q and R, which are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000, and finally compute Q + R. The answer should be in a box at the end. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, N is a four-digit number, the largest possible such that if you change any single digit to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is ABCD (where A, B, C, D are digits), then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, which must be divisible by 7; changing B to 1 gives A1CD, also divisible by 7; same for changing C to 1 (AB1D) and D to 1 (ABC1). All four of those numbers must be divisible by 7. And we need the largest such N possible. Then, once we find N, we divide it by 1000, which would give Q as the first digit (since 1000 divides into four-digit numbers once, with the quotient being the thousands digit), and R as the last three digits. Then Q + R is the sum we need.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, I need to find the largest four-digit number N such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nSince N is a four-digit number, let's denote it as N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, with a \u2260 0. Since we want the greatest such N, we should start checking from 9999 downwards until we find such a number. But doing this manually would be tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nThe key is the condition: changing any digit to 1 must make the number divisible by 7. Let's consider each digit position:\n\n1. Changing the thousands digit (a) to 1: the number becomes 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.\n\n2. Changing the hundreds digit (b) to 1: the number becomes 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. Must be divisible by 7.\n\n3. Changing the tens digit (c) to 1: the number becomes 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. Divisible by 7.\n\n4. Changing the units digit (d) to 1: the number becomes 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Also divisible by 7.\n\nSo, for each of these four modified numbers, they must be divisible by 7. Let me write these four conditions as equations modulo 7.\n\nLet me denote the original number N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Then:\n\n1. When changing a to 1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \u2261 0 mod7.\n\n2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \u2261 0 mod7.\n\n3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \u2261 0 mod7.\n\n4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c +1 \u2261 0 mod7.\n\nSo, each of these four expressions must be congruent to 0 mod7. Let me see if I can express these equations in terms of N and the original digits.\n\nFirst, note that N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Let me see:\n\nFor equation 1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = N - 1000(a - 1). Because the original N has 1000a, so subtracting 1000(a -1) would replace a with 1. Therefore, equation 1 can be written as:\n\nN - 1000(a - 1) \u2261 0 mod7 \u21d2 N \u2261 1000(a -1) mod7.\n\nSimilarly, equation 2: Changing b to 1 gives 1000a + 100 + 10c + d = N - 100(b -1). So:\n\nN - 100(b -1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N \u2261 100(b -1) mod7.\n\nEquation 3: Changing c to 1: N - 10(c -1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N \u226110(c -1) mod7.\n\nEquation 4: Changing d to1: N - (d -1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N \u2261 (d -1) mod7.\n\nTherefore, all four congruences must hold:\n\n1. N \u2261 1000(a -1) mod7,\n\n2. N \u2261 100(b -1) mod7,\n\n3. N \u2261 10(c -1) mod7,\n\n4. N \u2261 (d -1) mod7.\n\nHmm, so these four congruences must all be true. Since N is congruent to each of these expressions mod7, all four expressions must be congruent to each other mod7. Therefore, 1000(a -1) \u2261 100(b -1) \u2261 10(c -1) \u2261 (d -1) mod7.\n\nTherefore, all of these expressions must be equal modulo7. Let me note that 1000 mod7, 100 mod7, 10 mod7, and 1 mod7 can be precomputed to simplify.\n\nFirst, compute 1000 mod7. Let's see, 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994 = 6 \u21d2 1000 \u22616 mod7.\n\nSimilarly, 100 mod7: 7*14=98, so 100 -98=2 \u21d2 100\u22612 mod7.\n\n10 mod7 is 3, since 7+3=10.\n\n1 mod7 is 1.\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\n1. N \u2261 6(a -1) mod7,\n\n2. N \u2261 2(b -1) mod7,\n\n3. N \u22613(c -1) mod7,\n\n4. N \u2261(d -1) mod7.\n\nTherefore, all four right-hand sides must be equal mod7. Let me write them as equations:\n\n6(a -1) \u2261 2(b -1) mod7,\n\n6(a -1) \u22613(c -1) mod7,\n\n6(a -1) \u2261 (d -1) mod7,\n\nand also 2(b -1) \u22613(c -1) mod7,\n\n2(b -1) \u2261 (d -1) mod7,\n\n3(c -1) \u2261 (d -1) mod7,\n\nBut perhaps starting with the first three equations:\n\nEquation1 and Equation2: 6(a -1) \u2261 2(b -1) mod7 \u21d2 6a -6 \u22612b -2 mod7 \u21d26a -2b -4 \u22610 mod7 \u21d26a -2b \u22614 mod7.\n\nEquation1 and Equation3: 6(a -1) \u22613(c -1) mod7 \u21d26a -6 \u22613c -3 mod7 \u21d26a -3c -3 \u22610 mod7 \u21d26a -3c \u22613 mod7 \u21d2Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime, division is allowed): 2a -c \u22611 mod7.\n\nEquation1 and Equation4: 6(a -1) \u2261 (d -1) mod7 \u21d26a -6 \u2261d -1 mod7 \u21d26a -d -5 \u22610 mod7 \u21d26a - d \u22615 mod7.\n\nSo now we have three equations:\n\n1. 6a -2b \u22614 mod7,\n\n2. 2a -c \u22611 mod7,\n\n3. 6a -d \u22615 mod7,\n\nAdditionally, we can get more equations from the other pairs if needed, but maybe starting with these three.\n\nOur variables are a, b, c, d, each digits (a from 1-9, others 0-9). We need to find the largest N = 1000a + 100b +10c +d, so we need to maximize a first, then b, etc.\n\nSo perhaps starting with a=9, since we want the largest N. Let me try a=9 first.\n\nLet me set a=9. Let's see if possible.\n\nFirst, equation 2: 2a -c \u22611 mod7 \u21d22*9 -c \u22611 mod7 \u21d218 -c \u22611 mod7 \u21d218 mod7 is 4 (since 14 is 2*7, so 18-14=4). So 4 -c \u22611 mod7 \u21d2 -c \u2261 -3 mod7 \u21d2c \u22613 mod7. Since c is a digit (0-9), possible c=3 or 10, but 10 is invalid. So c=3 or 10, but 10 is not a digit, so c=3 or 3+7=10 (invalid). So only c=3.\n\nWait, but 4 -c \u22611 mod7 \u21d2 (4 -1) \u2261c mod7 \u21d2c\u22613 mod7. So c can be 3 or 10, but 10 is not allowed, so c must be 3.\n\nSo c=3.\n\nThen equation1: 6a -2b \u22614 mod7 with a=9.\n\n6*9 =54; 54 mod7: 7*7=49, so 54-49=5 \u21d254 \u22615 mod7.\n\nThus equation1: 5 -2b \u22614 mod7 \u21d2-2b \u2261 -1 mod7 \u21d22b \u22611 mod7. So 2b \u22611 mod7. The inverse of 2 mod7 is 4 because 2*4=8\u22611 mod7. So multiplying both sides by 4: b\u22614*1\u22614 mod7. Thus b can be 4 or 11, but 11 is too big. So b=4 or 4+7=11 (invalid). So only b=4.\n\nSo b=4.\n\nEquation3:6a -d \u22615 mod7. Again, 6a=54\u22615 mod7 as before. So 5 -d \u22615 mod7 \u21d2 -d \u22610 mod7 \u21d2d\u22610 mod7. So d must be 0 or7. Since d is a digit (0-9). So possible d=0 or7. Since we want the largest N, we should choose d=7 (since 7 is larger than 0). Wait, but let me confirm.\n\nWait, if d is 7, then the units digit is 7, which is higher than 0, so yes, to maximize N, we want d as large as possible. So d=7.\n\nSo with a=9, b=4, c=3, d=7. Let's check if this works.\n\nWait, but before we proceed, let me check all equations:\n\nFirst, equation1: 6a -2b =6*9 -2*4=54-8=46. 46 mod7: 7*6=42, 46-42=4. Which matches the RHS 4 mod7. Good.\n\nEquation2: 2a -c =18 -3=15. 15 mod7 is 1 (14+1). So 15\u22611 mod7. Correct.\n\nEquation3:6a -d =54-7=47. 47 mod7: 7*6=42, 47-42=5. So 5\u22615 mod7. Correct.\n\nSo that works. Now, we need to check if changing each digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7. Let me verify each case.\n\nFirst, changing the thousands digit (a=9 to 1):\n\nThe new number is 1 4 3 7 =1437. Let's divide by 7: 1437 \u00f77. 7*200=1400, 1437-1400=37. 37\u00f77 is 5*7=35, remainder 2. Wait, 37-35=2, so 1437 mod7 is 2. That's not divisible by 7. Hmm, that's a problem. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, but according to the equations, it should be divisible. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let's recalculate. Maybe I miscalculated 1437 \u00f77.\n\nLet me compute 7*205=1435. So 1437-1435=2. So yes, remainder 2. Not divisible. Hmm, so that's an issue. That means my assumption was wrong? But according to the equations, it should be congruent to 0 mod7.\n\nWait, let me check the equations again.\n\nWait, the equations were set up as N \u2261 expressions mod7, but perhaps I messed up the setup.\n\nWait, let me retrace. The first condition: changing the thousands digit to 1 gives the number 1BCD, which must be divisible by7. So that number is 1000 + 100b +10c +d. Then according to the first equation, N - 1000(a-1) \u22610 mod7, so N \u22611000(a-1) mod7. \n\nWait, but N =1000a + 100b +10c +d. So 1BCD is N -1000(a-1). So that's correct.\n\nBut substituting the values, with a=9, b=4, c=3, d=7:\n\nN = 9437. Then 1BCD is 1437. 1437 mod7: let me check again.\n\nWait 7*200=1400. 1437-1400=37. 37/7 is 5*7=35, so 37-35=2. So remainder 2. So that's not 0 mod7. Which contradicts the condition.\n\nHmm, so that means there's an error in my reasoning. Let me check where.\n\nWait, perhaps my equations are wrong. Let's see. The first equation was N \u2261 1000(a-1) mod7. Let me compute N mod7 and 1000(a-1) mod7.\n\nFirst, N=9437. Let's compute N mod7. 9437 divided by7:\n\n7*1348=9436, so 9437 mod7 is 1.\n\nNow, 1000(a-1) =1000*(9-1)=1000*8=8000. 8000 mod7: since 1000 mod7 is 6, so 8000 mod7 is 6*8 mod7. 6*8=48 mod7 is 48-42=6. So 8000 mod7 is6. So according to the equation N \u22616 mod7, but N mod7 is 1. Which is not congruent. Therefore, the equations are conflicting here. So my mistake must be in setting up the equations.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the equations. Let me go back step by step.\n\nOriginal setup: When changing the thousands digit to 1, the new number is 1 followed by the other digits. So that number is 1000*1 + 100b +10c +d. So the difference between N and this number is N - (1000 + 100b +10c +d) = 1000(a -1). Therefore, N - (new number) = 1000(a -1). Therefore, the new number = N - 1000(a-1). \n\nTherefore, the new number \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N -1000(a-1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N \u22611000(a-1) mod7. So that part is correct.\n\nBut in this case, N mod7 is 1, 1000(a-1)=8000 mod7 is 6. So 1\u22616 mod7? No, so that's a problem. So my equations must have been set up incorrectly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my mistake is in the direction of the equation. Wait, actually, the new number is equal to N minus 1000(a -1). So the new number is N - [1000(a -1)]. Therefore, to have the new number divisible by7, we need N -1000(a -1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N \u22611000(a -1) mod7. So that is correct. But in the case above, N mod7 is 1, and 1000*(a-1) mod7 is6, so 1\u22616 mod7? Not true. Therefore, the equations must not hold here, but according to my previous steps, they were supposed to. So my mistake must have been in solving the equations. Let me check again.\n\nStarting over with a=9:\n\nEquation1:6(a-1) \u22612(b -1) mod7.\n\nWait, let me recast all equations again:\n\nEquation1: 6(a -1) \u22612(b -1) mod7,\n\nEquation2:6(a -1)\u22613(c -1) mod7,\n\nEquation3:6(a -1)\u2261(d -1) mod7,\n\nAdditionally, equations from other pairs, but let's see.\n\nSo for a=9,\n\nEquation1: 6*(9-1)=6*8=48 mod7. 48 mod7 is 48-6*7=48-42=6 mod7. So 6 \u22612*(b-1) mod7 \u21d2 2*(b-1)\u22616 mod7 \u21d2 (b-1)\u22613 mod7 (since 2*3=6). So b-1\u22613 \u21d2b\u22614 mod7. So b can be 4 or 11, but b is a digit, so only 4. So that part is correct.\n\nEquation2:6*(9-1)=48\u22616 mod7. So 6\u22613*(c -1) mod7 \u21d23*(c -1)\u22616 mod7 \u21d2c -1\u22612 mod7 (since 3*2=6 mod7). So c -1=2 \u21d2c=3 mod7. Thus c=3 or 10 (invalid), so c=3. Correct.\n\nEquation3:6*(9-1)=48\u22616 mod7. So 6\u2261(d -1) mod7 \u21d2d -1\u22616 \u21d2d\u22617 mod7. So d\u22610 mod7. Wait, hold on: 6\u2261d-1 mod7 \u21d2d-1=6 mod7 \u21d2d\u22617 mod7 \u21d2d\u22610 mod7. So d must be 0 or 7. Because 7 mod7 is 0. Wait, yes. So d can be 0 or7. So I thought that, so choosing d=7 gives d=7. But 7 mod7 is 0, so d-1=6 mod7, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, equations are correct. But when we plug back into N mod7, we have N=9437. Let me compute N mod7 again.\n\nLet me compute 9437 divided by7 step by step.\n\n7*1000=7000, so 9437-7000=2437.\n\n7*300=2100, so 2437-2100=337.\n\n7*48=336, so 337-336=1. So total is 1000+300+48=1348, remainder 1. So 9437 mod7 is indeed 1. However, according to equation1, N should be congruent to 6 mod7 (since 1000(a-1)=8000\u22616 mod7). But 1\u22616 mod7? That's a contradiction. So my mistake must be somewhere else.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe the equations are set up incorrectly. Let me check the equations again.\n\nWait, the first equation is N \u22611000(a -1) mod7. But when a=9, that would be 1000*(8)=8000 mod7, which is 6 mod7. But N mod7 is 1. So that's a conflict. Therefore, this means that with a=9, there is no solution? But according to the equations above, the values of b,c,d satisfy the equations. So maybe my equations are wrong?\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe my mistake was in how I set up the equations. Let me rederive them.\n\nLet me start over with the four conditions:\n\nChanging the thousands digit to 1: the new number is 1XYZ, which must be divisible by7. So 1000 + 100b +10c +d \u22610 mod7.\n\nSimilarly, changing hundreds digit to1: a1CD must be divisible by7: 1000a +100 +10c +d \u22610 mod7.\n\nChanging tens digit to1: AB1D must be divisible by7: 1000a +100b +10 +d \u22610 mod7.\n\nChanging units digit to1: ABC1 must be divisible by7: 1000a +100b +10c +1 \u22610 mod7.\n\nSo these are four separate congruences. Let me write them as:\n\n1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \u22610 mod7,\n\n2. 1000a + 100 +10c +d \u22610 mod7,\n\n3. 1000a +100b +10 +d \u22610 mod7,\n\n4. 1000a +100b +10c +1 \u22610 mod7.\n\nNow, let me subtract equation1 from equation2:\n\nEquation2 - Equation1: (1000a +100 +10c +d) - (1000 +100b +10c +d) = 1000(a -1) -100(b -1) \u22610 mod7.\n\nTherefore, 1000(a -1) -100(b -1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d21000(a-1) \u2261100(b-1) mod7.\n\nSimilarly, equation2 - equation3: Let me see, but perhaps better to do each pair.\n\nAlternatively, let me express each equation in terms of N.\n\nLet me write N = 1000a +100b +10c +d.\n\nThen equation1: 1000 + 100b +10c +d = N -1000(a -1). So equation1: N -1000(a -1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N \u22611000(a-1) mod7.\n\nSimilarly equation2: N -100(b -1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N\u2261100(b-1) mod7,\n\nequation3: N -10(c -1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N\u226110(c-1) mod7,\n\nequation4: N - (d -1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N\u2261(d -1) mod7.\n\nSo these four congruences must hold. Therefore, all four expressions 1000(a-1), 100(b-1), 10(c-1), (d-1) must be congruent mod7.\n\nTherefore, 1000(a-1) \u2261100(b-1) \u226110(c-1)\u2261(d-1) mod7.\n\nSo in the case of a=9, we have:\n\n1000(a-1)=1000*8=8000\u22616 mod7,\n\n100(b-1)=100*(4-1)=100*3=300 mod7. Wait, 100 mod7 is 2, so 100*(b-1)=2*(b-1). Wait, maybe better to compute 100*(b-1) mod7. Since 100\u22612 mod7, so 100*(b-1)\u22612*(b-1) mod7. \n\nWait, so for a=9, b=4, then 100(b-1)=100*3=300. 300 mod7: 7*42=294, 300-294=6 \u21d2 6 mod7. So 6 mod7, which matches 1000(a-1)=6 mod7. So that's okay.\n\nThen 10(c-1)=10*(3-1)=20 mod7. 20 mod7=6. So also 6 mod7. Okay.\n\nThen (d-1)=7-1=6 mod7. So 6 mod7. Therefore, all four expressions are congruent mod7. So the equations are satisfied. But then why is N mod7=1, but 1000(a-1)=6 mod7?\n\nWait, because N \u22616 mod7? Wait N mod7 should be equal to 6 mod7. Wait but N=9437 mod7 is 1. Wait that contradicts.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Wait, let's compute N mod7 again. Maybe I made an error.\n\nCompute N=9437 mod7:\n\nLet me use another method. 9000 mod7: 7*1285=9000-7*1285. Wait, maybe better to break down 9437:\n\n9437 divided by 7:\n\n7 \u00d7 1348 = 9436. So 9437 =7\u00d71348 +1. Therefore, mod7 it's 1. So N mod7 is 1, but according to the equation, N should be congruent to 6 mod7. Therefore, something is wrong here.\n\nWait, so even though all the expressions 1000(a-1), 100(b-1), etc., are congruent mod7, the problem is that the equations set N \u2261 that value mod7. So if they are all congruent to 6 mod7, then N must be 6 mod7. But N is 1 mod7. So that means that with a=9, the equations are not satisfied. So perhaps my mistake was in assuming that when solving the equations, they are compatible? Wait, but when I set up the equations, I had:\n\nEquation1: N \u22616 mod7,\n\nEquation2: N\u22612*(b-1) mod7. With b=4, that is 2*3=6 mod7,\n\nEquation3: N\u226110*(c-1)=10*2=20\u22616 mod7,\n\nEquation4: N\u2261d-1=6 mod7.\n\nTherefore, all equations require that N\u22616 mod7, but N=9437\u22611 mod7. So there is a contradiction here. Therefore, my mistake must be in the algebra steps when I set up the equations? Wait, but how?\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made an error in substituting N into the equations. Wait, equation1 says N \u22611000(a-1) mod7. So with a=9, N must be \u22616 mod7, but N is actually 9437\u22611 mod7. Therefore, this is impossible. So even though the values of b,c,d satisfy the equations derived from equating the congruences, the actual N does not satisfy the original condition because the congruence N\u22616 mod7 isn't met. Therefore, there must be an error in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps my mistake was in how I solved the equations. Let me see.\n\nStarting over with a=9:\n\nEquation1: 6(a-1) \u22612(b-1) mod7 \u21d26*8=48\u22616 mod7. So 6\u22612(b-1) mod7 \u21d22(b-1)\u22616 \u21d2b-1\u22613 \u21d2b=4. Correct.\n\nEquation2: 6(a-1)\u22613(c-1) mod7 \u21d26\u22613(c-1) \u21d2c-1\u22612 \u21d2c=3. Correct.\n\nEquation3:6(a-1)\u2261(d-1) mod7 \u21d26\u2261d-1 \u21d2d=7. Correct.\n\nBut then N=9437\u22611 mod7, but according to equation1, N should be \u22616 mod7. Therefore, contradiction. So the problem is that even though the equations between variables are satisfied, the actual value of N mod7 is not matching the required congruence. \n\nThis suggests that there is no solution when a=9. Therefore, even though the variables b,c,d satisfy the relations between them, the value of N itself does not satisfy N\u2261 required mod7. So my mistake was in thinking that solving for b,c,d would automatically satisfy N\u2261 those expressions mod7. But actually, the equations only ensure that the expressions involving the variables are congruent, but N must also be congruent to that value mod7. Wait, but the equations are N \u2261 each of those expressions mod7. Therefore, if all those expressions are congruent mod7, then N can be set to that value mod7. But in this case, they are congruent, so N must be equal to that value mod7, but when we plug in the digits, it's not. Therefore, the problem is that even though the variables satisfy the relations between them, the actual number N mod7 is not equal to the required congruence. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that my approach is missing something. Perhaps I need to set N \u2261 k mod7 where k is the common value of all those expressions, so k=6 mod7 in this case, so N must be 6 mod7. However, N=9437 is 1 mod7, so that's a conflict. Therefore, even if the equations are satisfied, the actual number N mod7 must be set to k. Therefore, perhaps we need an additional equation: N mod7 must equal k, where k is the common value. \n\nWait, but how do we ensure that? Let me think. Since all four expressions (1000(a-1), 100(b-1), etc.) must equal k mod7, and N \u2261k mod7. Therefore, if we set N mod7=k, then the equations are satisfied. But when we choose a,b,c,d such that the expressions are equal to k mod7, but then N's actual mod7 might not be k. Therefore, we need to enforce that N mod7 =k. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the equations should also include that N mod7=k, where k is the common value. Since k=1000(a-1) mod7, which is 6(a-1) mod7 (since 1000\u22616 mod7). \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLet me denote k = 1000(a-1) mod7 =6(a-1) mod7,\n\nand also k=2(b-1) mod7,\n\nk=3(c-1) mod7,\n\nk=(d-1) mod7,\n\nand also N \u2261k mod7.\n\nBut N is equal to 1000a +100b +10c +d. So N mod7 is equal to (1000a mod7 + 100b mod7 +10c mod7 +d mod7).\n\nSince 1000\u22616, 100\u22612, 10\u22613 mod7,\n\nTherefore, N mod7 \u22616a + 2b +3c +d mod7.\n\nTherefore, we have another equation:\n\n6a +2b +3c +d \u2261k mod7,\n\nBut k is equal to 6(a-1) mod7,\n\nTherefore, substituting k=6(a-1) mod7,\n\nThus,\n\n6a +2b +3c +d \u22616(a -1) mod7 \u21d2\n\n6a +2b +3c +d \u22616a -6 mod7 \u21d2\n\n2b +3c +d \u2261 -6 mod7 \u21d2\n\n2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7 (since -6 mod7 is 1).\n\nTherefore, this is an additional equation that must hold.\n\nAh! So I missed this equation. The previous equations ensure that all the expressions are equal to k mod7, but we also need N itself to be equal to k mod7. Therefore, the equation 2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7 must hold. \n\nTherefore, in the case when a=9, b=4, c=3, d=7:\n\nCompute 2b +3c +d =2*4 +3*3 +7=8+9+7=24. 24 mod7 is 24-3*7=24-21=3 mod7. But we needed this to be 1 mod7. 3\u22601 mod7. So that's the problem. So even though the other equations are satisfied, this equation is not. Therefore, the solution with a=9, b=4, c=3, d=7 is invalid. \n\nTherefore, we need to include this additional equation: 2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7. \n\nTherefore, to solve this correctly, we need to not only have the equations between a,b,c,d but also this equation. \n\nTherefore, let's retrace with this in mind.\n\nGiven that a=9, let's try again.\n\nWe had earlier:\n\nFrom equations:\n\n1. 6(a-1) \u22612(b-1) mod7,\n\n2. 6(a-1)\u22613(c -1) mod7,\n\n3.6(a-1)\u2261(d -1) mod7,\n\nand the additional equation:\n\n4. 2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7.\n\nWith a=9,\n\nEquation1: 6*(8) \u226148\u22616 mod7 \u21d22(b-1)\u22616 \u21d2b-1\u22613 \u21d2b=4.\n\nEquation2: 6\u22613(c-1) \u21d2c-1\u22612 \u21d2c=3.\n\nEquation3:6\u2261d-1 \u21d2d=7.\n\nNow, plug into equation4: 2*4 +3*3 +7 =8+9+7=24\u22613 mod7. Which is not 1 mod7. So invalid. \n\nSo we need to adjust the variables so that equation4 holds. Since we need 2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7. Let's see if there are other possible values of b,c,d that satisfy the first three equations but also this fourth equation. \n\nBut from the first three equations, given a=9, we had:\n\nb=4 mod7,\n\nc=3 mod7,\n\nd=0 or7 mod7 (since d\u22611 mod7? Wait, no. Wait, from equation3: d-1\u22616 mod7 \u21d2d\u22617 mod7 \u21d2d\u22610 mod7. So d must be 0 or7. \n\nTherefore, possible d=0 or7. Let me see if changing d to 0 would help.\n\nWait, if d=0, then equation4: 2b +3c +0 \u22611 mod7. \n\nWith b=4, c=3, that gives 2*4 +3*3=8+9=17\u22613 mod7. Still 3\u22613\u22601 mod7. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe b can be different? Wait, but from equation1, b must be \u22614 mod7. Since b is a digit, it can be 4 or 11, but 11 is invalid. So only 4. So b must be 4. Similarly c must be 3 mod7 \u21d23 or 10, but 10 invalid. So c=3. And d must be 0 or7. \n\nTherefore, no solutions with a=9. Therefore, a=9 is impossible.\n\nSo we need to try a=8.\n\nLet me try a=8.\n\nProceeding similarly:\n\nFirst, set a=8. Let's go through the equations again.\n\nEquation1:6(a-1)=6*7=42 mod7=0. So 6(a-1)\u22610 mod7.\n\nEquation1: 0\u22612(b-1) mod7 \u21d22(b-1)\u22610 mod7 \u21d2b-1\u22610 mod7 \u21d2b\u22611 mod7. So b can be 1 or8.\n\nEquation2:6(a-1)=0\u22613(c-1) mod7 \u21d23(c-1)\u22610 mod7 \u21d2c-1\u22610 mod7 \u21d2c\u22611 mod7. So c=1 or8.\n\nEquation3:0\u2261(d-1) mod7 \u21d2d-1\u22610 mod7 \u21d2d\u22611 mod7 \u21d2d=1 or8.\n\nEquation4:2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7.\n\nNow, since a=8, and we want the largest N, we need to choose the largest possible b, c, d.\n\nPossible b: 8 or1. To maximize, choose b=8.\n\nc:8 or1, choose c=8.\n\nd:8 or1, choose d=8.\n\nLet me check if these choices work:\n\nb=8, c=8, d=8.\n\nNow, check equation4:2b +3c +d =2*8 +3*8 +8 =16+24+8=48. 48 mod7: 48-6*7=48-42=6 mod7. But equation4 requires 1 mod7. 6\u22601 mod7. Not valid.\n\nHmm. Let's try other combinations. Since we need to maximize N, but also satisfy equation4.\n\nLet me see possible combinations:\n\nb can be 8 or1,\n\nc can be8 or1,\n\nd can be8 or1.\n\nWe need to choose the largest digits possible but such that 2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7.\n\nLet me list all possibilities:\n\nCase1: b=8, c=8, d=8: sum=48\u22616 mod7. Not good.\n\nCase2: b=8,c=8,d=1: sum=2*8+3*8+1=16+24+1=41. 41 mod7: 41-5*7=41-35=6 mod7. Still 6.\n\nCase3: b=8,c=1,d=8: 2*8 +3*1 +8=16+3+8=27. 27 mod7=27-3*7=6. 6 again.\n\nCase4: b=8,c=1,d=1: 16+3+1=20. 20 mod7=6. Hmm, same.\n\nCase5: b=1,c=8,d=8: 2+24+8=34. 34 mod7: 34-4*7=34-28=6. Still 6.\n\nCase6: b=1,c=8,d=1: 2+24+1=27\u22616 mod7.\n\nCase7: b=1,c=1,d=8: 2+3+8=13\u22616 mod7.\n\nCase8: b=1,c=1,d=1: 2+3+1=6\u22616 mod7.\n\nAll combinations give 6 mod7, but we need 1 mod7. So none work. So with a=8, there's no solution either.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So perhaps a=8 also doesn't work. Let's try a=7.\n\nProceeding similarly:\n\nSet a=7.\n\nEquation1:6(a-1)=6*6=36 mod7. 36 mod7: 35 is 5*7, so 36\u22611 mod7.\n\nSo equation1:1\u22612(b-1) mod7 \u21d22(b-1)\u22611 mod7 \u21d2Multiply both sides by 4 (inverse of 2 mod7 is 4). So (b-1)\u22614 mod7 \u21d2b\u22615 mod7. Since b is a digit, possible b=5 or12 (invalid). So b=5.\n\nEquation2:6(a-1)=1\u22613(c-1) mod7 \u21d23(c-1)\u22611 mod7 \u21d2Multiply by 5 (inverse of 3 mod7 is5, since 3*5=15\u22611 mod7). So (c-1)\u22615 mod7 \u21d2c\u22616 mod7. So c=6 or13 (invalid). So c=6.\n\nEquation3:1\u2261(d-1) mod7 \u21d2d-1\u22611 mod7 \u21d2d\u22612 mod7 \u21d2d=2 or9.\n\nEquation4:2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7.\n\nNow, to maximize N, choose b=5, c=6, d=9 (since 9 is larger than 2).\n\nCheck equation4:2*5 +3*6 +9 =10 +18 +9=37 mod7. 37 mod7: 35 is 5*7, so 37-35=2 \u21d22 mod7. But we need 1 mod7. Not good.\n\nHmm. Let's see other options for d. If d=2 instead of9:\n\n2*5 +3*6 +2=10+18+2=30 mod7. 30-4*7=30-28=2 mod7. Still 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe different c or b?\n\nWait, but b must be 5 mod7 \u21d25. c must be6 mod7\u21d26. d must be 2 mod7 \u21d22 or9. So only possible b=5, c=6, d=2 or9. Both give equation4=2 mod7. Not 1. Thus, no solution with a=7.\n\nHmm. Let's try a=6.\n\nSet a=6.\n\nEquation1:6(a-1)=6*5=30 mod7. 30 mod7: 28 is 4*7, so 30-28=2 mod7.\n\nEquation1:2\u22612(b-1) mod7 \u21d22(b-1)=2 mod7 \u21d2b-1\u22611 mod7 \u21d2b\u22612 mod7. So b=2 or9.\n\nEquation2:2\u22613(c-1) mod7 \u21d23(c-1)=2 mod7 \u21d2Multiply both sides by5 (inverse of3): c-1\u226110 mod7 \u21d210 mod7=3 \u21d2c-1\u22613 \u21d2c\u22614 mod7. So c=4 or11 (invalid). So c=4.\n\nEquation3:2\u2261(d-1) mod7 \u21d2d-1\u22612 \u21d2d\u22613 mod7 \u21d2d=3 or10 (invalid). So d=3.\n\nEquation4:2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7.\n\nMaximizing variables: b=9 (since a=6, b can be 2 or9. 9 is larger), c=4, d=3.\n\nCompute equation4:2*9 +3*4 +3=18+12+3=33 mod7. 33-4*7=33-28=5 mod7. Not 1.\n\nAlternatively, b=2 (the other option):\n\nb=2, c=4, d=3:\n\n2*2 +3*4 +3=4+12+3=19 mod7. 19-2*7=5 mod7. Still 5\u22601.\n\nHmm, no solution here either. \n\nProceeding to a=5.\n\na=5:\n\nEquation1:6*(5-1)=6*4=24 mod7. 24 mod7 is 24-3*7=3 \u21d23 mod7.\n\nEquation1:3\u22612(b-1) mod7 \u21d22(b-1)=3 mod7 \u21d2Multiply by4: b-1\u226112 mod7 \u21d212 mod7=5 \u21d2b-1\u22615 \u21d2b\u22616 mod7 \u21d2b=6 or13 (invalid). So b=6.\n\nEquation2:3\u22613(c-1) mod7 \u21d23(c-1)=3 mod7 \u21d2c-1\u22611 \u21d2c=2 mod7 \u21d2c=2 or9.\n\nEquation3:3\u2261d-1 mod7 \u21d2d-1\u22613 \u21d2d=4 mod7 \u21d2d=4 or11 (invalid). So d=4.\n\nEquation4:2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7.\n\nMaximizing variables:\n\nb=6, c=9 (since c can be2 or9; 9 is larger), d=4.\n\nCompute equation4:2*6 +3*9 +4=12+27+4=43 mod7. 43-6*7=1 mod7. 43-42=1. So 43 mod7=1. That's good!\n\nSo equation4 is satisfied. Let me check all variables:\n\na=5, b=6, c=9, d=4. So N=5694.\n\nLet me verify all four conditions:\n\n1. Change thousands digit to1: 1694. Check divisibility by7.\n\nCompute 1694 \u00f77: 7*242=1694. Exactly divisible. Good.\n\n2. Change hundreds digit to1:5194. Check 5194 \u00f77.\n\n7*742=5194. Exactly divisible. Good.\n\n3. Change tens digit to1:5614. 5614 \u00f77: 7*802=5614. Exactly divisible.\n\n4. Change units digit to1:5691. 5691 \u00f77: 7*813=5691. Exactly divisible. \n\nAll four numbers are divisible by7. So N=5694 is a valid number.\n\nBut wait, we need to check if there's a higher a than 5 that works. Since we tried a=9,8,7,6, and none worked, perhaps 5 is the highest possible a. But let me check a=4 just to be thorough.\n\na=4:\n\nEquation1:6*(4-1)=18 mod7=4 mod7.\n\nEquation1:4\u22612(b-1) \u21d22(b-1)=4 mod7 \u21d2b-1=2 \u21d2b=3 mod7 \u21d2b=3 or10 (invalid). So b=3.\n\nEquation2:4\u22613(c-1) \u21d23(c-1)=4 mod7 \u21d2Multiply by5: c-1=20 mod7\u21d26 \u21d2c=7 mod7 \u21d2c=7 or14 (invalid). So c=7.\n\nEquation3:4\u2261d-1 \u21d2d=5 mod7 \u21d2d=5 or12 (invalid). So d=5.\n\nEquation4:2b +3c +d =2*3 +3*7 +5=6+21+5=32 mod7. 32 mod7=4 \u21d2Need 1 mod7. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, other options?\n\nb=3, c=7, d=5. The equation4 gives 4\u22614 mod7, but need 1. Not valid. \n\nThus, a=5 is the highest so far. But before concluding, let me check a=6 again to see if I missed any possible combination.\n\nWait when a=6, we had:\n\nEquation1: b=2 or9,\n\nEquation2: c=4,\n\nEquation3: d=3,\n\nEquation4: 2b +3c +d must \u22611 mod7.\n\nFor a=6, c is fixed at4, d=3.\n\nIf b=9: 2*9 +3*4 +3=18+12+3=33 mod7=5 mod7,\n\nb=2: 4 +12 +3=19 mod7=5 mod7.\n\nNeither gives 1 mod7. So no solution.\n\nSimilarly for a=7:\n\na=7: b=5, c=6, d=2 or9,\n\nEquation4: 2*5 +3*6 +d=10+18+d=28+d mod7. 28 mod7=0. So 0 +d mod7. We need this to be 1 mod7 \u21d2d\u22611 mod7. But d must be 2 or9 (from equation3). 2\u22612 mod7, 9\u22612 mod7. Thus, no.\n\nHmm. So a=5 is the highest possible. \n\nWait, but let me check a=5 with other possible c and d. For a=5, we had:\n\nEquation1: b=6 mod7 \u21d2b=6,\n\nEquation2: c=2 or9,\n\nEquation3: d=4 mod7 \u21d2d=4,\n\nEquation4:2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7.\n\nWhen choosing c=9, we get equation4=1 mod7. But what if we choose c=2?\n\nThen, with c=2, d=4:\n\nequation4:2*6 +3*2 +4=12+6+4=22 mod7=22-3*7=1 mod7. Wait, 22 mod7 is 1 (since 21 is 3*7). So 22 mod7 is 1. Wait a second! Wait, 22 divided by7 is3*7=21, so remainder1. So 22 mod7=1. So if c=2 instead of9, then equation4 is satisfied. \n\nWait, so actually, with c=2, d=4, we also have equation4 satisfied. \n\nWait, so there are two possibilities for c:2 or9. Both could work? Let me check:\n\nCase1: c=9, d=4 \u21d2 equation4=43 mod7=1.\n\nCase2: c=2, d=4 \u21d2 equation4=22 mod7=1.\n\nSo both are valid. However, since we want the largest N possible, we choose the largest possible digits. \n\nFor c:9 is larger than2, so choosing c=9 gives a larger number. Thus N=5694 vs N=5624 (if c=2, b=6, d=4). 5694 is larger, so that's better.\n\nBut just to confirm, let's see if there are other possibilities with a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 gives N=5694. \n\nAlternatively, is there a higher N with a=5 but different digits? Let me see:\n\nWait, with a=5, b can be 6 (only option), c can be9 (to maximize), d=4. That's the maximum possible digits.\n\nAlternatively, could d be another value? From equation3, d must be 4 mod7 \u21d2d=4 or11 (invalid). So d=4 is only option.\n\nThus, N=5694 is the maximum when a=5.\n\nWait, but let me check if a=5 is indeed the highest possible. Since a=6,7,8,9 didn't work, yes. So N=5694 is the largest such number. \n\nWait, but let me check another thing. When a=5, the equations give possible d=4, but could there be another d? For example, d=4+7=11 is invalid. So only d=4. \n\nTherefore, N=5694 is the maximum. \n\nNow, we need to confirm that there isn't a larger N with a=5 but higher b,c,d? Let's see:\n\nWait, with a=5, the maximum possible b is 6 (since b must be 6 mod7, so 6 is the highest digit possible). c can be 9 (since c must be 2 mod7? Wait, wait, equation2 for a=5:\n\nEquation2: for a=5,\n\nEquation2:3\u22613(c-1) mod7 \u21d2c-1\u22611 mod7 \u21d2c=2 mod7. So c can be 2 or9 (since 2+7=9). So 9 is allowed. So yes, choosing c=9 is the maximum.\n\nd is fixed at4.\n\nThus, N=5694 is indeed the largest possible. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's a number with a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4. So 5694.\n\nWait, let me confirm all four conditions again:\n\n1. Change thousands digit to1: 1694. 1694 \u00f77: 7\u00d7242=1694. Yes, divisible.\n\n2. Change hundreds digit to1:5194. 5194 \u00f77: 7\u00d7742=5194. Divisible.\n\n3. Change tens digit to1:5614. 5614 \u00f77: 7\u00d7802=5614. Divisible.\n\n4. Change units digit to1:5691. 5691 \u00f77: 7\u00d7813=5701? Wait, 7\u00d7800=5600, 7\u00d713=91, so 7\u00d7813=5691. Yes. So all four are divisible. \n\nThus, N=5694 is valid. \n\nNow, the problem says \"the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property\". Since we tried a=9 down to a=5, and found N=5694 as the first valid one, this is indeed the maximum. \n\nNow, to find Q and R when N is divided by 1000. \n\nDividing 5694 by1000, we get Q=5 (the thousands digit) and R=694 (the last three digits). Therefore, Q + R =5 +694=699.\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\n5694 divided by1000 is 5 with a remainder of 694. So Q=5, R=694. 5+694=699. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 699. But before finalizing, let me check once more for any possible higher N that I might have missed. \n\nWait, let me check a=5, but maybe with different digits?\n\nWait, for a=5, if we choose c=2 instead of9, then N=5624. Which is smaller than 5694. So not better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a higher N with a=5, but different b?\n\nNo, b must be 6 mod7. The maximum possible b is6 or13, but 13 is invalid. So b=6 is max.\n\nTherefore, N=5694 is indeed the maximum. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 5 + 694 = 699. So the answer is 699. Let me just confirm once more that there is no higher N.\n\nWait, let me check a=5, but if somehow another combination gives a higher number. For example, a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 gives 5694. Is there a way to have a higher digit in the units place? d must be4 mod7, so d can be4 or11. 4 is the max. \n\nAlternatively, if I made an error in calculation for a=7 or a=6?\n\nWait, let me check a=7 again. \n\nFor a=7, the equations give b=5, c=6, d=2 or9. \n\nWait, d must be\u22612 mod7 (since equation3: d\u22612 mod7). So d=2 or9. Choosing d=9 would make it higher. \n\nWait, previously I thought d\u22612 mod7? Let me recheck equation3 for a=7:\n\nEquation3:6(a-1)\u2261d-1 mod7. For a=7, 6*(6)=36\u22611 mod7. So 1\u2261d-1 mod7 \u21d2d\u22612 mod7. So d=2 or9. \n\nAh, so d can be 9. So d=9 is allowed. \n\nWait, so earlier when I considered a=7, I had:\n\nb=5, c=6, d=9. Let me check equation4 with these values:\n\n2b +3c +d =2*5 +3*6 +9=10+18+9=37 mod7. 37 mod7 is 37-5*7=37-35=2 mod7. Still 2 mod7, but equation4 requires 1 mod7. \n\nSo even with d=9, equation4 gives 2 mod7, which is not good. So no solution.\n\nWait, but maybe different c?\n\nWait, for a=7, c must be6 mod7? Let me check:\n\nEquation2 for a=7:\n\n6(a-1)=36\u22611 mod7. So equation2 says 1\u22613(c-1) mod7 \u21d23(c-1)=1 mod7 \u21d2c-1\u22615 mod7 \u21d2c=6 mod7. So c=6 or13 (invalid). So c=6. So cannot change c. \n\nTherefore, even with d=9, it still doesn't satisfy equation4. \n\nThus, a=7 still no solution. \n\nTherefore, yes, N=5694 is the maximum. Hence the answer is 5 + 694 = 699. \n\nWait, but hold on! Wait a second. I just realized that when a=5, the digit d=4. But when you change the units digit to1, you get 5691. Wait, but the original number N is 5694. Changing the units digit to1 gives 5691, which is divisible by7. But what about changing other digits?\n\nWait, let me check again all four:\n\n1. Change thousands digit to1: 1694 \u00f77 = 242. Correct.\n\n2. Change hundreds digit to1: 5194 \u00f77 =742. Correct.\n\n3. Change tens digit to1: 5614 \u00f77=802. Correct.\n\n4. Change units digit to1:5691 \u00f77=813. Correct.\n\nAll good. So N=5694 is valid.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 5+694=699. \n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me check if there's a higher N with a=5 but different digits. Let me see:\n\nWait, if a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, that gives 5694.\n\nAlternatively, if a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, could there be another four-digit number higher than 5694 with a=5 but different digits? For example, a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the maximum possible with a=5, since changing any digit higher would violate the congruence conditions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a number with a=5, b=6, c=9, d= something else? But d must be4 mod7. So only 4 or11, but 11 is invalid. \n\nTherefore, I think this is correct. \n\nThus, the answer should be 699.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{699}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully to make sure I understand what's being asked. \n\nThe problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, we need to find Q and R, which are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000, and finally compute Q + R. The answer should be in a box at the end. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, N is a four-digit number, the largest possible such that if you change any single digit to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is ABCD (where A, B, C, D are digits), then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, which must be divisible by 7; changing B to 1 gives A1CD, also divisible by 7; same for changing C to 1 (AB1D) and D to 1 (ABC1). All four of those numbers must be divisible by 7. And we need the largest such N possible. Then, once we find N, we divide it by 1000, which would give Q as the first digit (since 1000 divides into four-digit numbers once, with the quotient being the thousands digit), and R as the last three digits. Then Q + R is the sum we need.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, I need to find the largest four-digit number N such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nSince N is a four-digit number, let's denote it as N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, with a \u2260 0. Since we want the greatest such N, we should start checking from 9999 downwards until we find such a number. But doing this manually would be tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nThe key is the condition: changing any digit to 1 must make the number divisible by 7. Let's consider each digit position:\n\n1. Changing the thousands digit (a) to 1: the number becomes 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.\n\n2. Changing the hundreds digit (b) to 1: the number becomes 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. Must be divisible by 7.\n\n3. Changing the tens digit (c) to 1: the number becomes 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. Divisible by 7.\n\n4. Changing the units digit (d) to 1: the number becomes 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Also divisible by 7.\n\nSo, for each of these four modified numbers, they must be divisible by 7. Let me write these four conditions as equations modulo 7.\n\nLet me denote the original number N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Then:\n\n1. When changing a to 1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \u2261 0 mod7.\n\n2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \u2261 0 mod7.\n\n3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \u2261 0 mod7.\n\n4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c +1 \u2261 0 mod7.\n\nSo, each of these four expressions must be congruent to 0 mod7. Let me see if I can express these equations in terms of N and the original digits.\n\nFirst, note that N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Let me see:\n\nFor equation 1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = N - 1000(a - 1). Because the original N has 1000a, so subtracting 1000(a -1) would replace a with 1. Therefore, equation 1 can be written as:\n\nN - 1000(a - 1) \u2261 0 mod7 \u21d2 N \u2261 1000(a -1) mod7.\n\nSimilarly, equation 2: Changing b to 1 gives 1000a + 100 + 10c + d = N - 100(b -1). So:\n\nN - 100(b -1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N \u2261 100(b -1) mod7.\n\nEquation 3: Changing c to 1: N - 10(c -1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N \u226110(c -1) mod7.\n\nEquation 4: Changing d to1: N - (d -1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N \u2261 (d -1) mod7.\n\nTherefore, all four congruences must hold:\n\n1. N \u2261 1000(a -1) mod7,\n\n2. N \u2261 100(b -1) mod7,\n\n3. N \u2261 10(c -1) mod7,\n\n4. N \u2261 (d -1) mod7.\n\nHmm, so these four congruences must all be true. Since N is congruent to each of these expressions mod7, all four expressions must be congruent to each other mod7. Therefore, 1000(a -1) \u2261 100(b -1) \u2261 10(c -1) \u2261 (d -1) mod7.\n\nTherefore, all of these expressions must be equal modulo7. Let me note that 1000 mod7, 100 mod7, 10 mod7, and 1 mod7 can be precomputed to simplify.\n\nFirst, compute 1000 mod7. Let's see, 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994 = 6 \u21d2 1000 \u22616 mod7.\n\nSimilarly, 100 mod7: 7*14=98, so 100 -98=2 \u21d2 100\u22612 mod7.\n\n10 mod7 is 3, since 7+3=10.\n\n1 mod7 is 1.\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\n1. N \u2261 6(a -1) mod7,\n\n2. N \u2261 2(b -1) mod7,\n\n3. N \u22613(c -1) mod7,\n\n4. N \u2261(d -1) mod7.\n\nTherefore, all four right-hand sides must be equal mod7. Let me write them as equations:\n\n6(a -1) \u2261 2(b -1) mod7,\n\n6(a -1) \u22613(c -1) mod7,\n\n6(a -1) \u2261 (d -1) mod7,\n\nand also 2(b -1) \u22613(c -1) mod7,\n\n2(b -1) \u2261 (d -1) mod7,\n\n3(c -1) \u2261 (d -1) mod7,\n\nBut perhaps starting with the first three equations:\n\nEquation1 and Equation2: 6(a -1) \u2261 2(b -1) mod7 \u21d2 6a -6 \u22612b -2 mod7 \u21d26a -2b -4 \u22610 mod7 \u21d26a -2b \u22614 mod7.\n\nEquation1 and Equation3: 6(a -1) \u22613(c -1) mod7 \u21d26a -6 \u22613c -3 mod7 \u21d26a -3c -3 \u22610 mod7 \u21d26a -3c \u22613 mod7 \u21d2Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime, division is allowed): 2a -c \u22611 mod7.\n\nEquation1 and Equation4: 6(a -1) \u2261 (d -1) mod7 \u21d26a -6 \u2261d -1 mod7 \u21d26a -d -5 \u22610 mod7 \u21d26a - d \u22615 mod7.\n\nSo now we have three equations:\n\n1. 6a -2b \u22614 mod7,\n\n2. 2a -c \u22611 mod7,\n\n3. 6a -d \u22615 mod7,\n\nAdditionally, we can get more equations from the other pairs if needed, but maybe starting with these three.\n\nOur variables are a, b, c, d, each digits (a from 1-9, others 0-9). We need to find the largest N = 1000a + 100b +10c +d, so we need to maximize a first, then b, etc.\n\nSo perhaps starting with a=9, since we want the largest N. Let me try a=9 first.\n\nLet me set a=9. Let's see if possible.\n\nFirst, equation 2: 2a -c \u22611 mod7 \u21d22*9 -c \u22611 mod7 \u21d218 -c \u22611 mod7 \u21d218 mod7 is 4 (since 14 is 2*7, so 18-14=4). So 4 -c \u22611 mod7 \u21d2 -c \u2261 -3 mod7 \u21d2c \u22613 mod7. Since c is a digit (0-9), possible c=3 or 10, but 10 is invalid. So c=3 or 10, but 10 is not a digit, so c=3 or 3+7=10 (invalid). So only c=3.\n\nWait, but 4 -c \u22611 mod7 \u21d2 (4 -1) \u2261c mod7 \u21d2c\u22613 mod7. So c can be 3 or 10, but 10 is not allowed, so c must be 3.\n\nSo c=3.\n\nThen equation1: 6a -2b \u22614 mod7 with a=9.\n\n6*9 =54; 54 mod7: 7*7=49, so 54-49=5 \u21d254 \u22615 mod7.\n\nThus equation1: 5 -2b \u22614 mod7 \u21d2-2b \u2261 -1 mod7 \u21d22b \u22611 mod7. So 2b \u22611 mod7. The inverse of 2 mod7 is 4 because 2*4=8\u22611 mod7. So multiplying both sides by 4: b\u22614*1\u22614 mod7. Thus b can be 4 or 11, but 11 is too big. So b=4 or 4+7=11 (invalid). So only b=4.\n\nSo b=4.\n\nEquation3:6a -d \u22615 mod7. Again, 6a=54\u22615 mod7 as before. So 5 -d \u22615 mod7 \u21d2 -d \u22610 mod7 \u21d2d\u22610 mod7. So d must be 0 or7. Since d is a digit (0-9). So possible d=0 or7. Since we want the largest N, we should choose d=7 (since 7 is larger than 0). Wait, but let me confirm.\n\nWait, if d is 7, then the units digit is 7, which is higher than 0, so yes, to maximize N, we want d as large as possible. So d=7.\n\nSo with a=9, b=4, c=3, d=7. Let's check if this works.\n\nWait, but before we proceed, let me check all equations:\n\nFirst, equation1: 6a -2b =6*9 -2*4=54-8=46. 46 mod7: 7*6=42, 46-42=4. Which matches the RHS 4 mod7. Good.\n\nEquation2: 2a -c =18 -3=15. 15 mod7 is 1 (14+1). So 15\u22611 mod7. Correct.\n\nEquation3:6a -d =54-7=47. 47 mod7: 7*6=42, 47-42=5. So 5\u22615 mod7. Correct.\n\nSo that works. Now, we need to check if changing each digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7. Let me verify each case.\n\nFirst, changing the thousands digit (a=9 to 1):\n\nThe new number is 1 4 3 7 =1437. Let's divide by 7: 1437 \u00f77. 7*200=1400, 1437-1400=37. 37\u00f77 is 5*7=35, remainder 2. Wait, 37-35=2, so 1437 mod7 is 2. That's not divisible by 7. Hmm, that's a problem. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, but according to the equations, it should be divisible. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let's recalculate. Maybe I miscalculated 1437 \u00f77.\n\nLet me compute 7*205=1435. So 1437-1435=2. So yes, remainder 2. Not divisible. Hmm, so that's an issue. That means my assumption was wrong? But according to the equations, it should be congruent to 0 mod7.\n\nWait, let me check the equations again.\n\nWait, the equations were set up as N \u2261 expressions mod7, but perhaps I messed up the setup.\n\nWait, let me retrace. The first condition: changing the thousands digit to 1 gives the number 1BCD, which must be divisible by7. So that number is 1000 + 100b +10c +d. Then according to the first equation, N - 1000(a-1) \u22610 mod7, so N \u22611000(a-1) mod7. \n\nWait, but N =1000a + 100b +10c +d. So 1BCD is N -1000(a-1). So that's correct.\n\nBut substituting the values, with a=9, b=4, c=3, d=7:\n\nN = 9437. Then 1BCD is 1437. 1437 mod7: let me check again.\n\nWait 7*200=1400. 1437-1400=37. 37/7 is 5*7=35, so 37-35=2. So remainder 2. So that's not 0 mod7. Which contradicts the condition.\n\nHmm, so that means there's an error in my reasoning. Let me check where.\n\nWait, perhaps my equations are wrong. Let's see. The first equation was N \u2261 1000(a-1) mod7. Let me compute N mod7 and 1000(a-1) mod7.\n\nFirst, N=9437. Let's compute N mod7. 9437 divided by7:\n\n7*1348=9436, so 9437 mod7 is 1.\n\nNow, 1000(a-1) =1000*(9-1)=1000*8=8000. 8000 mod7: since 1000 mod7 is 6, so 8000 mod7 is 6*8 mod7. 6*8=48 mod7 is 48-42=6. So 8000 mod7 is6. So according to the equation N \u22616 mod7, but N mod7 is 1. Which is not congruent. Therefore, the equations are conflicting here. So my mistake must be in setting up the equations.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the equations. Let me go back step by step.\n\nOriginal setup: When changing the thousands digit to 1, the new number is 1 followed by the other digits. So that number is 1000*1 + 100b +10c +d. So the difference between N and this number is N - (1000 + 100b +10c +d) = 1000(a -1). Therefore, N - (new number) = 1000(a -1). Therefore, the new number = N - 1000(a-1). \n\nTherefore, the new number \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N -1000(a-1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N \u22611000(a-1) mod7. So that part is correct.\n\nBut in this case, N mod7 is 1, 1000(a-1)=8000 mod7 is 6. So 1\u22616 mod7? No, so that's a problem. So my equations must have been set up incorrectly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my mistake is in the direction of the equation. Wait, actually, the new number is equal to N minus 1000(a -1). So the new number is N - [1000(a -1)]. Therefore, to have the new number divisible by7, we need N -1000(a -1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N \u22611000(a -1) mod7. So that is correct. But in the case above, N mod7 is 1, and 1000*(a-1) mod7 is6, so 1\u22616 mod7? Not true. Therefore, the equations must not hold here, but according to my previous steps, they were supposed to. So my mistake must have been in solving the equations. Let me check again.\n\nStarting over with a=9:\n\nEquation1:6(a-1) \u22612(b -1) mod7.\n\nWait, let me recast all equations again:\n\nEquation1: 6(a -1) \u22612(b -1) mod7,\n\nEquation2:6(a -1)\u22613(c -1) mod7,\n\nEquation3:6(a -1)\u2261(d -1) mod7,\n\nAdditionally, equations from other pairs, but let's see.\n\nSo for a=9,\n\nEquation1: 6*(9-1)=6*8=48 mod7. 48 mod7 is 48-6*7=48-42=6 mod7. So 6 \u22612*(b-1) mod7 \u21d2 2*(b-1)\u22616 mod7 \u21d2 (b-1)\u22613 mod7 (since 2*3=6). So b-1\u22613 \u21d2b\u22614 mod7. So b can be 4 or 11, but b is a digit, so only 4. So that part is correct.\n\nEquation2:6*(9-1)=48\u22616 mod7. So 6\u22613*(c -1) mod7 \u21d23*(c -1)\u22616 mod7 \u21d2c -1\u22612 mod7 (since 3*2=6 mod7). So c -1=2 \u21d2c=3 mod7. Thus c=3 or 10 (invalid), so c=3. Correct.\n\nEquation3:6*(9-1)=48\u22616 mod7. So 6\u2261(d -1) mod7 \u21d2d -1\u22616 \u21d2d\u22617 mod7. So d\u22610 mod7. Wait, hold on: 6\u2261d-1 mod7 \u21d2d-1=6 mod7 \u21d2d\u22617 mod7 \u21d2d\u22610 mod7. So d must be 0 or 7. Because 7 mod7 is 0. Wait, yes. So d can be 0 or7. So I thought that, so choosing d=7 gives d=7. But 7 mod7 is 0, so d-1=6 mod7, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, equations are correct. But when we plug back into N mod7, we have N=9437. Let me compute N mod7 again.\n\nLet me compute 9437 divided by7 step by step.\n\n7*1000=7000, so 9437-7000=2437.\n\n7*300=2100, so 2437-2100=337.\n\n7*48=336, so 337-336=1. So total is 1000+300+48=1348, remainder 1. So 9437 mod7 is indeed 1. However, according to equation1, N should be congruent to 6 mod7 (since 1000(a-1)=8000\u22616 mod7). But 1\u22616 mod7? That's a contradiction. So my mistake must be somewhere else.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe the equations are set up incorrectly. Let me check the equations again.\n\nWait, the first equation is N \u22611000(a -1) mod7. But when a=9, that would be 1000*(8)=8000 mod7, which is 6 mod7. But N mod7 is 1. So that's a conflict. Therefore, this means that with a=9, there is no solution? But according to the equations above, the values of b,c,d satisfy the equations. So maybe my equations are wrong?\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe my mistake was in how I set up the equations. Let me rederive them.\n\nLet me start over with the four conditions:\n\nChanging the thousands digit to 1: the new number is 1XYZ, which must be divisible by7. So 1000 + 100b +10c +d \u22610 mod7.\n\nSimilarly, changing hundreds digit to1: a1CD must be divisible by7: 1000a +100 +10c +d \u22610 mod7.\n\nChanging tens digit to1: AB1D must be divisible by7: 1000a +100b +10 +d \u22610 mod7.\n\nChanging units digit to1: ABC1 must be divisible by7: 1000a +100b +10c +1 \u22610 mod7.\n\nSo these are four separate congruences. Let me write them as:\n\n1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \u22610 mod7,\n\n2. 1000a + 100 +10c +d \u22610 mod7,\n\n3. 1000a +100b +10 +d \u22610 mod7,\n\n4. 1000a +100b +10c +1 \u22610 mod7.\n\nNow, let me subtract equation1 from equation2:\n\nEquation2 - Equation1: (1000a +100 +10c +d) - (1000 +100b +10c +d) = 1000(a -1) -100(b -1) \u22610 mod7.\n\nTherefore, 1000(a -1) -100(b -1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d21000(a-1) \u2261100(b-1) mod7.\n\nSimilarly, equation2 - equation3: Let me see, but perhaps better to do each pair.\n\nAlternatively, let me express each equation in terms of N.\n\nLet me write N = 1000a +100b +10c +d.\n\nThen equation1: 1000 + 100b +10c +d = N -1000(a -1). So equation1: N -1000(a -1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N \u22611000(a-1) mod7.\n\nSimilarly equation2: N -100(b -1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N\u2261100(b-1) mod7,\n\nequation3: N -10(c -1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N\u226110(c-1) mod7,\n\nequation4: N - (d -1) \u22610 mod7 \u21d2 N\u2261(d -1) mod7.\n\nSo these four congruences must hold. Therefore, all four expressions 1000(a-1), 100(b-1), 10(c-1), (d-1) must be congruent mod7.\n\nTherefore, 1000(a-1) \u2261100(b-1) \u226110(c-1)\u2261(d-1) mod7.\n\nSo in the case of a=9, we have:\n\n1000(a-1)=1000*8=8000\u22616 mod7,\n\n100(b-1)=100*(4-1)=100*3=300 mod7. Wait, 100 mod7 is 2, so 100*(b-1)=2*(b-1). Wait, maybe better to compute 100*(b-1) mod7. Since 100\u22612 mod7, so 100*(b-1)\u22612*(b-1) mod7. \n\nWait, so for a=9, b=4, then 100(b-1)=100*3=300. 300 mod7: 7*42=294, 300-294=6 \u21d2 6 mod7. So 6 mod7, which matches 1000(a-1)=6 mod7. So that's okay.\n\nThen 10(c-1)=10*(3-1)=20 mod7. 20 mod7=6. So also 6 mod7. Okay.\n\nThen (d-1)=7-1=6 mod7. So 6 mod7. Therefore, all four expressions are congruent mod7. So the equations are satisfied. But then why is N mod7=1, but 1000(a-1)=6 mod7?\n\nWait, because N \u22616 mod7? Wait N mod7 should be equal to 6 mod7. Wait but N=9437 mod7 is 1. Wait that contradicts.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Wait, let's compute N mod7 again. Maybe I made an error.\n\nCompute N=9437 mod7:\n\nLet me use another method. 9000 mod7: 7*1285=9000-7*1285. Wait, maybe better to break down 9437:\n\n9437 divided by 7:\n\n7 \u00d7 1348 = 9436. So 9437 =7\u00d71348 +1. Therefore, mod7 it's 1. So N mod7 is 1, but according to the equation, N should be congruent to 6 mod7. Therefore, something is wrong here.\n\nWait, so even though all the expressions 1000(a-1), 100(b-1), etc., are congruent mod7, the problem is that the equations set N \u2261 that value mod7. So if they are all congruent to 6 mod7, then N must be 6 mod7. But N is 1 mod7. So that means that with a=9, the equations are not satisfied. So perhaps my mistake was in assuming that when solving the equations, they are compatible? Wait, but when I set up the equations, I had:\n\nEquation1: N \u22616 mod7,\n\nEquation2: N\u22612*(b-1) mod7. With b=4, that is 2*3=6 mod7,\n\nEquation3: N\u226110*(c-1)=10*2=20\u22616 mod7,\n\nEquation4: N\u2261d-1=6 mod7.\n\nTherefore, all equations require that N\u22616 mod7, but N=9437\u22611 mod7. So there is a contradiction here. Therefore, my mistake must be in the algebra steps when I set up the equations? Wait, but how?\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made an error in substituting N into the equations. Wait, equation1 says N \u22611000(a-1) mod7. So with a=9, N must be \u22616 mod7, but N is actually 9437\u22611 mod7. Therefore, this is impossible. So even though the values of b,c,d satisfy the equations derived from equating the congruences, the actual N does not satisfy the original condition because the congruence N\u22616 mod7 isn't met. Therefore, there must be an error in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps my mistake was in how I solved the equations. Let me see.\n\nStarting over with a=9:\n\nEquation1: 6(a-1) \u22612(b-1) mod7 \u21d26*8=48\u22616 mod7. So 6\u22612(b-1) mod7 \u21d22(b-1)\u22616 \u21d2b-1\u22613 \u21d2b=4. Correct.\n\nEquation2: 6(a-1)\u22613(c-1) mod7 \u21d26\u22613(c-1) \u21d2c-1\u22612 \u21d2c=3. Correct.\n\nEquation3:6(a-1)\u2261(d-1) mod7 \u21d26\u2261d-1 \u21d2d=7. Correct.\n\nBut then N=9437\u22611 mod7, but according to equation1, N should be \u22616 mod7. Therefore, contradiction. So the problem is that even though the equations between variables are satisfied, the actual value of N mod7 is not matching the required congruence. \n\nThis suggests that there is no solution when a=9. Therefore, even though the variables b,c,d satisfy the relations between them, the value of N itself does not satisfy N\u2261 required mod7. So my mistake was in thinking that solving for b,c,d would automatically satisfy N\u2261 those expressions mod7. But actually, the equations only ensure that the expressions involving the variables are congruent, but N must also be congruent to that value mod7. Wait, but the equations are N \u2261 each of those expressions mod7. Therefore, if all those expressions are congruent mod7, then N can be set to that value mod7. But in this case, they are congruent, so N must be equal to that value mod7, but when we plug in the digits, it's not. Therefore, the problem is that even though the variables satisfy the relations between them, the actual number N mod7 is not equal to the required congruence. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that my approach is missing something. Perhaps I need to set N \u2261 k mod7 where k is the common value of all those expressions, so k=6 mod7 in this case, so N must be 6 mod7. However, N=9437 is 1 mod7, so that's a conflict. Therefore, even if the equations are satisfied, the actual number N mod7 must be set to k. Therefore, perhaps we need an additional equation: N mod7 must equal k, where k is the common value. \n\nWait, but how do we ensure that? Let me think. Since all four expressions (1000(a-1), 100(b-1), etc.) must equal k mod7, and N \u2261k mod7. Therefore, if we set N mod7=k, then the equations are satisfied. But when we choose a,b,c,d such that the expressions are equal to k mod7, but then N's actual mod7 might not be k. Therefore, we need to enforce that N mod7 =k. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the equations should also include that N mod7=k, where k is the common value. Since k=1000(a-1) mod7, which is 6(a-1) mod7 (since 1000\u22616 mod7). \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLet me denote k = 1000(a-1) mod7 =6(a-1) mod7,\n\nand also k=2(b-1) mod7,\n\nk=3(c-1) mod7,\n\nk=(d-1) mod7,\n\nand also N \u2261k mod7.\n\nBut N is equal to 1000a +100b +10c +d. So N mod7 is equal to (1000a mod7 + 100b mod7 +10c mod7 +d mod7).\n\nSince 1000\u22616, 100\u22612, 10\u22613 mod7,\n\nTherefore, N mod7 \u22616a + 2b +3c +d mod7.\n\nTherefore, we have another equation:\n\n6a +2b +3c +d \u2261k mod7,\n\nBut k is equal to 6(a-1) mod7,\n\nTherefore, substituting k=6(a-1) mod7,\n\nThus,\n\n6a +2b +3c +d \u22616(a -1) mod7 \u21d2\n\n6a +2b +3c +d \u22616a -6 mod7 \u21d2\n\n2b +3c +d \u2261 -6 mod7 \u21d2\n\n2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7 (since -6 mod7 is 1).\n\nTherefore, this is an additional equation that must hold.\n\nAh! So I missed this equation. The previous equations ensure that all the expressions are equal to k mod7, but we also need N itself to be equal to k mod7. Therefore, the equation 2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7 must hold. \n\nTherefore, in the case when a=9, b=4, c=3, d=7:\n\nCompute 2b +3c +d =2*4 +3*3 +7=8+9+7=24. 24 mod7 is 24-3*7=24-21=3 mod7. But we needed this to be 1 mod7. 3\u22601 mod7. So that's the problem. So even though the other equations are satisfied, this equation is not. Therefore, the solution with a=9, b=4, c=3, d=7 is invalid. \n\nTherefore, we need to include this additional equation: 2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7. \n\nTherefore, to solve this correctly, we need to not only have the equations between a,b,c,d but also this equation. \n\nTherefore, let's retrace with this in mind.\n\nGiven that a=9, let's try again.\n\nWe had earlier:\n\nFrom equations:\n\n1. 6(a-1) \u22612(b-1) mod7,\n\n2. 6(a-1)\u22613(c -1) mod7,\n\n3.6(a-1)\u2261(d -1) mod7,\n\nand the additional equation:\n\n4. 2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7.\n\nWith a=9,\n\nEquation1: 6*(8) \u226148\u22616 mod7 \u21d22(b-1)\u22616 \u21d2b-1\u22613 \u21d2b=4.\n\nEquation2: 6\u22613(c-1) \u21d2c-1\u22612 \u21d2c=3.\n\nEquation3:6\u2261d-1 \u21d2d=7.\n\nNow, plug into equation4: 2*4 +3*3 +7 =8+9+7=24\u22613 mod7. Which is not 1 mod7. So invalid. \n\nSo we need to adjust the variables so that equation4 holds. Since we need 2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7. Let's see if there are other possible values of b,c,d that satisfy the first three equations but also this fourth equation. \n\nBut from the first three equations, given a=9, we had:\n\nb=4 mod7,\n\nc=3 mod7,\n\nd=0 or7 mod7 (since d\u22611 mod7? Wait, no. Wait, from equation3: d-1\u22616 mod7 \u21d2d\u22617 mod7 \u21d2d\u22610 mod7. So d must be 0 or7. \n\nTherefore, possible d=0 or7. Let me see if changing d to 0 would help.\n\nWait, if d=0, then equation4: 2b +3c +0 \u22611 mod7. \n\nWith b=4, c=3, that gives 2*4 +3*3=8+9=17\u22613 mod7. Still 3\u22613\u22601 mod7. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe b can be different? Wait, but from equation1, b must be \u22614 mod7. Since b is a digit, it can be 4 or 11, but 11 is invalid. So only 4. So b must be 4. Similarly c must be 3 mod7 \u21d23 or 10, but 10 invalid. So c=3. And d must be 0 or7. \n\nTherefore, no solutions with a=9. Therefore, a=9 is impossible.\n\nSo we need to try a=8.\n\nLet me try a=8.\n\nProceeding similarly:\n\nFirst, set a=8. Let's go through the equations again.\n\nEquation1:6(a-1)=6*7=42 mod7=0. So 6(a-1)\u22610 mod7.\n\nEquation1: 0\u22612(b-1) mod7 \u21d22(b-1)\u22610 mod7 \u21d2b-1\u22610 mod7 \u21d2b\u22611 mod7. So b can be 1 or8.\n\nEquation2:6(a-1)=0\u22613(c-1) mod7 \u21d23(c-1)\u22610 mod7 \u21d2c-1\u22610 mod7 \u21d2c\u22611 mod7. So c=1 or8.\n\nEquation3:0\u2261(d-1) mod7 \u21d2d-1\u22610 mod7 \u21d2d\u22611 mod7 \u21d2d=1 or8.\n\nEquation4:2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7.\n\nNow, since a=8, and we want the largest N, we need to choose the largest possible b, c, d.\n\nPossible b: 8 or1. To maximize, choose b=8.\n\nc:8 or1, choose c=8.\n\nd:8 or1, choose d=8.\n\nLet me check if these choices work:\n\nb=8, c=8, d=8.\n\nNow, check equation4:2b +3c +d =2*8 +3*8 +8 =16+24+8=48. 48 mod7: 48-6*7=48-42=6 mod7. But equation4 requires 1 mod7. 6\u22601 mod7. Not valid.\n\nHmm. Let's try other combinations. Since we need to maximize N, but also satisfy equation4.\n\nLet me see possible combinations:\n\nb can be 8 or1,\n\nc can be8 or1,\n\nd can be8 or1.\n\nWe need to choose the largest digits possible but such that 2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7.\n\nLet me list all possibilities:\n\nCase1: b=8, c=8, d=8: sum=48\u22616 mod7. Not good.\n\nCase2: b=8,c=8,d=1: sum=2*8+3*8+1=16+24+1=41. 41 mod7: 41-5*7=41-35=6 mod7. Still 6.\n\nCase3: b=8,c=1,d=8: 2*8 +3*1 +8=16+3+8=27. 27 mod7=27-3*7=6. 6 again.\n\nCase4: b=8,c=1,d=1: 16+3+1=20. 20 mod7=6. Hmm, same.\n\nCase5: b=1,c=8,d=8: 2+24+8=34. 34 mod7: 34-4*7=34-28=6. Still 6.\n\nCase6: b=1,c=8,d=1: 2+24+1=27\u22616 mod7.\n\nCase7: b=1,c=1,d=8: 2+3+8=13\u22616 mod7.\n\nCase8: b=1,c=1,d=1: 2+3+1=6\u22616 mod7.\n\nAll combinations give 6 mod7, but we need 1 mod7. So none work. So with a=8, there's no solution either.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So perhaps a=8 also doesn't work. Let's try a=7.\n\nProceeding similarly:\n\nSet a=7.\n\nEquation1:6(a-1)=6*6=36 mod7. 36 mod7: 35 is 5*7, so 36\u22611 mod7.\n\nSo equation1:1\u22612(b-1) mod7 \u21d22(b-1)\u22611 mod7 \u21d2Multiply both sides by 4 (inverse of 2 mod7 is 4). So (b-1)\u22614 mod7 \u21d2b\u22615 mod7. Since b is a digit, possible b=5 or12 (invalid). So b=5.\n\nEquation2:6(a-1)=1\u22613(c-1) mod7 \u21d23(c-1)\u22611 mod7 \u21d2Multiply by 5 (inverse of 3 mod7 is5, since 3*5=15\u22611 mod7). So (c-1)\u22615 mod7 \u21d2c\u22616 mod7. So c=6 or13 (invalid). So c=6.\n\nEquation3:1\u2261(d-1) mod7 \u21d2d-1\u22611 mod7 \u21d2d\u22612 mod7 \u21d2d=2 or9.\n\nEquation4:2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7.\n\nNow, to maximize N, choose b=5, c=6, d=9 (since 9 is larger than 2).\n\nCheck equation4:2*5 +3*6 +9 =10 +18 +9=37 mod7. 37 mod7: 35 is 5*7, so 37-35=2 \u21d22 mod7. But we need 1 mod7. Not good.\n\nHmm. Let's see other options for d. If d=2 instead of9:\n\n2*5 +3*6 +2=10+18+2=30 mod7. 30-4*7=30-28=2 mod7. Still 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe different c or b?\n\nWait, but b must be 5 mod7 \u21d25. c must be6 mod7\u21d26. d must be 2 mod7 \u21d22 or9. So only possible b=5, c=6, d=2 or9. Both give equation4=2 mod7. Not 1. Thus, no solution with a=7.\n\nHmm. Let's try a=6.\n\nSet a=6.\n\nEquation1:6(a-1)=6*5=30 mod7. 30 mod7: 28 is 4*7, so 30-28=2 mod7.\n\nEquation1:2\u22612(b-1) mod7 \u21d22(b-1)=2 mod7 \u21d2b-1\u22611 mod7 \u21d2b\u22612 mod7. So b=2 or9.\n\nEquation2:2\u22613(c-1) mod7 \u21d23(c-1)=2 mod7 \u21d2Multiply both sides by5 (inverse of3): c-1\u226110 mod7 \u21d210 mod7=3 \u21d2c-1\u22613 \u21d2c\u22614 mod7. So c=4 or11 (invalid). So c=4.\n\nEquation3:2\u2261(d-1) mod7 \u21d2d-1\u22612 \u21d2d\u22613 mod7 \u21d2d=3 or10 (invalid). So d=3.\n\nEquation4:2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7.\n\nMaximizing variables: b=9 (since a=6, b can be 2 or9. 9 is larger), c=4, d=3.\n\nCompute equation4:2*9 +3*4 +3=18+12+3=33 mod7. 33-4*7=33-28=5 mod7. Not 1.\n\nAlternatively, b=2 (the other option):\n\nb=2, c=4, d=3:\n\n2*2 +3*4 +3=4+12+3=19 mod7. 19-2*7=5 mod7. Still 5\u22601.\n\nHmm, no solution here either. \n\nProceeding to a=5.\n\na=5:\n\nEquation1:6*(5-1)=6*4=24 mod7. 24 mod7 is 24-3*7=3 \u21d23 mod7.\n\nEquation1:3\u22612(b-1) mod7 \u21d22(b-1)=3 mod7 \u21d2Multiply by4: b-1\u226112 mod7 \u21d212 mod7=5 \u21d2b-1\u22615 \u21d2b\u22616 mod7 \u21d2b=6 or13 (invalid). So b=6.\n\nEquation2:3\u22613(c-1) mod7 \u21d23(c-1)=3 mod7 \u21d2c-1\u22611 \u21d2c=2 mod7 \u21d2c=2 or9.\n\nEquation3:3\u2261d-1 mod7 \u21d2d-1\u22613 \u21d2d=4 mod7 \u21d2d=4 or11 (invalid). So d=4.\n\nEquation4:2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7.\n\nMaximizing variables:\n\nb=6, c=9 (since c can be2 or9; 9 is larger), d=4.\n\nCompute equation4:2*6 +3*9 +4=12+27+4=43 mod7. 43-6*7=1 mod7. 43-42=1. So 43 mod7=1. That's good!\n\nSo equation4 is satisfied. Let me check all variables:\n\na=5, b=6, c=9, d=4. So N=5694.\n\nLet me verify all four conditions:\n\n1. Change thousands digit to1: 1694. Check divisibility by7.\n\nCompute 1694 \u00f77: 7*242=1694. Exactly divisible. Good.\n\n2. Change hundreds digit to1:5194. Check 5194 \u00f77.\n\n7*742=5194. Exactly divisible. Good.\n\n3. Change tens digit to1:5614. 5614 \u00f77: 7*802=5614. Exactly divisible.\n\n4. Change units digit to1:5691. 5691 \u00f77: 7*813=5691. Exactly divisible. \n\nAll four numbers are divisible by7. So N=5694 is a valid number.\n\nBut wait, we need to check if there's a higher a than 5 that works. Since we tried a=9,8,7,6, and none worked, perhaps 5 is the highest possible a. But let me check a=4 just to be thorough.\n\na=4:\n\nEquation1:6*(4-1)=18 mod7=4 mod7.\n\nEquation1:4\u22612(b-1) \u21d22(b-1)=4 mod7 \u21d2b-1=2 \u21d2b=3 mod7 \u21d2b=3 or10 (invalid). So b=3.\n\nEquation2:4\u22613(c-1) \u21d23(c-1)=4 mod7 \u21d2Multiply by5: c-1=20 mod7\u21d26 \u21d2c=7 mod7 \u21d2c=7 or14 (invalid). So c=7.\n\nEquation3:4\u2261d-1 \u21d2d=5 mod7 \u21d2d=5 or12 (invalid). So d=5.\n\nEquation4:2b +3c +d =2*3 +3*7 +5=6+21+5=32 mod7. 32 mod7=4 \u21d2Need 1 mod7. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, other options?\n\nb=3, c=7, d=5. The equation4 gives 4\u22614 mod7, but need 1. Not valid. \n\nThus, a=5 is the highest so far. But before concluding, let me check a=6 again to see if I missed any possible combination.\n\nWait when a=6, we had:\n\nEquation1: b=2 or9,\n\nEquation2: c=4,\n\nEquation3: d=3,\n\nEquation4: 2b +3c +d must \u22611 mod7.\n\nFor a=6, c is fixed at4, d=3.\n\nIf b=9: 2*9 +3*4 +3=18+12+3=33 mod7=5 mod7,\n\nb=2: 4 +12 +3=19 mod7=5 mod7.\n\nNeither gives 1 mod7. So no solution.\n\nSimilarly for a=7:\n\na=7: b=5, c=6, d=2 or9,\n\nEquation4: 2*5 +3*6 +d=10+18+d=28+d mod7. 28 mod7=0. So 0 +d mod7. We need this to be 1 mod7 \u21d2d\u22611 mod7. But d must be 2 or9 (from equation3). 2\u22612 mod7, 9\u22612 mod7. Thus, no.\n\nHmm. So a=5 is the highest possible. \n\nWait, but let me check a=5 with other possible c and d. For a=5, we had:\n\nEquation1: b=6 mod7 \u21d2b=6,\n\nEquation2: c=2 or9,\n\nEquation3: d=4 mod7 \u21d2d=4,\n\nEquation4:2b +3c +d \u22611 mod7.\n\nWhen choosing c=9, we get equation4=1 mod7. But what if we choose c=2?\n\nThen, with c=2, d=4:\n\nequation4:2*6 +3*2 +4=12+6+4=22 mod7=22-3*7=1 mod7. Wait, 22 mod7 is 1 (since 21 is 3*7). So 22 mod7 is 1. Wait a second! Wait, 22 divided by7 is3*7=21, so remainder1. So 22 mod7=1. So if c=2 instead of9, then equation4 is satisfied. \n\nWait, so actually, with c=2, d=4, we also have equation4 satisfied. \n\nWait, so there are two possibilities for c:2 or9. Both could work? Let me check:\n\nCase1: c=9, d=4 \u21d2 equation4=43 mod7=1.\n\nCase2: c=2, d=4 \u21d2 equation4=22 mod7=1.\n\nSo both are valid. However, since we want the largest N possible, we choose the largest possible digits. \n\nFor c:9 is larger than2, so choosing c=9 gives a larger number. Thus N=5694 vs N=5624 (if c=2, b=6, d=4). 5694 is larger, so that's better.\n\nBut just to confirm, let's see if there are other possibilities with a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 gives N=5694. \n\nAlternatively, is there a higher N with a=5 but different digits? Let me see:\n\nWait, with a=5, b can be 6 (only option), c can be9 (to maximize), d=4. That's the maximum possible digits.\n\nAlternatively, could d be another value? From equation3, d must be 4 mod7 \u21d2d=4 or11 (invalid). So d=4 is only option.\n\nThus, N=5694 is the maximum when a=5.\n\nWait, but let me check if a=5 is indeed the highest possible. Since a=6,7,8,9 didn't work, yes. So N=5694 is the largest such number. \n\nWait, but let me check another thing. When a=5, the equations give possible d=4, but could there be another d? For example, d=4+7=11 is invalid. So only d=4. \n\nTherefore, N=5694 is the maximum. \n\nNow, we need to confirm that there isn't a larger N with a=5 but higher b,c,d? Let's see:\n\nWait, with a=5, the maximum possible b is 6 (since b must be 6 mod7, so 6 is the highest digit possible). c can be 9 (since c must be 2 mod7? Wait, wait, equation2 for a=5:\n\nEquation2: for a=5,\n\nEquation2:3\u22613(c-1) mod7 \u21d2c-1\u22611 mod7 \u21d2c=2 mod7. So c can be 2 or9 (since 2+7=9). So 9 is allowed. So yes, choosing c=9 is the maximum.\n\nd is fixed at4.\n\nThus, N=5694 is indeed the largest possible. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's a number with a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4. So 5694.\n\nWait, let me confirm all four conditions again:\n\n1. Change thousands digit to1: 1694. 1694 \u00f77: 7\u00d7242=1694. Yes, divisible.\n\n2. Change hundreds digit to1:5194. 5194 \u00f77: 7\u00d7742=5194. Divisible.\n\n3. Change tens digit to1:5614. 5614 \u00f77: 7\u00d7802=5614. Divisible.\n\n4. Change units digit to1:5691. 5691 \u00f77: 7\u00d7813=5701? Wait, 7\u00d7800=5600, 7\u00d713=91, so 7\u00d7813=5691. Yes. So all four are divisible. \n\nThus, N=5694 is valid. \n\nNow, the problem says \"the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property\". Since we tried a=9 down to a=5, and found N=5694 as the first valid one, this is indeed the maximum. \n\nNow, to find Q and R when N is divided by 1000. \n\nDividing 5694 by1000, we get Q=5 (the thousands digit) and R=694 (the last three digits). Therefore, Q + R =5 +694=699.\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\n5694 divided by1000 is 5 with a remainder of 694. So Q=5, R=694. 5+694=699. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 699. But before finalizing, let me check once more for any possible higher N that I might have missed. \n\nWait, let me check a=5, but maybe with different digits?\n\nWait, for a=5, if we choose c=2 instead of9, then N=5624. Which is smaller than 5694. So not better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a higher N with a=5, but different b?\n\nNo, b must be 6 mod7. The maximum possible b is6 or13, but 13 is invalid. So b=6 is max.\n\nTherefore, N=5694 is indeed the maximum. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 5 + 694 = 699. So the answer is 699. Let me just confirm once more that there is no higher N.\n\nWait, let me check a=5, but if somehow another combination gives a higher number. For example, a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 gives 5694. Is there a way to have a higher digit in the units place? d must be4 mod7, so d can be4 or11. 4 is the max. \n\nAlternatively, if I made an error in calculation for a=7 or a=6?\n\nWait, let me check a=7 again. \n\nFor a=7, the equations give b=5, c=6, d=2 or9. \n\nWait, d must be\u22612 mod7 (since equation3: d\u22612 mod7). So d=2 or9. Choosing d=9 would make it higher. \n\nWait, previously I thought d\u22612 mod7? Let me recheck equation3 for a=7:\n\nEquation3:6(a-1)\u2261d-1 mod7. For a=7, 6*(6)=36\u22611 mod7. So 1\u2261d-1 mod7 \u21d2d\u22612 mod7. So d=2 or9. \n\nAh, so d can be 9. So d=9 is allowed. \n\nWait, so earlier when I considered a=7, I had:\n\nb=5, c=6, d=9. Let me check equation4 with these values:\n\n2b +3c +d =2*5 +3*6 +9=10+18+9=37 mod7. 37 mod7 is 37-5*7=37-35=2 mod7. Still 2 mod7, but equation4 requires 1 mod7. \n\nSo even with d=9, equation4 gives 2 mod7, which is not good. So no solution.\n\nWait, but maybe different c?\n\nWait, for a=7, c must be6 mod7? Let me check:\n\nEquation2 for a=7:\n\n6(a-1)=36\u22611 mod7. So equation2 says 1\u22613(c-1) mod7 \u21d23(c-1)=1 mod7 \u21d2c-1\u22615 mod7 \u21d2c=6 mod7. So c=6 or13 (invalid). So c=6. So cannot change c. \n\nTherefore, even with d=9, it still doesn't satisfy equation4. \n\nThus, a=7 still no solution. \n\nTherefore, yes, N=5694 is the maximum. Hence the answer is 5 + 694 = 699. \n\nWait, but hold on! Wait a second. I just realized that when a=5, the digit d=4. But when you change the units digit to1, you get 5691. Wait, but the original number N is 5694. Changing the units digit to1 gives 5691, which is divisible by7. But what about changing other digits?\n\nWait, let me check again all four:\n\n1. Change thousands digit to1: 1694 \u00f77 = 242. Correct.\n\n2. Change hundreds digit to1: 5194 \u00f77 =742. Correct.\n\n3. Change tens digit to1: 5614 \u00f77=802. Correct.\n\n4. Change units digit to1:5691 \u00f77=813. Correct.\n\nAll good. So N=5694 is valid.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 5+694=699. \n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me check if there's a higher N with a=5 but different digits. Let me see:\n\nWait, if a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, that gives 5694.\n\nAlternatively, if a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, could there be another four-digit number higher than 5694 with a=5 but different digits? For example, a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the maximum possible with a=5, since changing any digit higher would violate the congruence conditions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a number with a=5, b=6, c=9, d= something else? But d must be4 mod7. So only 4 or11, but 11 is invalid. \n\nTherefore, I think this is correct. \n\nThus, the answer should be 699.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{699}\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \\( N \\) such that changing any single digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We then need to find \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\) when \\( N \\) is divided by 1000, and compute \\( Q + R \\).\n\nWe denote \\( N \\) as \\( 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \\). The conditions given translate to four congruences modulo 7 when each digit is changed to 1. After setting up and solving these congruences, we find:\n\n1. \\( N \\equiv 1000(a-1) \\mod 7 \\)\n2. \\( N \\equiv 100(b-1) \\mod 7 \\)\n3. \\( N \\equiv 10(c-1) \\mod 7 \\)\n4. \\( N \\equiv (d-1) \\mod 7 \\)\n\nAfter solving these equations step-by-step for the largest possible \\( a \\) (starting from 9 and moving downwards), we find that the valid solution occurs when \\( a = 5 \\). The corresponding values for \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\) are 6, 9, and 4 respectively, giving \\( N = 5694 \\).\n\nVerifying all conditions:\n1. Changing the thousands digit to 1: \\( 1694 \\div 7 = 242 \\)\n2. Changing the hundreds digit to 1: \\( 5194 \\div 7 = 742 \\)\n3. Changing the tens digit to 1: \\( 5614 \\div 7 = 802 \\)\n4. Changing the units digit to 1: \\( 5691 \\div 7 = 813 \\)\n\nAll results are integers, confirming \\( N = 5694 \\).\n\nDividing \\( 5694 \\) by 1000 gives \\( Q = 5 \\) and \\( R = 694 \\). Therefore, \\( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{699}\n\\]",
