      "full_content": "Okay, so the problem is about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue with equal probability for each vertex. Then we need to find the probability that there exists a rotation such that all blue vertices can be moved to positions that were originally red. The answer needs to be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then we have to find m + n. Hmm, okay, let me try to think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Each vertex is independently colored red or blue, each with probability 1/2. So there are 2^8 = 256 total possible colorings. We need to count how many colorings satisfy the condition that there exists some rotation (so rotating the octagon by 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, ..., 315\u00b0) such that when you rotate the octagon by that angle, all the blue vertices end up on positions that were originally red. Then the probability is that number divided by 256, and we have to present the answer as m + n where the fraction is reduced.\n\nAlright, so the key here is to find colorings where, for some rotation, the image of the blue vertices under that rotation is entirely within the red vertices. Alternatively, the blue vertices, when rotated by that rotation, don't land on any blue vertices. Wait, actually, the problem states \"all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices\". So, when you rotate the octagon by some angle, the blue vertices are moved to positions that were originally red. That is, the rotated blue vertices are a subset of the original red vertices. \n\nAlternatively, this can be rephrased as: there exists a rotation such that the blue vertices, when rotated by that rotation, do not overlap with any blue vertices in the original coloring. Because if they land on red vertices, then those positions were originally red, so they can't have been blue. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is equivalent to saying that the blue set is a subset of the red set under some rotation. Hmm. Let me think again.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let the octagon have vertices labeled 0 through 7. Let\u2019s denote the coloring as a set B of blue vertices and R of red vertices, with B and R being complements. The condition is that there exists some rotation (i.e., some k from 0 to 7, where a rotation by k positions corresponds to shifting each vertex i to i + k mod 8) such that when you rotate the blue vertices by k positions, all of them land in R. In other words, B rotated by k is a subset of R. Since R is the complement of B, this is equivalent to saying that B rotated by k does not intersect B. So, the rotated blue set and the original blue set are disjoint. \n\nTherefore, the condition is equivalent to: there exists some rotation k such that B \u2229 (B + k) = \u2205, where +k is the rotation. \n\nAlternatively, this is equivalent to saying that the blue set is \"disjoint from its rotation by k\". So for some k, shifting B by k doesn't overlap with itself. \n\nWait, but actually, the problem states \"all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices\". So, the rotated blue vertices must lie entirely within the red vertices, which is exactly that B rotated by k is a subset of R, which is equivalent to B \u2229 (B +k) = \u2205, yes.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of colorings (subsets B of the 8 vertices) such that there exists a rotation k (including rotation by 0, which would mean B is a subset of R, but since R is the complement of B, that would only be possible if B is empty. Wait, but rotation by 0 is the identity rotation. So if we allow rotation by 0, then the condition would require that B is a subset of R, which would mean B is empty. But since the problem says \"either red or blue with equal probability\", so empty set is allowed. However, perhaps the problem allows rotation by any rotation, including 0? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices\". So, rotating the octagon (presumably, by some non-zero rotation?) but actually, the problem doesn't specify that the rotation has to be non-zero. So rotation by 0 is allowed. So for the case when k=0, the condition requires that all blue vertices are at positions where they were originally red, which would mean that all blue vertices are red, so the blue set must be empty. So the only coloring where rotating by 0 satisfies the condition is the all-red coloring. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows rotation by any rotation, including identity. So when counting the colorings that satisfy the condition, we have to consider all rotations, including identity. \n\nTherefore, to compute the number of colorings where there exists some rotation (including identity) such that B rotated by that rotation is a subset of R. \n\nTherefore, the total number of such colorings is equal to the number of subsets B (since colorings are subsets B with probability 1/2 each) such that there exists a rotation k (from 0 to 7) where B rotated by k is disjoint from B.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets B of the 8 vertices such that there exists some rotation k where B and B +k are disjoint. \n\nHmm, okay, so the first step is to compute that count, then divide by 256, then reduce the fraction. \n\nTo approach this, perhaps using Burnside's lemma or inclusion-exclusion? Hmm, not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe we can consider for each rotation k, the number of subsets B that are disjoint from their rotation by k, then use inclusion-exclusion to account for overlaps. Wait, but since we need subsets where there exists at least one rotation k such that B is disjoint from B +k, this is equivalent to the union over all k of the sets {B | B disjoint from B +k}. Therefore, the total number is |Union_{k=0}^7 A_k| where A_k is the set of subsets B where B is disjoint from B +k. \n\nTherefore, to compute this, we can use inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|Union A_k| = Sum |A_k| - Sum |A_k \u2229 A_j| + Sum |A_k \u2229 A_j \u2229 A_m| - ... + (-1)^{n} |A_0 \u2229 ... \u2229 A_7}|.\n\nBut this seems complicated, since there are 8 rotations, so 2^8 terms. However, perhaps there is some symmetry here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of inclusion-exclusion, we can note that the rotations form a group (the cyclic group C8), and perhaps use some group theory here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can note that for each subset B, the set of rotations k for which B is disjoint from B +k is exactly the set of rotations that are in the complement of the \"rotation set\" of B. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps for a given subset B, the existence of such a k is equivalent to the condition that the subset B is not \"rotationally overlapping\" with itself in some way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to compute for each rotation k (from 0 to 7), the number of subsets B where B and B +k are disjoint, then account for overlaps. However, inclusion-exclusion might still be necessary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps first compute the total over all k of |A_k|, then subtract overlaps, but this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let me first compute the number for each rotation k, how many subsets B are such that B is disjoint from its rotation by k. Then, since the rotations have different orders, perhaps we can compute this for each rotation and then use inclusion-exclusion. \n\nFirst, let's note that the rotations are by 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, ..., 315\u00b0, which correspond to shifting by 0,1,2,...,7 positions. However, shifting by 4 is equivalent to shifting by -4 mod 8, so shifting by 4 is the same as shifting by -4. But since rotation direction might not matter here, since we are considering all possible shifts. \n\nFirst, let me note that for a rotation by k positions, shifting by k and shifting by -k would be similar. However, in this case, since we are considering all shifts from 0 to 7, each shift is considered as a separate element. \n\nHowever, perhaps it's better to note that shifting by k is equivalent to shifting by k mod 8. Since shifting by 8 is the identity, so shifts from 0 to 7. \n\nNow, for each shift k from 0 to 7, let's compute the number of subsets B such that B shifted by k is disjoint from B. \n\nFirst, let's start with k=0. Shifting by 0 is the identity, so B shifted by 0 is B itself. So the condition is that B is disjoint from itself, which is only possible if B is empty. So the number of subsets for k=0 is 1 (the empty set). \n\nNow, for k=1: shifting by 1. We need subsets B such that B shifted by 1 is disjoint from B. So for any element x in B, x+1 mod8 must not be in B. So this is equivalent to B being an independent set in the graph where each vertex is connected to its next neighbor. Wait, similar to a circular graph where each vertex is connected to the next one. So an independent set in that graph. Since the graph is an 8-cycle, an independent set on an 8-cycle. The number of independent sets on an 8-cycle can be calculated, but perhaps I need to think again.\n\nAlternatively, for each vertex, if we choose to include it in B, then the next vertex cannot be included. So it's similar to counting the number of subsets where no two consecutive vertices are in B. But since it's a cycle, the first and last are also adjacent. \n\nWait, actually, the condition is slightly different. The condition is that B shifted by 1 is disjoint from B. So if x is in B, then (x+1) mod8 is not in B. So indeed, it's exactly the independent sets on the 8-cycle graph. \n\nThe number of independent sets on an n-cycle is known to be F(n-1) + F(n+1), where F(n) is the Fibonacci sequence? Wait, actually, the formula for the number of independent sets on a cycle graph C_n is F_{n} + F_{n-2}? Hmm, maybe I need to recall the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps better to compute it manually for n=8.\n\nAlternatively, for a linear chain (path graph) of n vertices, the number of independent sets is F_{n+2}. For a cycle, it's F_{n} + F_{n-2}. Wait, let me confirm.\n\nSuppose for a cycle of n vertices, the number of independent sets is equal to the number for the path of n vertices (which is F_{n+2}) minus the number of independent sets where both the first and last vertices are selected (since in the cycle, they are adjacent). Wait, actually, maybe another approach.\n\nLet me denote the number of independent sets on a cycle of n vertices as C(n), and on a path of n vertices as P(n). For the path, it's straightforward: P(n) = P(n-1) + P(n-2), with P(1)=2, P(2)=3. So P(3)=5, P(4)=8, etc. For the cycle, the recurrence is a bit different. If we consider the first vertex, if it's included, then the second and last cannot be included, so the remaining is the independent sets of the path from the third to (n-1)th vertex, which is P(n-2). If the first is not included, then the remaining is the independent sets of the cycle of n-1 vertices (but actually, it becomes a path from the second to nth vertex, but since it's a cycle, removing the first vertex leaves a path from 2 to n, which is a line, so actually it's P(n-1). Wait, maybe the formula is C(n) = P(n) - C(n-2). Hmm, not sure. Maybe better to look up the formula. Wait, perhaps better to compute it for n=8.\n\nAlternatively, let me think recursively. Let's denote C(n) as the number of independent sets on an n-cycle.\n\nFor a cycle of n vertices, an independent set can either include the first vertex or not.\n\nIf it includes the first vertex, then it cannot include the second or the nth vertex. Then the remaining vertices from 3 to n-1 form a path of length n-3 (since vertices 2 and n are excluded). The number here is P(n-3).\n\nWait, maybe not exactly. Wait, if you include vertex 1, then vertices 2 and n cannot be included. The remaining vertices 3 to n-1 can form an independent set on the path from 3 to n-1 (since they are not adjacent to each other except in the original cycle, but since vertices 2 and n are excluded, their adjacency is only among themselves). Wait, actually, vertices 3 to n-1 form a path of length n-3 (since between 3 and n-1, there are n-3 vertices). So the number of independent sets in this case is P(n - 3).\n\nIf the first vertex is not included, then the remaining vertices form a cycle of n-1 vertices (vertices 2 to n). Wait, no, because vertices 2 and n are still adjacent. Wait, actually, if vertex 1 is not included, then vertices 2 to n form a cycle of n-1 vertices? No, actually, vertices 2 to n are arranged in a cycle only if we consider the original cycle minus vertex 1, but actually, in the original cycle, vertex 2 is adjacent to 3 and n, vertex n is adjacent to n-1 and 1 (which is excluded). So the remaining graph is actually a path from 2 to n, since vertex 1 is removed. Wait, no, vertex n is adjacent to vertex n-1 and vertex 2 (since in the original cycle, vertex n is adjacent to n-1 and 1). But since vertex 1 is not included, vertex n is adjacent to n-1 and 2. Wait, actually, removing vertex 1 leaves vertices 2 through n, but vertex 2 is adjacent to 3 and n, vertex n is adjacent to n-1 and 2. So the remaining graph is still a cycle of n-1 vertices? No, actually, it's a cycle of n vertices with vertex 1 removed, which breaks the cycle into a path. Wait, no. Let me think again. If you have a cycle 1-2-3-...-n-1-n-1, and you remove vertex 1, then the remaining graph is 2-3-...-n-1-n, but since vertex n is connected back to vertex 2 (since in the original cycle, vertex n was connected to 1 and vertex n-1, but vertex 1 is gone, so vertex n is only connected to n-1 and 2? Wait, no. Wait in the original cycle, vertex n is connected to vertex n-1 and vertex 1. Since vertex 1 is removed, vertex n is only connected to vertex n-1 and vertex 2? Wait, no, vertex 2 is connected to vertex 1 (gone) and vertex 3. So actually, removing vertex 1 disconnects the edges between 1-2 and 1-n. So the remaining graph is vertices 2 to n arranged in a line: 2 connected to 3, ..., n-1 connected to n, and vertex n is only connected to n-1. Wait, no, vertex 2 is connected to 3, and vertex n is connected to n-1, but vertex 2 and n are not connected. Therefore, the remaining graph is a path from 2 to n. So it's a path of length n-1 (vertices 2 through n). Therefore, the number of independent sets when the first vertex is not included is equal to P(n-1).\n\nTherefore, the recurrence is C(n) = P(n - 3) + P(n - 1). \n\nWait, let me check with small n. For n=3 (triangle), the number of independent sets on a triangle should be  C(3) = 1 (the empty set) + 3 (single vertices) = 4? Wait, actually, in a triangle, an independent set can be empty, any single vertex, but not two or three. So total 1 + 3 = 4. Let's see with the formula. If n=3, then P(n-3)=P(0). Wait, maybe my indexing is off. Wait, perhaps the path numbers need to be adjusted. Let me see:\n\nLet me define P(m) as the number of independent sets on a path of m vertices. Then for m=1, P(1)=2 (either include or not). For m=2, P(2)=3 (neither, first, second). For m=3, P(3)= P(2) + P(1) = 3 + 2 = 5? Wait, actually, for a path of 3 vertices, the independent sets are:\n\n- None: 1\n\n- 1st: 1\n\n- 2nd: 1\n\n- 3rd: 1\n\n- 1st and 3rd: 1\n\nTotal 5. So yes, P(3)=5. \n\nThen for the cycle C(3):\n\nC(3) should be P(0) + P(2). Wait, according to the recurrence above, C(n)=P(n-3)+P(n-1). For n=3, that would be P(0) + P(2). But P(0) is 1 (the empty set?), perhaps? If we define P(0)=1, then C(3)=1 + 3=4, which matches. Okay, so that works. \n\nSimilarly, for n=4:\n\nC(4)= P(1) + P(3)= 2 +5=7. Let's count manually. The independent sets on a 4-cycle:\n\n- Empty:1\n\n- Single vertices:4\n\n- Two non-adjacent vertices: 2 (since in a 4-cycle, two opposite vertices)\n\nWait, actually, in a 4-cycle, the independent sets of size 2 are two pairs of opposite vertices. So total 2. So total independent sets: 1 +4 +2 =7. That matches. \n\nTherefore, the formula C(n)= P(n-3) + P(n-1) with P(n) as path numbers, and P(0)=1, seems correct.\n\nTherefore, for n=8, let's compute C(8). First, we need P(8-3)=P(5) and P(8-1)=P(7). Let me compute P(m) up to m=7.\n\nWe have:\n\nP(0)=1\n\nP(1)=2\n\nP(2)=3\n\nP(3)=5\n\nP(4)=8 (since P(4)=P(3)+P(2)=5+3=8)\n\nP(5)= P(4)+P(3)=8+5=13\n\nP(6)= P(5)+P(4)=13+8=21\n\nP(7)= P(6)+P(5)=21+13=34\n\nTherefore, C(8)= P(5) + P(7)=13 +34=47. \n\nTherefore, the number of independent sets on an 8-cycle is 47. So for rotation k=1 (and similarly for shifts that are generators of the group, i.e., shifts by 1,3,5,7 since gcd(k,8)=1 for k=1,3,5,7), the number of subsets B where B shifted by 1 is disjoint from B is 47. Wait, but actually, in the problem, we need subsets B where B shifted by k is disjoint from B. So for shift by 1, that's exactly the independent sets on the cycle, so 47. \n\nWait, but hold on, in the problem, each vertex is colored either red or blue, so the subsets B can be any subset, but with the condition that shifting by k results in B shifted not overlapping with B. So yes, exactly the independent sets on the cycle for k=1. \n\nSimilarly, for shifts by other k's, the count may differ. For example, shift by 2. Let's see, shifting by 2. Then the condition is that B shifted by 2 is disjoint from B. So for any x in B, x +2 mod8 is not in B. So this is equivalent to B being an independent set on the graph where each vertex is connected to the vertex two apart. Wait, actually, the graph would be two separate 4-cycles? Because shifting by 2 in an 8-vertex cycle partitions the vertices into two cycles: 0,2,4,6 and 1,3,5,7. \n\nTherefore, for shift by 2, the condition that B shifted by 2 is disjoint from B is equivalent to B being an independent set on each of the two 4-cycles. \n\nSo for each of the two 4-cycles, the subset B must be an independent set on each. So the total number is (number of independent sets on a 4-cycle)^2. \n\nWait, the two 4-cycles are independent? Let me see. If the shift is 2, then the graph where edges connect each vertex to the one two steps away would actually form two separate 4-cycles. So for the condition B \u2229 (B +2) = \u2205, that requires that in each 4-cycle component, the subset is independent. Since the two components are separate, the choices are independent. \n\nThe number of independent sets on a 4-cycle is C(4)=7 as above. So for shift by 2, the number of subsets B is 7*7=49. Wait, but hold on, actually, the independent sets on each 4-cycle can be chosen independently, so yes, 7*7=49. \n\nWait, but actually, the condition is that in the entire graph (the original octagon), when shifted by 2, none of the elements of B are two apart. But since the shift by 2 would move each element two positions, so if you have a vertex x in B, then x+2 cannot be in B. But since the graph is two 4-cycles, each 4-cycle must individually have no two elements two apart? Wait, actually, in each 4-cycle, the adjacency is every other vertex. Wait, actually, in the graph where edges are between vertices two apart, each 4-cycle is actually a square where each vertex is connected to the next, so the independent sets on each 4-cycle would be the same as independent sets on a 4-cycle graph. \n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose the two 4-cycles are 0-2-4-6-0 and 1-3-5-7-1. Then in each of these, an independent set is a set of vertices with no two adjacent in that cycle. So for each 4-cycle, the number of independent sets is 7. So total is 7*7=49. \n\nSimilarly, for shift by 4, which is shifting by half the octagon. Shifting by 4, so each vertex x is mapped to x +4 mod8. The condition is that B shifted by 4 is disjoint from B. So for any x in B, x +4 is not in B. Therefore, the subset B cannot contain both a vertex and its opposite vertex. \n\nTherefore, the octagon is divided into four pairs of opposite vertices: (0,4), (1,5), (2,6), (3,7). Each pair must not have both vertices in B. So for each pair, we can choose either none or one of the two. So for each pair, 3 choices (neither, first, second). Wait, actually, no, the condition is that if you choose one, you can't choose the other, so for each pair, there are 3 possibilities: neither, first, or second. Since there are four independent pairs, the total number is 3^4 =81. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. Each pair is independent because the shift by 4 only relates the pairs. So yes, each pair can be treated separately. So 3^4=81 subsets. \n\nNow, for shift by 3. Let's see. Shifting by 3. The shift by 3, so the condition is B shifted by 3 is disjoint from B. So for any x in B, x+3 mod8 is not in B. \n\nThis is similar to shift by 1, but with step 3. Since 3 and 8 are coprime (gcd(3,8)=1), shifting by 3 is a generator, so the graph formed by connecting each vertex to x+3 mod8 is actually a single cycle of length 8. Wait, because 3 and 8 are coprime, so shifting by 3 repeatedly cycles through all 8 vertices. Therefore, the graph where edges connect each vertex to x+3 mod8 is actually two 4-cycles? Wait, no. Wait, actually, if you shift by 3 each time, starting at 0: 0, 3, 6, 1, 4, 7, 2, 5, 0. So this forms a single cycle of length 8. Wait, because 3*2=6 mod8, 3*3=9 mod8=1, so after 8 steps, you get back. So actually, it's a single 8-cycle. Therefore, the condition that B shifted by 3 is disjoint from B is equivalent to B being an independent set on an 8-cycle. Wait, but in this case, the edges are between vertices 3 apart. So actually, the graph is an 8-cycle where each vertex is connected to the one three steps ahead. But since 3 and 8 are coprime, it's a single cycle. So the independent sets here would be the same as independent sets on an 8-cycle, so again 47. \n\nWait, but actually, shifting by 3 is equivalent to shifting by -5, so maybe the graph is the same as shifting by 1 but in the other direction. Since the cycle is undirected, the independent sets count should be the same as for shifting by 1. So 47 again. \n\nSimilarly, shifting by 5 is equivalent to shifting by -3, so same as shifting by 3, so also 47. Shifting by 7 is equivalent to shifting by -1, so same as shifting by 1, so 47. \n\nShifting by 6 is equivalent to shifting by -2, so same as shifting by 2, so 49. \n\nShifting by 4 we already did, which gives 81. \n\nShifting by 0 gives 1 (only the empty set). \n\nTherefore, summarizing, for each shift k:\n\n- k=0: 1\n\n- k=1,3,5,7: 47 each\n\n- k=2,6: 49 each\n\n- k=4:81\n\nTherefore, the total over all shifts of |A_k| is 1 + 4*47 + 2*49 + 81. Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, 4*47 = 188\n\n2*49=98\n\nAdding up: 1 + 188 + 98 +81 = 1 + 188 is 189, +98 is 287, +81 is 368. So total Sum |A_k| = 368.\n\nBut the problem is that when we take the union over all A_k, we have overlaps where a subset B is in multiple A_k's. So to compute the union, we need inclusion-exclusion. \n\nHowever, inclusion-exclusion over 8 sets is complicated, but maybe we can find symmetries or use M\u00f6bius inversion over the group. Alternatively, perhaps we can note that some of these shifts are related via group theory. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the total number using M\u00f6bius inversion over the cyclic group. Wait, maybe using the principle from combinatorics for counting the number of colorings with at least one symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps Burnside's lemma is applicable here, but the problem is not about counting orbits, but rather colorings with some property related to rotations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's manageable to compute the total number as follows:\n\nLet me denote the set of all subsets B as the universe. We need to count the number of B such that there exists a rotation k where B rotated by k is disjoint from B. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the complementary probability is easier? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as for each B, it is counted in the union over all A_k, so the total is the sum over all B of the number of k such that B rotated by k is disjoint from B, divided by ... Wait, no. Wait, actually, the total number is the number of B such that there exists at least one k where B is in A_k. So the count is |Union A_k|.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the principle that |Union A_k| = Sum |A_k| - Sum |A_k \u2229 A_j| + Sum |A_k \u2229 A_j \u2229 A_m| - ... \n\nBut this is going to be complicated. Let me see if there is a smarter way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each subset B, the number of rotations k for which B rotated by k is disjoint from B is equal to the number of k such that B \u2229 (B +k) = \u2205. Let\u2019s denote this number as N(B). Then the total over all B of N(B) is equal to the sum over k |A_k|. Which we computed as 368. \n\nBut we need the number of B with N(B) \u22651. \n\nThe total over all B of N(B) = 368. The total number of subsets is 256. So the average N(B) is 368 /256 \u22481.4375. \n\nBut we need the number of subsets with N(B) \u22651. Let me denote this as S. Then S = Sum_{B} [N(B) \u22651]. \n\nWe can relate this via inclusion-exclusion: S = Sum_{B} (1 - [N(B)=0]). So S = 256 - Sum_{B} [N(B)=0]. \n\nTherefore, if we can compute the number of subsets B for which there is no rotation k (including identity) such that B rotated by k is disjoint from B. That is, for all k, B rotated by k intersects B. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to computing 256 minus the number of such \"bad\" subsets B where for every rotation k, B rotated by k intersects B. \n\nHmm, maybe this is easier? Let me think.\n\nSo let me denote T as the number of subsets B where for all k in 0,...,7, B rotated by k intersects B. Then the desired answer is 256 - T. \n\nSo now the question becomes: compute T, the number of subsets B such that for every rotation k, B and B +k share at least one common vertex. \n\nHmm, how can we compute T?\n\nAlternatively, note that if a subset B has the property that for every rotation k, B and B +k intersect, then in particular, for k=0, B must intersect itself, which is always true unless B is empty. Wait, but if B is empty, then B rotated by any k is also empty, so B and B +k are both empty, which are disjoint. Wait, but for the empty set, for every k, B rotated by k is empty, so the intersection is empty. Therefore, the empty set does not satisfy the condition for T, because for all k, B and B +k are disjoint. Wait, so actually, the empty set is in the complement of T. \n\nWait, actually, T is the set of subsets where for every rotation k, B and B +k have a non-empty intersection. So the empty set cannot be in T because for any k, B rotated by k is empty, so the intersection is empty. Similarly, the full set (all vertices blue) would have B rotated by any k is the full set, so the intersection with B (the full set) is the full set, so they do intersect. Wait, but the full set: if B is the full set, then B rotated by any k is also the full set, so the intersection is the full set, so yes, it does intersect. So the full set is in T. \n\nWait, let me confirm. For the full set, since all vertices are blue, then for any rotation k, B +k is also the full set, so B and B +k both are the full set, so their intersection is the full set. So yes, they intersect. So the full set is in T. \n\nSo T includes all subsets except those that can be rotated to be disjoint from themselves. Wait, actually, T is the set of subsets B where for every rotation k, B and B +k share at least one common vertex. \n\nHmm, this seems tricky. Let me think if there are any subsets other than the full set that satisfy this. For example, suppose B is a singleton {0}. Then rotating by 1, B +1 = {1}, which doesn't intersect {0}, so singleton subsets are not in T. \n\nSimilarly, a pair of adjacent vertices: {0,1}. Rotating by 1 gives {1,2}, which intersects at 1, so the intersection is non-empty. Rotating by 2 gives {2,3}, which doesn't intersect {0,1}, so the intersection is empty. Hence, the pair {0,1} is not in T. \n\nHmm, so maybe only the full set is in T? Wait, let's check the full set. \n\nWait, let me think of another example. Suppose B is the entire set except one vertex. Say, missing vertex 0. Then rotating by 1 would shift all vertices, so B +1 is missing vertex 1. The intersection between B and B+1 is all vertices except 0 and 1. Which is non-empty. Similarly, rotating by any k, B +k is missing vertex k. So the intersection between B and B +k is all vertices except 0 and k, which is non-empty as long as n \u22653. Since we have 8 vertices, yes. So in this case, the set with one vertex removed is in T? Let me check for k=8 (but mod8 it's 0). Wait, rotating by k=0, B is missing 0, so B rotated by 0 is itself, so the intersection is B, which is non-empty. For any other k, the intersection is missing two vertices, but since the total is 7, the intersection is 6 vertices, so non-empty. So yes, such a set would be in T. \n\nWait, so actually, subsets that are co-prime in some way?\n\nWait, let me check another example. Suppose B is four vertices, every other vertex: {0,2,4,6}. Let's see. Rotating by 1: {1,3,5,7}. The intersection is empty. Therefore, this set is not in T. \n\nAnother example: suppose B is three consecutive vertices {0,1,2}. Rotating by 1 gives {1,2,3}, which intersects at 1 and 2. Rotating by 2 gives {2,3,4}, which intersects at 2. Rotating by 3 gives {3,4,5}, which does not intersect with {0,1,2}. Therefore, rotating by 3, the intersection is empty. Thus, this set is not in T.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the only subsets in T are those that are \"dense\" enough that no rotation can shift them to be disjoint? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the full set is in T, and some other subsets. Let me check the complement of a singleton: as above, missing one vertex. Let's see, if B is missing vertex 0, then rotating by k=0 gives itself, so intersection is non-empty. Rotating by k=1 gives the set missing vertex 1, so intersection is all except 0 and1, which is non-empty. Similarly for any k, the intersection is missing two vertices, so as long as 8 -2 \u22651, which it is, so intersections are non-empty. So yes, the complement of a singleton is in T. \n\nSimilarly, the complement of two vertices: say missing 0 and1. Let's see, rotating by k=2, then the shifted set misses 2 and 3. The intersection between the original (missing 0,1) and the shifted (missing 2,3) is all vertices except 0,1,2,3. Which is 4 vertices remaining, so non-empty. Wait, but actually, the intersection is the set of vertices not in the union of the two missing sets. Since missing sets are {0,1} and {2,3}, their union is {0,1,2,3}, so the intersection is vertices 4,5,6,7. Non-empty. \n\nBut what if we rotate by k=4? The shifted set would miss 4 and5. The intersection with original (missing 0,1) would be vertices not in {0,1} union {4,5}, so vertices 2,3,6,7. Still non-empty. \n\nWhat about rotating by k=5? Shifted set misses 5 and6. Original misses 0,1. Intersection is vertices not in {0,1,5,6} which are 2,3,4,7. Non-empty. \n\nWait, seems like even the complement of two vertices is in T? \n\nWait, but let me check another rotation. Let me take a different example. Suppose B is missing three vertices: {0,1,2}. Then the complement has 5 vertices. Let me check rotating by k=3. The shifted set would be missing 3,4,5. The original missing set is {0,1,2}, so the intersection between B (the original complement, which is {3,4,5,6,7}) and the shifted set (which is missing 3,4,5, so the shifted B is {0,1,2,6,7} rotated by 3? Wait, no. Wait, actually, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:\n\nIf B is the complement of {0,1,2}, so B = {3,4,5,6,7}. Rotating B by k=3 would give {6,7,0,1,2}. The intersection between B and B+3 is {3,4,5,6,7} intersect {6,7,0,1,2} = {6,7}, which is non-empty. \n\nRotating by k=1: B+1 = {4,5,6,7,0}. Intersection with B is {4,5,6,7} intersect {3,4,5,6,7} = {4,5,6,7}, non-empty. \n\nWhat about rotating by k=5: B+5 would be {8,9,10,11,12} mod8, which is {0,1,2,3,4}. The intersection with B={3,4,5,6,7} is {3,4}, which is non-empty. \n\nHmm, so even the complement of three vertices is in T. \n\nWait, so maybe all subsets except those that can be rotated to be disjoint are in T? Wait, but how do we characterize T?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T includes all subsets except those that are \"disjoint from some rotation of themselves\". So the only subsets not in T are those that can be rotated to be disjoint from themselves, which are exactly the subsets counted in the complement. \n\nWait, but how many subsets are in T? It seems like even large subsets are in T, except the empty set. Wait, the empty set is definitely not in T. The full set is in T. The singleton subsets are not in T. The pair subsets? Let me check a pair. Suppose B is {0,1}. As before, rotating by k=2 gives {2,3}, which doesn't intersect with {0,1}, so this B is not in T. \n\nWait, so perhaps T consists of all subsets except those that are \"small\" in some sense. Maybe subsets with at least 4 elements? Not sure. Wait, let's check a 4-element subset. Suppose B is {0,1,2,3}. Rotating by k=4 gives {4,5,6,7}, which doesn't intersect with {0,1,2,3}. So that subset is not in T. \n\nHmm, so even 4-element subsets can be excluded. \n\nAlternatively, maybe subsets whose size is more than half the octagon? Since if a subset has more than 4 elements, then its complement has less than 4, so maybe shifting could cause overlap? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only subsets in T are those where for every rotation, the subset and its rotation share at least one common element. This might only be true for the full set and some other large subsets. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of group actions. Since the group is cyclic of order 8, the orbits of subsets under rotation can be considered. However, since we are dealing with subsets that have the property that no rotation shifts them to be disjoint, it might be complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of trying to compute T directly, we can compute the desired probability using M\u00f6bius inversion over the rotation group. \n\nWait, let's recall that the total number we need is S = 256 - T. \n\nAlternatively, maybe T is small. Let me see for small subsets:\n\n- The empty set: not in T.\n\n- Singletons: not in T.\n\n- Pairs: as above, many not in T.\n\n- Triplets: maybe some are in T?\n\nTake a triplet, say {0,1,3}. Let's see rotating by 1: {1,2,4}. Intersection with original {0,1,3} is {1}. So okay. Rotating by 2: {2,3,5}. Intersection with original {0,1,3} is {3}. Rotating by 3: {3,4,6}. Intersection with original {0,1,3} is {3}. Rotating by 4: {4,5,7}. No intersection with {0,1,3}? Wait, original B is {0,1,3}, rotated by 4 is {4,5,7}. The intersection is empty. Therefore, this triplet is not in T. \n\nHmm. So even some triplets are not in T. \n\nHow about a 5-element subset? Let's take the complement of two vertices, say missing 0 and1, so B has 6 vertices. Let's see rotating by 2: shifted set misses 2 and3. The intersection between B (missing 0,1) and shifted B (missing 2,3) is vertices 4,5,6,7. So non-empty. Rotating by 3: shifted set misses 3,4. Intersection with B (missing 0,1) is vertices 2,5,6,7. Still non-empty. Rotating by 4: shifted set misses 4,5. Intersection with B (missing 0,1) is vertices 2,3,6,7. Non-empty. Rotating by 5: shifted set misses 5,6. Intersection with B is vertices 0,1 (but they are excluded?), wait no, B is missing 0,1, so original B is {2,3,4,5,6,7}. Rotated by 5 gives {7,0,1,2,3,4} (since 5 mod8: 0+5=5, but missing vertices are shifted by 5: original missing are 0 and1, so shifted missing are 5 and6. Therefore shifted B is all except 5 and6, so {0,1,2,3,4,7}. The intersection with original B (missing 0,1) is {2,3,4,7}, which is non-empty. \n\nContinuing, rotating by 6: shifted set misses 6 and7. The intersection with B (missing 0,1) is vertices 2,3,4,5. Non-empty. \n\nRotating by 7: shifted set misses 7 and0 (since shift by7: original missing 0 and1 become 7 and0). Wait, the shifted set would be missing 0 and1 shifted by7: so 0+7 mod8=7, 1+7=8 mod8=0. So missing vertices are 7 and0. Original B is missing 0 and1. So shifted B is missing 7 and0. The intersection between B and shifted B is the set not missing 0,1 or 7,0. Wait, original B is missing 0,1, so has {2,3,4,5,6,7}. Shifted B is missing 7,0, so has {1,2,3,4,5,6}. The intersection is {2,3,4,5,6}. Non-empty. \n\nTherefore, this 6-element subset is in T. \n\nHmm, so subsets that are missing a small number of vertices (like 1 or 2) are in T. What about missing 3 vertices? Let's take B missing 0,1,2. So B has 5 vertices: {3,4,5,6,7}. Rotating by 3: shifted set is {6,7,0,1,2}. The intersection with B is {6,7}, non-empty. Rotating by 1: shifted set is {4,5,6,7,0}, intersection with B is {4,5,6,7}, non-empty. Rotating by 4: shifted set is {7,0,1,2,3}, intersection with B is {7,3}, non-empty. Rotating by 5: shifted set is {0,1,2,3,4}, intersection with B is {3,4}, non-empty. Rotating by 2: shifted set is {5,6,7,0,1}, intersection with B is {5,6,7}, non-empty. Rotating by 6: shifted set is {1,2,3,4,5}, intersection with B is {3,4,5}, non-empty. Rotating by 7: shifted set is {2,3,4,5,6}, intersection with B is {3,4,5,6}, non-empty. So yes, even this 5-element subset is in T. \n\nHow about missing 4 vertices? Let's take B missing 0,1,2,3, so B is {4,5,6,7}. Rotating by 4: shifted set is {0,1,2,3}, which doesn't intersect with B. So this subset is not in T. \n\nTherefore, subsets missing 4 vertices (size 4) may or may not be in T depending on their arrangement. Wait, in this case, the subset {4,5,6,7} when rotated by 4 becomes {0,1,2,3}, which is disjoint, so this subset is not in T. \n\nHmm. So subsets with exactly 4 elements can be in T or not? Let me check another 4-element subset. Say, {0,2,4,6}. Rotating by 1 gives {1,3,5,7}, which is disjoint. So this subset is not in T. \n\nAnother 4-element subset: {0,1,3,4}. Rotating by 2: {2,3,5,6}. Intersection with original is {3}. Rotating by 4: {4,5,7,0}. Intersection is {0,4}. Rotating by 3: {3,4,6,7}. Intersection with original {0,1,3,4} is {3,4}. Rotating by 5: {5,6,0,1}. Intersection is {0,1}. Rotating by 6: {6,7,1,2}. Intersection is {1}. Rotating by 7: {7,0,2,3}. Intersection is {0,2,3}. So for this subset, every rotation results in an intersection. Hence, this 4-element subset is in T? \n\nWait, let me confirm. Let's see rotating by k=2: shifted set is {2,3,5,6}. Original B is {0,1,3,4}. The intersection is {3}. Non-empty. \n\nRotating by k=5: shifted set is {5,6,0,1}. Original B has 0 and1, so intersection is {0,1}. \n\nRotating by k=4: shifted set is {4,5,7,0}. Original has 0 and4, so intersection {0,4}. \n\nRotating by k=6: shifted set {6,7,1,2}. Original has 1, so intersection {1}. \n\nRotating by k=7: shifted set {7,0,2,3}. Original has 0 and3, so intersection {0,3}. \n\nSo yes, all rotations give non-empty intersections. So this particular 4-element subset is in T. \n\nTherefore, some 4-element subsets are in T and some are not. So it's not straightforward. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the only way to compute T is to consider all subsets and see if they meet the condition, but this would be time-consuming. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for a subset B to be in T (i.e., for every rotation k, B \u2229 (B +k) \u2260 \u2205), then B must be such that it cannot be partitioned into two subsets that are rotations of each other. Wait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, note that if a subset B is \"rotationally dense\", meaning that it intersects all its rotations, then it's in T. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only subsets not in T are those that can be partitioned into two or more rotated copies of themselves. For example, if B is a subset such that B +k = B complement for some k, then rotating by 2k would give B again? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of T as the subsets B where the subgroup generated by the rotations that map B to itself is the whole group. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute T using M\u00f6bius inversion over the rotation group. Let me consider the cyclic group C8 acting on the subsets. For a subset B, the number of k where B and B +k are disjoint is N(B). We want T to be the number of subsets with N(B)=0. \n\nWait, actually, T is the number of subsets where N(B)=0. Because T is the number of subsets where for all k, B and B +k intersect, i.e., there is no k where they are disjoint. So N(B)=0. \n\nTherefore, T = number of subsets B with N(B)=0. \n\nThe total over all subsets of N(B) is Sum_{B} N(B) = Sum_{k} |A_k| = 368 as computed earlier. \n\nWe can also compute the second moment, but that might not help directly. \n\nAlternatively, using generating functions or some other method. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion but in a different way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that for a subset B to have N(B)=0, it must satisfy that for every rotation k, B and B +k intersect. \n\nThis is equivalent to saying that the subset B is intersected by all its rotations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only subsets in T are the full set and the subsets whose complement is \"rotationally sparse\". \n\nAlternatively, note that the full set is in T. Also, any subset whose complement is a singleton is in T. Similarly, subsets whose complement is two vertices not opposite each other. Wait, but when we had the complement of two vertices, like {0,1}, then rotating by 2 gives the shifted complement missing {2,3}, so the intersection with original complement (missing {0,1}) is non-empty. So yes. \n\nWait, maybe all subsets except those that can be partitioned into orbits under rotation. For example, if B is a single orbit under rotation, then rotating by the step of the orbit would shift it to itself, but other rotations might displace it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is too vague. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the problem in terms of the complement. Let R be the red set, which is the complement of B. The condition is that there exists a rotation k such that B rotated by k is a subset of R. Since R = complement of B, this is equivalent to B rotated by k and B are disjoint. \n\nTherefore, the original problem's desired count is the number of subsets B for which there exists a rotation k such that B rotated by k is disjoint from B. \n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to counting the number of subsets B for which there exists some rotation k where B and B +k are disjoint. \n\nTherefore, the count we need is exactly the size of the union of all A_k, which we earlier denoted as S = |Union A_k|. \n\nWe had computed that the total over all |A_k| is 368, but we need to subtract overlaps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can compute this using M\u00f6bius inversion over the group. Let me recall that in group actions, the number of subsets fixed by some group element can be counted via Burnside's lemma, but here we are dealing with a different condition. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for each rotation k, the set A_k consists of subsets B where B and B +k are disjoint. Note that A_0 is only the empty set. \n\nThe total number we need is |Union_{k=0}^7 A_k|. \n\nTo compute this, perhaps inclusion-exclusion is necessary, but it's going to be tedious. Let me see if there's a pattern or symmetry. \n\nFirst, note that the group of rotations is cyclic of order 8. The shifts k can be categorized by their gcd with 8:\n\n- k=0: gcd(0,8)=8\n\n- k=1,3,5,7: gcd(1,8)=1\n\n- k=2,6: gcd(2,8)=2\n\n- k=4: gcd(4,8)=4\n\nTherefore, shifts can be grouped by their gcd. \n\nLet me consider the shifts in terms of their order. \n\nFor each divisor d of 8 (i.e., d=1,2,4,8), the shifts with gcd(k,8)=d correspond to rotations of order 8/d. \n\nFor example:\n\n- d=1: rotations with gcd(k,8)=1 (order 8): k=1,3,5,7\n\n- d=2: rotations with gcd(k,8)=2 (order 4): k=2,6\n\n- d=4: rotation with gcd(k,8)=4 (order 2): k=4\n\n- d=8: rotation with gcd(k,8)=8 (order 1): k=0\n\nTherefore, perhaps we can categorize the shifts by their gcd, and compute the inclusion-exclusion terms accordingly. \n\nLet me denote the shifts by their gcd:\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let S_1 be the set of shifts with gcd 1: k=1,3,5,7 (order 8)\n\n- S_2: gcd 2: k=2,6 (order4)\n\n- S_4: gcd4: k=4 (order2)\n\n- S_8: gcd8: k=0 (order1)\n\nNow, the shifts in S_d have order 8/d. \n\nNow, to compute |Union A_k|, we can think in terms of the orbits or cosets. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the principle from combinatorics where the inclusion-exclusion can be simplified by considering the group structure. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for two shifts k and j, the intersection A_k \u2229 A_j is the set of subsets B such that B is disjoint from both B +k and B +j. \n\nThis is equivalent to B being disjoint from (B +k) and (B +j). \n\nAlternatively, B must be disjoint from both its k-rotation and its j-rotation. \n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps for some k and j, the intersection can be expressed in terms of the gcd of k and j. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's manageable to compute the first few terms of inclusion-exclusion. \n\nFirst, the first term is Sum |A_k| = 368.\n\nSecond term: subtract Sum |A_k \u2229 A_j| for all k < j. \n\nThird term: add Sum |A_k \u2229 A_j \u2229 A_m| for all triples, etc. \n\nBut this is going to be very tedious. Maybe we can find a smarter way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the fact that the problem is about the union over all A_k, and each A_k corresponds to a rotation, and use M\u00f6bius inversion over the rotation group. \n\nAlternatively, note that the problem is analogous to counting the number of subsets B such that B is \"avoided\" by at least one rotation, i.e., B is contained in the complement of its rotated image. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number can be computed as follows:\n\nFor each non-empty subset B, the number of rotations k for which B is disjoint from B +k is N(B). The total over all B of N(B) is 368. \n\nWe need the number of B with N(B) \u22651. \n\nThe total number of subsets with N(B) \u22651 is equal to Sum_{B} [N(B) \u22651] = Sum_{B} (1 - [N(B)=0]) = 2^8 - T = 256 - T. \n\nTherefore, if we can compute T (number of subsets with N(B)=0), we can get the desired count. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps T can be computed using M\u00f6bius inversion. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the problem in terms of the following: For a subset B to have N(B)=0, it must intersect every rotation of itself. This is a very restrictive condition. \n\nPerhaps the only such subsets are the full set and the complements of very small subsets. Wait, but earlier examples showed that subsets missing 1 or 2 vertices are in T. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\n- The full set: N(B)=0, because rotating it never results in a disjoint set (since it's always itself). Wait, but actually, rotating the full set gives the full set, so the intersection is the full set, which is non-empty. Therefore, N(B)=0 for the full set. \n\n- The empty set: N(B)=8 (since for any rotation, empty set rotated is empty, which is disjoint from itself, so N(empty set)=8). So the empty set is not in T. \n\n- A singleton set {x}: N(B) is the number of k where rotating {x} by k results in a set disjoint from {x}. The rotated set is {x +k}, so to be disjoint from {x}, we need x +k \u2260x mod8 \u21d2 k\u22600. So for any k\u22600, the singleton rotated by k is a different singleton, so disjoint. Therefore, N(B)=7 for a singleton. Hence, singleton subsets are not in T. \n\n- A pair of vertices: Let\u2019s consider two vertices {x,y}. The number N(B) is the number of k where rotating B by k results in a set disjoint from B. \n\nThe rotated set is {x+k, y+k}. To be disjoint from B={x,y}, we need both x+k \u2260x, y and y+k \u2260x, y. \n\nAlternatively, the rotated set must not contain x or y. \n\nThe number of such k is equal to the number of shifts where neither x+k \u2261x mod8 nor x+k \u2261y mod8, and similarly for y+k. \n\nThis seems complex. Alternatively, for a pair of vertices separated by distance d, the number of shifts where the rotated pair doesn't intersect the original pair can vary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only subsets with N(B)=0 are the full set and those subsets where every rotation of B intersects B. \n\nThis seems very restrictive. Perhaps only the full set and the subsets that are \"maximally overlapping\" with all their rotations. \n\nWait, the full set is one. What about the entire set except one vertex? Let's see: \n\nTake B = all except {0}. Then for any shift k, B +k is all except {k}. The intersection between B and B +k is all except {0} and {k}. Which is 6 elements, so non-empty. Hence, N(B)=0, so it is in T. \n\nSimilarly, subsets missing two vertices: missing {0,1}. Then for any k, B +k is missing {k, k+1}. The intersection is all except {0,1} union {k, k+1}. The size is 8 - 4 =4 (if the missing sets don't overlap) or 8-3=5 (if they do). Either way, it's non-empty, so N(B)=0. So they are in T. \n\nSubsets missing three vertices: Let\u2019s take B missing {0,1,2}. For any shift k, B +k is missing {k,k+1,k+2}. The intersection is all except {0,1,2} union {k,k+1,k+2}. The size is 8 - (3 +3 - overlap). The overlap between the missing sets is the intersection of {0,1,2} and {k,k+1,k+2}. \n\nIf the missing sets don't overlap, the intersection would be 8-6=2 vertices, which is non-empty. If they do overlap, maybe 8-5=3. Either way, non-empty. Hence, N(B)=0. So subsets missing three vertices are in T. \n\nSubsets missing four vertices: Let's take B missing four vertices. If the four missing vertices form a block like {0,1,2,3}, then rotating by 4 would give a shifted missing set {4,5,6,7}, so the intersection between B and B+4 is empty (since the missing sets are complementary). Thus N(B)\u22651 (specifically, at least the shift by4), so such a subset is not in T. \n\nHowever, if the four missing vertices are arranged such that no rotation shifts them to be disjoint from themselves, then they would be in T. For example, the subset missing every other vertex {0,2,4,6}. Rotating by 1 gives missing {1,3,5,7}, which is disjoint from the original missing set, so N(B)= at least 1 (shift by1), so not in T. \n\nAlternatively, a different four-missing subset. Let's try missing {0,1,3,4}. Then rotating by 2 gives missing {2,3,5,6}. The intersection between original missing {0,1,3,4} and shifted missing {2,3,5,6} is {3}, so the intersection of the subsets B and B+2 is all except those missing sets: 8 - (4 +4 -1) =1? Wait, actually, the intersection of B and B+2 is the set not missing in both: which is the complement of the union of the two missing sets. \n\nOriginal missing: {0,1,3,4}\n\nShifted missing (k=2): {2,3,5,6}\n\nUnion of missing sets: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}\n\nThus the intersection (common elements not missing) is {7}. So non-empty. \n\nRotating by k=5: shifted missing is {5,6,8,9} mod8 \u2192 {5,6,0,1}\n\nOriginal missing: {0,1,3,4}\n\nUnion of missing sets: {0,1,3,4,5,6}\n\nIntersection is {2,7}. Non-empty. \n\nRotating by k=4: shifted missing is {4,5,7,0}\n\nOriginal missing: {0,1,3,4}\n\nUnion: {0,1,3,4,5,7}\n\nIntersection: {2,6}. Non-empty. \n\nRotating by k=1: shifted missing is {1,2,4,5}\n\nOriginal missing: {0,1,3,4}\n\nUnion: {0,1,2,3,4,5}\n\nIntersection: {6,7}. Non-empty. \n\nRotating by k=6: shifted missing is {6,7,1,2}\n\nOriginal missing: {0,1,3,4}\n\nUnion: {0,1,2,3,4,6,7}\n\nIntersection: {5}. Non-empty. \n\nRotating by k=3: shifted missing is {3,4,6,7}\n\nOriginal missing: {0,1,3,4}\n\nUnion: {0,1,3,4,6,7}\n\nIntersection: {2,5}. Non-empty. \n\nRotating by k=7: shifted missing is {7,0,2,3}\n\nOriginal missing: {0,1,3,4}\n\nUnion: {0,1,2,3,4,7}\n\nIntersection: {5,6}. Non-empty. \n\nTherefore, this subset missing {0,1,3,4} is in T. \n\nSo some four-missing subsets are in T. \n\nHmm, so it's quite involved. Perhaps the only subsets not in T are those which can be partitioned into two equal parts that are rotations of each other. For example, if B is the first four vertices, then rotating by four shifts it to the second four, which are disjoint. Hence, N(B) is at least1. \n\nTherefore, subsets that are \"rotationally balanced\" in some way may not be in T. \n\nAlternatively, given the complexity, perhaps it's better to try to compute T using M\u00f6bius inversion over the group. \n\nLet me recall that in group actions, the number of subsets fixed by a rotation k is 2^{8 / gcd(k,8)}, since the rotation partitions the octagon into gcd(k,8) cycles of length 8/gcd(k,8). Each cycle must be colored uniformly for the subset to be fixed. \n\nBut in our case, we are not counting fixed subsets, but subsets that are disjoint from their rotated image. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use generating functions. \n\nLet me consider that for each subset B, the indicator variable for B being in T is 1 if for all k, B \u2229 (B +k) \u2260 \u2205. \n\nThe total T is the number of subsets where this holds. \n\nTo compute this, perhaps we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion where we subtract those subsets that have at least one k where they are disjoint, then add back those with two, etc. But this is the same as the inclusion-exclusion we were discussing earlier. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps approximate or find a pattern. \n\nAlternatively, notice that the total number we need is S = 256 - T. \n\nIf we can compute S = |Union A_k| = Sum |A_k| - Sum |A_k \u2229 A_j| + ... \n\nBut this requires computation of all terms, which is time-consuming. \n\nAlternatively, note that the problem is asking for the probability, so maybe the answer is known or has a standard form. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of subsets in the union is equal to the sum over rotations of |A_k| minus overlaps. \n\nAlternatively, let me try to compute some of the intersections. \n\nFirst, compute |A_0 \u2229 A_1|. A_0 is only the empty set. A_1 is the independent sets on the 8-cycle (47). The intersection is the empty set, since the empty set is in A_1 (since shifting the empty set gives itself, which is disjoint from itself? Wait, the empty set rotated by 1 is empty, so the intersection is empty set with itself, which is empty. So the condition for A_1 is that B shifted by1 is disjoint from B. For the empty set, this holds, so the empty set is in A_1. Hence, A_0 is exactly {empty set}, and A_1 includes the empty set. Therefore, A_0 \u2229 A_1 = {empty set}, so size 1. \n\nSimilarly, intersections between A_0 and any other A_k will also be the empty set except when the other A_k includes the empty set. Since all A_k include the empty set (since the empty set rotated is empty, which is disjoint from itself). Therefore, A_0 is a subset of every A_k. So for any k, A_0 \u2229 A_k = A_0, which has size1. \n\nNow, moving on to intersections between two non-zero A_k and A_j. \n\nLet's pick A_1 and A_2. \n\nA_1 is subsets B where B is an independent set on the 8-cycle (shift by1). \n\nA_2 is subsets B where B is an independent set on the two 4-cycles (shift by2). \n\nTherefore, the intersection A_1 \u2229 A_2 is the set of subsets B that are independent sets on both the 8-cycle and the two 4-cycles. \n\nWait, being an independent set on the 8-cycle (shift by1) requires that no two consecutive vertices are in B. \n\nBeing an independent set on the two 4-cycles (shift by2) requires that in each 4-cycle (0,2,4,6) and (1,3,5,7), no two vertices two apart are in B. \n\nWait, actually, for shift by2, the condition is that B and B +2 are disjoint, which means that for any vertex x in B, x+2 is not in B. \n\nTherefore, on each 4-cycle (even and odd), the subset B must be an independent set on each 4-cycle. \n\nAn independent set on a 4-cycle allows no two adjacent vertices. Since the 4-cycle for even vertices is 0-2-4-6-0, so adjacent means consecutive even numbers. Similarly for the odd cycle. \n\nTherefore, an independent set on each 4-cycle can have at most two vertices, non-adjacent. \n\nBut also, for shift by1, the independent set on the 8-cycle requires that no two consecutive vertices are in B. \n\nTherefore, the intersection A_1 \u2229 A_2 requires that B is an independent set on both the 8-cycle and each 4-cycle. \n\nThis would further restrict B. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose B is {0,4}. \n\n- Check for shift1: 0 and4 are two apart, so consecutive? No, they are two apart, but in the 8-cycle, consecutive would be 0 and1. So {0,4} is okay for shift1 (since no consecutive vertices). \n\n- For shift2: within the even 4-cycle 0,2,4,6, {0,4} are two apart (since 0 and2 are adjacent, 0 and4 are two steps apart). Wait in the 4-cycle 0-2-4-6, the adjacency is 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-0. So 0 and4 are not adjacent in the 4-cycle, so they can be both in the subset. \n\nTherefore, {0,4} is in both A_1 and A_2. \n\nAnother example: {0,2}. \n\n- For shift1: 0 and2 are two apart, so not consecutive. So okay for A_1. \n\n- For shift2: in the even 4-cycle, 0 and2 are adjacent (since 0-2 is an edge), so they cannot both be in B. Thus, {0,2} is not in A_2. \n\nTherefore, the intersection A_1 \u2229 A_2 requires that in each 4-cycle, no two adjacent vertices are present, which is stricter than the 8-cycle condition. \n\nTherefore, the intersection A_1 \u2229 A_2 is the set of subsets that are independent on both the 8-cycle and each 4-cycle. \n\nThis is equivalent to being an independent set on the graph that is the union of the 8-cycle and the two 4-cycles? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the conditions for A_1 and A_2 together require that:\n\n- No two consecutive vertices (for shift1).\n\n- No two vertices two apart (for shift2). \n\nTherefore, combining these, the subset B cannot have any two vertices at distance 1 or 2. \n\nOn an 8-vertex cycle, the distance between vertices can be 1,2,3,4. \n\nTherefore, the combined condition is that any two vertices in B must be at least distance 3 apart. \n\nTherefore, the maximum size of such a subset is floor(8/3) =2 or something? Let's see:\n\nPossible subsets:\n\n- Single vertices: allowed.\n\n- Pairs: must be at least distance 3 apart. For example, 0 and3, 0 and4 (distance4), etc.\n\nWait, distance3 is allowed? Wait, the condition is that they cannot be at distance1 or 2. So distance3 or more is okay. \n\nSo pairs like {0,3}: distance3 is okay.\n\n{0,4}: distance4 is okay. \n\nTherefore, such subsets are allowed. \n\nThe total number of subsets satisfying both A_1 and A_2 would be the number of subsets where any two vertices are at least distance3 apart. \n\nThis is similar to placing non-attacking kings on a circle (since they can't be adjacent or two apart). \n\nThe number of such subsets can be computed recursively or via formula. \n\nLet me think of it as an independent set on the graph where edges connect vertices at distance1 or2. \n\nThis graph is the union of the 8-cycle and its \"square\" (edges two apart). \n\nThis graph is actually the complement of the path graph where edges are only between vertices at distance\u22653. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to count them. Let me denote the vertices as 0-7 arranged in a circle. \n\nWe need subsets where no two are within two steps. \n\nLet me consider the number of such subsets. \n\nThis is similar to the problem of counting independent sets on the graph where each vertex is connected to its two neighbors and the next two. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model it as a recurrence. \n\nLet me denote f(n) as the number of subsets of an n-vertex cycle where no two vertices are within distance2. \n\nWe need f(8). \n\nFor a linear chain (path), the recurrence would be different, but for a cycle, it's a bit more involved. \n\nLet me try to derive the recurrence. \n\nSuppose we have a cycle of n vertices. Let's fix vertex 0. \n\nCase1: vertex0 is not included. Then the remaining n-1 vertices form a cycle of n-1 vertices (since it's a cycle, removing vertex0 leaves a path from1 ton, but with vertex1 adjacent ton). Wait, no, actually, removing vertex0 from a cycle leaves a path from1 ton with vertex1 connected to2 and vertexn connected ton-1, but not to vertex1. So it's a path, not a cycle. \n\nTherefore, the remaining is a path of n-1 vertices (1 ton), and we need the number of independent sets on that path where no two are within distance2. \n\nWait, but the condition is that no two are within distance2 on the original cycle. Since we removed vertex0, the distance between vertex1 and vertexn is n-1 in the original cycle, which is more than2, so it's okay. \n\nTherefore, the count is equal to the number of subsets for the path of n-1 vertices with the same distance condition. \n\nCase2: vertex0 is included. Then vertices1 and2 and n-1 (vertex7 if n=8) cannot be included. The remaining vertices from2 to n-2 (vertices2 to6) form a path of n-3 vertices (since vertices1 and n are excluded). \n\nWait, actually, if we include vertex0, then vertices1 and7 cannot be included (distance1), and vertices2 and6 cannot be included (distance2). Wait, distance2 from0 is vertices2 and6 (since on a cycle, vertex0's distance2 vertices are 2 and6). \n\nWait, hold on, in the original problem, the distance is along the cycle, so the distance between0 and2 is2, and between0 and6 is also2 (since the other direction). \n\nTherefore, including vertex0 excludes vertices1,2,7,6. \n\nTherefore, the remaining available vertices are3,4,5. \n\nWait for n=8, if we include vertex0, then vertices1,2,6,7 are excluded. The remaining vertices are3,4,5. \n\nThese form a path of3 vertices (3-4-5), and the condition is that no two are within distance2 on the original cycle. \n\nBut on this path, the distance between3 and4 is1, which is allowed as long as they are not within2 of each other. Wait, no, the condition is that in the entire set, no two are within2 on the original cycle. Since we've already excluded vertices close to0, the remaining vertices3,4,5 are in the middle. \n\nThe distance between3 and4 is1, so they cannot both be in the subset. \n\nSimilarly, between4 and5. \n\nTherefore, the available vertices3,4,5 must form an independent set on the path3-4-5 with the usual adjacency. \n\nTherefore, the number here is the number of independent sets on a path of3 vertices, which is P(3)=5. \n\nTherefore, the recurrence for f(n) (number of subsets on an n-cycle with no two vertices within distance2) is:\n\nf(n) = g(n-1) + h(n-3), where g(n-1) is the number for the path of n-1 vertices with the distance2 condition, and h(n-3) is the number for the remaining path? Hmm, perhaps better to formalize:\n\nLet me denote f(n) as the number for the cycle, and p(n) as the number for the path of n vertices with the same condition (no two within distance2). \n\nThen, for the cycle:\n\nf(n) = p(n-1) + p(n-3)\n\nBecause:\n\n- If vertex0 is excluded, the remaining is a path of n-1 vertices with the same condition, so p(n-1).\n\n- If vertex0 is included, then vertices1,2, n-1, n-2 are excluded (distance1 and2), leaving a path from3 to n-3 (if n\u22655). The length is n-4? Wait for n=8, it was 3 vertices (3,4,5). So the length is (n-1 - 2) =n-3? Wait, in the case of n=8, it was 3 vertices, which is n-5? Hmm, perhaps better to think:\n\nWhen vertex0 is included, the excluded vertices are1,2 and n-1, n-2 (since distance2 in both directions). So the remaining vertices are from3 ton-3. The number is (n-4) vertices? \n\nWait in n=8, it was 3 vertices (3,4,5): 8-5=3. Hmm, so maybe n-5 vertices? \n\nWait, maybe I need to think of it as the vertices between2 and n-2, but excluding those adjacent to0. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the remaining is a path of length n-5? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute f(n) directly for small n:\n\nLet me compute f(8):\n\nTo compute f(8), the number of subsets of an 8-cycle with no two vertices within distance2.\n\nLet me try to count them:\n\nStart with the empty set:1\n\nSingle vertices:8\n\nPairs: need vertices at least distance3 apart. \n\nHow many pairs are there?\n\nChoose two vertices with at least three edges between them in both directions. \n\nIn an 8-vertex cycle, the number of such pairs can be calculated as follows: \n\nFor each vertex, the forbidden vertices are the next two and previous two. So for vertex0, the allowed partners are vertices3,4 (since distance3 and4). \n\nWait, distance3 from0 is vertices3 and5 (since in a cycle of8, 0+3=3, 0-3=5 mod8). Wait, actually, distance3 from0 is vertices3 and5? Wait, distance is the minimal of clockwise or counter-clockwise. \n\nThe distance between0 and3 is3, and between0 and5 is also3 (since going the other way: 0 to7 to6 to5 is3 steps). \n\nTherefore, for vertex0, the vertices at distance\u22653 are3,4,5. Wait, distance3: vertices3 and5. \n\nWait, distance between0 and4 is4 (the other direction:0 to7 to6 to5 to4 is4 steps). \n\nWait, no, the minimal distance between0 and4 is4. \n\nWait, actually, in an 8-cycle, the distance between0 and4 is4 (since they're opposite). \n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify:\n\nThe distance between two vertices is the minimal number of steps between them along the cycle. \n\nFor vertex0:\n\n- Distance1:1 and7\n\n- Distance2:2 and6\n\n- Distance3:3 and5\n\n- Distance4:4\n\nTherefore, vertices at distance\u22653 from0 are3,4,5. \n\nWait, distance3 is3 and5, distance4 is4. \n\nSo vertices at distance\u22653 are3,4,5. \n\nTherefore, vertex0 can pair with3,4,5. \n\nSimilarly, for each vertex, there are3 possible partners at distance\u22653. \n\nTotal pairs would be8*3, but this counts each pair twice. So (8*3)/2=12. \n\nBut need to ensure that the two vertices are not within distance2 of each other. \n\nWait, actually, if two vertices are at distance3 apart, their mutual distance is3, which is allowed. \n\nWait, the condition is that no two are within distance2, so distance\u22653 is okay. \n\nTherefore, any pair of vertices at distance3,4, or5 (which is equivalent to distance3 in the other direction) are allowed. \n\nWait, the total number of pairs with distance\u22653 is equal to total pairs minus those with distance1 or2. \n\nTotal pairs:28. \n\nPairs at distance1:8 (each edge)\n\nPairs at distance2:8 (each pair two apart)\n\nTotal forbidden pairs:16, so allowed pairs:28-16=12. \n\nTherefore, there are12 pairs. \n\nTriples: need to choose three vertices, each pair at least distance3 apart. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe it's easier to use the formula. \n\nAlternatively, let's assume that f(n) follows a linear recurrence. \n\nSuppose for a path of n vertices, p(n) satisfies a recurrence. \n\nFor a path of n vertices with the condition that no two are within distance2:\n\nLet\u2019s think recursively. Let p(n) be the number of such subsets for a path of length n. \n\nFor the last vertex, n, we can choose to include it or not. \n\nIf we include it, then we cannot include n-1 or n-2. So the count is p(n-3). \n\nIf we don't include it, the count is p(n-1). \n\nThus, p(n) = p(n-1) + p(n-3). \n\nBase cases:\n\np(0)=1 (empty set)\n\np(1)=2 (include or not)\n\np(2)=3 (neither, first, second)\n\np(3)= p(2)+p(0)=3+1=4?\n\nWait, let's verify:\n\nFor n=3 (vertices1,2,3):\n\nAllowed subsets:\n\n- Empty:1\n\n- {1}, {2}, {3}:3\n\n- {1,3}:1\n\nTotal 5. Hmm, so my recurrence is wrong. \n\nWait, perhaps the recurrence is different. \n\nLet me recast the problem for the path: no two vertices within distance2. \n\nActually, the condition is that no two are adjacent or two apart. \n\nWait, the distance between any two in the subset must be at least3. \n\nWait, in a path of3 vertices (1-2-3):\n\n- {1,3}: distance2 between them (since on the path, they're two apart). So this is forbidden. \n\nTherefore, allowed subsets are those with no two within two edges. \n\nSo for n=3:\n\n- Empty:1\n\n- {1}, {2}, {3}:3\n\n- {1,3}: forbidden (distance2)\n\nTotal4. So p(3)=4. Which matches the recurrence p(3)=p(2)+p(0)=3+1=4. \n\nWait, but if the distance is strictly greater than2, then {1,3} is distance2, which is forbidden. So yes. \n\nWait, but in the problem for the cycle, the distance is along the cycle. But for the path, the distance is along the path. \n\nTherefore, the recurrence p(n)=p(n-1)+p(n-3). \n\nThus, let's compute p(n):\n\np(0)=1\n\np(1)=2\n\np(2)=3\n\np(3)=4\n\np(4)=p(3)+p(1)=4+2=6\n\np(5)=p(4)+p(2)=6+3=9\n\np(6)=p(5)+p(3)=9+4=13\n\np(7)=p(6)+p(4)=13+6=19\n\np(8)=p(7)+p(5)=19+9=28\n\nTherefore, for a path of8 vertices, p(8)=28. \n\nBut for the cycle f(8)= p(7) + p(5)= p(7)+p(5)=19+9=28. \n\nWait, so f(8)=28. \n\nWait, so the number of subsets in A_1 \u2229 A_2 is28. \n\nWait, but let me confirm with n=8:\n\nUsing the formula f(n)=p(n-1)+p(n-3):\n\nf(8)=p(7)+p(5)=19+9=28. \n\nOkay, so that works. \n\nTherefore, the intersection A_1 \u2229 A_2 has28 subsets. \n\nSimilarly, we can compute intersections between other A_k and A_j. \n\nBut this is going to be very time-consuming. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for another approach or see if the total is manageable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number we need is the sum over all subsets B of the number of rotations k where B is in A_k, divided by the number of rotations? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total desired count is equal to the number of ordered pairs (B, k) where B is in A_k, divided by the number of rotations? No, that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, note that the problem is asking for the probability, so maybe there's a symmetry or formula. \n\nAlternatively, recall that for each non-empty subset B, the number of k where B and B+k are disjoint is equal to the number of shifts k where the rotation takes B to a subset disjoint from B. \n\nThe total over all B is 368, as before. \n\nThe number of subsets B with at least one such k is S = desired count. \n\nThe average number of such k per subset is368/256 \u22481.4375. \n\nTherefore, using the first moment method, the expected value is about1.4375, but the actual count S is less than that because of overlaps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total is roughly 256*(average) - ... but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total is equal to the sum over k of |A_k| minus the sum over k<j of |A_k \u2229 A_j|, assuming higher order terms are negligible. \n\nBut this is an approximation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a known solution. \n\nWait, the problem states that each vertex is colored red or blue with equal probability, and we need the probability that there exists a rotation making all blue vertices land on red. \n\nThis is equivalent to the probability that the blue set B is such that there exists a rotation k where B rotated by k is contained in the red set R = complement of B. \n\nTherefore, B rotated by k is a subset of R, which is equivalent to B \u2229 (B +k) = \u2205. \n\nSo the probability is equal to the probability that B is disjoint from some rotation of itself. \n\nThis is similar to a problem in combinatorics where we want the probability that a random subset is \"rotationally disjoint\" from some rotation. \n\nPerhaps the answer is (2^8 - T)/2^8, but without knowing T, we can\u2019t proceed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the only subsets not in T (i.e., with N(B)=0) are those that are \"rotationally dense\", like the full set and subsets missing a few vertices. \n\nBut given the earlier examples, this is not the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total T is 1 (the full set) plus subsets missing1 or2 vertices, etc., but this would need exact count. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number T is 1 + 8 + 28 + 56 + ...? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the number of subsets in T is the number of subsets that cannot be rotated to be disjoint from themselves. \n\nThe only such subsets are those where for every rotation k, B and B+k share a common element. \n\nThis is very restrictive. The full set is one. The subsets missing one vertex are in T, as we saw. \n\nThe number of subsets missing one vertex is8. \n\nSubsets missing two vertices: the number isC(8,2)=28, and they are all in T. \n\nSubsets missing three vertices: C(8,3)=56. Are all of these in T? Earlier example showed yes. \n\nSubsets missing four vertices: C(8,4)=70. Some are in T, some not. \n\nWait, let's see how many subsets missing four vertices are in T. \n\nA subset missing four vertices is in T iff for every rotation k, the missing set does not contain any rotation of itself. \n\nAlternatively, for B being the complement of a four-vertex subset S, then B is in T iff for every k, S rotated by k intersects S. \n\nSo S must be such that it intersects every rotation of itself. \n\nThis requires that S cannot be rotated to be disjoint from itself. \n\nTherefore, the number of subsets S of size4 that are \"rotationally intersecting\". \n\nThe number of such S is equal to C(8,4) minus the number of S that can be rotated to be disjoint from themselves. \n\nThe subsets S that can be rotated to be disjoint are those that are a union of rotationally disjoint copies. \n\nFor example, if S is a block of four consecutive vertices, rotating by four would give the opposite block, disjoint. \n\nSimilarly, if S is every other vertex (size4), rotating by2 gives the same set, so it's disjoint? No, rotating by2 would map the set to itself. Wait, rotating the set {0,2,4,6} by2 gives {2,4,6,0}, which is the same set. So the intersection is the entire set. So it does intersect. \n\nWait, but rotating by1 would give {1,3,5,7}, which is disjoint. So the set {0,2,4,6} is not in T. \n\nTherefore, the subsets S of size4 that can be rotated to be disjoint are those for which there exists a rotation k such that S and S+k are disjoint. \n\nThe number of such S is equal to the number of subsets of size4 that are \"disjoint under some rotation\". \n\nFor example:\n\n- The four consecutive vertices: can be rotated by4 to get the opposite four, disjoint. \n\n- The four vertices every other: rotated by1 to get the other four. \n\n- Other subsets? \n\nLet me compute how many such subsets there are. \n\nFirst, the number of subsets S of size4 that can be partitioned into two subsets of size2 rotated by k. \n\nAlternatively, the number of subsets S that are a union of two orbits under some rotation. \n\nAlternatively, the number of subsets S of size4 that are periodic with some rotation. \n\nFor example:\n\n- Those that are two pairs of opposite vertices. But four vertices can be two pairs of opposites (like {0,4,1,5}), but rotating by1 would not necessarily make them disjoint. \n\nAlternatively, subsets that form a block of four consecutive vertices. There are8 such subsets (each starting at a different vertex). Each can be rotated by4 to be disjoint. \n\nSimilarly, subsets that are two pairs of opposite vertices (like {0,4,2,6}), which are actually the every other vertices. There are two such subsets: {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}. \n\nThese can be rotated by1 to be disjoint. \n\nAdditionally, are there other subsets of size4 that can be rotated to be disjoint? \n\nFor example, {0,1,3,4}. Rotating by2 gives {2,3,5,6}. The intersection with the original is {3}, so they are not disjoint. \n\nAnother example: {0,1,2,4}. Rotating by4 gives {4,5,6,0}. The intersection is {0,4}, so not disjoint. \n\nAnother example: {0,1,4,5}. Rotating by2 gives {2,3,6,7}. The intersection is empty? Original missing set is {0,1,4,5}, so B is the complement. Wait, sorry, S is the subset we're considering. Let me clarify:\n\nIf S is {0,1,4,5}, then rotating by2 gives {2,3,6,7}. The intersection between S and S+2 is empty? S is {0,1,4,5}, S+2 is {2,3,6,7}. Yes, they are disjoint. Therefore, this subset can be rotated to be disjoint. \n\nSo this subset is not in T. \n\nTherefore, such subsets exist beyond the consecutive four and the every other four. \n\nTherefore, the count is more than8+2. \n\nLet me see:\n\nHow many subsets of size4 can be rotated to be disjoint?\n\nFor a subset S of size4, there exists a rotation k such that S and S+k are disjoint. \n\nThis requires that the subset S can be partitioned into two subsets each of size2, such that one is a rotation of the other by k. \n\nAlternatively, the subset S has a period dividing8/gcd(k,8). \n\nAlternatively, the minimal period of S divides some divisor of8. \n\nThis is getting too vague. \n\nPerhaps the number of such subsets is8 (consecutive fours) +2 (alternating fours) + others. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of subsets of size4 that can be rotated to be disjoint is equal to:\n\nFor each divisor d of8 (d=1,2,4,8), the number of subsets S of size4 that are periodic with period d. \n\nWait, but period 1 would mean all elements are the same, which isn\u2019t possible. \n\nPeriod 2: subsets that repeat every2 vertices. \n\nFor period2, the subset would be a union of two copies of a2-element subset separated by2. \n\nFor example, {0,1,2,3} is period1 (if rotated by1, but period2? No. \n\nWait, a period2 subset would be like {0,1,4,5}: rotating by2 maps0\u21922, but {0,1,4,5} rotated by2 is {2,3,6,7}, which is disjoint. So period2 subsets are those where the subset is the union of two translates by2. \n\nThere are C(4,2)=6 such subsets? Wait, the first two elements in the first half, then their translates. \n\nActually, to form a period2 subset, you choose a subset of size2 in the first four vertices {0,1,2,3}, and then take their translates by4. \n\nWait, no, period2 means that rotating by2 maps the subset to itself? Or to a disjoint subset? \n\nActually, for period2, the subset must satisfy S +2 = S or S +2 disjoint from S. \n\nIf S +2 = S, then it's periodic with period2. \n\nSuch subsets would be like {0,2,4,6} or {1,3,5,7}. \n\nThese are the two alternating subsets. \n\nIf S +2 is disjoint from S, then S is like {0,1,4,5}, which when rotated by2 becomes {2,3,6,7}, disjoint from the original. \n\nThese are the \"shifted\" period2 subsets. \n\nThe number of such subsets:\n\nTo form S such that S +2 is disjoint from S:\n\nChoose a subset of the first four vertices (0-3) of size2, then the other two elements are in the second four vertices (4-7) such that they don't overlap when shifted. \n\nWait, if S has two elements in the first four and two in the second four, such that when shifted by2, the first two move to the second four's first two positions. \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLet me split the octagon into two halves: first half0-3, second half4-7. \n\nTo have S +2 disjoint from S, the elements in the first half must map to the second half, and vice versa. \n\nTherefore, S must have exactly two elements in the first half and two in the second half, and no element in the first half is at position x where x+2 is in S. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think:\n\nIf S has elements a,b in the first half and c,d in the second half, then a+2 and b+2 must not be in S. \n\nSince a and b are in0-3, their shifts are in2-5. \n\nTo avoid overlap, the shifted elements must land in4-7 (the second half), so a+2 and b+2 must be in4-7, which means a and b must be in2-3. \n\nSimilarly, c and d are in4-7, their shifts by2 are6-1 (mod8). \n\nTo prevent overlap, the shifts of c and d (which are6-7 and0-1) must not be in S. \n\nTherefore, if c and d are in4-5, their shifts are6-7, which are allowed as long as6-7 are not in S. \n\nThis is getting too involved. Maybe the number of such subsets is C(4,2)*C(4,2)=36, but with constraints. \n\nAlternatively, this is taking too long. Given time constraints, perhaps I should look for another way. \n\nWait, the problem asks for the probability, and the answer is m + n where the fraction is reduced. \n\nGiven that the total is 256, and the numerator is likely to be 256 - T. \n\nIf I assume that T is 1 (only the full set), then the probability would be (256-1)/256=255/256, but that's probably wrong because subsets like missing one vertex are in T. \n\nAlternatively, if T includes the full set and all subsets missing1 or2 vertices:\n\nFull set:1\n\nSubsets missing1:8\n\nSubsets missing2:28\n\nSubsets missing3:56\n\nSubsets missing4:70 (but some are not in T)\n\nBut even missing3 are in T. \n\nIf we assume T includes all subsets except those that can be rotated to be disjoint, which includes empty set and some subsets with size4,5, etc. \n\nThe empty set is definitely not in T. \n\nThe total number of subsets not in T is1 (empty set) + the number of subsets with size1 (8) + size2 (28) + size3 (56) + some subsets of size4, etc. \n\nThis is too vague. \n\nPerhaps I need to recall that the number we need is the total over all subsets B of the probability that there exists a rotation k where B rotated by k is disjoint from B. \n\nThis can be expressed as the expected value over all subsets B of the indicator function that such a rotation exists. \n\nThe expected value is equal to the probability. \n\nUsing linearity of expectation, the expectation is equal to the sum over rotations k of the probability that B is in A_k, minus the overlaps. \n\nWait, but expectation of the union is not the sum of expectations. \n\nAlternatively, the expectation is equal to the probability that at least one A_k holds, which is the same as the desired probability. \n\nThis expectation is equal to the sum over k of Pr(B \u2208 A_k) - Sum_{k<j} Pr(B \u2208 A_k \u2229 A_j) + ... \n\nBut calculating this requires the same inclusion-exclusion. \n\nHowever, the first term is Sum_{k} |A_k| /256 = 368/256 = 23/16 \u22481.4375. \n\nThe second term is Sum_{k<j} |A_k \u2229 A_j| /256. \n\nIf we can approximate this term, but without knowing the intersections, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number is368 - corrections. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a clever solution. \n\nWait, think of the problem as follows: we need the probability that the blue set B is such that there exists a rotation k where B is contained in the red set rotated by -k. \n\nThat is, B \u2286 R -k. \n\nSince R is the complement of B, this requires that B and B +k are disjoint. \n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to asking for the probability that B is a subset of some rotation of its complement. \n\nThis is similar to saying that B is contained in the complement rotated by some k. \n\nAlternatively, this is equivalent to B being a subset of a rotation of its complement. \n\nNote that the complement R has size8 - |B|. \n\nTherefore, for this to be possible, B must be contained within a rotation of R, which has the same size as R. \n\nTherefore, the condition is that there exists a rotation k such that B \u2286 R +k. \n\nSince R +k is the complement of B +k. \n\nTherefore, the condition is equivalent to B and B +k being disjoint. \n\nNow, the probability that such a k exists. \n\nPerhaps consider that for each subset B, the probability that such a k exists is equal to the probability that B is contained in some rotation of its complement. \n\nAlternatively, think of it as for each B, the number of k such that B \u2286 R +k divided by8 (the number of rotations). \n\nBut since each element is independent, perhaps there is a better way. \n\nAlternatively, note that for a random subset B, the probability that it is contained in some rotation of its complement is equal to the average over all subsets B of the probability that \u2203k, B \u2286 R +k. \n\nThis is exactly what we need. \n\nNow, perhaps use linearity of expectation in some way. \n\nAlternatively, consider that for a random subset B, the probability that there exists a rotation k such that B and B +k are disjoint. \n\nThe expected number of such rotations is Sum_{k} Pr(B and B +k are disjoint). \n\nThis expectation is equal to Sum_{k} |A_k| /256 =368/256=23/16\u22481.4375. \n\nThe probability we need is the probability that this count is at least1. \n\nUsing the first moment method, the probability is at most the expectation, so less than1.4375, but this is an upper bound. \n\nAlternatively, the probability is at least the expectation minus the second moment divided by the expectation. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the desired probability is equal to the sum_{k} Pr(B \u2208A_k) - sum_{k\u2260j} Pr(B \u2208A_k \u2229A_j) + ... \n\nBut without knowing the overlaps, this is not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, notice that for the empty set, it satisfies the condition for all rotations, so it's counted in all A_k. \n\nFor the full set, it doesn't satisfy the condition for any rotation except the identity, but since rotating the full set gives itself, which is not disjoint. So full set is not in any A_k. \n\nFor singleton sets, they are in A_k for k\u22600. \n\nFor the pair sets, they are in some A_k. \n\nPerhaps the total number can be computed as follows:\n\nThe total number of subsets in the union is equal to:\n\n- The empty set:1\n\n- All non-empty subsets B such that there exists a rotation k where B is disjoint from B +k. \n\nThe empty set is already counted. \n\nFor non-empty subsets, the count is:\n\nFor each non-empty subset B, if there exists a rotation k (k\u22600) such that B and B +k are disjoint. \n\nThe total is then1 + (number of non-empty subsets with such a k). \n\nThe number of non-empty subsets is255. \n\nThe total we want is1 + (255 - number of non-empty subsets with N(B)=0). \n\nBut this brings us back to needing T. \n\nPerhaps the key is to realize that the only subsets with N(B)=0 are those which are \"rotationally dense\", i.e., the full set and subsets missing a small number of vertices. \n\nAssuming T includes:\n\n- The full set:1\n\n- All subsets missing1 vertex:8\n\n- All subsets missing2 vertices:28\n\n- All subsets missing3 vertices:56\n\n- Some subsets missing4 vertices. \n\nLet's assume that all subsets missing up to3 vertices are in T. \n\nThen T=1+8+28+56=93. \n\nSubsets missing4 vertices: there are70. Some are in T, some not. \n\nSuppose half of them are in T, then T=93+35=128. \n\nBut this is a guess. \n\nIf T=128, then the desired count is256-128=128, giving probability1/2, so m+n=1+2=3. But this is likely incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps T=1+8+28+56+... \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the total number of subsets in T:\n\n- The full set:1\n\n- All subsets with at least5 vertices: since their complement has \u22643, which are in T. \n\nWait, if B has \u22655 vertices, then its complement has \u22643, so the complement is in T (as subsets missing up to3 are in T). Therefore, the complement R is in T, so for every rotation k, R intersects R +k. \n\nTherefore, for such B, there is no rotation k where B is disjoint from B +k (since that would require R +k disjoint from R). \n\nTherefore, subsets B with size\u22655 cannot be in the desired union, because their complements are in T. \n\nTherefore, the desired subsets are exactly those with size \u22644. \n\nWait, this is a crucial point! \n\nIf B has size s, then its complement R has size8-s. \n\nIf R is in T (i.e., for all rotations k, R intersects R +k), then there is no k such that B and B +k are disjoint. \n\nTherefore, B is not in the desired union if R is in T. \n\nTherefore, B is in the desired union (i.e., there exists k with B disjoint from B +k) if and only if R is not in T. \n\nTherefore, the number of desired subsets B is equal to the number of subsets R not in T, where R is the complement of B. \n\nSince the complement is a bijection, the number of B in the desired union is equal to the number of R not in T, which is equal to the total subsets minus T. \n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me rephrase:\n\nLet me denote that B is desired if there exists a rotation k where B is disjoint from B +k. \n\nLet R = complement of B. \n\nThen B disjoint from B +k is equivalent to R contains B +k. \n\nTherefore, the condition is equivalent to R contains B +k for some k. \n\nBut B = complement of R, so B +k = complement of R +k. \n\nThus, R contains complement of R +k, which implies that R \u2229 (R +k) = empty set? \n\nWait, perhaps better to think:\n\nB disjoint from B +k means B +k \u2286 R. \n\nThus, for some k, B +k is a subset of R. \n\nTherefore, the condition is equivalent to the existence of a rotation k such that B +k \u2286 R. \n\nBut since R = complement of B, this is equivalent to B +k and B are disjoint. \n\nTherefore, the number of desired subsets B is equal to the number of subsets B where there exists a rotation k with B +k \u2286 R. \n\nBut this is the same as the number of subsets B such that B is contained in some rotation of R (since R is the complement). \n\nAlternatively, the number of subsets B where B is contained in a rotation of its complement. \n\nNow, the key insight: \n\nIf the complement R has size s, then for B to be contained in a rotation of R, we need s \u2265 |B|. Since R has size s=8-|B|. \n\nTherefore, 8-|B| \u2265 |B| \u21d2 |B| \u22644. \n\nTherefore, subsets B with size greater than4 cannot satisfy the condition, because their complement is smaller than them, so cannot contain a rotated version. \n\nTherefore, only subsets with size \u22644 can be in the desired union. \n\nTherefore, the total number of desired subsets is equal to the number of subsets of size0 to4, minus those subsets of size0 to4 which are in T (i.e., their complement is not in T). \n\nWait, no: \n\nWait, if B has size \u22644, then it's possible that there exists a rotation k where B is contained in R +k (which is the complement rotated). \n\nBut whether this is possible depends on B. \n\nHowever, the crucial point is that subsets with size>4 cannot be in the desired union. \n\nTherefore, the desired count is the number of subsets B with size \u22644 such that there exists a rotation k with B +k \u2286 R. \n\nTherefore, the total desired count is the number of subsets of size0 to4 that are not in T (where T is defined for subsets, but here we need to adjust). \n\nWait, actually, let's rephrase:\n\nThe desired subsets are exactly those subsets B with size \u22644 such that their complement R has the property that there exists a rotation k where B is contained in R +k. \n\nAlternatively, since R = complement of B, this is equivalent to R contains a rotation of B. \n\nTherefore, for each B of size s \u22644, we need to check if there exists a rotation k such that B +k is contained in R. \n\nBut since R has size8-s \u22654, it's possible. \n\nBut we need to count all such B where this is true. \n\nThe total number is then the number of subsets B of size0-4 where there exists a rotation k with B +k \u2286 R. \n\nThe total number of subsets of size0 to4 is1 +8 +28 +56 +70=163. \n\nSubtract those subsets B of size0-4 for which no such rotation exists. \n\nThe subsets B of size0-4 with no rotation k such that B +k \u2286 R are exactly those subsets B where for every rotation k, B +k intersects B. \n\nWhich is the same as saying that the complement R is in T. \n\nTherefore, the number of subsets B of size0-4 that are not in the desired union is equal to the number of subsets R of size8-s (s \u22644) that are in T. \n\nTherefore, the desired count is:\n\nTotal subsets of size0-4 (163) minus the number of subsets R of size\u22654 in T. \n\nWait, this is getting convoluted. Let me rephrase carefully:\n\nLet me denote that:\n\n- Let S be the desired count: subsets B where \u2203k such that B \u2286 R +k. \n\n- S is equal to the number of subsets B with size0 to4 (since larger subsets can't be contained in R +k) minus the subsets B of size0 to4 where for all k, B +k is not contained in R. \n\n- The subsets B of size0 to4 where for all k, B +k is not contained in R correspond to subsets R (complements of B) of size8\u2212s (\u22654) where for all k, R does not contain B +k. \n\n- This is equivalent to saying R has no rotation that contains B. \n\n- But R contains B +k for some k iff B is contained in R \u2212k. \n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. \n\nPerhaps the key is that for subsets B of size \u22644, the number that can be rotated to fit into their complement is equal to the total subsets of size \u22644 minus those subsets B where their complement R is in T. \n\nTherefore, the desired count is:\n\nSum_{s=0}^4 C(8,s) - T', \n\nwhere T' is the number of subsets R of size\u22654 that are in T (i.e., for all k, R intersects R +k). \n\nBut T is the total number of subsets in T, which includes subsets of any size. \n\nEarlier, we considered that subsets with size\u22655 cannot be in the desired union, but their complements (size\u22643) are in T. \n\nTherefore, the subsets R in T of size\u22654 are exactly those subsets R of size\u22654 that are in T. \n\nTherefore, T' = T - (number of subsets in T of size \u22643). \n\nBut without knowing T, this doesn't help. \n\nHowever, if we can compute T as follows:\n\nT includes:\n\n- All subsets of size\u22655: their complements are of size \u22643, which are in T. \n\nWait no, T is the set of subsets R where for all k, R intersects R +k. \n\nIf R has size\u22655, its complement has size\u22643, which is in T, but R itself may or may not be in T. \n\nWait, let's think of R being of size5. \n\nTake R missing three vertices. As we saw earlier, such subsets are in T. \n\nIndeed, a subset of size5 (missing three vertices) is in T because for any rotation k, the shifted R will miss three different vertices, so their intersection is at least5 +5 -8 =2 vertices, so non-empty. \n\nWait, more carefully:\n\nFor a subset R of size5 (missing three vertices), rotating it by any k will shift the missing three vertices to new positions. The intersection between R and R +k is the set not missing any of the original missing or shifted missing vertices. \n\nThe number of vertices not missing in both is 8 - (3 +3 - overlap). \n\nThe overlap between the missing sets is the intersection of the original missing three and the shifted missing three. \n\nThe minimum intersection occurs when the missing sets are as disjoint as possible. \n\nThe maximum overlap is3, minimum0. \n\nIf overlap is0, the intersection size is8 -6=2. \n\nThus, the intersection is at least2 vertices, so non-empty. \n\nTherefore, subsets of size5 are in T. \n\nSimilarly, subsets of size6: missing two vertices. As before, they are in T. \n\nSize7: missing one vertex, in T. \n\nSize8: full set, in T. \n\nSize4: some in T, some not. \n\nSize3: in T. \n\nSize2: in T? \n\nWait subsets of size2 are not in T. Because, for example, a pair can be rotated to be disjoint. \n\nWait, a subset R of size2: its complement is6. \n\nBut R itself is a pair. \n\nFor example, R={0,1}. Rotating by2 gives {2,3}, which doesn't intersect R. So R is not in T. \n\nThus, subsets of size2 are not in T. \n\nSimilarly subsets of size1 are not in T. \n\nSize0: not in T. \n\nTherefore, T consists of:\n\n- All subsets of size\u22654 except those size4 subsets not in T. \n\nWait, subsets of size4: some are in T, some not. \n\nSubsets of size5,6,7,8 are all in T. \n\nSubsets of size3 are in T. \n\nSize2,1,0 are not in T. \n\nTherefore, T = number of subsets of size3,4,5,6,7,8, minus the subsets of size4 not in T. \n\nThe total subsets of size3 to8: \n\nC(8,3)+C(8,4)+C(8,5)+C(8,6)+C(8,7)+C(8,8)=56+70+56+28+8+1=219. \n\nSubtract the number of size4 subsets not in T: let's denote this as N. \n\nTherefore, T=219 - N. \n\nThe desired count S is the number of subsets B of size0-4 not in T's complement (i.e., B is in the desired union if its complement R is not in T). \n\nThe number of subsets B of size0-4 is163. \n\nThe number of subsets B of size0-4 where R is in T is equal to the number of subsets R of size8-s (s \u22644) that are in T. \n\nThat is:\n\n- For B of size0 (R size8): R is the full set, in T:1\n\n- B size1 (R size7): all R size7 are in T:8\n\n- B size2 (R size6): all R size6 are in T:28\n\n- B size3 (R size5): all R size5 are in T:56\n\n- B size4 (R size4): R must be in T, which are (C(8,4) - N) subsets. \n\nTherefore, the number of B of size4 with R in T is (70 - N). \n\nTherefore, total subsets B of size0-4 with R in T is1+8+28+56+(70 -N)=163 -N. \n\nTherefore, the desired count S=163 - (163 -N)=N. \n\nWait, no: \n\nThe desired subsets are those B of size0-4 where R is not in T. \n\nThe number is total B of size0-4 (163) minus those B where R is in T (which is163 -N). \n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, the number of B of size0-4 with R in T is:\n\nFor B size0: R size8 (in T):1\n\nB size1: R size7 (in T):8\n\nB size2: R size6 (in T):28\n\nB size3: R size5 (in T):56\n\nB size4: R size4 (in T): (70 - N) subsets? \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, R size4 is in T iff the subset R of size4 is in T. \n\nThe number of R size4 in T is (number of subsets of size4 in T) = (C(8,4) - N). \n\nWait, since T includes all subsets of size\u22653 except the size4 subsets not in T. \n\nWait, T includes all subsets of size3,5,6,7,8, and some size4 subsets. \n\nTherefore, the number of subsets R of size4 in T is (70 - N), where N is the number of size4 subsets not in T. \n\nTherefore, the number of B of size4 with R in T is (70 - N). \n\nThus, the total number of B of size0-4 with R in T is:\n\n1 (size0) +8 (size1) +28 (size2) +56 (size3) + (70 -N) (size4) =1+8=9; +28=37; +56=93; +70-N=163 -N. \n\nTherefore, the desired count S= total B of size0-4 (163) - (163 -N)=N. \n\nSo S=N, the number of subsets of size4 not in T. \n\nTherefore, we need to compute N, the number of subsets of size4 not in T (i.e., subsets R of size4 that are not in T). \n\nA subset R of size4 is not in T if there exists a rotation k such that R and R +k are disjoint. \n\nTherefore, N is the number of4-element subsets R that can be rotated to be disjoint from themselves. \n\nTherefore, we need to compute N = number of4-element subsets R where there exists a rotation k with R and R +k disjoint. \n\nThis is exactly the number we were trying to compute earlier. \n\nTo compute N, note that such subsets R must be able to be partitioned into two subsets of size2 rotated by k. \n\nFor example:\n\n- If R is four consecutive vertices, rotating by4 gives the opposite four, disjoint. \n\n- If R is two pairs of opposite vertices (e.g., {0,4,1,5}), rotating by1 would give {1,5,2,6}, which overlaps. \n\nWait, let's take R={0,1,2,3}. Rotating by4 gives {4,5,6,7}, disjoint. So this R is counted in N. \n\nAnother example: R={0,2,4,6}. Rotating by1 gives {1,3,5,7}, which is disjoint. So this R is also in N. \n\nAnother example: R={0,1,3,4}. Rotating by2 gives {2,3,5,6}. The intersection with R is {3}, so not disjoint. Rotating by5: {5,6,8 mod8=0,9 mod8=1}. So R+5={5,6,0,1}. Intersection with R is {0,1}, so not disjoint. \n\nIs there a rotation that makes them disjoint? \n\nTry rotating by4: R+4={4,5,7,0}. Intersection with R is {0,4}, not disjoint. \n\nRotating by3: R+3={3,4,6,7}. Intersection with R is {3,4}, not disjoint. \n\nRotating by1: R+1={1,2,4,5}. Intersection with R is {1,4}, not disjoint. \n\nRotating by6: R+6={6,7,9 mod8=1,10 mod8=2}. So {6,7,1,2}. Intersection with R is {1}, not disjoint. \n\nRotating by7: R+7={7,0,4,5}. Intersection with R is {0,4}, not disjoint. \n\nTherefore, this subset R={0,1,3,4} cannot be rotated to be disjoint from itself, so it is not counted in N. \n\nThus, N counts only those subsets R of size4 that can be rotated to be disjoint. \n\nTo compute N:\n\nThese subsets R must be such that they can be partitioned into two subsets of size2 each, separated by a rotation. \n\nFor example:\n\n- Four consecutive vertices: can be rotated by4 to be disjoint. \n\n- Two pairs of opposite vertices (like {0,4,1,5}): rotating by1 would give {1,5,2,6}, which overlaps, but rotating by2 gives {2,6,3,7}, which is disjoint from the original? \n\nWait, {0,4,1,5} rotated by2 gives {2,6,3,7}. The intersection is empty? \n\nOriginal R: {0,1,4,5}\n\nRotated by2: {2,3,6,7}. Yes, disjoint. \n\nTherefore, such subsets are counted in N. \n\nTherefore, the subsets R of size4 that can be rotated to be disjoint are:\n\n1. Those that are four consecutive vertices. There are8 such subsets (each starting at a different vertex). \n\n2. Those that are two pairs of opposite vertices. There are two such subsets: {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7} (but wait, those are the every other vertices). \n\nWait, actually, two pairs of opposite vertices can be arranged in different ways. \n\nWait, for example, {0,4,1,5} is another such subset where the pairs are {0,4} and {1,5}, each pair being opposite? \n\nWait, 0 and4 are opposite, 1 and5 are opposite. So this is a different subset from {0,2,4,6}. \n\nHow many such subsets are there? \n\nTo form a subset of two opposite pairs, choose two disjoint pairs of opposite vertices. \n\nThere are4 pairs of opposites: {0,4}, {1,5}, {2,6}, {3,7}. \n\nChoosing two pairs out of these4: C(4,2)=6 subsets. \n\nEach such selection gives a subset of size4. \n\nTherefore, there are6 subsets of this form. \n\nFor example:\n\n- {0,4,1,5}\n\n- {0,4,2,6}\n\n- {0,4,3,7}\n\n- {1,5,2,6}\n\n- {1,5,3,7}\n\n- {2,6,3,7}\n\nEach of these can be rotated by2 to be disjoint? \n\nTake {0,4,1,5}: rotating by2 gives {2,6,3,7}, which is disjoint. \n\nSimilarly, rotating by other amounts may also work. \n\nThus, these6 subsets are counted in N. \n\n3. Other subsets? \n\nFor example, the subset {0,1,4,5} we considered earlier cannot be rotated to be disjoint, so it's not counted. \n\nAnother example: {0,2,3,5}. Can this be rotated to be disjoint? \n\nRotating by4: {4,6,7,1}. Intersection with original {0,2,3,5} is empty? \n\nOriginal R: {0,2,3,5}\n\nRotated by4: {4,6,7,1}. \n\nIntersection: none, since 0\u22604,6,7,1; 2\u22604,6,7,1; etc. So yes, disjoint. \n\nWait, so this subset can be rotated by4 to be disjoint. \n\nWait, but how was this subset formed? \n\nIt's not four consecutive nor two opposite pairs. \n\nLet me see:\n\n{0,2,3,5} rotated by4 gives {4,6,7,1}. \n\nThe intersection is empty, so it is counted in N. \n\nThis suggests there are more subsets in N than the previous categories. \n\nTherefore, the count is more involved. \n\nLet me think of another way. \n\nA subset R of size4 can be rotated to be disjoint from itself if and only if it is contained in a subset of size4 that is the union of two orbits under some rotation. \n\nAlternatively, the subset R must be such that it has a period dividing some d, where d divides8. \n\nFor example, period2: subsets like the two opposite pairs or the four consecutive (period4). \n\nAlternatively, subsets with period1 (the entire set), but they can't be size4. \n\nPeriod2 subsets:\n\n- Two pairs of opposite vertices (6 subsets)\n\n- Two pairs of vertices separated by1 (like {0,1,4,5}), but need to check. \n\nWait, {0,1,4,5} has period gcd(1,4)=1? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, period4 subsets: four consecutive vertices (period4). \n\nPeriod1 subsets: none. \n\nPeriod other divisors? \n\nAlternatively, the total number of such subsets is8 (consecutive) +6 (two opposite pairs) + others. \n\nThe example {0,2,3,5} can be rotated by4 to be disjoint, so it has period4? \n\nWait, rotating by4 maps0\u21924,2\u21926,3\u21927,5\u21921. So the image is {4,6,7,1}, which is disjoint from the original. \n\nThis subset's period is not clear, but it can be rotated to disjoint. \n\nThis suggests that the total N is more than14. \n\nPerhaps the total number N is the number of subsets of size4 that are not intersecting with some rotation, which can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each rotation k, count the number of subsets R of size4 that are disjoint from R +k, then use inclusion-exclusion. \n\nBut this is again complicated. \n\nAlternatively, note that the total number of such subsets N is equal to the number of subsets R of size4 for which there exists a rotation k with R and R +k disjoint. \n\nFor each rotation k, the number of such subsets R is equal to the number of subsets R of size4 that are disjoint from R +k. \n\nThis is equal to the number of subsets R such that R and R +k are disjoint, which is the same as subsets R where R is an independent set on the graph where edges connect vertices differing by k. \n\nThis is similar to the earlier problem. \n\nFor example:\n\n- For k=1: the number is the number of independent sets of size4 on the 8-cycle. \n\nBut an independent set of size4 on an 8-cycle is impossible, since the maximum independent set on an 8-cycle is4 (every other vertex), but that has size4 and is exactly the alternating set. \n\nWait, the independent sets on the 8-cycle of size4 are exactly the two alternating sets: {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}. \n\nTherefore, for k=1, the number of subsets R of size4 that are independent sets (disjoint from their shift by1) is2. \n\nSimilarly, for k=3 (same as shift-5), also2. \n\nFor k=2: the graph is two 4-cycles. \n\nTo have R of size4 disjoint from R+2, R must be an independent set on each 4-cycle. \n\nAn independent set of size2 on each 4-cycle (since total size4). \n\nThe number of ways is [number of independent sets of size2 on a4-cycle]^2. \n\nOn a4-cycle, the number of independent sets of size2 is2 (choosing two opposite vertices). \n\nTherefore, total for k=2 is2*2=4. \n\nSimilarly for k=6 (shift-2), same as k=2. \n\nFor k=4: the graph is two pairs of opposites. \n\nTo have R of size4 disjoint from R+4 (which maps each vertex to its opposite), R must not contain any pair of opposites. \n\nWait, R +4 is the set of opposites of R. \n\nTo have R disjoint from R +4, R must contain no pair of opposites. \n\nTherefore, R is an independent set with respect to the opposite pairs. \n\nThe number of such subsets is the number of ways to choose4 vertices with no two opposite. \n\nThere are8 vertices, choosing4 with no two opposite. \n\nThe number is C(4,2)*2^2=6*4=24? \n\nWait, let me think:\n\nChoose one from each pair. There are4 pairs of opposites. To choose4 vertices with none opposite, you pick one from each pair. \n\nThere are2 choices per pair, so2^4=16 subsets. \n\nBut we need subsets of size4. Each such selection gives exactly4 vertices. \n\nTherefore, there are16 subsets of size4 with no two opposites. \n\nTherefore, for k=4, the number of subsets R of size4 disjoint from R+4 is16. \n\nFor k=0, it's impossible since R and R+0 are the same. \n\nFor other rotations like k=5 (same as-3), similar to k=3 gives2 subsets. \n\nk=6 as above. \n\nk=7 is like-1, so also2. \n\nk=1,3,5,7: each contribute2 subsets. \n\nk=2,6: each contribute4 subsets. \n\nk=4: contributes16 subsets. \n\nTotal over all k:\n\n4*2 +2*4 +1*16 =8 +8 +16=32. \n\nHowever, this counts each subset multiple times. For example, the subset {0,2,4,6} is counted for k=2 (since rotating by2 gives {2,4,6,0} which is the same set, so actually not disjoint. Wait, wait: \n\nWait, for k=2, the condition is R and R+2 are disjoint. \n\nFor R={0,2,4,6}, R+2={2,4,6,0} which is the same set, so they are not disjoint. \n\nTherefore, my earlier count for k=2 was incorrect. \n\nWait, I need to recalculate:\n\nFor k=2, the condition is R and R+2 are disjoint. \n\nThe graph for shift2 is two 4-cycles:0-2-4-6-0 and1-3-5-7-1. \n\nTo have R and R+2 disjoint, R must be an independent set on each 4-cycle. \n\nAn independent set on a4-cycle can have at most2 vertices (non-adjacent). \n\nTherefore, to have R of size4, you need two independent sets of size2 on each4-cycle. \n\nOn each4-cycle, the number of independent sets of size2 is2 (the two pairs of opposites). \n\nTherefore, for each4-cycle,2 choices, so total2*2=4 subsets. \n\nThese subsets are:\n\n- On the even cycle: choose {0,4} and on the odd cycle choose {1,5} \u2192 R={0,4,1,5}\n\n- Even: {0,4}, odd: {3,7} \u2192 R={0,4,3,7}\n\n- Even: {2,6}, odd: {1,5} \u2192 R={2,6,1,5}\n\n- Even: {2,6}, odd: {3,7} \u2192 R={2,6,3,7}\n\nSo these are the4 subsets for k=2. \n\nSimilarly for k=6 (shift-2), the same subsets are counted again. \n\nTherefore, the total for k=2 and k=6 is4+4=8, but these are the same subsets counted twice. \n\nSimilarly, for k=1, the two subsets {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7} are counted for k=1 and k=7. \n\nFor k=1, the independent sets of size4 on the8-cycle are exactly these two subsets. \n\nSimilarly for k=3,5,7, they will also count the same two subsets. \n\nFor k=4, the subsets counted are those with no opposite pairs, which are16 in total. \n\nTherefore, the total over all k is:\n\nFor k=1,3,5,7: each contribute2 subsets, but each subset is counted twice (for k and -k). \n\nFor example, the subset {0,2,4,6} is counted for k=1 and k=7 (since rotating by7 is equivalent to rotating by-1). \n\nSimilarly for {1,3,5,7}. \n\nThus total from these rotations:4 rotations *2 subsets =8, but each subset is counted twice, so total unique subsets counted here are2. \n\nFor k=2 and6: each contribute4 subsets, but they are the same subsets counted twice. \n\nTotal unique subsets here:4. \n\nFor k=4:16 subsets. \n\nAdditionally, the rotations k=4 also count subsets like {0,1,2,3} when rotated by4 gives {4,5,6,7}, which are disjoint. \n\nWait, but in our earlier calculation for k=4, the subsets counted are those with no opposite pairs. However, the subset {0,1,2,3} contains opposite pairs like0 and4 (but4 is not in the subset). \n\nWait, no, the subset {0,1,2,3} does contain pairs like0 and4? No,0 and4 are opposites, but4 is not in the subset. \n\nActually, the subset {0,1,2,3} does not contain any opposite pairs (since opposites are0-4,1-5, etc.). \n\nTherefore, {0,1,2,3} is one of the16 subsets counted by k=4. \n\nSimilarly, the subset {0,1,3,4} does contain opposites0 and4, so it's not counted in the16. \n\nTherefore, the16 subsets counted under k=4 are exactly those with no opposite pairs, which includes the four consecutive subsets like {0,1,2,3}, {1,2,3,4}, etc. \n\nIndeed, there are8 such consecutive subsets. \n\nEach consecutive subset of four has no opposite pairs (since the opposites are spread out). \n\nAdditionally, there are other subsets with no opposites, like {0,1,3,5}, but this has no opposites? \n\n0's opposite is4 not in the subset;1's opposite5 is in the subset? \n\nWait, {0,1,3,5} includes1 and5, which are opposites (1 and5 are opposite?). \n\nWait, in an octagon, the opposite of1 is5 (since1+4=5). So yes,1 and5 are opposites. \n\nThus, this subset contains an opposite pair and is not counted in the16. \n\nThe16 subsets are those with no opposite pairs. \n\nThese include:\n\n- The8 consecutive fours: each of these has no opposites because their opposites are outside the subset. \n\n- The subsets like {0,1,2,4}: wait, does this have opposites?0 and4 are opposites. \n\nYes, so that subset contains0 and4, so it's excluded. \n\nWait, perhaps the16 subsets are all subsets with no two opposites, which can be formed by choosing one from each of the4 opposite pairs. \n\nThere are4 pairs: {0,4}, {1,5}, {2,6}, {3,7}. \n\nTo choose4 vertices with none from the same pair, you pick one from each pair. \n\nThere are2 choices per pair, so2^4=16 subsets. \n\nThese include:\n\n- Choosing0,1,2,3 (one from each pair {0,4}, {1,5}, {2,6}, {3,7} \u2192 0,1,2,3\n\n- Choosing0,1,2,7 \u2192 0,1,2,7 (from pair3:7)\n\n- Etc. \n\nThus, the16 subsets include the8 consecutive fours (each is formed by choosing the first element of each pair in a consecutive block), and others like {0,1,2,7}, etc. \n\nEach of these16 subsets can be rotated by4 to be disjoint. \n\nTherefore, the total unique subsets counted across all k are:\n\n- 2 subsets from the8-cycle independent sets (k=1,3,5,7)\n\n- 4 subsets from the two-pairs-of-opposites (k=2,6)\n\n-16 subsets from the no-opposite-pairs (k=4)\n\nTotal:2+4+16=22. \n\nWait, but are there overlaps between these categories? \n\nFor example, the subset {0,2,4,6} is counted both as an independent set on the8-cycle (k=1) and as a no-opposite subset (k=4). \n\nIndeed, {0,2,4,6} has no opposite pairs (each element's opposite is also in the subset? Wait,0's opposite is4, which is in the subset. So actually, this subset does contain opposite pairs. \n\nWait, this is a problem. \n\nThe subset {0,2,4,6} contains0 and4 (opposites), so it is not counted in the no-opposite subsets (the16). \n\nWait, but earlier we said that the independent sets on the8-cycle (size4) are the two alternating sets {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}. \n\nHowever, these subsets do contain opposite pairs. \n\nThus, there is a contradiction. \n\nThis means my earlier analysis is flawed. \n\nIndeed, the subset {0,2,4,6} contains opposite pairs (0 and4, 2 and6), so it is not in the no-opposite subsets (the16). \n\nTherefore, the count for k=4 is indeed16 subsets that have no opposite pairs, which are different from the two independent sets. \n\nTherefore, the total unique subsets counted are:\n\n- The two alternating sets (from k=1,3,5,7)\n\n- The four two-pairs subsets (from k=2,6)\n\n- The16 no-opposite subsets (from k=4)\n\nTotal:2+4+16=22. \n\nHowever, the subsets counted under k=4 include the8 consecutive fours and others. \n\nFor example, the consecutive subset {0,1,2,3} is counted in the no-opposite subsets (since it contains no opposites), and also can be rotated by4 to be disjoint. \n\nThus, the total N=22. \n\nTherefore, the number of subsets R of size4 not in T is22. \n\nTherefore, the desired count S=N=22. \n\nWait, but earlier we had:\n\nS=N= the number of subsets of size4 not in T, which is22. \n\nTherefore, the total desired count is22. \n\nWait, but this can't be right, because the total subsets of size0-4 is163, and the desired count would be22, leading to probability22/256, but that seems low. \n\nWait, no, recall that S=N= the number of subsets B of size0-4 with R not in T, which are exactly the subsets R of size4 not in T (since other sizes' R are in T or not). \n\nWait, no: \n\nThe desired count S is the number of subsets B of size0-4 where R is not in T. \n\nFor B of size0: R is full set (in T) \u2192 not counted. \n\nB of size1: R size7 (in T) \u2192 not counted. \n\nB of size2: R size6 (in T) \u2192 not counted. \n\nB of size3: R size5 (in T) \u2192 not counted. \n\nB of size4: R size4 (not in T if R is counted in N). \n\nTherefore, the desired count is exactly N=22. \n\nBut this gives a total of22 subsets, leading to probability22/256=11/128, so m+n=11+128=139. \n\nBut this contradicts our earlier example where the subset {0,1,2,3} is counted in N, and thus B= its complement (size4) would be counted. \n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nIf R is a subset of size4 not in T (i.e., counted in N), then B= complement of R has size4, and is in the desired union. \n\nTherefore, the number of desired subsets B is equal to the number of R of size4 not in T, which is22. \n\nAdditionally, there are subsets B of size\u22643 that might also be in the desired union? \n\nWait, no, because for subsets B of size\u22643, their complement R has size\u22655, which are in T. Therefore, such B cannot be in the desired union. \n\nTherefore, the total desired count is indeed22. \n\nBut this seems low. \n\nWait, let me verify with an example:\n\nTake B={0,1,2,3}, which has size4. Its complement R is {4,5,6,7}. \n\nIs R in T? \n\nTo be in T, R must intersect every rotation of itself. \n\nRotating R by4 gives {0,1,2,3}, which is disjoint from R. \n\nTherefore, R is not in T, so B is counted in the desired set. \n\nThus, this subset is counted. \n\nSimilarly, the subset B={0,2,4,6} (complement R={1,3,5,7}), which is an alternating set. \n\nR's complement is B, which is an independent set on the8-cycle. \n\nR={1,3,5,7} is also an independent set, so rotating by1 gives {2,4,6,0}, which is disjoint from R. \n\nThus, R is not in T, so B is counted. \n\nTherefore, these two subsets are counted in N=22. \n\nSimilarly, the subset B={0,1,3,4} has size4. Its complement R={2,5,6,7}. \n\nIs R in T? \n\nRotating R by2 gives {4,7,0,1}. The intersection with R={2,5,6,7} is {7}. Non-empty. \n\nRotating by3: {5,0,1,2}. Intersection with R is {5,2}. \n\nRotating by4: {6,1,2,3}. Intersection with R is {6,2}. \n\nRotating by1: {3,6,7,8 mod8=0}. Intersection is {6,7,0}. \n\nSo R intersects every rotation. Therefore, R is in T, so B is not counted. \n\nThus, such subsets are not counted in N. \n\nTherefore, the total is indeed22. \n\nTherefore, the probability is22/256=11/128, so m+n=11+128=139. \n\nBut I feel this is possibly incorrect because the problem states \"each vertex is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability\". So the total is256. \n\nHowever, let me check the count again:\n\n- The two alternating subsets (size4): counted.\n\n- The four two-pairs subsets (size4): counted.\n\n- The16 no-opposite subsets (size4): counted. \n\nTotal:2+4+16=22. \n\nTherefore, the probability is22/256=11/128. \n\nBut this seems low. \n\nWait, but when I considered subsets like {0,1,2,3}, their complement is four vertices which can be rotated to be disjoint, so they should be counted. \n\nSimilarly, the no-opposite subsets (like {0,1,2,3}) are counted. \n\nThe total of22 seems correct based on the analysis. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is11+128=139. \n\nBut I recall that when we considered the subsets of size4 that can be rotated to be disjoint, we found22 subsets. \n\nTherefore, the desired count is22, giving probability22/256=11/128, so the answer is11+128=139. \n\nHowever, I might have made a mistake in the calculation of N. \n\nAlternatively, let me recheck the count for k=4:\n\nThe no-opposite subsets are16. \n\nThe two-pairs subsets are4. \n\nThe two alternating subsets are2. \n\nTotal22. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be139. \n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the no-opposite subsets are8 instead of16. \n\nWait, the no-opposite subsets are formed by choosing one from each of the4 opposite pairs. \n\nThere are4 pairs, each with2 choices, so2^4=16 subsets. \n\nYes, that is correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is139. \n\nBut let me see if the problem might have a different answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed some subsets in N. \n\nFor example, subsets like {0,1,4,5} can be rotated by2 to get {2,3,6,7}, which is disjoint. \n\nWait, {0,1,4,5} rotated by2 gives {2,3,6,7}, which is disjoint. \n\nTherefore, this subset should be counted in N. \n\nBut according to my previous analysis, it's not because it contains opposites1 and5. \n\nIndeed,1 and5 are opposites. \n\nTherefore, this subset contains an opposite pair and is not counted in",
