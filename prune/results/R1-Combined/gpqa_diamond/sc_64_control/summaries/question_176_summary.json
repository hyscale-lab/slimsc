      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized, right? Because the norm (or squared magnitude) should be 1. So I need to check if this vector is normalized. Let me calculate the sum of the squares of its components: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Adding them up, that's 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, so the vector isn't normalized. That's a problem. Wait, maybe I should normalize it first. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are unit vectors. So I think the correct approach is to divide each component by the square root of 6. So the normalized state vector would be ( -1/\u221a6, 2/\u221a6, 1/\u221a6 ). Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the problem introduces two observables, P and Q. Their corresponding operators are given as matrices. The operator for P, let's call it matrix P, has elements as follows:\n\nFirst row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\nSecond row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\nThird row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.\n\nAnd the operator for Q, matrix Q, is:\n\nFirst row: 1, 0, 0\nSecond row: 0, 0, 0\nThird row: 0, 0, -1.\n\nSo Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. That makes sense. So the possible outcomes when measuring Q are 1, 0, and -1.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring Q after P. Wait, no, the question says: someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the measurement of P is done first, then Q. But wait, in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of the corresponding operator. So the first measurement is of P, which affects the state, and then the second measurement of Q is done on this new state.\n\nBut wait, alternatively, maybe the measurement order is P then Q, so the probabilities are for P=0 and Q=-1. But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, so the initial state is |\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6). Then, first we measure P, and then Q. We need the probability that the first measurement gives P=0 and the second gives Q=-1.\n\nWait, but when you measure an observable, the outcome is one of its eigenvalues. So if P's eigenvalues include 0, then the first measurement could yield 0, and then the subsequent measurement of Q would be on the state after P's measurement.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should start by finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Because when we measure P, the state collapses into an eigenvector of P, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of that eigenvector in the initial state.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about P's eigenvalues. Let me try to find them. Alternatively, perhaps P is a Hermitian matrix since it's an observable. So let me check if P is Hermitian.\n\nMatrix P:\nRow 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n\nThe conjugate transpose of P (since all elements are real) is the same as P's transpose. Let me see the transpose of P. Row 1 becomes [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], same as original. Row 2 becomes [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], same as second row. Row 3 becomes [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], same as third row. So P is equal to its transpose, so it's symmetric, hence Hermitian. So yes, it's a valid observable.\n\nSo eigenvalues of P are real. Let's find the eigenvalues. Hmm, this might be a bit involved, but perhaps I can find them.\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nThe matrix P - \u03bb I is:\n[-\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n[1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2)]\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb]\n\nHmm, calculating the determinant of this 3x3 matrix.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))( -\u03bb ) - (1/sqrt(2))(0) ) ] + 0 * [ ... ]\n\nWait, maybe expanding along the first row.\n\nSo:\n\n-\u03bb * determinant of the submatrix:\n[ [ -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2) ],\n  [1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb ] ]\n\nMinus (1/sqrt(2)) times the determinant of the submatrix when column 2 is removed, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the rule for 3x3 determinants.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a smarter approach. Let me consider the structure of P. It's a symmetric matrix with a certain pattern. Maybe it's a tridiagonal matrix, but no. Hmm, perhaps I can find eigenvectors by assuming certain symmetries.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the matrix P has a particular structure. Let me check if there's any pattern or if it's a special matrix.\n\nWait, looking at P's elements: it's symmetric, and the non-zero elements are on the superdiagonal and subdiagonal, except for the center which is zero.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a graph Laplacian matrix or something else, but I might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that P^2 is the identity matrix? Let me check.\n\nWait, compute P squared:\n\nP = [\n[0, a, 0],\n[a, 0, a],\n[0, a, 0]\n], where a is 1/sqrt(2).\n\nSo P squared would be:\n\nCompute the product of P and P.\n\nLet me compute each element:\n\nElement (1,1) is row 1 of P times column 1 of P: 0*0 + a*a + 0*0 = a^2 = 1/2.\n\nElement (1,2) is row 1 of P times column 2 of P: 0*a + a*0 + 0*a = 0.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is row 1 of P times column 3 of P: 0*0 + a*a + 0*0 = a^2 = 1/2.\n\nElement (2,1) is row 2 times column 1: a*0 + 0*a + a*0 = 0.\n\nElement (2,2) is row2 * column2: a*a (from 2,1 *1,2) + 0*0 + a*a (from 2,3 *3,2) ) = a^2 + a^2 = 2a^2 = 1.\n\nElement (2,3) is row2 * column3: a*0 + 0*a + a*0 = 0.\n\nElement (3,1) is row3 * column1: 0*0 + a*a + 0*0 = a^2 = 1/2.\n\nElement (3,2) is row3 * column2: 0*a + a*0 + 0*a = 0.\n\nElement (3,3) is row3 * column3: 0*0 + a*a + 0*0 = a^2 = 1/2.\n\nSo P squared is:\n\n[ [ 1/2, 0, 1/2 ],\n  [ 0, 1, 0 ],\n  [ 1/2, 0, 1/2 ] ]\n\nWait, that's interesting. So P squared is not the identity matrix, but it's a matrix with 1/2, 0, 1/2 in the corners and 1 in the center. Hmm.\n\nWait, but we're trying to find the eigenvalues of P. Let me compute the trace of P squared. The trace is sum of diagonal elements: 1/2 + 1 + 1/2 = 2. The trace of P squared is the sum of squares of the eigenvalues, because for any matrix, trace(A^2) is the sum of squares of eigenvalues.\n\nWait, the trace of P is the sum of its diagonal elements. Let me compute that: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of the eigenvalues of P is zero.\n\nAnd the trace of P squared is 2. So the sum of squares of the eigenvalues is 2.\n\nSince there are three eigenvalues, let's denote them as \u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3.\n\nWe have:\n\n\u03bb1 + \u03bb2 + \u03bb3 = 0,\n\n\u03bb1\u00b2 + \u03bb2\u00b2 + \u03bb3\u00b2 = 2.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a third equation. Let's think about the determinant of P. The determinant of P is the product of eigenvalues. Let me compute determinant of P.\n\nUsing the matrix:\n\nRow 1: 0, a, 0.\n\nRow 2: a, 0, a.\n\nRow 3: 0, a, 0.\n\nThe determinant can be calculated using expansion by minors.\n\nExpanding along the first row (since it has a zero which might make calculation easier):\n\n0 * minor(1,1) - a * minor(1,2) + 0 * minor(1,3) = -a * minor(1,2).\n\nminor(1,2) is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2:\n\nRows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo the minor matrix is:\n\n[ a, a ]\n\n[ 0, 0 ]\n\nDeterminant is a*0 - a*0 = 0.\n\nSo the determinant of P is -a * 0 = 0. So the product of eigenvalues is zero. So at least one eigenvalue is zero.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb1 = 0, and the other two must satisfy \u03bb2 + \u03bb3 = 0 (from sum) and \u03bb2\u00b2 + \u03bb3\u00b2 = 2.\n\nBut since \u03bb2 + \u03bb3 =0, then \u03bb3 = -\u03bb2. Substituting into the second equation:\n\n\u03bb2\u00b2 + (-\u03bb2)^2 = 2 \u2192 2\u03bb2\u00b2 =2 \u2192 \u03bb2\u00b2 =1 \u2192 \u03bb2=1 or -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo when someone measures P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1. So the probability of getting 0 for P is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0 in the initial state.\n\nWait, but I need to find the eigenvectors for P. Let me find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\nFirst, for \u03bb=0:\n\nWe solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nMatrix P is:\n\n[0, a, 0]\n[a, 0, a]\n[0, a, 0]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n1) 0*v1 + a*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 a v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\n2) a v1 + 0*v2 + a v3 =0 \u2192 a(v1 + v3) = 0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\n3) 0*v1 + a v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 same as equation 1 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 must satisfy v2=0 and v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as [v1, 0, v3] where v1 = -v3. Let's choose v3 = 1, then v1 = -1. So the eigenvector is [-1, 0, 1]. But to make it a unit vector, we'll normalize it. The norm squared is (-1)^2 +0 +1^2 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check if this is correct. Let me plug into P:\n\nP * [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ].\n\nThe first component: 0*(-1/sqrt(2)) + a*0 +0*(1/sqrt(2)) = 0.\n\nSecond component: a*(-1/sqrt(2)) + 0*0 + a*(1/sqrt(2)) = a*(-1 +1)/sqrt(2) =0.\n\nThird component: 0*(-1/sqrt(2)) + a*0 + 0*(1/sqrt(2))=0.\n\nSo yes, it's an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.\n\nNow, for \u03bb=1:\n\nWe solve (P - I) v =0.\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n\n[ -1, a, 0 ]\n[ a, -1, a ]\n[ 0, a, -1 ]\n\nWe can write the equations:\n\n-1*v1 + a v2 = 0 \u2192 equation 1: v1 = a v2.\n\na v1 -1 v2 + a v3 =0 \u2192 substitute v1 from equation 1: a*(a v2) -v2 +a v3 =0 \u2192 a\u00b2 v2 -v2 +a v3 =0 \u2192 (a\u00b2 -1) v2 + a v3 =0.\n\nEquation 3: a v2 - v3 =0 \u2192 v3 = a v2.\n\nSubstituting v3 into equation from eq2:\n\n(a\u00b2 -1) v2 + a*(a v2 )=0 \u2192 (a\u00b2 -1 + a\u00b2 ) v2 =0 \u2192 (2a\u00b2 -1) v2 =0.\n\na is 1/sqrt(2), so a\u00b2 = 1/2. So 2a\u00b2 =1 \u2192 2*(1/2) =1 \u2192 2a\u00b2 -1 =0. So equation becomes 0 * v2 =0. Which is always true.\n\nSo from equation 1: v1 = a v2.\n\nFrom equation 3: v3 = a v2.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as [a v2, v2, a v2 ] = v2 [a, 1, a ].\n\nWe can choose v2=1/sqrt(2a\u00b2 + 1) to normalize.\n\nWait, let me compute the normalization factor.\n\nThe vector is [a, 1, a ].\n\nThe squared norm is a\u00b2 +1 +a\u00b2 = 2a\u00b2 +1.\n\nBut a is 1/sqrt(2), so a\u00b2=1/2. So 2a\u00b2=1 \u2192 the squared norm is 1 +1=2. So the normalized eigenvector is (a,1,a)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2) )^T divided by sqrt(2). Because sqrt(2) comes from the denominator.\n\nWait, let me compute the vector:\n\n[ a, 1, a ] \u2192 [1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2) ]\n\nThe squared norm is (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) )= 2 \u2192 norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)) / sqrt(2) \u2192 which is (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) ) \u2192 which is (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2 )^T.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me recheck:\n\nThe vector [a,1,a] \u2192 a=1/sqrt(2), so it's [1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)].\n\nThe norm squared is (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) = 2, so the norm is sqrt(2). So the unit vector is [1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)] divided by sqrt(2). So each component is multiplied by 1/sqrt(2):\n\n(1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(2)) = 1/2,\n\n1 * 1/sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(2),\n\nSimilarly, third component is 1/2.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2]^T.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check this. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to solve the equations again. Another approach: assuming v is [x, y, z].\n\nFrom (P - I) v =0.\n\nEquation 1: 0*x + a y + 0*z =0 \u2192 a y =0 \u2192 y=0.\n\nWait, wait, no, wait. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because for (P - I), the first row is [ -1, a, 0 ].\n\nSo equation 1 is -x + a y =0 \u2192 x = a y.\n\nEquation 2: a x - y + a z =0.\n\nEquation 3: 0 x + a y - z =0 \u2192 a y = z.\n\nSo substituting x = a y and z = a y into equation 2:\n\na*(a y) - y + a*(a y)= 0 \u2192 a\u00b2 y -y + a\u00b2 y =0 \u2192 (2 a\u00b2 -1 ) y =0.\n\nSince a\u00b2 = 1/2, 2 a\u00b2 =1 \u2192 2 a\u00b2 -1 =0.\n\nSo equation 2 is 0=0, which is always true.\n\nThus, the general solution is x = a y, z= a y, with y being a free variable.\n\nLet y =1. Then x= a, z= a.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [a, 1, a]^T. The norm squared is a\u00b2 + 1 + a\u00b2 = 2 a\u00b2 +1 = 2*(1/2) +1 =1+1=2. So the normalized eigenvector is [a,1,a]/sqrt(2) \u2192 [1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)] / sqrt(2) \u2192 which is [1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(2)]^T.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I should write the normalized eigenvector as [a,1,a]/sqrt(2a\u00b2 +1) \u2192 since a\u00b2=1/2, denominator is sqrt(2*(1/2) +1) = sqrt(2) \u2192 so [a,1,a]/sqrt(2) = [1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)]/sqrt(2) \u2192 which gives each component as [1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) , 1/sqrt(2), 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) ] \u2192 [1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2 ].\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused, but perhaps that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for \u03bb=-1.\n\nThe matrix (P + I) is:\n\n[1, a, 0 ]\n\n[a, 1, a ]\n\n[0, a, 1 ]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n1*x + a y =0 \u2192 equation 1: x = -a y.\n\na x + 1 y + a z =0 \u2192 substituting x = -a y: a*(-a y) + y + a z =0 \u2192 -a\u00b2 y + y + a z =0 \u2192 ( -a\u00b2 +1 ) y + a z =0.\n\nEquation 3: a y +1 z =0 \u2192 z = -a y.\n\nSubstituting z = -a y into equation from eq2:\n\n( -a\u00b2 +1 ) y + a*(-a y) =0 \u2192 ( -a\u00b2 +1 ) y - a\u00b2 y =0 \u2192 [ (-a\u00b2 +1) - a\u00b2 ] y =0 \u2192 [1 - 2 a\u00b2 ] y =0.\n\nSince a\u00b2=1/2, 2a\u00b2=1 \u2192 1 -2a\u00b2 =0.\n\nSo equation becomes 0=0 \u2192 y is a free variable.\n\nSo choose y=1.\n\nThen x = -a *1 = -a.\n\nz = -a *1 = -a.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [ -a, 1, -a ]^T \u2192 which is [ -1/sqrt(2), 1, -1/sqrt(2) ]^T.\n\nThe norm squared is a\u00b2 +1 + a\u00b2 = 2 a\u00b2 +1 = 2*(1/2) +1 =2 \u2192 norm is sqrt(2) \u2192 normalized as [ -1/sqrt(2), 1, -1/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2) \u2192 which would be [ -1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), -1/(2) ]^T.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if this is an eigenvector.\n\nP * [ -a, 1, -a ].\n\nFirst component: 0*(-a) + a*(1) +0*(-a) =a.\n\nWhich for eigenvalue -1, should be (-1)*(-a) \u2192 a. So yes.\n\nSecond component: a*(-a) +0*(1) +a*(-a) = -a\u00b2 - a\u00b2 = -2a\u00b2 \u2192 since a\u00b2=1/2, that's -1. Which for eigenvalue -1 would be (-1)*1 \u2192 -1. So correct.\n\nThird component: 0*(-a) +a*(1) + 0*(-a) =a \u2192 which should be (-1)*(-a) =a. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the eigenvector is correct.\n\nSo summarizing the eigenvectors:\n\n\u03bb=0: v1 = [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ].\n\n\u03bb=1: v2 = [ a, 1, a ] normalized \u2192 [1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)] / sqrt(2) \u2192 [1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2 ].\n\nWait, wait, earlier calculations led to [1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2], but I'm not fully confident about the normalization. Alternatively, perhaps I should write it as [1, sqrt(2), 1 ] / sqrt( (1^2) + (sqrt(2))^2 + (1^2) ) \u2192 sqrt(1+2+1) =sqrt(4)=2. So [1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2 ].\n\nSame for \u03bb=-1: v3 = [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]? Wait no, for \u03bb=-1, the eigenvector was [ -a,1,-a ] \u2192 [ -1/sqrt(2), 1, -1/sqrt(2) ]. The norm is sqrt( (1/2) +1 + (1/2) )=sqrt(2) \u2192 so unit vector is [ -1/sqrt(2), 1, -1/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2) \u2192 which is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ].\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the eigenvectors.\n\nSo, the initial state is |\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6) \u2192 let's compute the inner product with each eigenvector of P to find the coefficients for each eigenvalue.\n\nFirst, the eigenvectors are:\n\nv0 (\u03bb=0): [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ].\n\nv1 (\u03bb=1): [1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2) \u2192 which is [1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2 ].\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought that [1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2) ] has a norm of sqrt(2), but let me check:\n\n(1/sqrt(2))^2 + (1)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 \u2192 (1/2) +1 + (1/2) = 2 \u2192 sqrt(2) is the norm. So normalized is [1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2) \u2192 [1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(2) ].\n\nSimilarly, for v3 (\u03bb=-1): [ -1/sqrt(2), 1, -1/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2) \u2192 [ -1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), -1/(2) ].\n\nSo now, compute the probability of measuring P=0. That's the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |\u03c8> and v0.\n\nCompute <v0 | \u03c8>:\n\nv0 is [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.\n\n|\u03c8> is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.\n\nDot product: (-1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(-1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) = 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = 1/sqrt(12) = sqrt(3)/6 \u2248 0.2887.\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)) = 1/sqrt(12) = same as above.\n\nSo total is 2*(1/sqrt(12)) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3) \u2248 0.577.\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3 \u2192 so the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of P=0 is 1/3.\n\nBut wait, the question is about measuring P=0 and then Q=-1. Hmm, but what's the state after measuring P=0?\n\nWhen you measure P and get 0, the state collapses to the eigenvector v0, which is [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ].\n\nWait, but v0 was normalized, so the state after measurement is |v0>.\n\nThen, when measuring Q after that, what is the probability of getting -1?\n\nBecause Q is diagonal, its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1, and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n\nWait, matrix Q is diagonal, so its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors e1, e2, e3, with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1 respectively.\n\nSo, the state after P measurement is |v0> = [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ].\n\nNow, to find the probability that measuring Q gives -1.\n\nThe eigenvector for Q=-1 is e3 = [0, 0, 1]^T.\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |v0> and e3.\n\nSo the inner product is (0)(-1/sqrt(2)) + (0)(0) + (1)(1/sqrt(2)) \u2192 1/sqrt(2).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nSo the probability of Q=-1 after P=0 is 1/2.\n\nSo overall, the probability is P(P=0) * P(Q=-1 | P=0) \u2192 (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\n\nSo the correct answer is 1/6, which is option D.\n\n\nThe problem involves a quantum system with an initial state given by the column vector:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} / \\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\n\nThe system is subject to two observables, \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), with corresponding operators represented by the matrices:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix} \n0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ \n1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ \n0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \n\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \nQ = \\begin{bmatrix} \n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & -1 \n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe task is to find the probability of measuring \\(P = 0\\) and \\(Q = -1\\) in sequence.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \\(P\\)\nThe matrix \\(P\\) is symmetric and Hermitian, so its eigenvalues are real.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's three components, so it's a 3-dimensional state vector. The operators for two observables, P and Q, are given. I need to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring first P then Q.\n\nHmm, right. So the process is: measure P, get 0, then measure Q, get -1. Since measurements affect the state, the state after measuring P will be an eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, measuring Q in that new state will give the probability for -1.\n\nFirst, I think I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P to see what the possible outcomes are for P. Because when you measure P, the system collapses into an eigenvector of P, right?\n\nWait, the operator P is given by a matrix. Let me write it out:\n\nP matrix:\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nHmm. I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Since the state is given, perhaps I can compute the expectation values and probabilities without explicitly finding eigenvectors.\n\nWait, but the initial state is (-1, 2, 1) as a column vector. Let's normalize it first, because the probabilities depend on the normalized state.\n\nCalculating the norm: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state vector psi is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.\n\nNow, when we measure P, we get one of its eigenvalues, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nBut what are the eigenvalues of P? Let me try to find them.\n\nThe matrix P is:\n\n[ 0    1/\u221a2    0 ]\n[1/\u221a2  0     1/\u221a2 ]\n[ 0    1/\u221a2    0 ]\n\nHmm, this looks a bit like a symmetric matrix, so it should have real eigenvalues. Let me see if I can find them. Alternatively, perhaps I can guess an eigenvector.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to look for invariant subspaces or find the trace and determinant, but the matrix is 3x3, which might be complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I can see the structure. The first row has zeros except for the middle element. The second row has 1/sqrt(2) in the first and third positions and zero in the middle. The third row is similar to the first.\n\nWait, perhaps this matrix is symmetric, so it's diagonalizable. Let me see: P_ij = P_ji. Yes, because P_12 = 1/sqrt(2) and P_21 is the same. Similarly, P_23 and P_32 are both 1/sqrt(2), and the others are symmetric. So it's a symmetric matrix, so eigenvalues are real, and eigenvectors are orthogonal.\n\nBut how to find the eigenvalues. Maybe I can look for eigenvectors by solving (P - \u03bb I) v = 0.\n\nSo the characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nLet me write the matrix P - \u03bb I:\n\nRow 1: -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2), 0\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2)\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))^2 ] - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - 0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]\n\nWait, maybe expanding along the first row:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb) * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))^2 ] - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - 0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]\n\nSo,\n\ndet = (-\u03bb) [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-\u03bb * 1/sqrt(2)) - 0 ] + 0\n\n= (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) (\u03bb / sqrt(2) )\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb / 2 )\n\nSecond term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (\u03bb / sqrt(2)) )= (\u03bb) (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))) )= \u03bb/2\n\nSo adding both terms:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb\n\nSo the determinant equation is -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nFactor: \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 1 ) = 0.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb = 0, \u03bb = 1, \u03bb = -1.\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check.\n\nBecause the equation is:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb =0, and \u03bb\u00b2=1 \u2192 \u03bb= \u00b11.\n\nYes, so the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo when you measure P, you can get 0, 1, or -1.\n\nBut the question is, when you measure P and get 0, then the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector. Then, measuring Q in that state.\n\nWait, but the initial measurement is of P, which gives 0. So the probability is the square of the amplitude of the component of the initial state in the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nBut wait, the eigenvectors of P for eigenvalue 0 are needed.\n\nWait, let me find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\nStarting with \u03bb=0.\n\nSo (P - 0 I) v =0 \u2192 P v =0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nRow 1: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 =0.\n\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nRow 3: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u2192 v2 =0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 must satisfy v2=0, v1 = -v3. Let's pick v3 = a, so v1= -a, v2=0. So the eigenvector is [ -a, 0, a ]^T. To normalize, a=1/sqrt(2), so the eigenvector is [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.\n\nWait, but wait, the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 could be any scalar multiple, but the direction is what matters. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1, 0, 1).\n\nWait, let me compute the norm: (-1)^2 +0^2 +1^2 =2 \u2192 sqrt(2), so a=1/sqrt(2) as I did.\n\nSo the eigenvector is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.\n\nNow, the initial state is \u03c8 = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.\n\nThe probability of measuring P=0 is the square of the inner product between \u03c8 and the eigenvector of P=0.\n\nSo let me compute <eigenvector|\u03c8>:\n\n( (-1/sqrt(2)) , 0, 1/sqrt(2) ) \u00b7 ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )\n\n= [ (-1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)) ]\n\n= [ (1)/(sqrt(12)) ) + 0 + (1)/(sqrt(12)) ]\n\nSimplify sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3), so each term is 1/(2 sqrt(3)).\n\nAdding the two gives 2/(2 sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe square of the amplitude is (1/sqrt(3))^2 =1/3.\n\nSo the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3.\n\nIf we measure P and get 0, the state of the system collapses to the eigenvector of P=0, which is [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.\n\nWait, but I should normalize this state after projection. Wait, the initial state is \u03c8, and when you make a projection into an eigenvector, the state becomes the eigenvector divided by its norm. But wait, the eigenvector is already normalized, so after the projection, the state is exactly the eigenvector.\n\nSo now, after measuring P=0, the state is |\u03c8_p0> = [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.\n\nNow, we measure Q. The operator Q is given by the matrix:\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 0\n\nRow 2: 0, 0, 0\n\nRow 3: 0, 0, -1\n\nSo, the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1.\n\nWait, because the diagonal matrix has 1, 0, -1 on the diagonal. So, the matrix is diagonal, so the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n\nFor Q=1: eigenvector is [1,0,0]^T.\n\nFor Q=0: any vector in the second basis vector, but since it's zero, any vector in the subspace orthogonal to the other eigenvectors. Wait, no, for a diagonal matrix, the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. So Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1, with eigenvectors e1, e2, e3 respectively.\n\nSo in this case, eigenstates for Q are the standard basis vectors.\n\nNow, when we measure Q in the state |\u03c8_p0>, what is the probability of getting -1?\n\nThe eigenvalue -1 corresponds to the eigenvector e3 = [0, 0, 1]^T.\n\nSo the probability is the square of the amplitude of e3 in |\u03c8_p0>.\n\nCompute the inner product of |\u03c8_p0> and e3:\n\n( [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ] ) \u00b7 [ 0, 0, 1 ] = 1/sqrt(2).\n\nThe square is (1/sqrt(2))\u00b2 = 1/2.\n\nSo the probability of measuring Q=-1 after measuring P=0 is 1/2.\n\nWait, but then the overall probability is the product of the two probabilities. No, wait, no. Because the first measurement affects the state for the second measurement. The initial state is \u03c8. The probability of first getting P=0 and then Q=-1 is the product of the probability of P=0 and, given that, the probability of Q=-1.\n\nSo the overall probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because the first step is measuring P=0. The second step is measuring Q=-1 in the state post P=0. So the joint probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The initial probability to get P=0 is 1/3. Then, given that, the probability to get Q=-1 is 1/2. So overall, yes, the joint probability is (1/3)*(1/2)=1/6.\n\nSo the answer should be option D) 1/6.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through the steps again.\n\n1. Initial state is normalized: yes, because the sum of squares is 6, and we take each component divided by sqrt(6).\n\n2. Find eigenvalues of P: 0, 1, -1. So possible P outcomes are 0, 1, -1.\n\n3. Find eigenvector for P=0: [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.\n\n4. Compute inner product between initial state and this eigenvector: (1/sqrt(3)), so probability 1/3.\n\n5. After measuring P=0, the state becomes the eigenvector.\n\n6. Measure Q in this state. Q's eigenvector for -1 is [0,0,1]^T.\n\n7. Inner product between [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ] and [0,0,1] is 1/sqrt(2). So the probability is (1/sqrt(2))\u00b2=1/2.\n\n8. Multiply the two probabilities: (1/3)*(1/2)=1/6. So the answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the combined probability using the projectors.\n\nAnother approach: the combined probability to first get P=0 and then Q=-1 is the square of the amplitude of the component of the initial state that is in the joint eigenspace of P=0 and Q=-1.\n\nWait, but for Q, the eigenstates are e1, e2, e3. So the joint eigenspace for P=0 and Q=-1 is the subspace spanned by e3, provided that e3 is also an eigenvector of P.\n\nWait, let me check: e3 is [0,0,1]^T. What is P acting on e3?\n\nP * e3 = [0, (1/sqrt(2)), 0 ]^T.\n\nWhich is not equal to zero, so e3 is not an eigenvector of P.\n\nWait, so the state after P=0 is |\u03c8_p0> = [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T. Let me compute Q acting on this state.\n\nWait, Q is diagonal, so applying Q to |\u03c8_p0> would give:\n\nQ |\u03c8_p0> = [1*(-1/sqrt(2)), 0, (-1)*(1/sqrt(2)) ]^T.\n\nSo the components are (-1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ). The eigenvalues would be 1, 0, -1 for each component. Wait, no, in this case, the state is a combination of the Q eigenstates.\n\nSo, when we measure Q, the possible results are 1, 0, or -1.\n\nThe projection onto each eigenvector of Q from |\u03c8_p0>:\n\nThe projection onto e1 (Q=1) is the first component: (-1/sqrt(2))\u00b2 = 1/2.\n\nThe projection onto e2 (Q=0): the second component is zero, so probability zero.\n\nThe projection onto e3 (Q=-1): (1/sqrt(2))\u00b2=1/2.\n\nWait, but in |\u03c8_p0>, the third component is 1/sqrt(2), right? So the inner product with e3 is (1/sqrt(2)), so the probability is (1/sqrt(2))\u00b2=1/2.\n\nSo that's consistent with the earlier calculation.\n\nSo the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2 after measuring P=0, which had a probability of 1/3.\n\nThus, the combined probability is (1/3)(1/2)=1/6.\n\nSo the answer should be D) 1/6.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the probability of measuring \\( P = 0 \\) followed by \\( Q = -1 \\) for a quantum system with a given initial state and operators \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\). Here's the analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Normalize the initial state\nThe initial state is given as \\( \\psi = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through step by step. Alright, let's start by understanding what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but that doesn't look like a normalized state vector. Oh wait, maybe it is. Let me check. The state vector is a column vector with components -1, 2, 1. The length of this vector would be the square root of (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 = 6. So the square root of 6. So the state vector is not normalized. Oh, but in quantum mechanics, state vectors are supposed to be normalized. Hmm, maybe I should normalize it first. Or wait, perhaps the given state is already normalized. Let me think: the sum of squares is 6, so the norm is sqrt(6), so to normalize, we'd divide each component by sqrt(6). But wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about normalizing. Oh, perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the state is already normalized? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me proceed and see if that becomes an issue later.\n\nNext, the operators for observables P and Q are given. The operator P has the matrix:\n\nFirst row: (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0)\nSecond row: (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2))\nThird row: (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0)\n\nAnd the operator Q is:\n\nFirst row: (1,0,0)\nSecond row: (0,0,0)\nThird row: (0,0,-1)\n\nSo Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes when measuring Q are 1, 0, and -1. Similarly, for P, I need to look at its eigenvalues because those will be the possible outcomes.\n\nThe question is asking, if we first measure P and then measure Q, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.\n\nWait, but when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So after the first measurement of P, the state will be in one of the eigenstates of P. Then, when we measure Q, the outcome depends on this new state.\n\nBut wait, the problem says someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the order is P first, then Q. So the process is: initial state \u2192 measure P (get outcome 0) \u2192 state collapses to the corresponding eigenstate of P for 0 \u2192 then measure Q on this state and get outcome -1. The probability is the product of the probabilities of each of these steps, assuming they are independent, which they are if the measurements are consecutive.\n\nWait, no, because the state after the first measurement affects the second. So I need to find the probability that the first measurement of P yields 0, and the second measurement of Q, given the state after P's measurement, yields -1.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P. We're interested in the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0, because that's the outcome we want from the first measurement.\n\n2. The initial state is given, but perhaps we need to normalize it first. Let me check its norm. The state is (-1, 2, 1). The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\n3. The probability that measuring P gives 0 is the square of the amplitude of the component of the initial state in the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. If P has multiple eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0, the state could collapse into any of them, but the probabilities would add up.\n\nWait, but first I need to find the eigenvectors of P. Let me write the matrix for P again:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],\n[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n]\n\nHmm, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for this matrix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues first. Let me find the characteristic equation.\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P - \u03bb I is:\n\n[\n[-\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2), 0],\n[1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2)],\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb]\n]\n\nThe determinant of this 3x3 matrix is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))^2 ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - 0 ] + 0 * [ ... ] \n\nWait, perhaps expanding along the first row.\n\nThe determinant would be:\n\n-\u03bb * det [ [ -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2) ],\n             [1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb ] ]\n\nminus 1/sqrt(2) * det [ [ 1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ],\n                        [0, -\u03bb ] ]\n\nplus 0 * something.\n\nSo let's compute each minor.\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb * [ (\u2212\u03bb)(\u2212\u03bb) \u2212 (1/sqrt(2))^2 ] = -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 \u2212 (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - 0 ] = - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb / sqrt(2)) ) = - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb / sqrt(2)) \u2192 simplifies to (\u03bb/2 )\n\nThird term is zero.\n\nSo overall determinant equation:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 -1/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0\n\nExpand this:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0 \u2192 -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb( -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 )= 0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2 ) =0.\n\nSo eigenvalues are \u03bb=0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1. So possible outcomes for measuring P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nBut the problem is about measuring 0 for P. So we're looking for the eigenvectors of P corresponding to \u03bb=0.\n\nLet me find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe set up (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the system is:\n\nFirst equation: (0)v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3 =0 \u2192 (1/sqrt(2)) v2 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSecond equation: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0.\n\nThird equation: 0 v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3 =0 \u2192 again v2=0.\n\nSo from v2=0, the third equation is satisfied.\n\nFrom the second equation, v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, v3) where v1 = -v3. Let me choose v3 = a, then v1 = -a.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as (-a, 0, a) = a*(-1, 0, 1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1, 0, 1), because the norm squared is (1) +0 + (1) =2 \u2192 sqrt(2) is the norm, so divide by sqrt(2).\n\nWait, no: The vector (-1,0,1) has a norm of sqrt( (-1)^2 +0 + 1^2 )=sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.\n\nSo any state in this eigenspace can be written as a scalar multiple of this vector.\n\nNow, the initial state is (-1, 2, 1)^T, but normalized. The norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nWhen we measure P, the probability of getting 0 is the square of the inner product between the initial state and the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0.\n\nSo compute the inner product:\n\n\u27e8v | eigenvector\u27e9 = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ] \u2022 [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]\n\n= [ (-1)(-1) ]/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) + [2*0 ] ... + [1*1]/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2))\n= (1)/(sqrt(12)) + 0 + (1)/(sqrt(12))\n= (2)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3), so 2/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = 1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the inner product is 1/sqrt(3), so the probability is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of getting 0 for P is 1/3.\n\nNow, after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses into the eigenvector for \u03bb=0, which is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.\n\nNow, we measure Q on this state. Let's find the possible outcomes of Q.\n\nQ is a diagonal matrix with entries 1, 0, -1 on the diagonal. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. The corresponding eigenvectors are:\n\nFor 1: (1,0,0)\nFor 0: any vector in the y-z plane (but wait, no, Q is diagonal, so eigenvectors are standard basis vectors.\n\nWait, more precisely, the eigenvectors for Q are (1,0,0) for eigenvalue 1, (0,1,0) for eigenvalue 0, and (0,0,1) for eigenvalue -1.\n\nSo when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1,0,-1.\n\nWe are interested in the outcome -1 for Q. So the corresponding eigenvector is (0,0,1).\n\nThe state after the first measurement is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.\n\nTo find the probability of measuring -1 for Q, we compute the inner product between this state and the eigenvector (0,0,1), then square the absolute value.\n\nCompute inner product:\n\n\u27e8 e_Q | state \u27e9 = (0, 0, 1) \u2022 ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ) = 0 +0 + (1)(1/sqrt(2)) ) \u2192 1/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the probability is |1/sqrt(2)|\u00b2 = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting -1 for Q is 1/2.\n\nNow, the combined probability of getting P=0 and then Q=-1 is the product of the probabilities, since the two measurements are consecutive and the state changes after the first.\n\nSo the probabilities are (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the state after the first measurement is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ). So when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are:\n\n- For eigenvalue 1: the projection is (0,0,0), so the component is zero.\n\n- For eigenvalue 0: the projection is (0,1,0), which is orthogonal to our state, so component is zero.\n\n- For eigenvalue -1: the component is (0,0,1) \u2022 state, which is 1/sqrt(2). So the square is 1/2. That's correct.\n\nSo the probability for each outcome is 1/2 for Q=-1, 0 for others. So the Q=-1 probability is 1/2.\n\nSo the total probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 1/6. So the correct answer should be D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the system's state and the operators for observables \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\). The initial state of the system is given as the column vector \\((-1, 2, 1)^T\\), which has a norm of \\(\\sqrt{6}\\). Normalizing the state, we get:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\( P \\)\nThe operator \\( P \\) is represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{pmatrix} \n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\ \n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \\(\\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0\\). The eigenvalues are \\(\\lambda = 0, 1, -1\\). For \\(\\lambda = 0\\), the eigenvectors satisfy \\( P v = 0 \\). Solving this, the eigenvectors are of the form \\( v = a(-1, 0, 1)^T \\), where \\( a \\) is a scalar.
