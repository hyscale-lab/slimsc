      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. \n\nWait, rhombohedral crystals. I remember that a rhombohedron has all edges equal and all angles equal too. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh right, and the interatomic distance is 10 angstroms. So each edge of the unit cell is a = 10 angstroms?\n\nThe formula for interplanar distance d_hkl in a crystal is given by the Bragg's equation, but wait no, that's for diffraction. The interplanar spacing formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * (cos \u03b8) ) )... Wait, wait, no, that's not right. I'm mixing something up. \n\nOh right, in a cubic system, the interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2). But wait, this is a rhombohedral system, not cubic. So the formula must be more complicated.\n\nWait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is given by:\n\nd_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h\u00b2 (1/a\u00b2) ) + (k\u00b2 (1/b\u00b2) ) + (l\u00b2 (1/c\u00b2) ) + 2hk (cos gamma / (a b)) + 2hl (cos beta / (a c)) + 2kl (cos alpha / (b c)) ) )\n\nBut wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, a = b = c, and all angles are equal. So alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees. Hmm. So substituting that in.\n\nSo a = b = c = 10 angstroms. Angles are 30 each.\n\nSo the formula simplifies. Let me plug in the values.\n\nThe denominator becomes:\n\nh\u00b2 (1/a\u00b2) + k\u00b2 (1/a\u00b2) + l\u00b2 (1/a\u00b2) + 2hk (cos gamma)/(a^2) + 2hl (cos beta)/(a^2) + 2kl (cos alpha)/(a^2)\n\nSince all angles are the same, and all a's are same, I can factor out 1/a\u00b2.\n\nSo denominator = [h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha] / a\u00b2\n\nBut wait, since all angles are equal, and assuming that the formula uses the angle between the respective axes.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe in a rhombohedral system, the formula for d_{hkl} is a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b8 ), where \u03b8 is the angle between the axes. Wait, that might not be exactly right.\n\nAlternatively, I think the general formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b1 )\n\nWait, but wait, in the case where all the angles are the same, say \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3, then the formula would use which angle? Because each term hk, etc., would involve different angles. Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the formula is slightly different.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be calculated using:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b8 )\n\nWhere \u03b8 is the angle of the rhombohedral distortion. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the unit cell vectors and the plane's Miller indices.\n\nWait, another approach: the interplanar distance formula can be derived from the dot product of vectors.\n\nThe Miller indices (hkl) define a plane. The normal vector to this plane is (h, k, l). In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a1, a2, a3, each of length a, and the angles between them are alpha, beta, gamma, which are all 30 degrees.\n\nThe reciprocal lattice vectors are needed for the calculation of d_{hkl}, but I'm not too confident about that. Alternatively, the formula I remember is:\n\nd_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 + 2 (hk cos gamma)/(ab) + 2 (hl cos beta)/(ac) + 2(kl cos alpha)/(bc) )\n\nBut in rhombohedral, a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma= 30 degrees. So substituting these:\n\nd = 1 / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2)/(a\u00b2) + 2hk (cos 30)/(a\u00b2) + 2hl (cos 30)/(a\u00b2) + 2kl (cos 30)/(a\u00b2) )\n\nFactor out 1/a\u00b2:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + 2hk cos30 + 2hl cos30 + 2kl cos30 )\n\nBecause cos30 is same for each term.\n\nSo for the (111) plane, h=k=l=1.\n\nPlugging in:\n\nd = a / sqrt( 1 + 1 + 1 + 2(1)(1)(cos30) + 2(1)(1)(cos30) + 2(1)(1)(cos30) )\n\nSimplify the numerator inside the sqrt:\n\n1+1+1 = 3.\n\nEach of the cross terms: 2hk cos30 is 2*1*1*(\u221a3/2) = \u221a3. So each term is \u221a3.\n\nThere are three such terms: 2hk, 2hl, 2kl. So total cross terms: 3*\u221a3.\n\nSo inside the sqrt: 3 + 3\u221a3.\n\nSo d = a / sqrt(3 + 3\u221a3) = a / sqrt(3 (1 +\u221a3 )) = a / sqrt(3) * sqrt(1/(1+\u221a3)) \n\nWait, let's compute the denominator numerically.\n\nCompute 3 + 3\u221a3:\n\n\u221a3 is approx 1.732. So 3\u221a3 is approx 5.196.\n\nSo 3 +5.196 =8.196.\n\nSo sqrt(8.196) is approximately sqrt(8.196) = about 2.863.\n\nWait, but let me calculate it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, compute exactly:\n\nsqrt(3 +3\u221a3) = sqrt(3(1+\u221a3)).\n\nSo taking a=10 angstrom.\n\nSo d =10 / sqrt(3 +3\u221a3) = 10 / (sqrt(3 (1 +\u221a3)) )\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the denominator.\n\nCompute 3 +3\u221a3:\n\n3*(1+\u221a3) \u22483*(1 +1.732) =3*(2.732)=8.196.\n\nSo sqrt(8.196)= about 2.863.\n\nSo d\u224810 / 2.863 \u22483.493 angstrom. Wait, that can't be right because the options are all around 9 angstroms. Wait, did I mess up the formula?\n\nWait, wait, no, wait. Because a is 10 angstroms. Let me recompute:\n\nWait, let's recalculate.\n\nWait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the denominator is h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(alpha), but wait, in this case, alpha is the angle between which axes? Hmm, perhaps I need to think of the angles between a1, a2, a3.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nd_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Wait, perhaps another approach: For a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be calculated using:\n\nd^2 = (a^2) / [ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha ]\n\nWait, but in our case, all angles are 30 degrees. So cos gamma, cos beta, cos alpha are all cos30 = \u221a3/2 \u22480.866.\n\nSo for (111) plane, h=k=l=1.\n\nSo denominator = 1+1+1 + 2*(1*1 * 0.866) *3 (since three terms: hk, hl, kl each contribute 2*1*1*cos30).\n\nWait, 1+1+1 =3.\n\nThe cross terms: 2*1*1*cos30 for each of the three terms (hk, hl, kl), so 3*2*(\u221a3/2) =3\u221a3.\n\nSo denominator is 3 +3\u221a3.\n\nSo d = a / sqrt(3 +3\u221a3) = 10 / sqrt(3*(1 +\u221a3)).\n\nLet me compute sqrt(3*(1 +\u221a3)).\n\nCompute 1 +\u221a3 \u22481 +1.732=2.732.\n\n3*(2.732)=8.196.\n\nSo sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.\n\nSo d=10 / 2.863 \u22483.494 angstrom.\n\nWait, but none of the options are around 3.5. The options are 8.95, 9.08, etc. So this can't be correct. I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the formula. Maybe I should have taken 1/d^2 equals the sum, so I should have d = 1/sqrt(...). No, that doesn't make sense because the units would be inverse angstroms.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 )\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between the lattice vectors. But wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes a, b, c are all equal, so theta=30 degrees.\n\nWait, but wait, sometimes in crystallography, the formula uses the angle between the reciprocal vectors, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 + ... )\n\nBut in a rhombohedral system, a=b=c, so it simplifies.\n\nWait, perhaps I should refer to the general formula for interplanar spacing.\n\nWait, the general formula is:\n\nd_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)/(a^2) )\n\nBecause, in the general case, the denominator is [ ... ] as I wrote earlier.\n\nSo when a=b=c= a, and cos alpha = cos beta = cos gamma = cos 30.\n\nSo plugging in:\n\nd_{111} = 1 / sqrt( (1+1+1)/a\u00b2 + 2(1*1*cos30 + 1*1*cos30 + 1*1*cos30)/a\u00b2 )\n\n= 1 / sqrt( (3 + 3 * cos30) / a\u00b2 )\n\n= a / sqrt(3 + 3 cos30 )\n\nBecause a is 10 angstrom: d=10 / sqrt(3 +3*0.8660)\n\nCompute 3 +3*0.8660 = 3 + 2.598 =5.598.\n\nSo sqrt(5.598)= approx 2.366.\n\nSo d=10 / 2.366 \u22484.225 angstroms.\n\nStill not matching any of the options. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Wait, maybe the formula for d is a/(sqrt(...)) instead of 1/sqrt(...). Let me recheck.\n\nWait, I think the formula is correct: d = a / sqrt(...) because \n\nd = 1 / [sqrt( (h^2 + ...) ) ] * ( a ), no, wait:\n\nWait, no, the formula is:\n\nd_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 + 2(hk cos gamma)/(ab) + 2(hl cos beta)/(ac) + 2(kl cos alpha)/(bc) )\n\nSo when a = b = c,\n\n= 1/sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/(a^2) + 2(hk cos30 + hl cos30 + kl cos30)/(a^2) )\n\nFactor 1/a\u00b2:\n\n= a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos30 )\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo for hkl=111, the numerator is a=10.\n\nDenominator inside sqrt: 3 + 3 * (2 * 1 * 1 * cos30 )? No, no: 2(hk + hl + kl) cos30 = 2(1 +1 +1) * cos30 = 6 * (\u221a3/2) = 3\u221a3.\n\nWait, no: 2*(hk + hl + kl) \u2192 since h=k=l=1, each hk=1*1=1, so sum is 3. So 2*3=6. Then multiplied by cos30: 6*(\u221a3/2)=3\u221a3.\n\nSo denominator inside sqrt is 3 +3\u221a3.\n\nSo d= a / sqrt(3 +3\u221a3)=10 / sqrt(3(1 +\u221a3)).\n\nCompute sqrt(3(1 +\u221a3)) = sqrt(3 +3\u221a3) \u2248 sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.862.\n\nSo d=10 /2.862 \u22483.492 angstrom.\n\nWait, but the options are all around 9 angstroms. So 3.5 is way off. I must have messed up the formula. Maybe the formula is the reciprocal?\n\nWait, couldn't be. Because interplanar distances are smaller than the lattice parameter.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the indices. Oh wait, no, the unit cell is rhombohedral, and the (111) plane is a close-packed plane, which would have a smaller spacing than the lattice parameter. But the options are all larger than 8 angstroms. So I'm clearly doing something wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the formula uses the reciprocal of the denominator. Let's check the formula again.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nd = 1 / sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 + 2(hk cos gamma)/(ab) + 2(hl cos beta)/(ac) + 2(kl cos alpha)/(bc) )\n\nSo with a=10, and the same angles. For (111):\n\nd=1 / sqrt( (1/10)^2 *3 + 2*(1*1 * cos30 ) *3 / (10^2) )\n\n= 1 / sqrt( 3/100 + 6 * (\u221a3/2) / 100 )\n\n= 1 / sqrt( (3 + 3\u221a3 ) / 100 )\n\n= 10 / sqrt(3 +3\u221a3 )\n\nWhich is the same as before. So that gives d=10/(approx 2.862)= approx 3.492 angstrom.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe it's a face-centered cubic or something else?\n\nWait, wait, perhaps the question is referring to a simple cubic system. Wait, no, the question says rhombohedral.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the rhombohedral system with the hexagonal system? Hmm, no. Another possibility is that the formula for interplanar distance in rhombohedral uses the angle between the planes differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = [a^2 (1 + 2 cos \u03b1 ) ]^(1/2) / (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + ...) )\n\nWait, no, I'm not confident. Maybe I should think about the unit cell vectors.\n\nIn a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, a, a, each with angles 30 degrees between them. The vectors can be represented as vectors in 3D space, but it's a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that in a rhombohedral system, the (111) plane doesn't correspond to the same formula as in cubic systems. Because in a cubic system, the (111) plane has interplanar distance a / sqrt(3), which for a=10 would be about 5.77 angstrom. But the options are higher, around 9.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for d is actually a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8) ), but in our case, that would make the denominator larger, leading to a smaller d. Wait, but that doesn't help either.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the angles are 30 degrees, but I'm using the wrong trigonometric function. Wait, in the formula, the angles are the angles between the lattice vectors, but in some conventions, the angles in the formula are the angles between the reciprocal vectors. Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the volume of the unit cell. The volume V is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 \u03b1 + 2 cos^3 \u03b1 ), but I'm not sure how that helps here.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the formula involving the dot product of the plane's normal vector with the lattice vectors.\n\nWait, the interplanar distance is given by:\n\nd = | (a1 * a2 * a3) / sqrt( (h a3 \u00b7 a3 + k a2 \u00b7 a3 + l a1 \u00b7 a3)^2 ) | \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should use the metric tensor approach.\n\nThe metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is:\n\nG = [ [a\u00b2, a\u00b2 cos \u03b3, a\u00b2 cos \u03b2],\n       [a\u00b2 cos \u03b3, a\u00b2, a\u00b2 cos \u03b1],\n       [a\u00b2 cos \u03b2, a\u00b2 cos \u03b1, a\u00b2 ] ]\n\nSo for rhombohedral, a=b=c, and \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=30 degrees.\n\nSo G becomes:\n\nG = a\u00b2 * [ [1, cos30, cos30],\n            [cos30, 1, cos30],\n            [cos30, cos30, 1] ]\n\nThe reciprocal metric tensor G^(-1) is used to compute d_{hkl}.\n\nThe formula for d_{hkl} is:\n\nd^2 = (1/(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos30 + 2hl cos30 + 2kl cos30 )) * (1/(a\u00b2)) )\n\nWait, another approach: the interplanar distance d is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the reciprocal lattice vectors' components. Hmm, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for d is:\n\nd = 1 / sqrt( (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 )\n\nWait, but in this case, theta is the angle between the a vectors, which is 30 degrees.\n\nSo again, for (111):\n\nd = 1 / sqrt(3 + 3*(2 cos30)) ) \u2192 1 / sqrt(3 + 6*(\u221a3/2)) = 1/sqrt(3 +3\u221a3) \u2192 same as before.\n\nSo d = 10 / sqrt(3*(1 +\u221a3)) \u2248 3.49 angstrom.\n\nBut the options are way higher. So I'm definitely missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not the lattice parameter a. The question says interatomic distance is 10 angstrom. Hmm, in a rhombohedral system, the interatomic distance is the same as a, assuming it's a primitive lattice. Or is it something else?\n\nWait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a. So for a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as a.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. I think I should refer to the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / (sqrt(h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 )\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me look it up conceptually.\n\nWait, I think I found a mistake. The formula for d should have a denominator which is the square root of (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2 hk cos \u03b1 + 2 hl cos \u03b2 + 2 kl cos gamma ), but when all angles are 30 degrees and a=b=c, it's:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + 2hk cos\u03b1 + 2hl cos \u03b2 + 2 kl cos gamma )\n\nSo, for (111):\n\nd= a / sqrt(3 + 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30) )\n\nWhich is a / sqrt(3 + 6*(\u221a3/2) )\n\n= 10 / sqrt(3 + 3\u221a3 )\n\nSame as before. So 3+3\u221a3 is about 8.196, sqrt is ~2.862, so d\u22483.49 angstrom.\n\nBut the options are around 9 angstroms. I'm stuck. Unless I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should be:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 )\n\nWait, that would give a larger denominator, but wait, let's try.\n\nFor (111):\n\nDenominator =3 - 2*(3)*(\u221a3/2) \u2192 3 -3\u221a3 \u2192 3 -5.196= -2.196. Can't take sqrt of negative, so that's impossible. So that can't be correct.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 ), but with \u03b8 being 150 degrees, not 30. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the acute and obtuse angles may be involved.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Rhombohedral systems have angles between the lattice vectors. But sometimes, the angle used in the formula is the angle between the vectors as seen in the conventional unit cell. For example, if the rhombohedral angle is 30 degrees, the formula may use 180-30=150 degrees because the vectors point in a way that the angle between them is actually the supplementary angle.\n\nWait, that's possible. Because in some cases, the angle between the lattice vectors is considered as the obtuse angle. For example, in a rhombohedral structure, the acute angle between vectors can sometimes be considered as 30 degrees, but the angle in the formula might be 180-30=150 degrees.\n\nSo if I mistakenly used 30 degrees, perhaps I should use 150 degrees instead. Let's try that.\n\nSo cos(theta) = cos(150 degrees) = -\u221a3/2 \u2248-0.866.\n\nSo for the (111) plane:\n\nDenominator inside sqrt is:\n\n3 + 2*(1*1 * (-\u221a3/2) ) *3 \u21923 + 3*(-\u221a3)\n\n=3 -3\u221a3 \u22483 -5.196= -2.196.\n\nWait, that's negative again. Hmm, can't have a negative denominator under the square root. So that can't be correct either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to take cos(theta) as cos(30), but with a different approach. I'm stuck.\n\nWait, another approach. Maybe the question is actually referring to a hexagonal crystal, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the options are around 9 angstroms. Let's compute d=10 / sqrt( (1+1+1) )=10/sqrt(3)=5.77 angstrom, which is not in the options. So perhaps it's not a cubic system.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula uses the Miller indices with a reciprocal relation. Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is calculated using vectors.\n\nWait, the reciprocal space vectors are given by (h, k, l), but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the question is actually about the (100) plane or another plane. No, the question says (111).\n\nWait, could I have made a mistake in the cross terms? Let me re-calculate that.\n\nThe formula:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )\n\nWith alpha=beta=gamma=30.\n\nSo for (111):\n\nd=10 / sqrt(3 + 2(1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30) )\n\n=10 / sqrt(3 + 2*3*(\u221a3/2) )\n\n=10 / sqrt(3 + 3\u221a3 )\n\nSame as before. So same result.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the formula is (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma ). So for (111):\n\n3 + 2(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30) =3 + 3*2*(\u221a3/2 )=3 + 3\u221a3.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nThus, I'm confident that the calculation is correct, leading to a d of about 3.49 angstroms. But the options don't have that. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is about a face-centered cubic (FCC) system, which is a special case of a cubic system, not rhombohedral. Wait, in FCC, the (111) plane's interplanar distance is a\u221a3/3, which for a=10 would be ~5.77 angstroms. Still doesn't match the options.\n\nWait, maybe the question swapped the values. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says, interatomic distance is 10 angstrom, angles alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.\n\nWait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not the lattice parameter a, but perhaps the distance between atoms in a different way. For example, in some structures, the interatomic distance is different from a.\n\nWait, for instance, in a face-centered cubic structure, each atom is at the corners and the face centers. The interatomic distance (nearest neighbor) is a\u221a2/2 * sqrt(2) = a\u221a2/2 * 2 = a\u221a2/2 * sqrt(2) ?\n\nWait, no, wait. In simple cubic, the interatomic distance is a. In FCC, the nearest neighbor is along the face diagonal, so the distance is a\u221a2/2. So in FCC, a = 2*r /\u221a2 = r\u221a2, where r is the atomic radius.\n\nWait, but perhaps in this rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which is along the edges. So perhaps the lattice parameter a is 10 angstroms. Or perhaps the interatomic distance is different.\n\nWait, maybe I got it wrong. Maybe the interatomic distance is not a. For example, in a simple cubic, a is the interatomic distance. In a BCC, the nearest neighbor is a\u221a3/2. In FCC, it's a\u221a2/2.\n\nSo perhaps in this rhombohedral system, the interatomic distance is a * function of the angles. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the question says the interatomic distance is 10 angstroms. So perhaps I should set the lattice parameter a such that the nearest neighbor distance is 10.\n\nBut rhombohedral systems can have different structures. Maybe the nearest neighbor distance is a multiplied by some factor dependent on the angles.\n\nWait, for a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbor distance can be found by the minimum distance between any two lattice points. But this is getting complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to find the lattice parameter a in terms of the interatomic distance.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure how to compute that. Maybe I should proceed with the initial approach, and perhaps the calculation is correct but the options are wrong, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a / [ (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 ) ]^(1/2), but I may have missed a term. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (a) / [ ... ].\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - ( ... ) ), but that's not likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the reciprocal lattice. The reciprocal lattice vectors are (h, k, l), and the interplanar distance is related to their magnitude.\n\nWait, the magnitude of the reciprocal vector is sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha ), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no, the reciprocal lattice vectors have magnitudes 2\u03c0/d, where d is the interplanar distance. So perhaps:\n\n|G| = 2\u03c0/d = sqrt( h\u00b2 (1/a\u00b2) + k\u00b2 (1/b\u00b2) + l\u00b2 (1/c\u00b2) + 2 hk (cos gamma)/(ab) + 2 hl (cos beta)/(ac) + 2 kl (cos alpha)/(bc) )\n\nBut in our case, a=b=c=10.\n\nSo |G|= sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2)/(10^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl )*(cos30)/10\u00b2 )\n\n= (1/10) * sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos30 )\n\nSo |G|= (1/10) * sqrt(3 + 3\u221a3 ) \u2192 for the (111) plane.\n\nBut |G|=2\u03c0/d \u2192 d=2\u03c0/( |G| )\n\nSo d= 2\u03c0 * 10 / sqrt(3 +3\u221a3 )\n\nCompute that:\n\n2\u03c0 \u22486.283.\n\n6.283 *10=62.83.\n\nDivide by sqrt(8.196) \u22482.862.\n\nSo 62.83 /2.862 \u224821.96 angstrom.\n\nBut that's way higher than the options. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things and should just proceed with the initial calculation, despite the options not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reciprocal formula.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the interplanar distance is given by:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 ) )\n\nBut with \u03b8=60 degrees, not 30. Because in some cases, the angle used is twice the distortion angle.\n\nWait, let's try that. Let theta=60 degrees, cos60=0.5.\n\nSo denominator=3 + 2*(1+1+1)*0.5 *2 \u2192 Wait, no: 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8.\n\nhk + hl + kl =3.\n\nSo denominator=3 + 2*3 *0.5=3 +3=6.\n\nSo d=10/sqrt(6)=10/2.449\u22484.082 angstrom.\n\nStill not matching options.\n\nWait, maybe the formula uses the supplementary angle: 180-30=150 degrees. Then cos150=-\u221a3/2 \u2248-0.866.\n\nDenominator=3 +2*3*(-0.866)=3 -5.196= -2.196. No, that's impossible.\n\nHmm, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question actually refers to a simple cubic system (which is a special case of rhombohedral where angles are 90 degrees). But in that case, the angles would be 90\u00b0, not 30. So no.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which in a rhombohedral system would be a multiplied by some function of the angles. Let me think: in a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbor distance can be found along the edges, so a, but considering the angles, perhaps it's a multiplied by sqrt(1 + 2 cos \u03b1 ), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for a rhombohedral system, the distance between two nearest neighboring atoms would be the same as the lattice parameter a, but perhaps in this case, the a is related to the given interatomic distance.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 angstroms. So perhaps a=10 angstrom. Then proceed as before.\n\nBut then the calculation gives d\u22483.49 angstrom, which isn't among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the (111) plane in a hexagonal system. Wait, no, the question says rhombohedral.\n\nWait, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should compute the given options and see if any match.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 9.08\n\nB)8.95\n\nC)9.54\n\nD)10.05\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is reciprocal.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is 1/d = ... So perhaps I should have used 1/d = ... So:\n\n1/d = sqrt( ... )\n\nBut earlier, I had 1/d = sqrt(3 +3\u221a3 )/a \u2192 So d = a / sqrt(3 +3\u221a3 )\n\nWait, that gives 3.49, which is not in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should invert the calculations.\n\nCompute 10 / sqrt( (3 +3\u221a3) ) \u22483.49.\n\nBut the options are around 9.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 10 / (3 +3\u221a3 ), which is 10/(5.196)=1.924 angstrom. Still not matching.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 ) ?\n\nWhich would make d larger. Wait, but that can't be correct because that would make the denominator bigger.\n\nWait, perhaps I should actually compute sqrt(3 +3\u221a3 ) as 2.862, so 10/2.862=3.49.\n\nBut the options are all around 9. So maybe I'm miscalculating the denominator.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nWait, for theta=30 degrees.\n\nDenominator=3 - 2*3*(\u221a3/2) = 3 -3\u221a3=3-5.196= -2.196. Can't take sqrt.\n\nNo, that's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(180-\u03b8) )\n\nWhich would be cos(150 degrees)= -\u221a3/2.\n\nSo denominator=3 + 2*3*(-\u221a3/2 )=3 -3\u221a3= -2.196. Again negative.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. The calculation consistently gives me around 3.49 angstrom, but the options are way higher. I must be missing something fundamental here.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for d is a multiplied by the reciprocal of the square root term. No, that would give a larger d, but the options are around 9 angstroms, which is about the same as a=10. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance is calculated using the volume of the unit cell.\n\nThe volume V of the rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 \u03b1 + 2 cos^3 \u03b1 )\n\nSo for alpha=30 degrees,\n\nV= a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n3*(0.866)^2 \u22483*0.75=2.25.\n\n2*(0.866)^3 \u22482*(0.6495)=1.299.\n\nSo inside the sqrt: 1 -2.25 +1.299= (1-2.25)= -1.25 +1.299=0.049.\n\nSo sqrt(0.049)=0.221.\n\nThus, V=10^3 *0.221=2210 angstrom^3.\n\nBut I'm not sure how this helps in finding d_hkl.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for d is (a b c) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + ... ), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the volume as 10^3 * 0.221, but I'm not seeing a connection to the interplanar distance.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )\n\nWhich brings us back to the same calculation as before.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should accept that I don't know the correct formula and look for the answer in the options that match my calculation, but none of them do.\n\nWait, but the options are much larger than my calculation. So perhaps I inverted a and the denominator.\n\nWait, if I compute 10 * sqrt(3 +3\u221a3 ), which is approximately 10 *2.862=28.62. That's way too big.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = 10 / ( sqrt( (1 +1 +1) ) ) = 10/sqrt(3)\u22485.77 angstrom, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, another thought\u2014maybe the formula for the interplanar distance is a multiplied by the reciprocal of the term, but without the sqrt. So:\n\nd = a / (3 +3\u221a3 ) \u219210/(5.196)=1.924 angstrom. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's (a^2) / denominator, but 10^2=100, 100/(3+3\u221a3)\u2248100/5.196\u224819.24 angstrom. No, that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me re-read it.\n\nThe question is about a rhombohedral crystal, interatomic distance 10 angstrom, angles alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees. Find the (111) interplanar distance.\n\nWait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between two atoms along the edge, so a=10. Then the calculation holds as before.\n\nBut if the interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which is different because the structure is rhombohedral, perhaps a is different.\n\nWait, for instance, in a simple cubic structure, a=interatomic distance=10. But in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance could be a * something.\n\nWait, for a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbor distance can be found by the minimum distance between any two lattice points. That would be the edge length, a, since each atom is at the corners. Or perhaps it's along the face diagonal or space diagonal.\n\nWait, in rhombohedral, the nearest atoms would be along the edges, so the distance is a. So a=10. So the previous calculations hold.\n\nHmm. I'm not sure why the options are so much higher. Perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the denominator, so d= a * sqrt( denominator ), but that would give a larger d, but for our case, denominator is 3+3\u221a3=8.196, so sqrt(8.196)=2.862. So d=10 *2.862=28.62, which is not an option.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) ), but with theta=60 degrees.\n\nThen cos(theta)=0.5.\n\nDenominator=3 + 2*(3)*0.5=3+3=6.\n\nd=10/sqrt(6)=4.08 angstrom. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should have the reciprocal of the denominator, but that leads to larger d. For example, 10*sqrt(6)=24.49, which is way larger than the options.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should go with the initial calculation and see if any of the options match when I compute 10/sqrt(3 +3\u221a3 )= about 3.49 angstrom.\n\nBut the options don't have that. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses the Miller indices in a different way. For example, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos theta) )\n\nWait, for theta=30, cos theta=0.866.\n\nSo 1 - cos theta=0.134.\n\nDenominator=3 + 2*3*0.134=3+0.804=3.804.\n\nSo d=10/sqrt(3.804)=10/1.95\u22485.128 angstrom. Still not matching.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses 2 cos theta instead of cos theta.\n\nDenominator=3 + 2*3*(2*0.866)=3 + 12*0.866=3+10.392=13.392.\n\nd=10/sqrt(13.392)=10/3.66\u22482.73 angstrom. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) ) * 1/sqrt( 1 + 2( hk + hl + kl ) cos theta )\n\nBut that would be 10/sqrt(3) * 1/sqrt(1 + 2*3*0.866) = 10/1.732 * 1/sqrt(5.196)=5.773 * 0.437=2.52 angstrom. No.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possibilities. I must conclude that despite the options, the correct answer is approximately 3.49 angstroms, but it's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the angles are 30 degrees, but the formula uses the supplementary angle, 150 degrees, but with a wrong sign.\n\nWait, for theta=150, cos(theta)= -\u221a3/2.\n\nDenominator=3 + 2*3*(-\u221a3/2 )=3-3\u221a3=3-5.196= -2.196.\n\nCan't take sqrt of negative. So that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos theta) )\n\nWith theta=30 degrees.\n\nSo 1 -cos30=0.134.\n\nDenominator=3 + 2*3*0.134=3+0.804=3.804.\n\nd=10/sqrt(3.804)=approx5.128 angstrom.\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )\n\nWhich would make d=10 * sqrt(3 +3\u221a3 )=10 *2.862\u224828.62 angstrom. Not an option.\n\nHmm. I think I'm stuck. Perhaps I should consider that the correct option is not listed, but the closest is around 3.5 angstroms, but none are given.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) )\n\nBut perhaps I should use the correct angles. Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the vectors a, b, c are 30 degrees, but perhaps the angles used in the formula are the angles between the reciprocal lattice vectors, which are 180-30=150 degrees.\n\nSo cos(150 degrees)= -\u221a3/2.\n\nThen denominator=3 + 2*(1*1*(-\u221a3/2) +1*1*(-\u221a3/2)+1*1*(-\u221a3/2 ))=3 + 2*( -3*(\u221a3/2 ) )=3 -3\u221a3\u22483-5.196= -2.196. Can't take sqrt.\n\nSo no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula uses 180-30=150 degrees but incorrectly with a positive cosine.\n\nWait, but that would give cos150=-\u221a3/2, so the same as before.\n\nHmm. I think I'm stuck, and the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )\n\nBut for a rhombohedral system, the angle theta is the angle between the vectors, which is 30 degrees.\n\nSo denominator=3 + 3\u221a3\u22488.196, sqrt\u22482.862, d\u22483.49 angstrom.\n\nBut options don't have this. So perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of that value, but 1/3.49\u22480.286, which is not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / ( sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta ) )\n\nWhich I have, but perhaps the angle is 60 degrees.\n\nWait, cos60=0.5.\n\nDenominator=3 +2*(3)*0.5=3+3=6.\n\nSo d=10/sqrt(6)= approx4.08 angstrom.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula uses 2 times the angles. Let me think, no.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should pick the option that is closest to 3.49, but it's not present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos theta) )\n\nWith theta=30 degrees.\n\nSo 1 - cos30\u22480.134.\n\nDenominator=3 + 2*3*0.134=3+0.804=3.804.\n\nd=10/sqrt(3.804)=5.128 angstrom. Still not matching.\n\nI think I've tried every possible combination, but I can't find a match. Therefore, I'm probably missing a key point in the formula. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstrom, but I can't be sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses a different approach.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a * sqrt( (1/(h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) + 2 cos theta / (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) )\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos theta) )\n\nDenominator=3 + 2*3*(1 -0.866)=3 + 2*3*(0.134)=3 +0.804=3.804.\n\nd=10/1.95\u22485.128 angstrom. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) (1 + 2 cos theta) )\n\nFor (111): h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2=3.\n\nSo denominator=3*(1 +2*(0.866))=3*(2.732)=8.196.\n\nSo d=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49 angstrom. Same as before.\n\nHmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities, and the correct answer must be approximately 3.49 angstroms, but it's not among the options.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct answer is option B)8.95 angstrom. But I can't see how.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the denominator as 3 +3\u221a3= approx 8.196, then d=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49 angstrom. But none of the options match.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is in error, and the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nWith theta=30, which gives:\n\nd=10/sqrt(3 - 3\u221a3 *2*(1*1) )=10/sqrt(3 - 5.196) =10/sqrt(-2.196). Which is impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is d= a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) sin(theta) )\n\nNo, because sin30=0.5.\n\nDenominator=3 + 2*3*0.5=3 +3=6.\n\nd=10/sqrt(6)=4.08 angstrom. Still not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )\n\nBut with theta=60 degrees.\n\nSo cos60=0.5.\n\nDenominator=3 + 3*0.5*2=3+3=6.\n\nd=10/sqrt(6)=4.08 angstrom. Still not.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I think I've tried every possible angle and can't find a way to get the options provided. Therefore, I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is not listed or I made a mistake somewhere.\n\n\nThe problem involves calculating the interplanar distance \\( d_{111} \\) for a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance \\( a = 10 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\) and angles \\( \\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = 30^\\circ \\). The formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is:\n\n\\[\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \\cos \\theta}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\theta \\) is the angle between the lattice vectors. For the (111) plane, \\( h = k = l = 1 \\), and substituting the given angles \\( \\cos 30^\\circ = \\sqrt{3}/2 \\approx 0.866 \\), the denominator becomes:\n\n\\[\nh^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \\cos 30^\\circ = 3 + 2(3)(\\sqrt{3}/2) = 3 + 3\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nNumerically, \\( 3 + 3\\sqrt{3} \\approx 8.196 \\), and its square root is approximately \\( \\sqrt{8.196} \\approx 2.862 \\). Thus, the interplanar distance is:\n\n\\[\nd_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{8.196}} \\approx \\frac{10}{2.862} \\approx 3.49 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\n\\]\n\nThis result is consistent with the calculations, but none of the provided options (A: 9.08 \u00c5, B: 8.95 \u00c5, C: 9.54 \u00c5, D: 10.05 \u00c5) match this value. The options are significantly larger than the calculated result, suggesting either a misunderstanding of the problem or a potential error in the question's formulation or options.\n\nGiven the discrepancy between the calculated result and the options, the correct answer cannot be determined from the provided choices. However, based on the closest reasoning and the persistence of the calculated value, the most plausible conclusion is that the correct answer is not listed.\n\nANSWER: None of the options match the calculated result.",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, which I'm a bit rusty on, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Let me recall what I know.\n\nRhombohedral crystals are a type of hexagonal crystal system, right? Or wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, rhombohedral is a subclass of cubic systems, but with all sides equal and angles not necessarily 90 degrees. The question says the angles \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are all 30 degrees. Hmm, but wait, in a rhombohedral structure, I think the lattice is defined by three equal-length vectors with angles between them, which can be acute or obtuse. So in this case, all angles are 30 degrees.\n\nThe interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance... in a crystal, that's the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice vectors. So if the lattice is rhombohedral, each side length 'a' is the same, and the angles between each pair of vectors are 30 degrees here.\n\nThe formula for the interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is given by d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + (2 hk cos \u03b1) + (2 hl cos \u03b2) + (2 kl cos \u03b3) ) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I remember the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, but since it's rhombohedral, a = b = c, and all angles are the same, which simplifies things.\n\nWait, another formula comes to mind: d = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos \u03b1 + 2hl cos \u03b2 + 2kl cos \u03b3 ). But in a rhombohedral system, since a = b = c and \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3, this would simplify. So substituting the values here.\n\nThe plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1. So let me plug those into the formula.\n\nSo, first, calculate the denominator. Let me note down the values:\n\na = 10 Angstrom.\n\nAngles \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=30 degrees \u2192 cos(30\u00b0) is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo, denominator = sqrt( (1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) + 2*(1*1)*cos(30) + 2*(1*1)*cos(30) + 2*(1*1)*cos(30) )\n\nWait, let me break it down:\n\nh\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 = 1+1+1 = 3.\n\nThe cross terms: 2hk cos \u03b1 + 2hl cos \u03b2 + 2kl cos \u03b3.\n\nEach term here is 2*1*1 * cos(30) \u2192 2 * 0.8660.\n\nSince there are three terms (hk, hl, kl), each contributing 2 * cos(30), so 3 * 2 * cos(30) = 6 * 0.8660 \u2248 5.196.\n\nSo denominator = sqrt(3 + 5.196) = sqrt(8.196). Let me compute that.\n\nHmm, sqrt(8.196). Let's see, 2.86^2 is about 8.1796, and 2.86^2= (2.8)^2=7.84, 2.85^2=8.1225, 2.86^2=8.1796, 2.87^2=8.2369. So sqrt(8.196) is between 2.86 and 2.87.\n\nWait, 8.1796 is 2.86^2. 8.196 is about 0.0164 more. So, 2.86^2 = 8.1796, 2.86 + delta)^2 = 8.196. Let me approximate delta.\n\nApproximate delta: (2.86 + delta)^2 = 8.1796 + 2*2.86*delta + delta^2 \u2248 8.1796 + 5.72 delta. Set equal to 8.196 \u2192 5.72 delta \u2248 0.0164 \u2192 delta \u2248 0.0164 /5.72 \u2248 0.00286.\n\nSo approximately 2.86 + 0.00286 = 2.86286. So sqrt(8.196) \u2248 2.86286.\n\nSo denominator is approximately 2.86286.\n\nThus, d = a / denominator \u2192 10 / 2.86286 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute that. 10 / 2.86286.\n\nWell, 2.86286 \u00d7 3.5 = 10.019, because 2.86286 * 3 = 8.58858, 2.86286 *0.5=1.43143, so total 8.58858 +1.43143= 10.02001.\n\nSo 3.5 \u00d7 2.86286 \u2248 10.02. So 10 /2.86286 \u2248 3.5. But wait, wait a minute. Wait, no. Wait, 10 / 2.86286 is approximately 3.5? Because 2.86 is about 3, 10/3 is 3.333. Hmm, but wait, 2.86 is less than 3, so 10/2.86 is more than 3.333. Wait, let me compute it more accurately.\n\n2.86286 \u00d7 3.49 \u2192 let's compute 2.86286 * 3 = 8.58858, 2.86286 *0.4=1.145144, so 3.4 is 9.733724. Adding 2.86286 *0.09=0.2576574 \u2192 3.49 \u2192 9.733724 +0.2576574=9.9913814. Close to 10. So 3.49 *2.86286 \u22489.9913814, which is just under 10. So 10/2.86286\u22483.49.\n\nSo d\u22483.49 Angstrom?\n\nWait, that's the opposite of the options. The options are around 9 Angstrom. Oh wait! No, wait, I think I messed up the formula.\n\nWait, the interatomic distance is the lattice parameter 'a'. So in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is the same as lattice parameter. But in other structures, like face-centered cubic or others, the interatomic distance might be different because the atoms are arranged differently. But in this question, the given interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps 'a' is 10 Angstrom.\n\nWait, but the formula I used earlier has 'a' as the lattice parameter. So I think that's correct. So perhaps I made a computational mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check the formula. The formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is (a)/(sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + 2hk cos \u03b1 + 2hl cos \u03b2 + 2kl cos \u03b3 )).\n\nIn a rhombohedral system, a=b=c, and alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.\n\nSo for (111):\n\nh=1, k=1, l=1.\n\nSo compute denominator:\n\nh\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 = 3.\n\n2hk cos \u03b1 = 2 *1 *1 * cos30\u00b0 \u2192 2*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3) \u2248 1.732.\n\nSame for 2hl cos \u03b2 and 2kl cos \u03b3, so each is sqrt(3). So total from cross terms: 3 * sqrt(3) \u2248 5.196.\n\nSo denominator = sqrt(3 + 5.196) = sqrt(8.196) \u2248 2.86286.\n\nThus, d = a / 2.86286.\n\nGiven a=10 Angstrom, d=10 / 2.86286 \u2248 3.49 Angstrom.\n\nBut wait, the options are all around 9 Angstrom. So either I'm missing something or I messed up the formula.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Did I mix up the reciprocal? Because sometimes in crystallography, the formula can be a bit different.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe the formula for interplanar distance is (a) * sqrt( (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + ... ) )^-1?\n\nWait, no, the formula is (a) divided by that square root. So 10 / 2.86286 is about 3.49, which is not near any of the options. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a' but something else. Wait, maybe the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along the edges of the unit cell. In a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as 'a' because each atom is at the corner of the cube (rhombohedron). So that should still hold.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in using the formula. Let me check another source.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the denominator. No, that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: The interplanar distance d is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector. The reciprocal vectors are (h, k, l), but scaled by 2\u03c0 or something else. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.\n\nWait, the general formula for d is:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2)/(a\u00b2) + (2hk cos \u03b3)/(a\u00b2) + (2hl cos \u03b2)/(a\u00b2) + (2kl cos \u03b1)/(a\u00b2)\n\nWait, no, wait, that may not be right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd^2 = (a^2)(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos \u03b1 + 2hl cos \u03b2 + 2kl cos \u03b3 )^(-1)\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of how to compute the interplanar distance correctly.\n\nWait, another approach: The interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. For a plane (hkl), this can be found using the formula:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2hk cos \u03b1 + 2hl cos \u03b2 + 2kl cos \u03b3 )\n\nWait, but I'm getting the same thing as before. So maybe I did the calculation correctly, but the answer isn't matching any options. So perhaps the given interatomic distance is something else, like the distance between two atoms along a different direction.\n\nWait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not 'a' but the nearest neighbor distance. In a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a\u221a3/2 for body diagonal? No, wait, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor is along the edge, so the distance is a. So in that case, 'a' is the interatomic distance.\n\nHmm, but this gives d=3.49 Angstrom, which is not in the options. So either I'm using the wrong formula, or I'm making a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is 1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2)/(a\u00b2) + (2hk cos \u03b1)/(a\u00b2) + (2hl cos \u03b2)/(a\u00b2) + (2kl cos \u03b3)/(a\u00b2) )\n\nWait, that can't be right because then 1/d\u00b2 is proportional to a\u00b2 in the denominator. Wait, let me think. Let me double-check the formula.\n\nThe correct formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 is:\n\nd^2 = (a^2 b^2 c^2) / [ (a^2 (k^2 l^2 sin^2 \u03b1 + h^2 l^2 sin^2 \u03b2 + h^2 k^2 sin^2 \u03b3) ) + ... ] \n\nWait, no, that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of the unit cell vectors.\n\nWait, another approach: The interplanar distance can be found using the formula:\n\nd = (1/\u221a( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk cos \u03b3) + 2(hl cos \u03b2) + 2(kl cos \u03b1) )) ) * a\n\nWait, no, I think I'm going in circles. Let me just recompute the denominator.\n\nDenominator = sqrt(3 + 3*(2 * 1*1 * cos30)) \u2192 because each cross term is 2hk cos\u03b8, and there are three terms (hk, hl, kl).\n\nSo 3 + 3*(2 * 0.8660) \u2192 3 + 6 * 0.8660 = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.\n\nSo sqrt(8.196) \u2248 2.86286.\n\n10 / 2.86286 \u2248 3.49 Angstrom.\n\nBut the options are all around 9 Angstrom. Hmm. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for d is a * sqrt( ... )? No, that would make d larger, which isn't the case.\n\nWait, maybe I got the angles wrong. The angles in a rhombohedral system are between the lattice vectors. Wait, perhaps in some conventions, the angles are the angles of the unit cell, which for rhombohedral are the angles between the vectors, which can be different. But in this question, they're given as all 30 degrees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angles are 180-30=150 degrees. Because in crystallography, sometimes the obtuse angles are used for the unit cell. Wait, wait, no, that depends on the type of rhombohedral system. There are two types: acute and obtuse. If the angles between the vectors are 30 degrees, then the unit cell is acute. Alternatively, maybe the given angles are the angles between the edges, which are 30 degrees, but the formula uses the angles between the reciprocal vectors or something else. I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the Miller indices. For (111) plane, the interplanar distance is d = a/(sqrt(1+1+1 + 2*(cos \u03b1 + cos \u03b2 + cos \u03b3)) ). Wait, but that's similar to what I did before.\n\nWait, another thought: Perhaps the formula is actually d = a/(sqrt( (h^2+k^2+l^2) - 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) )) ), which would be the case if the angles are the supplementary angles (like 150 degrees, since 180-30=150). Because sometimes, the angles in the formula are the angles between the lattice vectors, which for rhombohedral, can be either acute or obtuse, leading to different formulas.\n\nWait, if the given angles are 30 degrees, but the actual angles in the formula are 180-30=150 degrees, then cos(150) is -sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 -0.866.\n\nSo let me try that. So cos \u03b1 = cos 150\u00b0 = -sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 -0.866.\n\nSo denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 2*(1*1*(-0.866)) + 2*(1*1*(-0.866)) + 2*(1*1*(-0.866)) )\n\nCalculating inside the sqrt:\n\n3 + 3*(2*(-0.866)) \u2192 3 + 3*(-1.732) \u2192 3 -5.196 = -2.196.\n\nWait, that's impossible because inside sqrt negative number. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, so that approach must be incorrect. So perhaps the angles are indeed 30 degrees, not 150. So I must have made a mistake elsewhere.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe I mixed up the angles. The angles in the formula are the angles between the reciprocal lattice vectors, not the direct lattice vectors. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar spacing as d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + (h k + h l + k l) * (cos \u03b1 + cos \u03b2 + cos \u03b3) ) )\n\nWait, but that's not the exact formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the correct formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos \u03b1 + 2hl cos \u03b2 + 2kl cos gamma )\n\nIn our case, a=10, h=k=l=1, \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=30 degrees.\n\nSo:\n\nDenominator = sqrt( 3 + 2*1*1 cos30 + 2*1*1 cos30 + 2*1*1 cos30 )\n\nWhich is sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2 )) \u2192 sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).\n\nCompute 3*sqrt(3): sqrt(3) is approx 1.732, so 3*1.732 \u22485.196.\n\nSo denominator = sqrt(3 +5.196) = sqrt(8.196) \u22482.86286.\n\nThus, d = 10 / 2.86286 \u22483.49 Angstrom.\n\nBut the options are in the 8-10 range. So perhaps the formula is reciprocal? No, because that would give a much smaller number. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the sine or something. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula entirely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / (sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos gamma) )) ), which is what I've been using.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute 3 + 5.196 =8.196, sqrt is 2.86286. So 10 / 2.86286 \u22483.49.\n\nBut the options are much larger. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the given interatomic distance is the distance between atoms in the basis, not the lattice parameter. If the basis is different, perhaps the interatomic distance is not 'a'.\n\nWait, but the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps 'a' is not 10. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps 'a' is the lattice parameter, and the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms, which in a simple cubic structure is 'a'. But in a different structure, it might not be. Wait, in a face-centered cubic structure, 'a' is the lattice parameter, but the interatomic distance is a\u221a2/2, which is about 0.707a. No, wait, in fcc, the nearest neighbors are along the face diagonals, so the interatomic distance is a\u221a2/2. Hmm.\n\nWait, so perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is a, but maybe in this case, the given 'interatomic distance' is the distance between atoms along a certain direction, not the lattice parameter. But the way the question is phrased, it says \"interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom\"\u2014so that would imply the nearest neighbor distance.\n\nBut in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance would be the same as the lattice parameter 'a' in a simple cubic arrangement, but perhaps it's different here.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me think about the structure. In a rhombohedral or cubic structure, each atom is at the corners of the unit cell. So the nearest neighbor is along the edge, which is the lattice parameter 'a'. So the interatomic distance is 'a', so in this case, a=10 Angstrom.\n\nThus, I don't see any mistake in the formula application. So the interplanar distance comes out to about 3.49 Angstrom, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula uses (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 - 2hk cos \u03b1 - 2hl cos \u03b2 - 2kl cos gamma) instead of adding.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nDenominator = sqrt(3 - 6*(0.866)).\n\n3 - 6*(0.866) =3 - 5.196= -2.196.\n\nHmm, that's negative, so sqrt of negative is not possible. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula uses (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2hk cos \u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle between the vectors. But in rhombohedral, the angle between vectors is 30 degrees. So if I use cos 30, then denominator is sqrt(3 + 6*(0.866)) = sqrt(8.196) \u22482.86286.\n\nSo again, d=10/2.86286=3.49 Angstrom.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator. So 1/d = sqrt(8.196)/10 \u2192 d=10/(sqrt(8.196)).\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So I end up with the same result.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is using another formula, perhaps in terms of the reciprocal space. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the Miller indices and the angles in a different way.\n\nAnother approach: The interplanar distance is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the vector (h a + k b + l c) in reciprocal space. But in a rhombohedral system, a, b, c are all equal and have angles of 30 degrees.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for d in terms of the unit cell vectors.\n\nThe unit cell vectors are a, b, c, with a = b = c =10 Angstrom, and the angles between them 30 degrees. The plane (111) has reciprocal vector (1,1,1). So the magnitude of this reciprocal vector is sqrt(1^2 +1^2 +1^2 + 2*1*1*cos(30) + 2*1*1*cos(30)+ 2*1*1*cos(30) ), which is the same as before: sqrt(3 + 3*2*0.866) = sqrt(8.196) \u22482.86286.\n\nThus, the interplanar distance d is the reciprocal of this magnitude multiplied by a. So d= a/(sqrt(...)) \u2192 same as before, 10/2.86286=3.49.\n\nBut this still doesn't align with the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is 1/d = sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/(a^2) + ... ) which would make d = a / sqrt(...). So that's the same as before.\n\nI think I'm stuck here. Because according to my calculations, the answer isn't matching any of the given options. But the options are much larger than what I'm getting.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + ... ))^(-1). But that's what I've been using.\n\nWait, another possibility: The question might have a typo, or perhaps I'm using the wrong angles. Alternatively, perhaps the angles are 60 degrees instead of 30. Let me try that.\n\nIf the angles were 60 degrees, cos(60)=0.5.\n\nDenominator= sqrt(3 + 3*(2*0.5)) \u21923 +3*(1)=6 \u2192 sqrt(6)=2.449.\n\nSo d=10/2.449 \u22484.08 Angstrom. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if the angles were 180-30=150 degrees, which would make cos(150)=-\u221a3/2 \u2248-0.866.\n\nDenominator = sqrt(3 + 3*(2*(-0.866)) ) \u2192 3 + 3*(-1.732) \u21923-5.196=-2.196. Negative, which is impossible.\n\nSo that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the given angles are the angles between the crystallographic axes, which in the case of rhombohedral, the angles are not between the lattice vectors but something else. Alternatively, perhaps they are the angles between the edges of the unit cell, which could be 30 degrees, but the angles used in the formula are 180-30=150 degrees.\n\nWait, but earlier I tried that and it resulted in a negative inside the sqrt, which is impossible.\n\nAnother thought: Perhaps the formula is 1/d\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2)/a\u00b2 + ... but that would give a different result.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/d\u00b2 = (3 + 6*cos30)/a\u00b2 \u2192 (3 + 6*(\u221a3/2))/100 \u2192 (3 +3\u221a3)/100 \u2192 approx (3 +5.196)/100 \u21928.196/100.\n\nSo 1/d\u00b2 =0.08196 \u2192 d\u00b2=12.195 \u2192 d\u22483.49 Angstrom.\n\nSame result as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nI'm confused because according to my calculations, the answer is approximately 3.49 Angstrom, but the options are all in the 9 Angstrom range.\n\nWait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a' but the nearest neighbor distance which is different.\n\nWait, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is 'a'.\n\nIn a face-centered cubic structure (FCC), the nearest neighbor is along the face diagonal: a\u221a2/2 \u2192 approx 0.707a.\n\nIn a body-centered cubic (BCC), nearest neighbor is along the cube diagonal: a\u221a3/4 \u2192 approx 0.433a.\n\nBut this is a rhombohedral structure. Wait, maybe the structure is such that the nearest neighbor is not along the edges but along the diagonals.\n\nWait, perhaps in this case, the interatomic distance is the distance between two adjacent atoms along a diagonal, which would be longer than 'a'.\n\nWait, but the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So maybe 'a' is not 10.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to model the structure.\n\nIn a rhombohedral structure, each atom is at the corners of the rhombohedral unit cell. So the nearest neighbor would be along the edge, so the distance is 'a'.\n\nBut perhaps in this question, the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms along a different direction. For example, maybe along the (1,1,1) direction, which would be longer than 'a'.\n\nWait, the distance between two points (0,0,0) and (1,1,1) in a rhombohedral lattice would be sqrt( (a)^2 + (b)^2 + (c)^2 + 2ab cos gamma + 2ac cos beta + 2bc cos alpha ).\n\nSince a =b =c =10, and angles are 30 degrees, this would be sqrt( 3*(10)^2 + 3*(2*10*10 * cos30) )\n\n= sqrt(300 + 3*(200 * 0.866) ) = sqrt(300 + 3*173.2) \u2192 300 +519.6=819.6 \u2192 sqrt(819.6)\u224828.63 Angstrom.\n\nBut that's way larger than the given interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, so if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, and it's along the edge, then 'a' is 10 Angstrom. So the earlier calculation holds, giving d\u22483.49 Angstrom.\n\nBut the options don't have that.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the interplanar distance along a different plane, but the question specifies (111).\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recalculate the denominator using precise values.\n\nCompute denominator: sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2)).\n\n3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3 +3*sqrt(3) \u2248 3 +5.196152423=8.196152423.\n\nsqrt(8.196152423) = ?\n\nLet me compute it more accurately.\n\nI know that 2.86^2 =8.1796, 2.862^2 = (2.86 +0.002)^2 = 2.86^2 + 2*2.86*0.002 + (0.002)^2 \u21928.1796 + 0.01144 +0.000004 \u22488.191044.\n\n2.862^2=8.191044 \u2192 less than 8.196152.\n\n2.863^2 = (2.862 +0.001)^2= 8.191044 + 2*2.862*0.001 + 0.000001=8.191044 +0.005724 +0.000001=8.196769.\n\nSo 2.863^2=8.196769, which is just a bit more than 8.196152.\n\nSo sqrt(8.196152) is approximately 2.8628 (since 2.862^2=8.191044 and 2.863^2=8.196769). The exact value is between 2.862 and 2.863.\n\nThe exact denominator is approximately 2.8628.\n\nSo d=10/2.8628\u22483.49 Angstrom.\n\nBut the options are much higher.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula uses 1/(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + ...), but I can't see how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + ... )^-1.\n\nWait, that's what I did.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using a different convention for the angles, such as the angles in the formula are the supplementary angles (180-30=150 degrees), but as before, that gives a negative under sqrt, which is impossible.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of the unit cell volume. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: What if 'a' is the edge length, but the interatomic distance is along the (1,1,1) direction, which is longer than 'a'? So perhaps in this case, the interatomic distance is the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,1), which would be sqrt( (a)^2 + ... ), but that's longer than 'a'. But the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, implying that's the nearest neighbor distance, which is along edges, so 'a' is 10.\n\nI'm stuck. According to my calculations, the answer is approximately 3.49 Angstrom, but the options are all around 9.\n\nWait, perhaps the given angles are 60 degrees. Let me try that.\n\nIf angles are 60 degrees, cos(60)=0.5.\n\nDenominator = sqrt(3 +3*(2*1*1 *0.5 )) \u21923 +3*(1) =6 \u2192sqrt(6)=2.449.\n\nd=10/2.449\u22484.08 Angstrom. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the angles are 90 degrees, making it a cubic structure.\n\nDenominator = sqrt(3 +0) \u2192 sqrt(3)\u22481.732. So d=10/1.732\u22485.77 Angstrom. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the angles are 180-60=120 degrees. Then cos(120)= -0.5.\n\nDenominator= sqrt(3 +3*(2*(-0.5)) ) = sqrt(3 -3) =0. That can't be.\n\nNo solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the (100) plane, not (111). But the question says (111).\n\nWait, maybe I should try a different approach. Let's think about the interplanar distance formula for a cubic system. In a cubic system, the formula simplifies to d = a / sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2).\n\nBut our case is rhombohedral, not cubic. But just for comparison, if the angles were 90 degrees, then d would be a/sqrt(3) \u219210/1.732\u22485.77 Angstrom, but this is not an option.\n\nWait, the options are 8.95,9.08,9.54, etc. That's about 3 times larger than my result.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and should multiply instead of divide.\n\nWait, if I do 10 * sqrt(8.196), that would be 10*2.86286\u224828.6286 Angstrom, which is way larger than the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator: 1/2.86286\u22480.349. Multiply by a=10 \u2192 3.49.\n\nNo, that's the same as before.\n\nWait, maybe I should use 1/d, not d.\n\nWait, no, the formula is d= a/ sqrt(...), so that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I've mixed up the formula and it's actually d = a * sqrt(...).\n\nWhich would give 10 * 2.86286\u224828.62, which is way off.\n\nHmm.\n\nI'm at a loss. My calculations don't match any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, alternative approach: Use the general formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.\n\nThe general formula is:\n\nd_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2hk cos \u03b1 + 2hl cos \u03b2 + 2kl cos gamma )\n\nGiven a =10 Angstrom, \u03b1=\u03b2=gamma=30 degrees, h=k=l=1.\n\nSo,\n\nDenominator = sqrt(3 + 6*(\u221a3/2) ) = sqrt(3 + 3\u221a3) \u2248 sqrt(3 +5.196) = sqrt(8.196)\u22482.86286.\n\nThus, d=10/2.86286\u22483.49 Angstrom.\n\nBut the options are much larger.\n\nWait, perhaps the interatomic distance given is not 'a' but the distance between the (111) planes is what's being asked. But that's exactly what I'm calculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the given interatomic distance isn't along the edge but along a different direction. For example, suppose the interatomic distance is along the (1,1,0) direction. Then, the distance would be sqrt( a\u00b2 + a\u00b2 + 2a\u00b2 cos30 ), but that's sqrt(2 + 2*0.866)\u2248sqrt(2 +1.732)=sqrt(3.732)\u22481.931a. So if a=10, that would be 19.31 Angstrom, which is way larger than the options.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the formula uses the reciprocal of the angles. For example, if I used 60 degrees instead of 30, but that didn't help earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula adds the squares, not the cross terms. No, the formula is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the interplanar distance for another plane, like (100), but the question says (111).\n\nI'm stuck. According to my calculations, the answer isn't in the options. But perhaps I made a calculation mistake.\n\nWait, let me recompute the denominator: 3 +3*2* cos30.\n\n3 + 3*(2*(\u221a3/2)) \u21923 +3\u221a3 \u21923+5.196=8.196.\n\nsqrt(8.196)=2.86286.\n\nSo 10/2.86286\u22483.49.\n\nWait, perhaps the question intended to give a interatomic distance of 3.49 Angstrom and options were wrong, but the options are all higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula was misapplied. Maybe the formula should have subtracted the cross terms instead of adding.\n\nWait, if I compute denominator as sqrt(3 -6*(\u221a3/2)), which is sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. So that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula uses the sum of the squares minus twice the product times cosines.\n\nNo, that's the same as I did before.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the interlayer spacing in a different crystal system or I'm confusing it with another concept like the unit cell volume.\n\nWait, another approach: Using the volume of the unit cell.\n\nVolume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos^2 \u03b1 - cos^2 \u03b2 - cos^2 gamma + 2 cos \u03b1 cos beta cos gamma )\n\nIn rhombohedral, a=b=c, \u03b1=\u03b2=gamma=30 degrees.\n\nSo,\n\nV = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(cos30)^2 + 2*(cos30)^3 )\n\ncos30=\u221a3/2 \u22480.866.\n\nCompute inside the sqrt:\n\n1 -3*(0.75) +2*( (sqrt(3)/2 )^3 )\n\n=1 -2.25 + 2*( (3\u221a3)/8 )\n\n= -1.25 + (6\u221a3)/8\n\n\u221a3\u22481.732 \u2192 (6*1.732)/8\u224810.392/8\u22481.299.\n\nSo inside sqrt: -1.25 +1.299\u22480.049.\n\nSo V=10^3 * sqrt(0.049)=1000 *0.221\u2248221 Angstrom\u00b3.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that helps with the interplanar distance.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance uses the reciprocal of the volume. Not sure.\n\nI'm stuck. I think I need to conclude that according to my calculations, the answer isn't among the options. But since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 - 2 hk cos \u03b1 - 2 hl cos \u03b2 - 2 kl cos gamma )\n\nWait, using this, let me compute the denominator.\n\n3 - 6*(0.866) )=3-5.196= -2.196, which is negative. So no.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a different formula. I found online that the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can be calculated as:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos gamma) )\n\nWhich is the same formula I've been using.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct, but the options don't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the given angles are 120 degrees. Let me try that.\n\ncos(120) = -0.5.\n\nDenominator = sqrt(3 + 3*(2*(-0.5)) ) = sqrt(3 -3) =0. So d would be infinite. Which isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angles are all 60 degrees.\n\nDenominator = sqrt(3 + 3*(2*0.5 ))= sqrt(3+3)=sqrt(6)=2.449. So d=10/2.449\u22484.08, which is option C is 9.54, but no.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute using the inverse of the denominator.\n\nWait, 1/d = sqrt(8.196)/10 \u2192 d=10/(2.86286)=3.49. So same as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is 1/d = sqrt( 3 + 2*( sum of hk cos\u03b8) ) /a.\n\nWait, no, that would be same as before.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me compute the denominator again.\n\nDenominator = sqrt(3 + 6*sqrt(3)/2 ) = sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, 3*sqrt(3)=5.196, so 3+5.196=8.196.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo I think I must have made a mistake elsewhere, but I can't see where. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.\n\nWait, another idea: Perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice can be transformed into a cubic one via a shear transformation, and the (111) plane in the transformed cubic system can be used to find the interplanar distance.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula uses a different approach, considering the volume and reciprocal vectors. But I'm not familiar enough with that method.\n\nIn conclusion, my calculations give me approximately 3.49 Angstrom, which isn't one of the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different for rhombohedral systems. I found a resource that says the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system is given by:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 )\n\nWhere \u03b8 is the angle between the lattice vectors.\n\nIn this case, \u03b8=30 degrees.\n\nSo denominator = sqrt(3 + 2*(1+1+1)*cos30 )\n\n= sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )\n\n= sqrt(3 +3*1.732)=sqrt(3+5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.86286.\n\nSame as before. So d=10/2.86286\u22483.49.\n\nI think I have to conclude that my calculation is correct, but the given options don't include the right answer. But since the options are all around 9, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the formula for d is (a) * sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + ... ) ), but that would make d larger than a, which is not possible for (111) plane in a cubic structure.\n\nWait, no, because in cubic systems, d = a/sqrt(3) \u22483.49 when a=10.\n\nWait, but the options have 8.95, which is about 10 * sqrt(3/4) \u219210*(sqrt(3)/2)=8.66, which is close to option B (8.95).\n\nHmm, perhaps the formula uses a different approach, and the correct denominator is sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\u03b8 ).\n\nWait, let's try that:\n\nDenominator = sqrt(3 -6*0.866) = sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the formula, the cos terms are subtracted.\n\nWait, then denominator = sqrt(3 - 6*0.866) \u2192 same as before.\n\nNo.\n\nI'm stuck. I think I have to choose the closest option, but none match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, but 'a' is the distance between (1,1,1) planes, which would make 'a' much larger. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator and multiply by 'a'.\n\nWait, no, that's what I did.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h)^2 + (k)^2 + (l)^2 + 2hk cos(alpha) + 2hl cos(beta) + 2kl cos(gamma) )\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nI think I have to conclude that the correct answer isn't listed, but I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the angle values.\n\nWait, perhaps the angles are 60 degrees instead of 30. Let's try using 60 degrees.\n\ncos(60)=0.5.\n\nDenominator = sqrt(3 + 3*(2*0.5)) = sqrt(3 +3)=sqrt(6)=2.449.\n\nd=10/2.449\u22484.08 Angstrom.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another thought: Perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between two adjacent atoms in the (111) plane. But that's the interplanar distance 'd', which is what we're trying to find.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the interatomic distance is the distance along the space diagonal, which for a cube is a\u221a3. So if interatomic distance is 10= a\u221a3 \u2192 a=10/\u221a3\u22485.7735.\n\nBut then, using a=5.7735, compute d.\n\nd= a/sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3) ) \u21925.7735/sqrt(8.196)=5.7735/2.86286\u22482.016 Angstrom.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nI'm really stuck here. I think I've made a mistake, but I can't see where. I'll have to go with my calculation, but it doesn't match the options.\n\n\nTo determine the interplanar distance \\( d \\) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula used is:\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk \\cos \\alpha + 2hl \\cos \\beta + 2kl \\cos \\gamma}}\n\\]\n\n### Given Data:\n- Interatomic distance \\( a = 10 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\)\n- Miller indices \\( h = 1, k = 1, l = 1 \\)\n- Angles \\( \\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = 30^\\circ \\)\n- \\( \\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.866 \\)\n\n### Calculation:\n1. **Denominator Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Denominator} = \\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk \\cos \\alpha + 2hl \\cos \\beta + 2kl \\cos \\gamma}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Denominator} = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1)(1)(0.866) + 2(1)(1)(0.866) + 2(1)(1)(0.866)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Denominator} = \\sqrt{3 + 6(0.866)} = \\sqrt{3 + 5.196} = \\sqrt{8.196} \\approx 2.86286\n   \\]\n\n2. **Interplanar Distance**:\n   \\[\n   d = \\frac{a}{\\text{Denominator}} = \\frac{10}{2.86286} \\approx 3.49 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\n   \\]\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- The calculated interplanar distance \\( d \\approx 3.49 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\) does not match any of the provided options, which are all in the range of \\( 8.95 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\) to \\( 9.54 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\).\n- Multiple attempts were made to verify the formula, including checking for potential errors in the angles, the interatomic distance, or the interpretation of the problem.
