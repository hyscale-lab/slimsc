      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember from my studies that mesons are subatomic particles, and a resonance in this context probably refers to a particle that doesn't exist long enough to be observed directly\u2014it quickly decays into other particles.\n\nThe question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. They gave me some data: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width \u0393_X is 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, so I need to calculate which one is correct.\n\nWait, how do I approach this? I think decay distance has to do with how far the particle travels before decaying. I remember that the mean lifetime is related to the particle's width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The width \u0393 is related to the lifetime \u03c4 by the equation \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4. So \u03c4 is \u0127 divided by \u0393.\n\nBut wait, units are important here. Let me think. \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Oh wait, yeah, I remember that value because it's commonly used in particle physics for these kinds of calculations.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But \u0393 is given in MeV, and \u0127 is in GeV\u00b7s. I'll need to convert \u0393 to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So \u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\nNow, plugging into the formula:\n\u03c4 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s.\nLet me calculate that. 6.582 divided by 0.32... 6.582 / 0.32 \u2248 20.56875. So \u03c4 \u2248 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, no, the exponents: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25, which is about 20.56875e-25 s. Wait, that's 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, no, 20.56875e-25 is 2.056875e-24? Wait, 1e-25 multiplied by 20 is 2e-24. Wait, no, 20e-25 is 2e-24. So yeah, 2.056875e-24 seconds is the mean lifetime.\n\nBut wait, the mean decay distance is the velocity multiplied by the lifetime. Because the particle is moving, right? So distance L = v * \u03c4. But what's the velocity? The particle's energy E is given as 8 GeV, and its mass is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. So I can find the velocity using the relativistic energy formula.\n\nRelativistic energy E = gamma * m c\u00b2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So gamma = E/(m c\u00b2). But since E and m are both in GeV and GeV/c\u00b2, respectively, the c\u00b2 is already accounted for, so gamma = E/m. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nGamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2), where beta is v/c. So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). Let me compute that.\n\nGamma is about 6.6667, so gamma squared is 44.4444. 1/gamma squared is about 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So beta \u2248 0.9887. So v = 0.9887 c.\n\nBut wait, c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 meters per second. So v \u2248 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s \u2248 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nNow, the mean lifetime \u03c4 is 2.056875e-24 seconds, and velocity is 2.966e8 m/s. So the decay distance L = v * \u03c4 \u2248 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nCalculating that: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = Let's compute 2.966 * 2.056875 \u2248 6.104. Then exponents: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16. So L \u2248 6.104e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, none of them are exactly 6.1e-16. The options are A:5.0223e-16, D:4.0655e-16. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, gamma: E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. So gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.6666667. Correct.\n\nBeta calculation: gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2). So 1/(gamma\u00b2) = 1 - beta\u00b2. So beta squared is 1 - 1/(gamma\u00b2) = 1 - (1/(44.4444)) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. That seems right. So v \u2248 0.9887c.\n\nWait, but when I calculate beta more accurately, perhaps I should compute sqrt(0.9775) more precisely. Let me see, 0.9887 squared is about 0.9775, yes.\n\nWait, let's compute beta more accurately. Let's use a calculator approach. Let's say 0.9887^2 = (approx) 0.9887 * 0.9887. Let me compute:\n\n0.9887 * 0.9887:\n= (0.98 * 0.98) + (0.0087 * 0.98)*2 + (0.0087)^2\nWait, maybe a better way. 0.9887 is close to 0.99. 0.99^2 is 0.9801. So 0.9887 is a bit less, so 0.9887^2 is roughly 0.9775, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo v is about 0.9887c.\n\nNow, let's recalculate L:\n\nL = v * \u03c4 = 0.9887c * \u03c4.\n\nWait, but earlier I multiplied v by \u03c4 directly. Alternatively, perhaps I should write L = (beta c) * \u03c4.\n\nWhich is the same as beta c tau.\n\nSo, tau is 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s = approx 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo L = beta c tau.\n\nBeta is 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo:\n\nbeta * c * tau = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nLet me compute the numbers step by step.\n\nFirst, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.170625 * 1e-16.\n\nThen multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625 * 0.9887 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n6.170625 * 0.9887:\n\n= (6 * 0.9887) + (0.170625 * 0.9887)\n= 5.9322 + 0.1687 \u2248 6.1009.\n\nSo 6.1009e-16 meters. So approximately 6.10e-16 m.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me recheck the calculations for tau.\n\nTau is \u0127 / \u0393. \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV s.\n\nGamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the natural units where \u0127 c is involved in the decay length formula? Or perhaps I should use another approach.\n\nWait, another formula I've heard of is that the decay length L is given by c * tau * beta gamma, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Wait, beta gamma is (v/c) * gamma, which is gamma beta.\n\nWait, beta gamma is the rapidity factor, which is also (from gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2)), gamma beta = sqrt(gamma^2 - 1).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is L = c tau beta gamma.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The mean lifetime is tau, but the particle is moving at a velocity v, so the distance it travels is v tau. So L = v tau. Since v = beta c, that's L = beta c tau.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated that as about 6e-16 m, but none of the options match that.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation steps. Let me recompute.\n\nCompute beta gamma. Since gamma is 6.6667, and beta is 0.9887, beta gamma is 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.60. So beta gamma \u22486.6.\n\nSo L = c * tau * beta gamma.\n\nWait, but then:\n\nc = 3e8 m/s,\n\ntau = 2.056875e-24 s,\n\nbeta gamma \u22486.6.\n\nSo L = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s * 6.6.\n\nWait, but that would be 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 *6.6.\n\nLet me compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 *2.056875) * 1e8 *1e-24 = 6.170625e-16.\n\nMultiply by 6.6: 6.170625e-16 *6.6 \u2248 40.81e-16 m, which is 4.081e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. So which is correct? Hmm.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let's get back to the basics.\n\nThe mean decay length is L = v * tau, but tau is the proper lifetime. If the particle is moving at speed v, then the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by tau. So the lifetime observed is gamma tau. So the decay length becomes v * gamma tau.\n\nWait, no. Because tau is the proper time, the time in the particle's rest frame. When observed in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma. So the time t = gamma tau. So the distance is v * t = v gamma tau.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier approach. So L = v * gamma tau.\n\nWait, let's re-examine.\n\nIn the rest frame of the particle, the lifetime is tau. In the lab frame, moving with velocity v, the lifetime is longer by gamma: t = gamma tau.\n\nSo during this time, the particle moves a distance L = v * t = v gamma tau.\n\nBut v is beta c. So L = beta c gamma tau.\n\nAlternatively, L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nSo that's the correct formula.\n\nEarlier, I used L = beta c tau, which is incorrect. I should have included gamma.\n\nSo with that in mind, let's recalculate.\n\nWe have:\n\nbeta = 0.9887,\n\ngamma = 6.6667,\n\nc =3e8 m/s,\n\ntau = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo L = beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nCompute beta * gamma: 0.9887 * 6.6667 \u2248 6.60.\n\nSo L \u22486.6 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16.\n\nMultiply by 6.6: 6.170625e-16 * 6.6 \u224840.81e-16 m \u2192 4.081e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15 m and option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So 4.08e-15 is close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15.\n\nHmm, but let me do this more accurately.\n\nCompute beta * gamma:\n\ngamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))) = sqrt(1 - (1/( (8/1.2)^2 )) )\n\nWait, 8/1.2 is 6.6666667, squared is (6.6666667)^2 = approx 44.444444.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(1 - 1/44.444444) = sqrt(43.444444 /44.444444) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo beta=0.9887, gamma=6.6666667.\n\nBeta*gamma=0.9887 *6.6666667 \u2248 Let me compute this accurately.\n\n6.6666667 * 0.9887 = ?\n\n6 * 0.9887=5.9322,\n\n0.6666667 *0.9887\u2248 0.6666667 *0.9887 \u2248 0.6588.\n\nSo total is about 5.9322 + 0.6588 = 6.591. So beta*gamma\u22486.591.\n\nSo L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nc =3e8 m/s,\n\ntau=6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 6.582 /0.32 = 20.56875e-25 s \u2192 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo L=6.591 *3e8 *2.056875e-24.\n\nLet me compute 3e8 *2.056875e-24 = (3 *2.056875) * 1e8 *1e-24 =6.170625 *1e-16.\n\nThen multiply by 6.591:\n\n6.170625e-16 *6.591 \u2248 Let me compute 6.170625 *6.591.\n\n6 *6.591=39.546,\n\n0.170625 *6.591\u2248 approx 1.120. So total \u224840.666.\n\nSo 40.666e-16 m is 4.0666e-15 m. Hmm, which is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but let me see if I can get more precise numbers.\n\nLet me calculate beta * gamma exactly.\n\ngamma =8/1.2= 20/3\u22486.6666666667.\n\nbeta= sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))) = sqrt(1 - (9/400)) since gamma^2=(20/3)^2=400/9.\n\nSo 1/(gamma^2) =9/400=0.0225.\n\nSo 1-0.0225=0.9775.\n\nSo sqrt(0.9775) = let me compute more accurately.\n\nWhat is sqrt(0.9775)?\n\nApproximating, since 0.9887^2=0.9775.\n\nSo beta=0.9887.\n\nCompute beta * gamma:\n\n0.9887 * (20/3) = (0.9887 *20)/3 = 19.774 /3 \u22486.591333333.\n\nSo beta gamma \u22486.591333333.\n\nNow, L = beta gamma * c * tau.\n\nWe have c=3e8 m/s, tau= (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) =20.56875e-25 s=2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo L=6.591333333 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nCompute 3e8 *2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen multiply by 6.591333333:\n\n6.170625e-16 *6.591333333 = ?\n\n6.170625 *6.591333333 \u2192 let's compute this.\n\n6 *6.591333333=39.548.\n\n0.170625 *6.591333333= let's compute:\n\n0.1 *6.591333333 =0.6591333333.\n\n0.07 *6.591333333=0.4613933333.\n\n0.000625 *6.591333333= approx 0.00411958333.\n\nAdd them up: 0.659133 +0.461393=1.120526 +0.004119=1.124645.\n\nSo total is 39.548 +1.124645=40.672645.\n\nSo 40.672645e-16 m =4.0672645e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So our calculation is 4.0673e-15, which is very close to option B. The slight discrepancy could be due to using more precise values for beta and gamma.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B: 4.0655 * 10^-15 m.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we use the formula for the decay length:\n\n\\[\nL = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\beta = \\frac{v}{c} \\) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,\n- \\( \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m} \\) is the Lorentz factor,\n- \\( c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\) is the speed of light,\n- \\( \\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} \\) is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate \\( \\tau \\)\nThe mean proper lifetime \\( \\tau \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\hbar = 6.582 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{GeV\u00b7s} \\) and \\( \\Gamma = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.32 \\, \\text{GeV} \\).

Hmm, I remember that when a particle decays, the mean lifetime is related to its width, and then the decay distance depends on its velocity or something like that. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nThe question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width \u0393_X as 320 MeV. Wait, I need to find the mean decay distance, right?\n\nI think the mean lifetime \u03c4 is given by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Oh right, \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393. Because the width \u0393 is related to the particle's lifetime. Since \u0393 is the total decay width, which is the inverse of the lifetime. So \u03c4 is \u0127 divided by \u0393.\n\nWait, but units! I have to make sure the units are correct. Let me recall the values. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, but \u0127 is h/(2\u03c0), so \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. Oh, but in particle physics, they often use GeV units, so maybe it's better to convert \u0127 into GeV\u00b7seconds or something.\n\nWait, I remember that \u0127c is a useful constant here, where c is the speed of light. The value of \u0127c in GeV\u00b7fm (femtometers) is about 197.3 MeV\u00b7fm. Wait, let me check that. Oh, right, \u0127c \u2248 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm. So maybe I can use that.\n\nBut wait, the mean lifetime \u03c4 is \u0127/\u0393. Let me write that. \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. \u0393 is given in MeV, so I'll have to make sure the units are consistent.\n\nSo, let's compute \u03c4 first. \u0393 is 320 MeV. So, substituting, \u03c4 = \u0127 / 320 MeV. But \u0127 in units of MeV\u00b7s? Wait, no, because \u0127 = 6.582\u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Wait, no, maybe I should better convert everything into compatible units.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the lifetime in seconds. Let me think:\n\n\u0393_X is 320 MeV. Since 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So, \u0393 = 0.32 GeV.\n\nNow, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. \u0127 is approximately 6.582\u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So \u03c4 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s.\n\nLet me calculate that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. So \u03c4 \u2248 2.057e-24 seconds.\n\nBut wait, that seems really small, but lifetimes for particles are indeed tiny. Okay.\n\nNow, the next part is the decay distance. The mean decay distance L is given by L = v * \u03c4, where v is the velocity of the particle.\n\nSo I need to find the velocity v. How do I find that? Well, the particle's energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, and its rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So, using relativistic equations, the energy is gamma * m c\u00b2. So gamma = E_X / (m_X c\u00b2). But since we're working in units where c is incorporated, perhaps I can calculate the gamma factor.\n\nWait, in natural units where c=1, E = gamma * m. So gamma = E / m. So gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 \u22486.6667.\n\nSo gamma is about 6.6667. Now, the velocity v can be found from gamma. The relation between gamma and velocity v is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So I can solve for v.\n\nLet me compute beta = v/c. Beta squared is 1 - (1/gamma\u00b2). Or wait, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2), so 1/gamma\u00b2 = 1 - beta\u00b2 \u2192 beta\u00b2 = 1 - 1/gamma\u00b2.\n\nSo beta squared = 1 - (1/( (8/1.2) )\u00b2 ) = 1 - ( (1.2/8) )\u00b2.\n\nWait, 8/1.2 is 6.666..., so 1/(6.6667)^2 is about 1/44.444 \u2248 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta squared is 0.9775 \u2192 beta is sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo v \u2248 0.9887 c. Okay, so approximately 0.9887 times the speed of light, which is about 3e8 m/s. So v \u2248 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s \u2248 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nWait, but I can compute it more accurately. Let's see, 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.666666..., which is 20/3. So gamma is 20/3 \u22486.66667. Then, beta squared is 1 - (3/20)^2. 3/20 is 0.15, squared is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root is sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo v \u2248 0.9887 * c. Let's take c as approximately 3e8 m/s, so v is roughly 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nNow, the mean decay length L is v multiplied by the lifetime \u03c4. So L = v * \u03c4.\n\nWe have v \u2248 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s \u2248 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nAnd \u03c4 is approximately 2.057e-24 seconds.\n\nSo L \u2248 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s = let's compute that.\n\n2.966e8 * 2.057e-24 = (2.966 * 2.057) * 1e(8-24) = (about 6.103) * 1e-16 \u2192 6.103e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me compute 2.966 * 2.057 more accurately.\n\n2.966 * 2 = 5.932.\n\n2.966 * 0.057 \u2248 let's see: 2.966 * 0.05 = 0.1483, 2.966 *0.007= ~0.020762. So sum is ~0.169. So total 5.932 +0.169=6.099, approximately 6.1.\n\nSo 6.1e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the options are around 1e-15 m or 1e-16 m.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n\nC) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n\nSo my calculation gives about 6e-16 m, but the options have 5e-16 or 4e-15 etc. Hmm, maybe my approach is missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute more accurately, including more precise values.\n\nLet me recalculate the steps with more precise numbers.\n\nFirst, compute tau.\n\nGamma_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo \u03c4 = \u0127/(\u0393). \u0127 is approximately 6.582\u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u03c4 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.\n\n6.582 / 0.32 \u2192 let's compute that. 0.32 * 20 = 6.4 \u2192 6.582 is 6.4 + 0.182. So 20 + 0.182/0.32 \u2248 20 + 0.56875 \u2192\u224820.56875.\n\nSo 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. So about 2.057e-24 s.\n\nNext, velocity calculation.\n\nGamma is E/m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 20/3 \u22486.6666667.\n\nSo beta squared is 1 - (1/(gamma^2)).\n\ngamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u224844.444444.\n\nSo 1/(gamma^2) is 9/400 = 0.0225.\n\nSo beta squared is 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775 \u2192 beta = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nWait, let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately. Let's see, 0.9887^2 = approx 0.9775.\n\nYes, 0.9887 * 0.9887:\n\n0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.\n\n0.0087 * 0.98 = 0.008526.\n\n0.98 * 0.0087 = 0.008526.\n\n0.0087 * 0.0087 \u2248 0.00007569.\n\nSo adding: 0.9604 + 0.008526 + 0.008526 + 0.00007569 \u2248 0.977527, which matches. So beta is approximately 0.9887.\n\nSo v = beta c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = approximately 2.9661e8 m/s.\n\nNow, L = v * tau.\n\nv = 2.9661e8 m/s.\n\ntau = 2.057e-24 s.\n\nSo L = 2.9661e8 * 2.057e-24 = (2.9661 * 2.057) * 1e8 * 1e-24 \u2192 exponent is 8-24= -16.\n\nCompute 2.9661 * 2.057:\n\nLet me do it step by step.\n\n2 * 2.057 = 4.114.\n\n0.9661 * 2.057 \u2248 2.000 (since 1 * 2.057 is 2.057, so 0.9661 * 2.057 \u2248 ~2.000).\n\nAdding 4.114 + 2.000 \u22486.114.\n\nSo L \u22486.114e-16 meters.\n\nHmm, but the options don't have this. The closest option is A:5.0223e-16 m and D:4.0655e-16 m.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of \u0127. Because \u0127 is often approximated as 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s, but let me check that.\n\nWait, Planck constant h is 6.62607015e-34 J\u00b7s. \u0127 is h/(2pi) \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nNow, to convert \u0127 into GeV\u00b7s, since 1 GeV = 1.60218e-10 J (since 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J, so 1 GeV is 1e9 eV \u21921.60218e-10 J).\n\nSo \u0127 (in GeV\u00b7s) = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s / (1.60218e-10 J/GeV ) = approximately 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo that part was correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for beta. Let me compute beta more accurately.\n\nGamma is 20/3 \u22486.666666667.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(1 - (3^2)/(20^2)) = sqrt(1 - 9/400) = sqrt(391/400) sqrt(391)/20.\n\nWait, sqrt(391)= approximately 19.774, because 19.77^2 is about 390.9.\n\nSo sqrt(391)\u224819.774. So beta is 19.774 / 20 \u2248 0.9887, which matches previous calculation.\n\nSo v \u22480.9887c.\n\nHmm, perhaps the calculation of L is correct, but the options don't have 6e-16. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait another approach: perhaps I should compute L using the formula involving the decay width, mass, and energy differently. Or maybe I should compute the velocity using the relativistic momentum.\n\nWait, another formula for the mean decay length is L = (gamma * beta) * c * tau.\n\nWait, because gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, so gamma beta is (v/c)/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), which is the same as (v/(c)) * gamma.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). So gamma beta = beta / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = beta * gamma. Hmm, no, that's not correct\u2014gamma beta is gamma multiplied by beta.\n\nAh, right. So, L = v * tau = gamma beta c tau.\n\nWait, but tau is \u0127/(Gamma). So L = gamma beta c (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nWait, but in any case, perhaps the approach is correct.\n\nBut maybe I should use the formula for the decay length in terms of the particle's properties.\n\nWait, the decay length formula is L = (gamma * beta) * c * tau. \n\nBut tau is \u0127 / Gamma. So L = (gamma beta c) * (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nWait, combining terms, perhaps it's better to compute it using (gamma beta) c tau, which is (gamma beta c) * (\u0127 / Gamma) ) = (gamma beta c \u0127) / Gamma.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I can compute gamma beta as follows:\n\nGamma is E/m = (8 GeV)/(1.2 GeV) = 6.6666667.\n\nSo gamma is 6.6666667.\n\nSo gamma beta = (gamma) * beta = (20/3) * sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2).\n\nWait, but earlier calculation showed that gamma beta is approximately 6.6666667 * 0.9887 \u22486.586.\n\nWait, let me compute gamma beta accurately.\n\nGamma is 20/3 \u22486.6666667.\n\nBeta is sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2) = sqrt(391)/20 \u224819.774/20\u22480.9887.\n\nSo gamma beta = (20/3) * (19.774/20) )= (19.774)/(3) \u22486.591333.\n\nSo gamma beta \u22486.59133.\n\nSo now, L = gamma beta * c * tau.\n\nTau is \u0127 / Gamma. So L = gamma beta c (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nLet me plug in the numbers.\n\ngamma beta c = 6.59133 * (3e8 m/s) \u22481.9774e9 m/s.\n\nWait, wait: 6.59133 *3e8 = about 1.977e9 m/s.\n\nWait, (6.59133) *3e8 = 1977399e6 \u2192 about 1.977e9 m/s.\n\nBut then, multiply by tau, which is \u0127/Gamma.\n\nWait, no. Let me compute L = gamma beta c (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nSo \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Gamma is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo \u0127/Gamma = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 \u22482.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo L = 1.977e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s \u2192 1.977e9 * 2.056875e-24 = let's compute 1.977 *2.056875 = approx 4.065.\n\nSo 4.065e(9-24) \u21924.065e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's 4.065e-15 m, which is option B or D? Let me check the options.\n\nOption B:4.0655e-15 m.\n\nOption D:4.0655e-16 m.\n\nAh, wait, 4.065e-15 is option B.\n\nBut earlier when I did L = v tau, I got 6e-16. Now with this approach, I get 4.065e-15 m.\n\nHmm, so which approach is correct?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the first approach. Because in the first approach, I computed v as 0.9887c, which is about 2.966e8 m/s. Then, tau is 2.056e-24 s. So L = v tau = 2.966e8 * 2.056e-24 \u22486.1e-16 m.\n\nBut in the second approach, using L=gamma beta c tau, I get 4.065e-15 m.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests I might have made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the exponent in the second approach. Let me recalculate.\n\nIn the second approach:\n\ngamma beta c = 6.59133 *3e8 m/s = 1.9774e9 m/s.\n\nTau: 2.056e-24 s.\n\nSo L = 1.9774e9 m/s * 2.056e-24 s = (1.9774 * 2.056) * 1e(9-24) \u2192 (4.065) * 1e-15 \u21924.065e-15 m.\n\nWhich matches option B.\n\nBut wait, why is there a discrepancy between the two methods?\n\nAh, I think I see the mistake. Because in the first approach, I took v as beta c, which is correct. But tau is \u0127 / Gamma. So L = beta c * tau.\n\nBut in the second approach, I used L = gamma beta c tau.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think: The mean lifetime tau is \u0127 / Gamma. So the proper time is tau.\n\nBut the lab frame time is longer, but in this case, the decay length is v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime, which is gamma tau. Because the particle's lifetime as measured in the lab is longer than its proper time.\n\nWait, no, no. The proper time is tau. The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau.\n\nBecause the particle is moving, its lifetime is longer. So the lab frame lifetime t = gamma tau.\n\nSo the decay distance is v * t = v gamma tau.\n\nSo L = v gamma tau.\n\nWait, but v=beta c. So L = beta c gamma tau.\n\nWhich is same as gamma beta c tau.\n\nSo the correct formula is L = gamma beta c tau.\n\nSo I must have made a mistake in the first approach. I think I forgot to include gamma in the first calculation.\n\nAh! So in the first approach, I used v tau, but that's (beta c) * tau, where tau is the proper time. But the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau, so the correct decay length should be v * gamma tau.\n\nSo tau is \u0127 / Gamma, which is proper time. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. Thus, the correct L is v * gamma tau.\n\nSo in the first approach, I only used tau, but I should have used gamma tau.\n\nSo my first approach was wrong because I didn't multiply by gamma again.\n\nSo let's redo it.\n\nSo tau = \u0127 / Gamma = 2.057e-24 s.\n\nThe lab frame lifetime is gamma tau, which is (20/3) * 2.057e-24 s \u2248 (6.6667) * 2.057e-24 \u22481.371e-23 s.\n\nThen, L = v * (gamma tau) = beta c * gamma tau.\n\nWait, but beta c is v, and gamma tau is the lab lifetime.\n\nSo L = v * (gamma tau) = beta c * gamma tau.\n\nAlternatively, L = gamma beta c tau.\n\nSo let's compute it.\n\nGamma is 20/3 \u22486.6667.\n\nBeta is sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2) \u22480.9887.\n\nSo gamma beta \u22486.6667 * 0.9887 \u22486.5913.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nTau is 2.057e-24 s.\n\nSo L =6.5913 *3e8 m/s *2.057e-24 s.\n\nCompute 6.5913 *3 =19.7739.\n\nSo 19.7739e8 * 2.057e-24 = (19.7739 * 2.057) * 1e(8-24) \u2192 (approx 40.655) * 1e-16 \u219240.655e-16 m =4.0655e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's exactly option B:4.0655 *10^-15 m.\n\nWait, but wait! No, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. But wait, 40.655e-16 is 4.0655e-15.\n\nSo yes, option B is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options:\n\nOption B:4.0655 * 10^-15 m.\n\nOption C:5.0223 * 10^-15 m.\n\nSo according to this, the correct answer is B.\n\nBut wait, in the initial approach, I didn't account for the gamma factor and thus got a different answer. But after correcting the approach, the correct L is about 4.0655e-15 m, which is option B.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed L using gamma beta c tau, I got 4.065e-15. So that's the correct approach.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option B.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we start by calculating the mean lifetime \\( \\tau \\), which is related to the total decay width \\( \\Gamma \\) via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}.\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( \\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.32 \\, \\text{GeV} \\), and using \\( \\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{GeV\u00b7s} \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \\approx 2.057 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}.\n\\]\n\nNext, the decay distance \\( L \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nL = v \\cdot \\tau,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( v \\) is the velocity of the particle. The velocity \\( v \\) can be determined using relativistic kinematics. The energy of the particle is \\( E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} \\), and its mass is \\( m_X = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} \\). The Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X} = \\frac{8}{1.2} \\approx 6.6667.\n\\]\n\nThe velocity \\( v \\) is related to \\( \\gamma \\) by:\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}, \\quad v = \\beta c.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( \\gamma = 6.6667 \\), we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{44.444}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.9775} \\approx 0.9887.\n\\]\n\nThus, the velocity is:\n\n\\[\nv = \\beta c \\approx 0.9887 \\cdot 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\approx 2.966 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}.\n\\]\n\nThe mean decay distance is then:\n\n\\[\nL = v \\cdot \\tau = (2.966 \\times 10^8) \\cdot (2.057 \\times 10^{-24}) \\approx 6.1 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m}.\n\\]\n\nHowever, this result does not match the provided options. To resolve this discrepancy, we use the corrected formula for the decay distance:\n\n\\[\nL = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( \\gamma \\beta \\approx 6.5913 \\), \\( c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\), and \\( \\tau = 2.057 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s} \\), we calculate:\n\n\\[\nL = 6.5913 \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8) \\cdot (2.057 \\times 10^{-24}) \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}.\n\\]\n\nThis matches option **B**. The earlier discrepancy arose because the proper time \\( \\tau \\) must be multiplied by the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\) to account for the lab frame lifetime.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**B) \\( 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m} \\)**",
