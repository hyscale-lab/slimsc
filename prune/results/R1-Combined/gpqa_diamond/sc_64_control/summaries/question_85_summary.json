      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these formulas, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nSo the question says there are two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, orbiting a star. The star's mass is 1.5 times the Sun, radius 1.2 times, and effective temperature 6300 K. Both planets are detected via transit and RV methods, so they must be pretty close to their star since both methods are effective for nearby planets.\n\nPlanet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which is good because that variable won't come into play for the equilibrium temperature calculation.\n\nThe question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Oh right, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Since albedo is the same for both, that part cancels out when we take the ratio.\n\nWait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ) / ( (1 + e)^(1/4) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so we can ignore that part. Also, since both planets presumably orbit the same star, the albedo is same, so they cancel in the ratio.\n\nWait, no, wait. The star's temperature is given, but the star's luminosity is proportional to R^2 * T^4. So maybe I need to compute the luminosity first.\n\nWait, but each planet's equilibrium temperature also depends on the distance from the star. How do I find the distance? Because the RV method gives us the mass and the distance via the Doppler shift. Oh wait, the question gives the Doppler shifts for each planet on the same forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5.\n\nWait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) / ( (1 day) * 86400 seconds )^(something)? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the RV semi-amplitude formula.\n\nWait, the RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by K = ( (2\u03c0G) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ), but since e=0 (circular orbits), the denominator simplifies. Also, because M_planet is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_planet \u2248 M_star.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ), but I might be mixing up the exponents.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about the relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital period. But wait, the question gives the Doppler shifts, which are the actual observed velocities of the star. So, the RV semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity measured, which is given as 0.03 \u00c5 for Planet1 and 0.04 \u00c5 for Planet2.\n\nWait, but how does that relate to the planet's orbital period or distance? Because the RV method gives the mass function, which depends on the planet's mass, the inclination, and the orbital period. But without knowing the inclination, we can't get the exact mass, but since both planets are detected via transit, their inclinations are likely the same (edge-on), so sin i =1.\n\nWait, but if both planets are transiting, their orbital planes are aligned, so same i. So sin i is 1 for both.\n\nSo for each planet, the RV semi-amplitude K is given.\n\nLet me recall the formula for K:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ), but I'm not confident. Maybe another approach: the RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = ( (27 * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_earth) ) ) / ( (M_star / M_sun) + (M_p / M_earth) )^(1/3) * (P / day) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 m/s), but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. The formula is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * P) / (2\u03c0 c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )\n\nBut I'm not remembering exactly. Alternatively, I can think in terms of the mass function. The mass function depends on the RV semi-amplitude K, the period P, and the inclination.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the relation between the Doppler shift and the velocity, and then find the period, which relates to the planet's distance via Kepler's third law.\n\nWait, I have the Doppler shift values given as 0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5 for the two planets. But how does that translate to velocity? The Doppler shift formula is:\n\n\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb0 = v / c\n\nSo, \u0394\u03bb is 0.03 \u00c5 for Planet1, and 0.04 \u00c5 for Planet2.\n\nBut the forbidden line is at 6300 \u00c5, so \u03bb0 is 6300 \u00c5. So for Planet1:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.03 \u00c5 \u2192 v = (0.03 / 6300) * c\n\nSimilarly for Planet2: v = (0.04 / 6300) * c\n\nBut wait, in the RV method, K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. So the maximum velocity is K, which is what's given here as the shifts.\n\nSo, compute K for each planet in terms of velocity.\n\nLet me compute K for each:\n\nc = speed of light \u2248 3e5 km/s = 3e8 m/s.\n\nBut in \u00c5ngstr\u00f6ms, 1 \u00c5 is 1e-10 meters. So, 6300 \u00c5 is 6300e-10 m = 6.3e-7 m.\n\nSo for Planet1:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.03 \u00c5 = 0.03e-10 m.\n\nv1 = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb0) * c = (0.03e-10 / 6300e-10) * 3e8 m/s\n\nWait, 0.03e-10 / 6300e-10 = 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-3 / 6300 = 1e-5 / 2100 \u2248 4.76e-6.\n\nSo v1 = 4.76e-6 * 3e8 m/s = 1.428e3 m/s = approx 1.428 km/s.\n\nSimilarly for Planet2, \u0394\u03bb is 0.04 \u00c5:\n\nv2 = (0.04e-10 / 6300e-10) * 3e8 = (0.04 /6300)*3e8 m/s.\n\n0.04 /6300 = 4e-3 /6300 \u2248 6.349e-6.\n\nv2 = 6.349e-6 * 3e8 = 1.9047e3 m/s \u2248 1.905 km/s.\n\nSo K1 is about 1.428 km/s, K2 is about 1.905 km/s.\n\nNow, the RV semi-amplitude formula is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) )\n\nWait, maybe I should use the formula in terms of period and mass. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider the formula:\n\nK = ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * ( (G / (4\u03c0\u00b2))^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * c) )\n\nWait, maybe it's better to find the period P for each planet using their respective K.\n\nBut without knowing P, maybe I can relate the two planets' periods using their K values.\n\nWait, the formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (v) ) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * ( 1 / ( (P)^(1/3) * ( (2\u03c0) )^(1/3) ) ) )\n\nHmm, perhaps an alternative form is more useful. Let me think in terms of the mass function.\n\nThe mass function is f(M) = (M_p^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 )\n\nWhich is given by:\n\nf(M) = (K^3 P) / (2942)\n\nWhere K is in m/s, P is in days, and f(M) is in Jupiter masses.\n\nBut wait, since both planets are transiting, sin i is 1, and the inclination is 90 degrees. So f(M) = (M_p)^3 / (M_star + M_p)^2 \u2248 (M_p)^3 / M_star^2, since M_p << M_star.\n\nSo for each planet, we can write:\n\nf(M1) = (K1^3 P1) / 2942 = (M_p1^3) / (M_star^2)\n\nSimilarly, f(M2) = (K2^3 P2) / 2942 = (M_p2^3) / (M_star^2)\n\nBut since M_p1 and M_p2 are given in Earth masses, and M_star is 1.5 solar masses, which is 1.5 * M_sun.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure: the mass function is f(M) = (M_p^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 (1 + M_p/M_star) ) )\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the period in terms of K and M.\n\nWait, but if I can relate the periods P1 and P2, perhaps via Kepler's third law, which for a star of mass M_star is:\n\nP^2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 G M_star)^(-1) * a^3\n\nSo P is proportional to a^(3/2) / (M_star)^(1/2)\n\nBut I don't know a for each planet. Alternatively, since we're trying to find the equilibrium temperature, which depends on the distance a, perhaps I can find the ratio a1/a2.\n\nWait, equilibrium temperature T_eq is given by the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )\n\nSince albedos are the same, it cancels when taking the ratio. So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/a1) / (R_star/a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nThus, to find T1/T2, I need a2/a1.\n\nAlternatively, the equilibrium temperature formula is often written as:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) )\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )\n\nBut since albedo is same for both, the ratio becomes sqrt( R_star/(2 a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo I need to find the ratio a2/a1.\n\nNow, to find a1 and a2, I can use the RV data. Since K is known for each planet, and the mass function relates K, P, and M_p.\n\nWait, but I have two unknowns: P1 and P2, and a1 and a2, but perhaps I can relate them through the RV data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that the same forbidden line is used for both, and the same star, so the period and K can be linked to the planet's mass and distance.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: since both planets are detected via transit and RV, their periods are known. But the question doesn't provide the periods, so I must somehow find the ratio a1/a2 from the given K values.\n\nWait, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )\n\nBut since sin i=1 for both, and M_p is known, and M_star is known, perhaps I can express P in terms of a.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_star )\n\nSo P = ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / (G M_star) )^(1/2 )\n\nWait, substituting into the K formula:\n\nK \u221d (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (P^(-1/3) )\n\nSubstituting P from Kepler's law:\n\nP^(-1/3) = ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 / (G M_star) )^(-1/2) )^(-1/3) ) = ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3/(G M_star)) )^(1/6 )\n\nSo K \u221d ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3/(G M_star) ) )^(1/6 )\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nLet me write it as (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3/(G M_star)) )^(1/6) = (a^3)^(1/6) * (G M_star)^(-1/6) ) = a^(0.5) * (G M_star)^(-1/6 )\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nK \u221d M_p * a^0.5 / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * ( G M_star )^(-1/6 )\n\nWait, that's a bit messy. Let me try simplifying the exponents.\n\nLet me collect the terms:\n\nM_p,\n\na^0.5,\n\nM_star^(-2/3 - 1/6 ) = M_star^(-5/6 )\n\nAnd G^(-1/6 ) (but G is a constant, so that's part of the proportionality).\n\nSo K \u221d M_p * a^0.5 / ( M_star^(5/6 ) )\n\nBut K is given for each planet.\n\nSo for each planet,\n\nK_p = (constant) * ( M_p ) * sqrt(a) / ( M_star^(5/6) )\n\nWait, because a^0.5 is sqrt(a).\n\nSo, rearranging to solve for sqrt(a):\n\nsqrt(a) = K_p * M_star^(5/6) / (constant * M_p )\n\nSo sqrt(a_p) = (K_p / M_p) * ( M_star^(5/6) ) / constant )\n\nBut since the constant is the same for both planets, the ratio of a1 and a2 can be found from:\n\nsqrt(a1)/sqrt(a2) = (K1/(M_p1)) / (K2/(M_p2)) )\n\nBecause M_star is same for both.\n\nSo sqrt(a1/a2) = (K1 / M_p1) / ( K2 / M_p2 ) )\n\nWhich simplifies to sqrt(a1/a2) = (K1 * M_p2) / ( K2 * M_p1 )\n\nThen, a1/a2 = ( (K1 * M_p2)/( K2 * M_p1 ) )^2\n\nSo the ratio a2/a1 is reciprocal, so (K2 * M_p1 / ( K1 * M_p2 ))^2.\n\nWait, but I need a2/a1 for the temperature ratio.\n\nWait, earlier I found that T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1 )\n\nSo if I can compute a2/a1, I can get the temperature ratio.\n\nSo let me compute a2/a1.\n\nFrom the expression,\n\na1/a2 = [ ( K1 * M_p2 ) / ( K2 * M_p1 ) ]^2\n\nThus,\n\na2/a1 = [ ( K2 * M_p1 ) / ( K1 * M_p2 ) ]^2\n\nSo, putting in the numbers:\n\nK1 is 1.428 km/s, K2 is 1.905 km/s.\n\nM_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5 Earth masses.\n\nCompute ( K2 * M_p1 ) / ( K1 * M_p2 ) = (1.905 *7)/(1.428 *5 )\n\nCalculating numerator: 1.905 *7 \u2248 13.335\n\nDenominator: 1.428 *5 = 7.14\n\nSo the ratio is 13.335 / 7.14 \u2248 1.867.\n\nSo [1.867]^2 = approximately 3.485.\n\nSo a2/a1 \u2248 3.485.\n\nThen, the temperature ratio T1/T2 is sqrt(a2/a1 ) = sqrt(3.485) \u2248 1.867.\n\nWait, that's a big difference. But wait, let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the ( K2 * M_p1 ) / ( K1 * M_p2 ) term precisely.\n\nK1 = 1.428 km/s, K2=1.905 km/s.\n\nM_p1=7, M_p2=5.\n\nSo:\n\nNumerator: K2 * M_p1 = 1.905 *7 = 13.335\n\nDenominator: K1 * M_p2 = 1.428 *5 = 7.14\n\nSo ratio = 13.335 /7.14 = let me compute.\n\nDivide 13.335 by 7.14:\n\n7.14 \u00d7 1.866 = 13.333 (since 7.14 \u00d71.8=12.852; 7.14 \u00d70.066\u22480.471, total 13.323). Close enough to 13.335. So 1.866.\n\nSo ratio is approximately 1.866.\n\nSo a2/a1 = (1.866)^2 \u2248 3.48.\n\nThus, T1/T2 = sqrt(3.48) \u2248 1.866.\n\nHmm, but looking at the options, the options are 0.98, 1.30, 0.53, 1.05. So that's way higher than any of the options.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me go back.\n\nWhen I derived the sqrt(a1/a2) ratio, maybe I got it inverted.\n\nWait, the formula I had was sqrt(a1/a2) = (K1 * M_p2) / ( K2 * M_p1 )\n\nWhich would make a1/a2 = [ (K1 M_p2)/( K2 M_p1) ]^2\n\nSo, a1/a2 = ( (1.428 *5)/(1.905 *7) )^2\n\nWait, 1.428 *5 =7.14, 1.905 *7=13.335.\n\nSo (7.14/13.335 )= 0.535.\n\nSo a1/a2 = (0.535)^2 \u2248 0.286.\n\nSo a2/a1 \u2248 3.49, same as before.\n\nWait, so a2 is about 3.49 times a1.\n\nSo T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(3.49) \u2248 1.867.\n\nBut that's not matching any of the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, another approach. Let me think about the RV semi-amplitude formula.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) )\n\nWait, another way to write K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( (G/(4 \u03c0\u00b2))^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3) ) )\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to express the ratio of K1 and K2.\n\nK1/K2 = [ (M_p1 sin i) / (M_p2 sin i) ] * [ (P2^(1/3) ) / (P1^(1/3) ) ] \n\nBecause K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (1/ P^(1/3) )\n\nSo,\n\nK1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3 )\n\nBut we also have from Kepler's law: P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3/(M_star)\n\nSo, P1\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a1\u00b3)/(G M_star )\n\nP2\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a2\u00b3)/(G M_star )\n\nDividing P2\u00b2 by P1\u00b2 gives (a2\u00b3/a1\u00b3) \u2192 (P2/P1)^2 = (a2/a1)^3 \u2192 (P2/P1) = (a2/a1)^(3/2 )\n\nSo, (P2/P1)^(1/3 ) = (a2/a1)^( (3/2)*(1/3) ) ) = (a2/a1)^(1/2 )\n\nSo substituting back into K1/K2 ratio:\n\nK1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (a2/a1)^(1/2 )\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for (a2/a1)^(1/2 ) = (K1/K2) * (M_p2/M_p1 )\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(a2/a1) = (K1/K2) * (M_p2/M_p1 )\n\nThen,\n\na2/a1 = ( (K1/K2) * (M_p2/M_p1 ) )^2\n\nWait, this is a different approach but I think it's leading me somewhere.\n\nBut wait, in this case, K1 is for planet1 and K2 for planet2. So let me plug in the numbers.\n\nK1 is 1.428 km/s, K2 is 1.905 km/s.\n\nM_p1 is7, M_p2 is5.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(a2/a1) = (1.428/1.905) * (5/7 )\n\nCompute 1.428/1.905 = approximately 0.75.\n\n5/7\u22480.714.\n\nSo, 0.75 * 0.714 \u2248 0.535.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(a2/a1) = 0.535 \u2192 a2/a1 = (0.535)^2 \u2248 0.286.\n\nWait wait, this is conflicting with the earlier result. Earlier, I had a2/a1 \u22483.49, but now I get a2/a1\u22480.286.\n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, in the formula:\n\nsqrt(a2/a1) = (K1/K2) * (M_p2/M_p1 )\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(a2/a1) = (1.428/1.905) * (5/7 )\n\nWhich is (0.75) * (0.714) \u2248 0.535.\n\nSo,\n\na2/a1 = (0.535)^2 \u2248 0.286.\n\nWhich implies a2 is about 0.286 times a1. So a2 is closer to the star than a1.\n\nBut earlier approach gave a2/a1 of about 3.48.\n\nHmm, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the formula derivation.\n\nIn the formula:\n\nK1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3 )\n\nBut from Kepler's law, P is proportional to a^(3/2) / sqrt(M_star )\n\nSo,\n\nP2/P1 = (a2/a1)^(3/2 ) * (M_star)/(M_star) ) \u2192 since same star, M_star cancels.\n\nThus,\n\nP2/P1 = (a2/a1)^(3/2 )\n\nSo,\n\n(P2/P1)^(1/3 ) = (a2/a1)^( (3/2)*(1/3) ) ) = (a2/a1)^(1/2 )\n\nThus,\n\nK1/K2 = (M_p1/M_p2) * (a2/a1)^(1/2 )\n\nRearranged:\n\n(a2/a1)^(1/2 ) = (K1/K2) * (M_p2/M_p1 )\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(a2/a1) = (K1/K2) * (M_p2/M_p1 )\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(a2/a1) = (1.428 / 1.905) * (5/7 )\n\nWhich is about (0.75) * (0.714) = 0.535.\n\nThus,\n\na2/a1 = (0.535)^2 \u22480.286.\n\nSo, a2 \u2248 0.286 a1.\n\nThus, a1 is larger than a2. So a1 is farther from the star than a2.\n\nNow, the equilibrium temperature ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nWhich is sqrt(0.286) \u2248 0.535.\n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 is approximately 0.535.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which is close to this value.\n\nSo the answer should be option C.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:\n\n\\[\nT_{\\text{eq}} = T_{\\text{star}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{\\text{star}}}{2a}} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\text{albedo}\\right)^{1/4}\n\\]\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo, the albedo term cancels out when taking the ratio. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\nThus, the key task is to find the ratio \\( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\), which depends on the planets' orbital distances from the star. The orbital distance \\( a \\) can be related to the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \\( K \\) using the formula:\n\n\\[\nK \\propto \\frac{M_p}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}\n\\]\n\nFrom Kepler's third law, the orbital period \\( P \\) is related to the distance \\( a \\) as:\n\n\\[\nP^2 \\propto a^3 / M_{\\text{star}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( P \\propto a^{3/2} \\) into the RV formula, we find:\n\n\\[\nK \\propto \\frac{M_p}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{a^{1/2}}\n\\]\n\nRearranging to solve for \\( a \\), we get:\n\n\\[\na \\propto \\frac{K^2 \\cdot M_{\\text{star}}^{4/3}}{M_p^2}\n\\]\n\nThe ratio of distances \\( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\) is then:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2 \\cdot M_{p1}}{K_1 \\cdot M_{p2}}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\n### Given Data:\n- \\( K_1 = 1.428 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) (Planet1)\n- \\( K_2 = 1.905 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) (Planet2)\n- \\( M_{p1} = 7 \\, M_{\\text{Earth}} \\) (Planet1)\n- \\( M_{p2} = 5 \\, M_{\\text{Earth}} \\) (Planet2)\n\nSubstituting these values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{1.905 \\cdot 7}{1.428 \\cdot 5}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator and denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Numerator: } 1.905 \\cdot 7 = 13.335\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Denominator: } 1.428 \\cdot 5 = 7.14\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{13.335}{7.14}\\right)^2 \\approx (1.866)^2 \\approx 3.48\n\\]\n\nNow, the equilibrium temperature ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{3.48} \\approx 1.867\n\\]\n\nHowever, this result does not match the provided options. Upon re-evaluating the formula, it was realized that the correct ratio of distances is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1 \\cdot M_{p2}}{K_2 \\cdot M_{p1}}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values again:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{1.428 \\cdot 5}{1.905 \\cdot 7}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Numerator: } 1.428 \\cdot 5 = 7.14\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Denominator: } 1.905 \\cdot 7 = 13.335\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{7.14}{13.335}\\right)^2 \\approx (0.535)^2 \\approx 0.286\n\\]\n\nThus, the equilibrium temperature ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{0.286} \\approx 0.535\n\\]\n\nThis matches option **C** (~0.53).\n\n### Final Answer:\n**C**",
