      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about determining the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I remember that these kinds of problems usually involve understanding elemental abundances and how they're represented in terms of dex, or decimal exponents.\n\nSo, the data given is about the stars' masses and their elemental abundances. Let's list out what I know:\n\nStar_1 has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, and Star_2 is 1.2 solar masses. But I'm not sure if their masses directly affect the elemental abundances. Maybe the problem is more about the chemical compositions, so perhaps the masses are just there for context but not directly needed for the calculation.\n\nThe elemental abundances are given using the EW method under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The values provided are:\n- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex\n- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex\n- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex\n- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex\n\nWait, right, these are logarithmic abundance ratios. The notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X / n_Y)_sun. So, each [X/Y] tells us how much more or less abundant X is relative to Y compared to the Sun.\n\nThe solar photospheric composition is given:\n- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 \u2192 So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 \u2192 nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)\n- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 \u2192 log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 \u2192 nMg/nH =10^(-5)\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify that. The way it's written, it's 12 plus the log equals some number. So for Fe, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 \u2192 log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 \u2192 which is -4.5. So nFe/nH in the Sun is 10^(-4.5), which is the same as 3.16 \u00d710^-5. Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 \u2192 log is -5 \u2192 nMg/nH is 1e-5.\n\nSo, the Sun's Fe to H ratio is 3.16e-5, and Mg to H is 1e-5.\n\nNow, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. Wait, no\u2014it's the ratio of silicon in each star. Or wait, the ratio between the two stars?\n\nWait, the exact question: \"the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.\" So, (n_Si in Star_1) / (n_Si in Star_2) ?\n\nSo, to find [Si/Star_1] compared to [Si/Star_2], I need to find the abundance of Si in each star relative to H (or perhaps another element), then compute their ratio.\n\nWait, but the given data includes [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si]. So perhaps I need to find [Si/H] for each star, then take the ratio.\n\nLet me think about Star_1 first.\n\nFor Star_1:\n\nGiven [Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun. If [Fe/H] is 0, then log(nFe/nH)_star = log(nFe/nH)_sun \u2192 nFe/nH is same as Sun.\n\nSo for Star_1, nFe/nH = same as Sun, which is 3.16e-5.\n\nAlso, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_sun =0.3.\n\nWait, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.\n\nSo [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 \u2192 log(nSi/nFe, star 1) - log(nSi/nFe, sun) =0.3.\n\nWe can compute nSi/nFe for Star_1 as 10^(0.3 + log(nSi/nFe)_sun).\n\nWait, let me think. Let\u2019s compute the Sun's [Si/Fe]. Sun's [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe)_sun.\n\nWait, but for the Sun, we know nFe/nH and nMg/nH. Do we have nSi/nH for the Sun? Or can we get it from the data provided?\n\nWait, the problem didn't give the solar [Si/H] or [Si/Fe]. Hmm. So maybe I need to find the [Si/Fe]_sun to compute the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute it. Let me think. The problem provides [Mg/Si]_2, but for Star_2. Hmm... but perhaps for the Sun, I can find [Mg/Si], and then invert it.\n\nWait, for the Sun, we have nMg/nH =1e-5, nFe/nH=3.16e-5, but nSi/nH is not given. Hmm. Maybe I can find [Mg/Si]_sun, then use that.\n\nWait, [Mg/Si]_sun = log(nMg/nSi)_sun. Since [Mg/Si]_sun is log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg/nSi)_sun =0? Wait, wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. So [Mg/Si]_sun would be 0, because it's the log base 10 of (nMg/nSi)_sun / (nMg/nSi)_sun) \u2192 which is 1, so log(1)=0.\n\nBut how does that help me? I'm not sure. Maybe I can find nSi/nH for the Sun.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find nSi/nFe for the Sun, since I know [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3.\n\nWait, but without knowing nSi/nH for the Sun, perhaps I can express the ratio of Si in each star relative to H, using the given data.\n\nLet me outline the steps for each star.\n\nStarting with Star_1:\n\nWe have [Fe/H]_1 = 0 \u2192 Fe abundance same as Sun.\n\nWe have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 \u2192 Si is 0.3 dex higher relative to Fe than the Sun.\n\nSo, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 \u2192 (nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^(0.3) * (nSi/nFe)_sun.\n\nBut we don't know (nSi/nFe)_sun. Hmm, perhaps we can express (nSi/nH)_1 in terms of (nFe/nH)_1 and (nSi/nFe)_1.\n\nLet me think.\n\nnSi/nH = (nSi/nFe) * (nFe/nH).\n\nSo, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 \u2192 (nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.\n\nBut I don't know (nSi/nFe)_sun. So perhaps I need to find that.\n\nWait, but we can compute [Si/Fe]_sun as log(nSi/nFe)_sun - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0 \u2192 which doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express [Si/H] for Star_1 in terms of [Fe/H] and [Si/Fe].\n\nBecause [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe].\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nBecause [X/H]_star = [Fe/H]_star + [X/Fe]_star.\n\nBecause [X/Fe] is log(nX/nFe) - log(nX/nFe)_sun.\n\nAnd [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun.\n\nBut nX/nH = (nX/nFe) * (nFe/nH).\n\nSo, log(nX/nH) = log(nX/nFe) + log(nFe/nH).\n\nThus, [X/H] = ([X/Fe] ) + [Fe/H].\n\nBecause [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun.\n\nSo yes, [X/H] = [X/Fe] + [Fe/H].\n\nSo for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1.\n\nBecause [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.\n\nSo, [Si/H]_1 =0.3.\n\nSimilarly, for Star_2:\n\nWe have [Mg/H]_2=0 \u2192 Mg abundance same as Sun.\n\n[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 \u2192 [Mg/Si] is log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg/nSi)_sun =0.3.\n\nWhich rearranges to (nMg/nSi)_2 =10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_sun.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, I can think about [Mg/H] in terms of [Mg/Si] and [Si/H].\n\nWait, using the same logic as before, [Mg/H] = [Mg/Si] + [Si/H].\n\nBecause [Mg/H] = log(nMg/nH) - log(nMg/nH)_sun.\n\nBut nMg/nH = (nMg/nSi) * (nSi/nH).\n\nSo, [Mg/H] = [Mg/Si] + [Si/H].\n\nGiven that [Mg/H]_2 is 0, and [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, so:\n\n0 = 0.3 + [Si/H]_2 \u2192 [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.\n\nWait, that would mean [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.\n\nSo, for Star_1, [Si/H] is 0.3, and for Star_2, it's -0.3.\n\nNow, to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 compared to Star_2, we can compute (n_Si,1 / H,1) / (n_Si,2 / H,2) = (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) * (n_H,2 / n_H,1).\n\nBut wait, the ratio of silicon atoms would be (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) = (n_Si,1 / H,1) * (H,2 / n_Si,2). Because (n_Si,1 / H,1) is [Si/H]_1 scaled by the solar value, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of logarithms.\n\nAlternatively, since [X/H] is log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun, then log(nX/nH) = [X/H] + log(nX/nH)_sun.\n\nWait, but how do we get the actual ratios?\n\nLet me think: if [Si/H]_1 =0.3, then log(n_Si,1 / n_H,1) = log(n_Si, sun / n_H, sun) + 0.3.\n\nSimilarly, for Star_2: [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 \u2192 log(n_Si,2 / n_H,2) = log(n_Si, sun / n_H, sun) - 0.3.\n\nNow, the ratio (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) = [ (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) / (n_Si,2 / n_H,2) ) ] * (n_H,2 / n_H,1).\n\nWait, that's a bit complicated. Let me think in terms of exponents.\n\nLet\u2019s denote A = n_Si,1 / n_H,1 = (n_Si /n_H)_1.\n\nAnd B = (n_Si /n_H)_2.\n\nThen the ratio A/B is (n_Si,1 /n_H,1) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2) ) = (n_Si,1 * n_H,2) / (n_Si,2 * n_H,1).\n\nWhich is (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) * (n_H,2 /n_H,1).\n\nBut we don't know the densities of H in each star. Hmm.\n\nWait, but perhaps the H density is the same in both stars? No, that's not necessarily true. The problem doesn't give any information about the overall metallicity or the H content of each star beyond the abundance ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the H density is the same as in the Sun when considering [Fe/H] and [Mg/H]. But wait, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so Fe is same as Sun. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so Mg is same as Sun.\n\nWait, but in Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0. So the abundance of Fe relative to H is same as in the Sun. So nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as Sun.\n\nSimilarly, in Star_2, nMg/nH is same as Sun.\n\nBut what about nH in each star? Well, the total density (n) of the star's photosphere would depend on its overall structure, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that the number of H atoms is the same as the Sun? No, that's probably not correct because stars can have different sizes and temperatures, but without more data, it's unclear.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is designed so that the H abundance is the same in both stars as the Sun. But looking at the data, Star_1's [Fe/H] is zero, so nFe/nH is same as Sun. Similarly, Star_2's [Mg/H] is zero, so nMg/nH same as Sun. But for the H itself, maybe the question assumes that the H abundance is the same as the Sun in both stars? Or perhaps not, since we don't have [H/Fe] or [H/Mg] data.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars. So maybe I don't need to know the absolute number of H atoms in each star, just the ratio of Si in each.\n\nWait, let me approach this from another angle.\n\nWe can write the ratio (n_Si,1) / (n_Si,2) = (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) * (n_H,2 / n_Si,2) ) * (n_H,1 / n_H,2).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think about it more carefully.\n\nThe ratio (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) = (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) * (n_H,2 / n_Si,2) ) * (n_H,1 / n_H,2).\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me think in terms of logarithms.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nn_Si,1 = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 + log(n_Si/Sun) }\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to use the definitions.\n\nBecause [X/H] = log(n_X / n_H) - log(n_X / n_H)_sun.\n\nSo, log(n_X / n_H) = [X/H] + log(n_X /n_H)_sun.\n\nTherefore, for Star_1:\n\nlog(n_Si,1 / n_H,1) = [Si/H]_1 + log(n_Si, sun / n_H, sun).\n\nSimilarly for Star_2:\n\nlog(n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) = [Si/H]_2 + log(n_Si, sun /n_H, sun).\n\nCompute the ratio:\n\n(n_Si,1 /n_H,1) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 + log_Sun_Si_H } / 10^{ [Si/H]_2 + log_Sun_Si_H } }\n\nWhich simplifies to 10^{ ([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2) }\n\nBecause the log_Sun_Si_H terms cancel when taking the ratio.\n\nSo (n_Si,1 /n_H,1) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) = 10^{ (0.3 - (-0.3)) } = 10^{0.6} \u2248 3.98.\n\nBut wait, that's the ratio (n_Si,1 /n_H,1) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ), which is (Si in Star_1 relative to H in Star_1) divided by (Si in Star_2 relative to H in Star_2).\n\nBut the question is about (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 ), which is the ratio of Si atoms in Star_1 to those in Star_2, regardless of H.\n\nWait, but H could be present in different amounts in each star. So, to get n_Si,1 / n_Si,2, we also have to account for the ratio of H in each star.\n\nBecause n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 = (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) / (n_Si,2 / n_H,2 ) * (n_H,2 /n_H,1 )\n\nSo that's the same as [ (n_Si,1 /n_H,1) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) ) ] * (n_H,2 /n_H,1 )\n\nFrom earlier, (n_Si,1 /n_H,1) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) ) = 10^{0.6} \u22483.98.\n\nBut what is (n_H,2 /n_H,1 )?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the overall metallicity. But the given data doesn't directly provide [H/Fe] or [H/Si]. So perhaps the problem assumes that the number of H atoms in each star is the same as the Sun, but that's an assumption we can't make unless stated.\n\nWait, but let's think about [Fe/H]_1 =0 and [Mg/H]_2=0.\n\nFor Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 =0 \u2192 nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as Sun.\n\nSimilarly, Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 \u2192 nMg/nH same as Sun.\n\nBut without knowing [H/Fe] or [H/Mg], I can't say anything about the H abundance in each star.\n\nWait, but perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun. Because the problem doesn't state otherwise, perhaps the H in each star is same as Sun.\n\nIf that's the case, then (n_H,2 /n_H,1 )=1.\n\nThen, the ratio n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 =3.98, which is approximately 4. So the ratio would be about 3.9, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, that's a big assumption. The problem doesn't say that the H abundance is the same. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the abundance of H is the same in both stars, which is another way of saying [H/Fe] is 0 in both. But without that data, I can't be sure.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which implies that [Fe/H] is 0 in Star_1. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0 in Star_2.\n\nBut [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (nFe/nH) relative to the Sun. So for Star_1, nFe/nH is same as the Sun, which is 3.16e-5.\n\nSimilarly, for Star_2, nMg/nH is same as the Sun, which is 1e-5.\n\nWait, but for Star_1, nFe is the same as the Sun, but we don't know about nH. If [Fe/H]_1 is 0, then nFe/nH = nFe_sun / nH_sun \u2192 which implies that (nFe/nH) = (nFe_sun)/(nH_sun) \u2192 so (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun.\n\nWhich would imply that (nH)_1 = nH_sun * (nFe/nH)_1 / (nFe/nH)_sun \u2192 but (nFe/nH)_1 is same as Sun, so (nH)_1 = nH_sun.\n\nWait, no, because nFe/nH = (nFe)/(nH). So if (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun, then nFe_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun * nH_1.\n\nBut nFe_sun = (nFe/nH)_sun * nH_sun.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nnFe_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun * nH_1.\n\nBut nFe_sun = (nFe/nH)_sun * nH_sun.\n\nSo, nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun).\n\nHmm, so if nFe_1 is same as nFe_sun (as per [Fe/H]_1=0), then:\n\nnFe_1 = nFe_sun \u2192 [ (nFe/nH)_sun * nH_1 ] = (nFe/nH)_sun * nH_sun \u2192 nH_1 = nH_sun.\n\nSo yes, in Star_1, the number of H atoms is same as Sun.\n\nSimilarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 \u2192 nMg/nH = nMg_sun / nH_sun \u2192 so nMg_2 = nMg_sun \u2192 which implies that nH_2 = nH_sun.\n\nBecause nMg_2 = nMg_sun = (nMg/nH)_sun * nH_2 \u2192 nH_2 = (nMg_sun * nH_sun) / (nMg/nH)_sun.\n\nWait, nMg_sun = (nMg/nH)_sun * nH_sun \u2192 so nMg_sun = (1e-5) *nH_sun.\n\nSo nH_2 = (nMg_sun * nH_sun) / (nMg/nH)_sun \u2192 substitute nMg_sun = (1e-5)*nH_sun \u2192 that becomes ( (1e-5 nH_sun) * nH_sun ) / (1e-5) ) \u2192 (1e-5 * (nH_sun)^2 ) / 1e-5 \u2192 (nH_sun)^2 / 1 \u2192 nH_sun^2? That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up here. Let me re-express:\n\nnMg_2 = nMg_sun.\n\nBecause [Mg/H]_2=0 \u2192 nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun \u2192 nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH_2.\n\nBut nMg_sun = (nMg/nH)_sun * nH_sun \u2192 which is 1e-5 *nH_sun.\n\nSo, substituting into nMg_2:\n\nnMg_2 = (1e-5 *nH_sun / nH_sun) ) * nH_2 = 1e-5 * nH_2.\n\nBut since nMg_2 = nMg_sun, which is 1e-5 *nH_sun:\n\n1e-5 *nH_2 = 1e-5 *nH_sun \u2192 nH_2 =nH_sun.\n\nSo, both stars have the same number of H atoms as the Sun: nH_1 =nH_sun, nH_2= nH_sun.\n\nTherefore, (n_H,2 /n_H,1 )=1.\n\nSo, the ratio of silicon atoms is (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 )= (n_Si,1 /n_H,1) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) ) * (n_H,2 /n_H,1 ) \u2192 which simplifies to (n_Si,1 /n_H,1)/(n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) \u2192 which is 10^{0.6}\u22483.98.\n\nSo approximately 3.9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\n[Si/H]_1=0.3 \u2192 [Si/H]_1 = log(n_Si,1/n_H,1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) \u2192 0.3.\n\nSimilarly, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.\n\nSo, n_Si,1 = [Si_sun * 10^0.3], and n_Si,2 = [Si_sun *10^-0.3}.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, n_Si,1 = n_Si_sun *10^{0.3}.\n\nSimilarly, n_Si,2 =n_Si_sun *10^{-0.3}.\n\nSo, the ratio n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 = (10^{0.3} ) / (10^{-0.3}) ) =10^{0.6} \u22483.98.\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So the ratio is about 3.9, which is option A.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the relationships between logarithmic abundance ratios.\n\n### Key Data:\n1. **Star_1**:\n   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 \u2192 Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun.\n   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 \u2192 Si is 0.3 dex more abundant relative to Fe than in the Sun.\n\n2. **Star_2**:\n   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 \u2192 Mg abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun.\n   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 \u2192 Mg is 0.3 dex more abundant relative to Si than in the Sun.\n\n3. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:\n   - 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 \u2192 log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 \u2192 nFe/nH = 10\u207b\u2074.\u2075 \u2248 3.16 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075.\n   - 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 \u2192 log10(nMg/nH) = -5 \u2192 nMg/nH = 10\u207b\u2075.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate [Si/H] for Each Star\nUsing the relationship:\n\\[\n[X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H],\n\\]\nwhere [X/Y] is the logarithmic abundance ratio of element X to Y, and [Y/H] is the logarithmic abundance ratio of Y to H.\n\n- For **Star_1**:\n  \\[\n  [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.\n  \\]\n\n- For **Star_2**:\n  \\[\n  [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Mg/H]_2 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Relate Silicon Abundance to Hydrogen\nThe abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen in each star can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\log\\left(\\frac{n_{Si}}{n_H}\\right) = [Si/H] + \\log\\left(\\frac{n_{Si}}{n_H}\\right)_{\\odot}.\n\\]\n\nFor **Star_1**:\n\\[\n\\log\\left(\\frac{n_{Si,1}}{n_{H,1}}\\right) = 0.3 + \\log\\left(\\frac{n_{Si}}{n_H}\\right)_{\\odot}.\n\\]\n\nFor **Star_2**:\n\\[\n\\log\\left(\\frac{n_{Si,2}}{n_{H,2}}\\right) = -0.3 + \\log\\left(\\frac{n_{Si}}{n_H}\\right)_{\\odot}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Ratio of Silicon Atoms in Star_1 and Star_2\nThe ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is:\n\\[\n\\frac{n_{Si,1}}{n_{Si,2}} = \\frac{\\frac{n_{Si,1}}{n_{H,1}}}{\\frac{n_{Si,2}}{n_{H,2}}}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\(\\frac{n_{Si,1}}{n_{H,1}}\\) and \\(\\frac{n_{Si,2}}{n_{H,2}}\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{n_{Si,1}}{n_{Si,2}} = \\frac{10^{[Si/H]_1 + \\log\\left(\\frac{n_{Si}}{n_H}\\right)_{\\odot}}}{10^{[Si/H]_2 + \\log\\left(\\frac{n_{Si}}{n_H}\\right)_{\\odot}}}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n\\frac{n_{Si,1}}{n_{Si,2}} = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 = -0.3:\n\\[\n\\frac{n_{Si,1}}{n_{Si,2}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Final Ratio\n\\[\n10^{0.6} \\approx 3.98.\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**A) ~3.9**",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but let's see if I can work through this.\n\nSo the problem says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, does the mass matter here? The question is about elemental abundances, so maybe the mass doesn't play a direct role in the calculation. But perhaps it's just extra information. I'll keep that in mind but focus on the given abundances.\n\nThe given abundances are in terms of these [X/Y] notation, which I remember stands for the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of elements X and Y relative to the Sun. Oh right, the formula is [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's like a logarithmic abundance difference.\n\nThe data provided:\n- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex for Star_1\n- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star_2\n- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex for Star_1\n- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex for Star_2\n\nAnd the Sun's photospheric composition:\n- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 \u2192 So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 \u2192 nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)\n- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 \u2192 log(nMg/nH) = 7-12 = -5 \u2192 nMg/nH = 10^(-5)\n\nThe question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, we need to find (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) or (n_Si,2 / n_Si,1)? Wait, the question says \"ratio of silicon atoms\", so probably n_Si,1 / n_Si,2, I think. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nLet me break down each star's composition.\n\nStarting with Star_1:\n\nWe know [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe,nH)_sun = 0. So log(nFe,1 / nH,1) = log(nFe_sun / nH_sun). That means nFe,1 / nH,1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. Since for the Sun, nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5), then in Star_1, the same ratio holds. Wait, but what about the other elements? Because [Fe/H] is 0, which only tells us about the iron-to-hydrogen ratio. But for silicon, we have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So the [Si/Fe] ratio is 0.3 dex above solar.\n\nWait, no. [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So that means the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is higher than solar by 0.3 dex.\n\nWait, let's rephrase. [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 \u2192 log(n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1) - log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) = 0.3.\n\nBut we know from the Sun, nFe_sun = 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun. Similarly, n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun is another value.\n\nWait, maybe I should express this in terms of ratios relative to the Sun's ratios.\n\nFor Star_1:\n\nWe have [Fe/H]_1 = 0 \u2192 nFe,1/nH,1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.\n\nSo that's the same as solar ratio for Fe/H, which is 10^(-4.5) as before.\n\nNow, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 \u2192 log(n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1) = log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) + 0.3.\n\nBut n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun is (n_Si/nH, sun) / (n_Fe/nH, sun) ) = (n_Si/nH)_sun / (n_Fe/nH)_sun.\n\nWait, what's the solar n_Si/nH? I don't have that value. Hmm. Let me think. The problem gives us the Sun's Fe and Mg abundances but not Si. Oh, wait, I might need to calculate it.\n\nWait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio is given? No, wait the given data is [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 for Star_2. But for the Sun, no, the only given are for Fe and Mg.\n\nWait, I think I need to find n_Si for Star_1 and Star_2, then take their ratio.\n\nWait, but I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe] ratio. Hmm, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of H, Fe, and Mg, and then relate Si.\n\nLet me approach each star one by one.\n\nStarting with Star_1.\n\nStar_1 has [Fe/H] = 0 \u2192 n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 10^(-4.5). So n_Fe,1 = 10^(-4.5) * n_H,1.\n\nAlso, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 \u2192 log(n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1) = log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) + 0.3.\n\nBut we don't know n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun. Wait, but from the Sun's data, the given:\n\n12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 \u2192 log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 \u2192 nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.\n\nSimilarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) = 7 \u2192 log(nMg/nH) = -5 \u2192 nMg/nH = 1e-5.\n\nWait, but what about n_Si/nH for the Sun? I don't have that value given. Hmm. Unless I can calculate it based on the given [Mg/Si] ratio for Star_2. Wait, no\u2014Star_2's [Mg/Si] is 0.3, but that's about Star_2's abundance. The Sun's [Mg/Si] is not given.\n\nWait, but perhaps I don't need the Sun's [Mg/Si], because for Star_1, we only have [Si/Fe], and for Star_2, [Mg/Si]. So perhaps I can express n_Si in terms of n_Fe for Star_1, and in terms of n_Mg for Star_2.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFor Star_1:\n\nWe have [Fe/H]1 = 0 \u2192 n_Fe,1 /n_H,1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun = 10^(-4.5).\n\nWe also have [Si/Fe]1 = 0.3 \u2192 log(n_Si,1 /n_Fe,1) = log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) + 0.3.\n\nBut wait, n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) / (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) ) = (n_Si/nH)_sun / (n_Fe/nH)_sun.\n\nBut since (n_Fe/nH)_sun is 1e-4.5, and (n_Si/nH)_sun is unknown, perhaps I can denote it as x. So x = (n_Si/nH)_sun.\n\nThen, for Star_1:\n\nlog(n_Si,1/n_Fe,1) = log( (x * n_H_sun) / (1e-4.5 * n_H_sun) ) ) = log( x / 1e-4.5 )\n\nWait, wait, n_Si,1 = (n_Si/nH)_1 * n_H,1.\n\nSimilarly, n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe/nH)_1 * n_H,1.\n\nBut [Fe/H]_1 is 0 \u2192 (n_Fe/nH)_1 = (n_Fe/nH)_sun = 1e-4.5.\n\nSo n_Si,1 = x_1 * n_H,1.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me clarify. Let me define (n_Si/nH)_sun = x.\n\nSo, [Si/Fe]_1 = log( (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) / (n_Fe,1 / n_H,1) ) - log( (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) / (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) )\n\nWhich simplifies to log( (n_Si,1 /n_Fe,1) ) - log( (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) )\n\nWhich is 0.3.\n\nBut n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = 1e-4.5.\n\nSo n_Si,1 = (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) * 1e0.3 * (n_Fe,1)\n\nBecause:\n\nlog( n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1 ) = log( n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) + 0.3\n\nSo n_Si,1 /n_Fe,1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun )\n\nSo n_Si,1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) * n_Fe,1.\n\nBut n_Fe,1 = 1e-4.5 * n_H,1.\n\nSo n_Si,1 = 10^0.3 * (x) * (1e-4.5) * n_H,1.\n\nWait, x is (n_Si/nH)_sun, which is unknown. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think differently.\n\nSince [Fe/H]_1 is 0, Star_1's Fe/H is the same as the Sun. So n_Fe,1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H,1 /n_H_sun).\n\nBut without knowing the total H, but perhaps I can express everything in terms of H.\n\nLet me consider that Star_1's H is the same as the Sun's H multiplied by some factor. Wait, the [Fe/H] is 0, so the ratio of Fe to H is same as Sun. So n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H,1.\n\nSame for Star_1's n_Si,1: [Si/Fe] is 0.3, so (n_Si,1 /n_Fe,1) = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun )\n\nSo, n_Si,1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) * n_Fe,1.\n\nBut n_Fe,1 is (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H,1.\n\nSo n_Si,1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) * (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H,1.\n\nSimplify: n_Si,1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H,1.\n\nBut wait, n_Si_sun /n_H_sun is x, the solar silicon to hydrogen ratio. So n_Si,1 = 10^0.3 * x *n_H,1.\n\nSimilarly, for Star_1, the ratio of Si to H is x * 10^0.3.\n\nWait, but for the Sun, [Fe/H] is 0, but what about [Si/H] for the Sun? Don't know, but perhaps it's not needed.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find [Si/H] for Star_1.\n\nWait, [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 = 0 +0.3 \u2192 [Si/H]_1 =0.3.\n\nWhich means log(n_Si,1 /n_H,1) = log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) +0.3.\n\nSo, n_Si,1 = n_Si_sun * 10^0.3 * (n_H,1 /n_H_sun).\n\nSo, for Star_1, the silicon to hydrogen ratio is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.\n\nSimilarly, for Star_2:\n\nWe have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3.\n\nSo log(n_Mg,2 /n_Si,2 ) = log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) +0.3.\n\nAlso, [Mg/H]_2 =0 \u2192 log(n_Mg,2 /n_H,2 ) = log(n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) +0 \u2192 n_Mg,2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H,2 /n_H_sun).\n\nSo, let's plug that into the [Mg/Si] equation.\n\nlog( (n_Mg,2 /n_Si,2) ) = log( (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) ) +0.3.\n\nBut n_Mg,2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H,2 /n_H_sun ).\n\nSo,\n\nlog( [n_Mg_sun*(n_H,2 /n_H_sun ) ] / n_Si,2 ) = log( n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) +0.3.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nlog( (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) * (n_H,2 /n_H_sun ) / n_Si,2 )\n\n= log( n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) + log( n_H,2 / (n_H_sun * n_Si,2) )\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative approach is better.\n\nLet me rearrange [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.\n\nn_Mg,2 /n_Si,2 = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun )\n\nBut n_Mg,2 is known from [Mg/H]_2 =0.\n\nn_Mg,2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H,2 /n_H_sun )\n\nSo,\n\n( n_Mg_sun * (n_H,2 /n_H_sun ) ) / n_Si,2 = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun )\n\nDivide both sides by n_Mg_sun:\n\n(n_H,2 /n_H_sun ) / n_Si,2 = 10^0.3 / n_Si_sun.\n\nRearranged: n_Si,2 = (n_H,2 /n_H_sun ) * n_Si_sun / 10^0.3.\n\nSo, n_Si,2 = (n_Si_sun * n_H,2 ) / (n_H_sun * 10^0.3 )\n\nSimilarly, for Star_1, n_Si,1 = (n_Si_sun * n_H,1 ) * 10^0.3 /n_H_sun.\n\nWait, no. Wait, earlier we had for Star_1:\n\nn_Si,1 = 10^0.3 * x * n_H,1.\n\nBut x is n_Si_sun /n_H_sun.\n\nSo, n_Si,1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H,1.\n\nWhich can be written as n_Si,1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun * n_H,1 ) / n_H_sun.\n\nSimilarly, for Star_2, n_Si,2 = (n_Si_sun * n_H,2 ) / (n_H_sun *10^0.3 )\n\nSo, the ratio of n_Si,1 to n_Si,2 is:\n\n[n_Si,1 / n_Si,2] = [ (10^0.3 * n_Si_sun * n_H,1 ) / n_H_sun ] / [ (n_Si_sun * n_H,2 ) / (n_H_sun *10^0.3 ) ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [10^0.3 * n_H,1 * n_Si_sun * n_H_sun ] / [n_H_sun * n_Si_sun *n_H,2 ] * [10^0.3 /1 ]\n\nWait, let me do this step by step.\n\nNumerator: 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun * n_H,1) /n_H_sun.\n\nDenominator: (n_Si_sun * n_H,2 ) / (n_H_sun * 10^0.3 )\n\nSo,\n\nRatio = (10^0.3 * A) / (B ), where A= n_Si_sun n_H1 /n_H_sun, B = n_Si_sun n_H2/(n_H_sun 10^0.3 )\n\nSo,\n\nRatio = (10^0.3 * A ) / (B ) = (10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun n_H1 /n_H_sun) ) ) / ( (n_Si_sun n_H2/(n_H_sun 10^0.3 )) )\n\n= [10^0.3 * (n_H1) ] / [ (n_H2) / (10^0.3) ) ]\n\nBecause (n_Si_sun /n_Si_sun ) cancels, and (n_H_sun /n_H_sun ) cancels.\n\nSo,\n\n= [10^0.3 * n_H1 * 10^0.3 ] / n_H2.\n\n= (10^{0.3 + 0.3}) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )\n\n= 10^0.6 * (n_H1 /n_H2 )\n\nSo, the ratio is 10^0.6 multiplied by the ratio of the hydrogen in Star_1 to that in Star_2.\n\nBut wait, do we know anything about the hydrogen in each star? Not directly. But perhaps we can find the ratio of n_H1 to n_H2 in terms of other abundances.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that H is the same in both stars. No, that's probably not correct because stars can have different metallicities, but in this case, Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0, which is the same as the Sun. Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0, which would imply that Mg/H is same as Sun. Wait, let me think.\n\nWait, [Fe/H] =0 for Star_1: Fe/H is same as Sun.\n\n[Mg/H]=0 for Star_2: Mg/H same as Sun.\n\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean that H is the same in both stars. Because the total H abundance could vary, but the ratio to Mg (for Star_2) or Fe (for Star_1) is same as Sun.\n\nWait, but for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0 \u2192 n_Fe,1 /n_H,1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.\n\nSimilarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H] =0 \u2192 n_Mg,2 /n_H,2 =n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun.\n\nSo, for Star_1: n_H,1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_Fe,1 ) * n_H_sun.\n\nWait, n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H,1 \u2192 rearranged, n_H,1 = (n_Fe,1 * n_H_sun ) /n_Fe_sun.\n\nBut n_Fe,1 is the same as the Sun's n_Fe because [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So n_Fe,1 = n_Fe_sun.\n\nWait, no, because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means (n_Fe,1 /n_H,1) = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ), not that n_Fe,1 is same as n_Fe_sun.\n\nSo, perhaps n_H,1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_Fe,1 ) * n_H_sun.\n\nBut without knowing the actual numbers, this might not help.\n\nWait, perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun, but I don't think that's necessarily the case. The problem doesn't state that.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio of H in Star_1 and Star_2 can be found from their abundances.\n\nWait, let's think about the metallicity.\n\nWait, in Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, which implies that Fe and H are in the same ratio as the Sun. But total metallicity (like [M/H]) is [Fe/H] + the abundance of other metals relative to H. But since Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, but other elements may vary.\n\nWait, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars doesn't matter because the question is only about the ratio of Si, and that ratio depends on the other elements via the given abundances.\n\nWait, but in the ratio of n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 = (10^0.6) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )\n\nSo, the ratio depends on (n_H1 /n_H2 ).\n\nBut how can I find that? Because I don't have any information about H in either star beyond their ratios to Fe and Mg.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the total number of heavy elements (metals) is the same for both stars, but I don't think that's given either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio of H in each star is the same as the Sun, but that's an assumption.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps the ratio of H doesn't matter because in the ratio n_Si,1 /n_Si,2, the H terms will cancel out if we consider the ratio of both stars relative to the Sun.\n\nWait, let me try another approach.\n\nLet me express n_Si,1 and n_Si,2 in terms of the Sun's values.\n\nFor Star_1:\n\nn_Si,1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H,1 * 10^0.3.\n\nSimilarly, for Star_2:\n\nn_Si,2 = (n_Si_sun / (10^0.3 ) ) * (n_H,2 /n_H_sun )\n\nWait, no, earlier we had:\n\nn_Si,2 = (n_Si_sun * n_H,2 ) / (n_H_sun *10^0.3 )\n\nWhich can be written as (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * (n_H,2 /10^0.3 )\n\nSo,\n\nn_Si,2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * (n_H,2 ) /10^0.3.\n\nSo, the ratio n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 = [ (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H,1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * (n_H,2 ) / 10^0.3 ) ]\n\nSimplify: the (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) terms cancel, so:\n\n= (n_H,1 *10^0.3 ) / (n_H,2 /10^0.3 )\n\n= (n_H,1 /n_H,2 ) * 10^{0.3 + 0.3}.\n\n= (n_H,1 /n_H,2 ) * 10^0.6.\n\nSo the ratio is 10^0.6 times the ratio of H in Star_1 to H in Star_2.\n\nBut how do I find n_H,1 /n_H,2?\n\nWait, perhaps I can find the ratio using the given abundances for other elements.\n\nWait, Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0, so n_Fe,1 /n_H,1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun = 1e-4.5.\n\nStar_2 has [Mg/H] =0 \u2192 n_Mg,2 /n_H,2 = n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun =1e-5.\n\nBut I don't know the relation between n_H,1 and n_H,2.\n\nHmm. Maybe I can assume that the total number of hydrogen atoms is the same in both stars, but that's an assumption. The problem doesn't state that.\n\nWait, but without additional information, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that n_H,1 =n_H,2. That is, the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars.\n\nIf that's the case, then the ratio n_Si,1/n_Si,2 = 10^0.6.\n\nBecause (n_H1 /n_H2 ) =1, so the ratio is 10^0.6.\n\n10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, which is about 4. So option A is ~3.9.\n\nBut wait, is that the correct approach? Because the problem doesn't state anything about the hydrogen content of the stars. So perhaps I'm making an incorrect assumption here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a way to find the ratio of n_H,1 and n_H,2 from the given data.\n\nWait, perhaps the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] can give me the ratio.\n\nWait, [Fe/H]_1 =0 \u2192 n_Fe,1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H,1 /n_H_sun )\n\nSimilarly, [Mg/H]_2 =0 \u2192n_Mg,2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H,2 /n_H_sun )\n\nBut without knowing n_Fe,1 or n_Mg,2, I can't get the ratio of n_H,1 and n_H,2 unless I have more information.\n\nWait, but perhaps the mass of the stars can be used. The problem gives that Star_1 has mass 1.5 solar masses, Star_2 is 1.2 solar masses. But I don't know if that relates to their photospheric composition. Typically, more massive stars might have different abundances, but the problem says to assume LTE and use the EW method, which I think is about measuring the abundances, not the mass. So maybe the mass doesn't play a role here.\n\nUnless perhaps the problem is expecting to consider that the total number of atoms is the same, but I don't think that's a valid assumption.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Without knowing the ratio of H in the two stars, I can't compute the ratio of Si.\n\nWait, perhaps the way around this is to recognize that for Star_2, [Mg/Si] =0.3. So Mg is more abundant relative to Si in Star_2 than in the Sun. But how does that tie into the other data?\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the ratio of H in the two stars is the same as the ratio of Fe in Star_1 to Mg in Star_2. No, that probably doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me express n_Si,1 in terms of n_Fe,1 and n_Si_sun.\n\nn_Si,1 = n_Fe,1 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) * 10^0.3.\n\nSimilarly, for Star_2:\n\nn_Si,2 = n_Mg,2 * (n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun ) * 10^{-0.3}.\n\nBecause [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 \u2192 [Mg/Si] = log(n_Mg,2/n_Si,2 ) - log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun )=0.3 \u2192 n_Mg,2 /n_Si,2 = 10^{0.3} (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) \u2192 n_Si,2 =n_Mg,2 * (n_Si_sun / (n_Mg_sun *10^{0.3} )).\n\nBut n_Mg,2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H,2 /n_H_sun ) \u2192 because [Mg/H]_2 =0.\n\nSo,\n\nn_Si,2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H,2 /n_H_sun ) * (n_Si_sun / (n_Mg_sun *10^{0.3} )) = (n_Si_sun / (10^{0.3} )) ) * (n_H,2 /n_H_sun )\n\nSimilarly, for Star_1, n_Si,1 = n_Fe,1 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) * 10^{0.3}.\n\nBut n_Fe,1 =n_Fe_sun * (n_H,1 /n_H_sun )\n\nSo,\n\nn_Si,1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H,1 /n_H_sun ) * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) *10^{0.3} = (n_Si_sun *n_H,1 )/(n_H_sun ) *10^{0.3}.\n\nSo, the ratio n_Si,1/n_Si,2 = [ (n_Si_sun *n_H,1 *10^{0.3} )/(n_H_sun ) ] / [ (n_Si_sun *n_H,2 )/(n_H_sun *10^{0.3} ) ]\n\n= [ (n_H,1 *10^{0.3} ) ] / [ (n_H,2 )/(10^{0.3} ) ) ]\n\n= (n_H,1 /n_H,2 ) * 10^{0.6}.\n\nSo again, same result as before. So without knowing n_H,1 /n_H,2, I can't proceed.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find n_H,1 /n_H,2 from the stars' masses. Because more massive stars have higher luminosity, and perhaps more H? Or maybe not. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, the problem says 'photospheric composition' so maybe the H abundance is the same as the Sun in both stars. But then, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, implying that Fe/H is same as Sun. But if H is same as Sun, then n_Fe,1 =n_Fe_sun. Similarly, n_Mg,2 =n_Mg_sun.\n\nWait, but if H is the same as the Sun in both stars, then n_H,1 =n_H_sun and n_H,2 =n_H_sun.\n\nSo, the ratio n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 =10^0.6 * (n_H,1/n_H,2 ) =10^0.6 *1= ~3.98.\n\nSo the answer would be ~4, which is option A.\n\nBut let me double-check that assumption. If both stars have H same as the Sun, then yes. But the problem doesn't state that. So maybe that's not the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the ratio of Si in the two stars by linking their abundances through the Sun's ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the absolute abundances for each star, assuming H is the same as the Sun.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can find the ratio of H in the two stars using the given data.\n\nWait, since Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0, which implies n_Fe,1 /n_H,1 =n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.\n\nSo n_Fe,1 =n_Fe_sun * (n_H,1 /n_H_sun )\n\nSimilarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H] =0 \u2192 n_Mg,2 =n_Mg_sun * (n_H,2 /n_H_sun )\n\nBut I don't have any other information to relate n_H,1 and n_H,2.\n\nWait, perhaps considering that for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0 and for Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0, but there's no direct relation between H in the two stars.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Without additional information, I can't find the ratio of H in the two stars. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the H abundance is the same in both stars. If that's the case, then the ratio is 10^0.6, which is approximately 3.98 \u2192 option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier and the ratio is inverted.\n\nWait, wait. Let me re-express the ratio.\n\nWe have n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 = (n_Si,1 ) / (n_Si,2 )= [ (n_Si_sun *n_H,1 *10^{0.3} )/(n_H_sun ) ] / [ (n_Si_sun * n_H,2 )/(n_H_sun *10^{0.3} ) ]\n\n= [n_H,1 *10^{0.3} ] / [n_H,2 /10^{0.3} ]\n\n= (n_H,1 /n_H,2 ) *10^{0.6}.\n\nWait, but if H is the same in both stars, then n_H,1 =n_H,2 \u2192 ratio is 10^0.6.\n\nWhich is approximately 3.98, so ~4.\n\nBut looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.\n\nSo the answer would be A.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the logarithmic abundance notation. The key steps are as follows:\n\n### Given Data:\n1. **Star_1**:\n   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex\n   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex\n   - [Fe/H] = 0 implies that the Fe/H ratio in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun, i.e., \\( n_{\\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\\text{H,1}} = n_{\\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\\text{H,sun}} \\).\n\n2. **Star_2**:\n   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex\n   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex\n   - [Mg/H] = 0 implies that the Mg/H ratio in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun, i.e., \\( n_{\\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\\text{H,2}} = n_{\\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\\text{H,sun}} \\).\n\n3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:\n   - \\( 12 + \\log_{10}(n_{\\text{Fe}} / n_{\\text{H}}) = 7.5 \\) \u2192 \\( \\log_{10}(n_{\\text{Fe}} / n_{\\text{H}}) = -4.5 \\), so \\( n_{\\text{Fe}} / n_{\\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \\).\n   - \\( 12 + \\log_{10}(n_{\\text{Mg}} / n_{\\text{H}}) = 7 \\) \u2192 \\( \\log_{10}(n_{\\text{Mg}} / n_{\\text{H}}) = -5 \\), so \\( n_{\\text{Mg}} / n_{\\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \\).\n\n### Key Relationships:\n1.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.\n\nSo there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I don't think the masses matter directly for this problem, but maybe they're a distractor or maybe they come into play in another way. The question is about the elemental abundances, so I'll focus on that.\n\nThe data given is about their elemental ratios using the EW method, which I remember stands for Equivalent Width. But I'm not exactly sure how that ties into calculating the ratios, but perhaps the key is in the [X/Y] notation.\n\nThe values given are:\n- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex\n- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex\n- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex\n- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex\n\nAnd the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:\n- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 \u2192 So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 \u2192 nFe/nH = 10^-4.5\n- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 \u2192 log10(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 \u2192 nMg/nH=10^-5\n\nWait, but in the Sun, the number ratios are given. So for the Sun, nFe = 1e-4.5 * nH and nMg =1e-5 *nH. But wait, I may need the number densities to compute the ratios for the stars.\n\nThe question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So [Si/Star_1] over [Si/Star_2], or the ratio of Si in each star compared to each other?\n\nWait, the question says 'the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.' So maybe [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], which would give (n_Si1 / n_H1) / (n_Si2 / n_H2) \u2192 (n_Si1/n_Si2) * (n_H2/n_H1). But wait, because if they're both in solar units, perhaps the H is the same, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the H is the same in both stars as per their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but let me think.\n\nWait, the [Fe/H] is given for each star. [Fe/H]_1 is 0 dex, which means [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0 \u2192 so nFe/nH for Star_1 is same as solar, which is 1e-4.5.\n\nSimilarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so Star_2's Mg/H is same as solar.\n\nNow, what about the other elements? Let's see:\n\nFor Star_1:\n[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 \u2192 [Si/Fe] = log(n_Si/n_Fe) - log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun =0.3.\n\nWait, no. The [X/Y] notation is usually defined as log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3, which would mean log(n_Si1/(n_Fe1)) ) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) )=0.3.\n\nBut since n_Fe1/n_H1 = same as Sun because [Fe/H]_1 is 0 \u2192 n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun) )\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express each element's ratio relative to hydrogen.\n\nLet me think. For Star 1, [Fe/H] =0 \u2192 so the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun) ) \u2192 assuming H is same number density as Sun? Or wait, [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) \u2212 log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) ) =0 \u2192 so log(n_Fe1/n_H1) \u2212 log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) )=0 \u2192 which implies log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) \u2192 so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun \u2192 so Fe abundance is same as Sun.\n\nSimilarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 \u2192 Mg abundance same as Sun.\n\nBut wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe] =0.3 \u2192 which is log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) \u2212 log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) )=0.3. Since n_Fe1/n_H1 = same as Sun, so n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun). But n_Si1 is what we're looking for.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to express all the element abundances in terms of H.\n\nLet me first write down the expressions.\n\nFor Star_1:\n\n[Fe/H]_1=0 \u2192 log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) \u2192 so n_Fe1/n_H1 = (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) \u2192 let's denote this as solar ratio.\n\nSimilarly, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 \u2192 log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) +0.3.\n\nBut n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 /n_H_sun) because [Fe/H] is 0: n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun \u2192 so n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) * n_H1.\n\nSo, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 \u2192 log(n_Si1/(n_Fe1)) = log( (n_Si_sun/(n_Fe_sun)) ) + 0.3.\n\nSubstituting n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) * n_H1.\n\nSo, n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) ) * 10^{0.3}.\n\nWait, no: because log(a/b) = log(a) - log(b) \u2192 [Si/Fe] = log(n_Si/n_Fe) \u2212 log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) ) =0.3 \u2192 so log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) +0.3 \u2192 so n_Si1 = n_Fe1 \u00d7 (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) \u00d7 10^{0.3}.\n\nBut n_Fe1 is (n_Fe_sun) \u00d7 (n_H1/n_H_sun).\n\nSo substituting, n_Si1 = (n_Fe_sun \u00d7 n_H1/n_H_sun) \u00d7 (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) ) \u00d710^{0.3}.\n\nSimplify: n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun) \u00d7 (n_H1/n_H_sun) \u00d7 10^{0.3}.\n\nAlternatively, n_Si1 = n_Si_sun \u00d7 (n_H1/n_H_sun) \u00d7 10^{0.3}.\n\nWhich can be written as: n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) \u00d7 10^{0.3}.\n\nSo [Si/H]_1 = log(n_Si1/n_H1) \u2212 log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) = 0.3.\n\nBecause 10^{0.3} is about 2, so [Si/H]_1 would be 0.3, meaning Si is 2x more abundant relative to H than in the Sun.\n\nWait, but in the question, we don't have [Si/H] given directly; we have [Si/Fe], but through [Fe/H] being 0, we can get [Si/H].\n\nSo for Star_1, [Si/H] is 0.3. So the ratio of Si to H is higher than solar.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute for Star_2.\n\nStar_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 \u2192 log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) \u2212 log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) )=0.3.\n\nAnd [Mg/H]_2=0 \u2192 log(n_Mg2/n_H2) \u2212 log(n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) )=0 \u2192 so n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.\n\nSo, log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) = log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) +0.3 \u2192 n_Mg2/n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) \u00d710^{0.3}.\n\nBut n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun \u00d7 (n_H2/n_H_sun) \u2192 because [Mg/H]_2 is 0.\n\nSo: n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H2/n_H_sun).\n\nPutting into equation:\n\nn_Mg2/n_Si2 = [n_Mg_sun * (n_H2/n_H_sun)] / n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) \u00d710^{0.3}.\n\nSo,\n\nn_Si2 = [n_Mg_sun * (n_H2/n_H_sun) ] / [ (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) \u00d710^{0.3} ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nn_Si2 = [n_Mg_sun * n_H2 /n_H_sun ] / [ (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) \u00d710^{0.3} ) ]\n\nThe n_Mg_sun cancels out:\n\nn_Si2 = [n_H2/n_H_sun ] * (n_Si_sun) / (10^{0.3}) )\n\nSo,\n\nn_Si2 = (n_Si_sun) * (n_H2/n_H_sun) /10^{0.3}\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nn_Si2/n_H2 = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) /10^{0.3} \u2192 So [Si/H]_2 = log(n_Si2/n_H2) - log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) ) = log(1/10^{0.3} ) = -0.3.\n\nSo Star_2 has [Si/H] = -0.3 \u2192 which means lower Si abundance relative to H than the Sun.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2, so n_Si1 / n_Si2.\n\nWait, but each star's Si abundance is relative to their own H. So I think the ratio would be (n_Si1 / n_H1) / (n_Si2 / n_H2) ) \u2192 but wait, that's [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2, which is 0.3 - (-0.3) =0.6 \u2192 which would be log of the ratio, so the ratio is 10^0.6 \u22483.98, which is about 4.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is ~3.9. So that seems to be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because both stars could have different H abundances. Wait, but [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are 0, meaning their H is same as solar? Or does [Fe/H] being 0 mean that Fe is same as solar, but H could vary? No, wait, [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) relative to solar. So if [Fe/H] is 0, then n_Fe/n_H is the same as solar. But that doesn't say anything about the overall H abundance in the star. Wait, but in the Sun, n_H is a certain value, but in the star, H could be more or less. But if their [Fe/H] is 0, it means that the ratio n_Fe/n_H in Star 1 is same as in Sun. So for Star 1, n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun).\n\nWait, but in the question, the Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 \u2192 which gives nFe/nH =1e-4.5.\n\nBut for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 \u2192 nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun \u2192 so nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH1.\n\nSimilarly, for H in Star_1, nH1 is the same as in the Sun? Or can vary. Hmm, but perhaps in this problem, H is assumed to be the same as the Sun? Or perhaps not. Wait, but the problem says \"photospheric composition for the Sun\" as given. So the Sun's nH is a known value, but the stars' nH could be different.\n\nBut wait, when calculating the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Si in Star_2, the H in each star will affect their [Si/H], but perhaps when we take the ratio of the two [Si/H], the H cancels out. Let me think.\n\nWait, the ratio of Si atoms would be (n_Si1 / n_H1) / (n_Si2 /n_H2) ) = (n_Si1/n_Si2) * (n_H2/n_H1).\n\nBut from earlier, we have:\n\nn_Si1 = (n_Si_sun) * (n_H1 /n_H_sun) *10^{0.3}.\n\nn_Si2 = (n_Si_sun) * (n_H2 /n_H_sun) /10^{0.3}.\n\nSo, the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2) = [ (n_Si_sun * (n_H1/n_H_sun)*10^0.3) ] / [ (n_Si_sun * (n_H2/n_H_sun) /10^0.3) ) ]\n\nSimplify: = [ (n_H1/n_H_sun) *10^0.3 ] / [ (n_H2/n_H_sun) /10^0.3 ] \u2192 (n_H1/n_H2) * (10^0.3 * 10^0.3) \u2192 (n_H1/n_H2) * 10^{0.6}.\n\nAnd then multiply by (n_H2/n_H1) from before:\n\nSo the overall ratio is (n_Si1/n_Si2) * (n_H2/n_H1) ) = [ (n_H1/n_H2) *10^{0.6} ) ] * (n_H2/n_H1) ) \u2192 10^{0.6} = approx 3.98.\n\nSo the ratio of Si atoms is about 4, which matches option A.\n\nWait, but why does the H terms cancel out? Because in each star, the H can be different, but when you compute the ratio of the two [Si/H], the H cancels. Hmm, but in this calculation, it's not exactly [Si/H], but the actual number densities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumption is that the H abundance is the same in both stars as the Sun, but I don't think that's the case. Let me think again.\n\nWait, for Star 1, [Fe/H] is 0, which means that Fe is same as Sun relative to H. But that doesn't mean that H is same as Sun. Because if the star has more H, but more Fe, but in such a way that their ratio is same as Sun. So the H could be higher or lower.\n\nBut in our earlier calculation, when we did the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2) * (n_H2/n_H1), the H terms would cancel only if (n_H1/n_H2) is 1. But in the problem, the H abundance in each star is not given. Wait, but the question gives [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] as 0, which don't directly provide the H abundance. Hmm, perhaps there's another way.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that for [Fe/H]_1 =0, it tells us that the star has the same Fe abundance relative to H as the Sun. So n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) * n_H1.\n\nSimilarly, for the Sun, n_Fe_sun = (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) * n_H_sun.\n\nBut perhaps the total H in the star is the same as the Sun? No, the problem doesn't state that. Hmm. So in this case, perhaps we can't know the actual number of H atoms, but when taking the ratio of the two stars' Si/H, the H cancels.\n\nWait, because for each star, [Si/H] is known. For Star_1, [Si/H] =0.3, and for Star_2, [Si/H] =-0.3.\n\nSo the ratio of their [Si/H] is 0.3 - (-0.3) =0.6, so 10^0.6 \u22483.98 \u2192 so the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Star_2 is ~3.98, which is option A.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the [X/Y] notation, which represents the logarithmic ratio of the number densities of two elements relative to their solar values. The key steps are as follows:\n\n### Star_1:\n- **[Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex**: This means the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun, i.e., \\( n_{\\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\\text{H,1}} = n_{\\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\\text{H,sun}} \\).\n- **[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex**: Using the definition of [X/Y], we have:\n  \\[\n  \\log\\left(\\frac{n_{\\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\\text{Fe,1}}}\\right) - \\log\\left(\\frac{n_{\\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\\text{Fe,sun}}}\\right) = 0.3.\n  \\]\n  Substituting \\( n_{\\text{Fe,1}} = n_{\\text{Fe,sun}} \\cdot (n_{\\text{H,1}} / n_{\\text{H,sun}}) \\), we find:\n  \\[\n  n_{\\text{Si,1}} = n_{\\text{Si,sun}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{n_{\\text{H,1}}}{n_{\\text{H,sun}}}\\right) \\cdot 10^{0.3}.\n  \\]\n  Thus, the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio for Star_1 is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{n_{\\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\\text{H,1}}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\\text{H,sun}}} \\cdot 10^{0.3}.\n  \\]\n  This implies:\n  \\[\n  [\\text{Si/H}]_1 = 0.3.\n  \\]\n\n### Star_2:\n- **[Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex**: This means the Mg abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun, i.e., \\( n_{\\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\\text{H,2}} = n_{\\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\\text{H,sun}} \\).\n- **[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex**: Using the definition of [X/Y], we have:\n  \\[\n  \\log\\left(\\frac{n_{\\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\\text{Si,2}}}\\right) - \\log\\left(\\frac{n_{\\text{Mg,sun}}}{n_{\\text{Si,sun}}}\\right) = 0.3.\n  \\]\n  Substituting \\( n_{\\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\\text{Mg,sun}} \\cdot (n_{\\text{H,2}} / n_{\\text{H,sun}}) \\), we find:\n  \\[\n  n_{\\text{Si,2}} = n_{\\text{Si,sun}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{n_{\\text{H,2}}}{n_{\\text{H,sun}}}\\right) \\cdot 10^{-0.3}.\n  \\]\n  Thus, the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio for Star_2 is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{n_{\\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\\text{H,2}}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\\text{H,sun}}} \\cdot 10^{-0.3}.\n  \\]\n  This implies:\n  \\[\n  [\\text{Si/H}]_2 = -0.3.\n  \\]\n\n### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:\nThe ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{n_{\\text{Si,1}} / n_{\\text{H,1}}}{n_{\\text{Si,2}} / n_{\\text{H,2}}} = \\frac{[\\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\\text{Si/H}]_2}{\\log_{10}} = 10^{[\\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\\text{Si/H}]_2}.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( [\\text{Si/H}]_1 = 0.3 \\) and \\( [\\text{Si/H}]_2 = -0.3 \\), we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{n_{\\text{Si,1}} / n_{\\text{H,1}}}{n_{\\text{Si,2}} / n_{\\text{H,2}}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.\n\\]\nApproximating \\( 10^{0.6} \\approx 3.98 \\), the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**A) ~3.9**",
