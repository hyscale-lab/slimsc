      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nThe question gives me some phase shifts: \u03b4\u2080 = 90\u00b0, \u03b4\u2081 = 67\u00b0, \u03b4\u2082 =55\u00b0, \u03b4\u2083=30\u00b0, and \u03b4\u2084=13\u00b0. And the rest are ignored. The electrons are 50 MeV. I'm supposed to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.\n\nWait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(\u03b8) has real and imaginary parts, and it's related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the formula for f(\u03b8) is the sum over l of ( (2l+1)/(2k) ) * (e^{i\u03b4_l} - 1) * P_l(cos\u03b8), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. But wait, the problem is specifically asking for the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is \u03b8 = 0\u00b0, right?\n\nSo when \u03b8 is 0\u00b0, cos\u03b8 is 1. The Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l, I think. Because P_0(1) = 1, P_1(1)=1, P_2(1)=1 as well. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, no: P_l(1) is always 1. Because for any l, P_l(1) = 1. Because the Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 are 1. So that simplifies things.\n\nSo the scattering amplitude f(0) would be the sum over l of ( (2l+1)/(2k) ) * [ e^{i\u03b4_l} -1 ] * 1.\n\nBut I'm only concerned with the imaginary part. So let's compute Im(f(0)).\n\nEach term in the sum contributes to the imaginary part. So for each l, the term is (2l+1)/(2k) multiplied by the imaginary part of (e^{i\u03b4_l} -1).\n\nWhat's the imaginary part of e^{i\u03b4} -1? Let me calculate that. e^{i\u03b4} is cos \u03b4 + i sin \u03b4. So e^{i\u03b4} -1 = (cos \u03b4 -1) + i sin \u03b4. The imaginary part is sin \u03b4.\n\nSo each term's contribution to Im(f(0)) is (2l+1)/(2k) * sin \u03b4_l.\n\nSo Im(f(0)) = sum over l [ (2l+1)/(2k) * sin \u03b4_l ]\n\nWait, but what are the values of k here? k is the wave number. The electrons have an energy of 50 MeV. Oh, right, electrons are light, so relativistic effects might matter, but perhaps for this problem, we can use non-relativistic expressions. Wait, but wait, 50 MeV is much higher than the rest mass of an electron, which is about 0.511 MeV. So relativistic effects are significant. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE) / \u0127, but in the relativistic case, the energy E is much larger than the rest mass, so maybe E \u2248 pc, so p \u2248 sqrt(m\u00b2c^4 + p\u00b2c\u00b2) \u2192 but for high energy, E \u2248 pc. So k = p/(\u0127) = (sqrt(2mE)) / \u0127 ? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, let's think in terms of units. The scattering amplitude f is usually given in units of inverse length, often in fm (femtometers), since 1 fm is 1e-15 meters.\n\nThe formula for k is k = sqrt(2mE) / \u0127, but that's non-relativistic. Since E is 50 MeV, which is much bigger than the rest mass (0.511 MeV), perhaps the relativistic expression is better.\n\nWait, the relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). For E >> m c^2, E \u2248 pc. So p \u2248 E/(c).\n\nBut then k = p/(\u0127) = (E/(c)) / \u0127. Hmm, but E here is in MeV. Let me compute this properly.\n\nWait, units. Let me make sure I get the units right. Let's convert E into Joules. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 50 MeV is 50e6 eV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J \u2248 8.01e-13 J.\n\nBut the mass of the electron is m = 9.11e-31 kg. So mE is 9.11e-31 kg * 8.01e-13 J = 9.11e-31 * 8.01e-13 = approx 7.3e-43 kg\u00b2 m\u00b2/s\u00b2. Hmm, but taking the square root would give k in m^{-1}.\n\nWait, maybe I should use natural units where \u0127 = c = 1. That might make the calculations easier.\n\nIn natural units, \u0127 = 1, c = 1. Then E (in MeV) can be converted into units of inverse length. Since 1 eV^{-1} is about 1.973e-16 meters. So 1 MeV^{-1} is about 1.973e-16 m * (1/1e6) = 1.973e-22 m.\n\nWait, but in natural units, E (in MeV) is equivalent to E (MeV) * (1.973e-16 m)^{-1} )... Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nActually, in natural units, E (in eV) is related to wavelength \u03bb by E \u2248 12400 / \u03bb (in eV\u00b7nm). So for E in eV, \u03bb in nm is about 12400 / E. So 1 eV corresponds to about 12400 nm, which is 12.4 microns.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to compute k in terms of E. Since E = (\u0127 c) * sqrt(k\u00b2 + (m c / \u0127 )^2 ), right? Because E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. And p = \u0127 k. So E\u00b2 = (\u0127 c k )^2 + (m c\u00b2 )^2.\n\nBut for 50 MeV electrons, which is much higher than their rest mass, E \u2248 \u0127 c k. So k \u2248 E/(\u0127 c).\n\nSo let me compute k. E is 50 MeV. Let me convert E into Joules. 50 MeV = 50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 8.01e-13 J.\n\n\u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. c is 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo k \u2248 E/(\u0127 c) = (8.01e-13 J) / (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s * 3e8 m/s) )\n\nWait, calculating denominator: 1.0545718e-34 * 3e8 = 3.1637e-26 J\u00b7m.\n\nSo k = 8.01e-13 / 3.1637e-26 \u2248 approximately 2.53e+13 m^-1.\n\nWait, but 2.53e13 m^-1 is 2.53e13 inverse meters. Converting that to inverse femtometers (since 1 m = 1e15 fm), so 2.53e13 m^-1 = 2.53e13 / 1e15 fm^-1 = 2.53e-2 fm^-1. Wait, that can't be right because 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 1 m is 1e15 fm, so 1 m^-1 is 1e-15 fm^-1.\n\nWait, let me compute it again. 1 m is 1e15 fm, so 1 m^-1 is 1e-15 fm^-1.\n\nSo 2.53e13 m^-1 = 2.53e13 * 1e-15 fm^-1 = 2.53e-2 fm^-1.\n\nWait, but that seems small. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, let's compute the denominator: 1.0545718e-34 (J\u00b7s) * 3e8 m/s = 3.1637e-26 J\u00b7m.\n\nE is 8.01e-13 J.\n\nSo k = E/(\u0127 c) = (8.01e-13) / (3.1637e-26) \u2248 (8.01 / 3.1637) * 1e13.\n\n8 divided by 3.16 is about 2.53, so 2.53e13 m^-1.\n\nYes, same as before. So k \u2248 2.53e13 m^-1, which is 2.53e-2 fm^-1.\n\nWait, but why so small? Wait, 1/fm is 1e15 m^-1. So 2.53e13 m^-1 = 2.53e13 / (1e15) fm^-1 = 2.53e-2 fm^-1. Hmm, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, that seems counterintuitive because higher energy electrons should have a smaller wavelength, which would correspond to a higher k (since k is inversely proportional to wavelength). Wait, no, k is 2pi divided by wavelength, right? So higher energy (shorter wavelength) would give higher k. So 50 MeV electrons would have a much higher k value. So 2.53e-2 fm^-1 sounds too low. Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic formula more accurately. Because for high energies, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), but when E >> m c\u00b2, E \u2248 pc. So p \u2248 E / c.\n\nAnd since k = p/(\u0127), k = E/(\u0127 c).\n\nWait, let's recompute E in Joules. 50 MeV is 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.\n\n\u0127 c is 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s * 3e8 m/s = 3.1637e-26 J\u00b7m.\n\nSo k = E/(\u0127 c) = (8.01e-13 J) / (3.1637e-26 J\u00b7m) ) = (8.01/3.1637) * 1e13 m^-1 \u2248 2.53e13 m^-1.\n\nWhich is 2.53e13 m^-1.\n\nWait, but another approach: using the relation between energy and wavelength. The de Broglie wavelength \u03bb = h / p. For high energy, p \u2248 E/c, so \u03bb = h c / E.\n\nh is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. c is 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo \u03bb = (6.626e-34 Js)(3e8 m/s) / (8.01e-13 J) ) = (1.9878e-25) / (8.01e-13) ) \u2248 2.48e-13 meters, which is 2.48e-13 m = 0.248 femtometers (since 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 0.248e-15 m is 0.248 fm). So \u03bb is ~0.25 fm, so k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb \u2248 2*3.14/0.25 fm \u2192 around 25 fm^-1.\n\nWait, that's a big difference. What's going on here?\n\nWait, I think I messed up the calculation earlier. Let's recompute the de Broglie wavelength.\n\nWait, \u03bb = h c / E.\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nc =3e8 m/s.\n\nE is 50 MeV, which is 50e6 eV. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.\n\nSo \u03bb = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (8.01e-13) ) = (1.9878e-25) / (8.01e-13) ) \u2248 2.48e-13 meters = 0.248e-15 meters, which is 0.248 femtometers. So \u03bb \u2248 0.248 fm.\n\nThen, k = 2\u03c0 / \u03bb \u2248 2 * 3.1416 / 0.248 fm \u2248 6.2832 / 0.248 \u2248 25.33 fm^-1.\n\nAh, okay, so earlier I must have made a mistake in the calculation. So k \u2248 25.33 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, so before I thought k was about 2.53e-2 fm^-1, but that's wrong. The correct approach is using the de Broglie wavelength, which gives k around 25 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo, I think the correct k is approximately 25.33 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, but why did the initial approach give me 2.53e-2 fm^-1? Because I think I messed up the units in that calculation. Let me try to recompute k using SI units.\n\nk = E/(\u0127 c)\n\nE = 50 MeV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.\n\n\u0127 = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nc = 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo \u0127 c = 1.0545718e-34 * 3e8 = 3.1637e-26 J\u00b7m.\n\nSo k = (8.01e-13 J) / (3.1637e-26 J\u00b7m) ) = 8.01e-13 / 3.1637e-26 = (8.01 / 3.1637) * 1e13 m\u207b\u00b9 \u2248 2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. But using the wavelength method, we get k \u2248 25.33 fm\u207b\u00b9, which is about 2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9. Oh, because 1 fm = 1e-15 m, so 1 fm\u207b\u00b9 = 1e15 m\u207b\u00b9. So 25.33 fm\u207b\u00b9 is 25.33e15 m\u207b\u00b9. Wait, but that's way larger than 2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9. So I'm getting conflicting results here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, I'm making a mistake in unit conversion.\n\nWhen I compute k from E = \u0127 c k, so k = E/(\u0127 c).\n\nE is 8.01e-13 J.\n\n\u0127 c is 3.1637e-26 J\u00b7m.\n\nSo k = (8.01e-13) / (3.1637e-26) = approx 2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nBut 1 m\u207b\u00b9 is 1e15 fm\u207b\u00b9. So 2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9 = 2.53e13 * 1e15 fm\u207b\u00b9 = 2.53e28 fm\u207b\u00b9, which is way too high.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So where's the mistake?\n\nWait, no, wait. 1 m\u207b\u00b9 is 1e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9. Because 1 m = 1e15 fm \u2192 1 m\u207b\u00b9 = (1e15 fm )\u207b\u00b9 = 1e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo 2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9 = 2.53e13 * 1e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9 = 2.53e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nBut earlier, using the wavelength method, I got k \u224825.33 fm\u207b\u00b9. So which is correct?\n\nWait, I think I messed up the wavelength method.\n\nWait, the de Broglie wavelength \u03bb = h / p.\n\np = \u0127 k.\n\nE = sqrt( (p c )^2 + (m c^2 )^2 )\n\nSo for E >> m c\u00b2, E \u2248 p c \u2192 p \u2248 E/(c).\n\nThus, \u03bb = h c / E.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo for E =50 MeV,\n\n\u03bb = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s * 3e8 m/s ) / (8.01e-13 J) = (1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m) / (8.01e-13 J) ) \u2248 2.48e-13 meters \u2192 which is 0.248e-15 meters = 0.248 femtometers.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.248 fm.\n\nk = 2\u03c0 / \u03bb \u2248 2 *3.1416 / 0.248 \u2248 25.33 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo that's correct. So why did the other approach give me 2.53e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9?\n\nBecause when I compute E/(\u0127 c) in SI units, I get 2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9, which is 2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9 * (1e15 fm/m)\u207b\u00b9 \u2192 2.53e13 * 1e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9 = 2.53e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWhich contradicts the wavelength approach. So which is correct?\n\nAh, wait, I think the mistake is in the assumption that E = \u0127 c k. For relativistic particles, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 ), and p = \u0127 k.\n\nSo for E in the relativistic case, when E >> m c\u00b2, E \u2248 pc \u2248 \u0127 c k \u2192 k \u2248 E/(\u0127 c).\n\nSo in that case, k is E/(\u0127 c) \u2192 which is 2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9, which is 2.53e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nBut the wavelength approach gives k around 25 fm\u207b\u00b9. There's a discrepancy here. So I must be making a mistake in one of the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the de Broglie wavelength. Because the de Broglie wavelength is \u03bb = h / p, and p is not just E/c, but for relativistic particles, p = E/c when E >> m c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let's compute using the exact formula.\n\nE = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 )\n\nSo p = sqrt( (E^2 c^2 - m\u00b2 c^4) ) / c\u00b2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should compute p more accurately.\n\nE = 50 MeV. m c\u00b2 is 0.511 MeV.\n\nSo (E)^2 = (50)^2 (MeV)^2 = 2500 (MeV)^2.\n\n(m c\u00b2)^2 = (0.511)^2 \u2248 0.261 (MeV)^2.\n\nSo E\u00b2 c\u00b2 = (50)^2 * (c)^2 (MeV)^2.\n\nWait, but in terms of units, perhaps it's easier to compute p in MeV/c units.\n\np (MeV/c) = sqrt( (E (MeV))^2 - (m c^2 (MeV))^2 ) ) / c\u00b2 * c.\n\nWait, perhaps better to write p = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c.\n\nIn units where c=1, E is in MeV, m c\u00b2 is 0.511 MeV.\n\nSo p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) \u2248 50 MeV/c.\n\nSo p \u224850 MeV/c.\n\nThen, using \u03bb = h / p.\n\nh is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nBut to express h in units of MeV\u00b7s, because p is in MeV/c, and c is in m/s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute \u03bb in terms of MeV and c.\n\nWait, let me think: 1 MeV = 1.602e-13 J.\n\nSo, p =50 MeV/c = (50 * 1.602e-13 J) / (3e8 m/s) ) = 50 * 1.602e-13 / 3e8 = approx 2.67e-15 J\u00b7s/m.\n\nThen, \u03bb = h / p = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s) / (2.67e-15 J\u00b7s/m) ) = approx 2.48e-19 m = 0.248 fm.\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.248 fm \u2192 k = 2\u03c0 / \u03bb \u2248 25.33 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo that's the same as the wavelength method.\n\nBut according to the other approach, k = E/(\u0127 c) \u2192 2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9 \u2192 2.53e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nThis is a big discrepancy. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute E/(\u0127 c) again.\n\nE =50 MeV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.\n\n\u0127 =1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nc=3e8 m/s.\n\nSo \u0127 c = 1.0545718e-34 *3e8 = 3.1637e-26 J\u00b7m.\n\nSo k = E/(\u0127 c) = (8.01e-13 J) / (3.1637e-26 J\u00b7m) ) = approximately 2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWhich is 2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9. Now, converting to fm\u207b\u00b9: 1 m\u207b\u00b9 = 1e15 (fm\u207b\u00b9), so 2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9 = 2.53e13 * 1e15 fm\u207b\u00b9 \u2192 2.53e28 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, that's impossible. That can't be right because the wavelength approach gives 25 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nAh, I see the mistake now. Oh wait, I think I confused the exponents.\n\nWait, 1 m\u207b\u00b9 = 1e15 fm\u207b\u00b9. So 2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9 = 2.53e13 * 1e15 fm\u207b\u00b9 = 2.53e28 fm\u207b\u00b9. Which is way too large, but that can't be correct. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach using E = \u0127 c k is only valid in natural units where \u0127 = c =1.\n\nWait, in natural units, E = \u0127 c k \u2192 k = E/(\u0127 c). But in real units, it's not correct because E isn't just \u0127 c k when E is relativistic.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the exact relativistic relation.\n\nE\u00b2 = (p c)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2.\n\nAnd p = \u0127 k.\n\nSo,\n\nE\u00b2 = ( \u0127 k c )^2 + (m c^2 )^2.\n\nSo,\n\nk = sqrt( (E/(c))^2 - (m c )^2 ) / \u0127.\n\nWait, but for E=50 MeV, which is much larger than m c\u00b2=0.511 MeV, so (m c)^2 is negligible. So,\n\nk \u2248 E/(c \u0127) = (50 MeV) / (c \u0127).\n\nBut wait, 50 MeV is energy, so in terms of units, perhaps it's better to compute in terms of inverse meters.\n\nWait, but perhaps using the relation between energy and wavenumber:\n\nk = sqrt( (E/(\u0127 c))^2 - (m c/(\u0127))^2 )\n\nWhich, for E >> m c\u00b2, simplifies to k \u2248 E/(\u0127 c).\n\nBut in that case, k = (50e6 eV) / (\u0127 c).\n\nBecause 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.\n\nSo, 50e6 eV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should compute in terms of eV and use the relation that k (in inverse meters) = E (in eV) * 1.973e-7 m eV^{-1}.\n\nWait, I remember that 1 eV^{-1} is approximately 1.973e-7 meters. So, for E in eV, k (m\u207b\u00b9) \u2248 E (eV) * 1.973e-7 m eV^{-1}.\n\nSo, for E =50 MeV =50e6 eV,\n\nk \u224850e6 * 1.973e-7 m eV^{-1} = 50e6 * 1.973e-7 = 50 * 0.1973 = approx 9.865 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, that's a much more reasonable value.\n\nWait, but wait. 1 eV^{-1} is 1.973e-7 m. So, the conversion factor is 1.973e-7 m per eV^{-1}.\n\nSo, if E is in eV, then k (in m\u207b\u00b9) is (E eV) * (1 eV^{-1} )^{-1} ) \u2192 wait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is k (m\u207b\u00b9) = E (eV) * 1.973e-7 m eV^{-1}.\n\nSo,\n\nk = 50e6 eV * 1.973e-7 m/eV = 50e6 * 1.973e-7 = 50 * 0.1973 = 9.865 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWhich is about 9.865 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, but that's still in m\u207b\u00b9. Converting to fm\u207b\u00b9, since 1 m\u207b\u00b9 is 1e15 fm\u207b\u00b9,\n\nk \u22489.865e15 fm\u207b\u00b9 \u2192 9.865e15 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, that's way larger than the 25.33 fm\u207b\u00b9 we got from the wavelength method. So now I'm really confused.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe I should just use the given phase shifts and compute the sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the imaginary part of f(0) is the sum over l of (2l+1)/(2k) * sin \u03b4_l.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck on calculating k correctly. Let me see if I can find another approach.\n\nWait, another approach: the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin(2\u03b4_l) )? No, wait, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, I'm really getting stuck on the k calculation. Let me look for a way to compute k in terms of MeV.\n\nI found this formula online (but since I can't access the internet, I'll have to recall): in nuclear physics, the wave number k can be written as k = (2mE)^\u00bd / \u0127, but that's non-relativistic. But when E is much larger than m c\u00b2, the relativistic formula might be better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the relativistic expression is used, and k is given by k = (E) / (\u0127 c).\n\nWait, but then using E=50 MeV, which is 50e6 eV.\n\n1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.\n\nSo E =50e6 * 1.602e-19 J =8.01e-13 J.\n\n\u0127 = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nc =3e8 m/s.\n\nSo k = E/(\u0127 c) = (8.01e-13 J) / (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s *3e8 m/s) ) = 8.01e-13 / (3.1637e-26 J\u00b7m) ) \u22482.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWhich is 2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9 = 2.53e13 *1e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9 = 2.53e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nBut that's conflicting with the previous results. I'm getting stuck here, but perhaps I should proceed with this value.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the non-relativistic formula for k, which is k = sqrt(2mE)/(\u0127). Let's try that.\n\nE is 50 MeV, which is 50e6 eV =8.01e-13 J.\n\nm is the electron mass, 9.11e-31 kg.\n\nSo non-relativistic k = sqrt(2mE) / \u0127.\n\nCompute 2mE: 2 *9.11e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J = 2*9.11e-31 *8.01e-13 = let's compute 9.11e-31 *8.01e-13 = approx 7.3e-43 kg\u00b7J.\n\nBut J is kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2, so 2mE has units kg\u00b2\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2.\n\nWait, taking the square root: sqrt(2mE) has units kg\u00b7m/s.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(2mE) = sqrt(7.3e-43 kg\u00b2 m\u00b2/s\u00b2 ) = sqrt(7.3e-43) kg m/s \u2248 8.54e-22 kg m/s.\n\n\u0127 is 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s =1.0545718e-34 kg m\u00b2/s.\n\nSo k = (8.54e-22 kg m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 kg m\u00b2/s ) ) \u2192 units: (kg m/s) / (kg m\u00b2/s) ) \u2192 1/m.\n\nSo,\n\nk = (8.54e-22) / (1.0545718e-34 ) \u2248 8.1e12 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWhich is 8.1e12 m\u207b\u00b9 \u2192 8.1e12 *1e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9 \u2192 8.1e-3 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nHmm, that's even smaller than the relativistic calculation.\n\nBut I'm really not confident about this. Maybe the problem expects me to use a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should proceed with the sum and see which option matches.\n\nThe phase shifts given are \u03b4\u2080=90\u00b0, \u03b4\u2081=67\u00b0, \u03b4\u2082=55\u00b0, \u03b4\u2083=30\u00b0, \u03b4\u2084=13\u00b0.\n\nSo, the imaginary part is sum over l=0 to 4 of (2l+1)/(2k) * sin \u03b4_l.\n\nSo, compute each term:\n\nFor l=0: (2*0+1)/(2k) * sin(90\u00b0) = (1)/(2k) * 1.\n\nl=1: (3)/(2k) * sin67\u00b0 \u2192 sin67\u22480.9205.\n\nl=2: 5/(2k) * sin55 \u2192 sin55\u22480.8192.\n\nl=3:7/(2k) * sin30 \u2192 sin30=0.5.\n\nl=4:9/(2k) * sin13 \u2192 sin13\u22480.2249.\n\nSo, sum all terms:\n\n(1 + 3*0.9205 +5*0.8192 +7*0.5 +9*0.2249 ) / (2k).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n1 + 3*0.9205=1 +2.7615=3.7615\n\n5*0.8192=4.096 \u2192 3.7615+4.096=7.8575\n\n7*0.5=3.5 \u2192 7.8575+3.5=11.3575\n\n9*0.2249\u22482.0241 \u2192 11.3575+2.0241\u224813.3816.\n\nSo numerator\u224813.3816.\n\nThus, sum = 13.3816 / (2k) \u2192 13.3816/(2k) = 6.6908/k.\n\nSo, Im(f(0)) = 6.6908/k.\n\nNow, if I can find k in correct units, I can compute this.\n\nWait, but I'm stuck on computing k correctly. So perhaps I should try the first approach where k=25.33 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nIf k=25.33 fm\u207b\u00b9,\n\nIm(f(0))=6.6908 /25.33 \u22480.2642 fm.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm. That's way larger than 0.26 fm. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the formula is (2l+1)/(2k) * sin \u03b4_l, but I should sum all these terms and then multiply by 1/(2k) ?\n\nWait, no, the sum is sum [ (2l+1)/(2k) * sin \u03b4_l ].\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that I'm using k in fm\u207b\u00b9, but in the formula, k is in 1/m. So perhaps the calculation of k in 1/m is correct, but then when calculating 1/k, I have to convert it to fm.\n\nBecause 1/k (if k is in m\u207b\u00b9) is in meters, which is 1e15 fm. So if k=2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9,\n\n1/k = 1/(2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9) = (1/2.53e13) m = 3.95e-14 m = 3.95e-14 m *1e15 fm/m = 39.5 fm.\n\nSo,\n\nIm(f(0)) = 6.6908 * (1/k) = 6.6908 *39.5 fm \u2248 264 fm.\n\nWait, that's way higher than the options given. The options are 87163, 355, 177, 251.\n\nSo 264 isn't among them.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.\n\nLet me try using k from the wavelength approach, which gave k\u224825.33 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo 1/k = 1/25.33 fm\u207b\u00b9 \u22480.0395 fm.\n\nSo Im(f(0))=6.6908 *0.0395 fm \u22480.263 fm.\n\nWhich again doesn't match any options.\n\nWait, perhaps the units are messed up again. Because the formula for f is in terms of inverse length, but perhaps I'm missing a factor.\n\nWait, another thought. The scattering amplitude f is given in units of barns (1 barn=1e-24 cm\u00b2), but in this case, the options are in fm, which is 1e-15 m.\n\nWait, but f has units of length (since it's a scattering amplitude). So the options are given in fm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic expression and a different approach to calculate k.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the relation k = (E) / (\u0127 c).\n\nE is 50 MeV =50e6 eV.\n\nBut 1 eV =1.602e-19 J.\n\nSo E=50e6 *1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.\n\n\u0127 c=1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s *3e8 m/s=3.1637e-26 J\u00b7m.\n\nSo k=8.01e-13 /3.1637e-26=2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWhich is 2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9 =2.53e13 *1e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9 =2.53e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo 1/k=1/(2.53e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9) )= (1/0.0253) fm \u224839.525 fm.\n\nSo Im(f(0))=6.6908 *39.525 fm \u2248264.1 fm.\n\nBut the options are all lower than that. The highest is 87163 fm, which is way larger.\n\nHmm... Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l. But wait, the imaginary part would be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula includes a factor of 2 in the denominator. Let me check.\n\nThe formula for f(\u03b8) is f(\u03b8)=sum [ (2l+1)/(2k) ) (e^{i \u03b4_l} -1) P_l(cos\u03b8) ]\n\nSo, the imaginary part is sum [ (2l+1)/(2k) sin \u03b4_l P_l(1) ].\n\nSince P_l(1)=1, it's sum [ (2l+1)/(2k) sin \u03b4_l ].\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should multiply by 1e15 because k is in 1/m, and 1/k is in meters, which is 1e15 fm.\n\nWait, let me recalculate.\n\nIf k=2.53e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9,\n\nthen 1/k is 1/(2.53e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9) ) = approx 39.525 fm.\n\nSo,\n\nIm(f(0))= (sum terms) * (1/(2k)).\n\nWait, sum terms were 13.3816/(2k)=6.6908/k.\n\nSo,\n\n6.6908 / k =6.6908 *39.525 fm \u2248264.1 fm.\n\nAgain, this doesn't match any of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the sum.\n\nLet me recompute the sum.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nl=0: (1)/(2k) * sin90 = (1)/(2k) *1 = 1/(2k).\n\nl=1: 3/(2k) * sin67 \u2192 3/(2k) *0.9205.\n\nl=2:5/(2k) * sin55 \u21925/(2k)*0.8192.\n\nl=3:7/(2k) *0.5 \u21927/(2k)*0.5.\n\nl=4:9/(2k)*sin13 \u21929/(2k)*0.2249.\n\nSo, summing all terms:\n\n= [1 +3*0.9205 +5*0.8192 +7*0.5 +9*0.2249 ]/(2k).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n1 =1.\n\n3 *0.9205=2.7615.\n\n5 *0.8192=4.096.\n\n7 *0.5=3.5.\n\n9 *0.2249\u22482.0241.\n\nSumming all:\n\n1 +2.7615=3.7615.\n\n+4.096\u21927.8575.\n\n+3.5\u219211.3575.\n\n+2.0241\u219213.3816.\n\nSo sum=13.3816.\n\nThus,\n\nIm(f(0))=13.3816/(2k) =6.6908/k.\n\nNow, if k=2.53e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9,\n\n1/k=39.525 fm.\n\nSo,\n\nIm(f(0))=6.6908 *39.525 \u2248264.1 fm.\n\nBut the options don't have this. The closest option is D)251.271 fm. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations.\n\nLet me compute sin(67), sin55, sin30, sin13 accurately.\n\nsin67 \u22480.92050485345.\n\nsin55\u22480.81915204428.\n\nsin30=0.5.\n\nsin13\u22480.2249510543.\n\nSo,\n\nl=0: 1 *1/(2k) =1/(2k).\n\nl=1: 3 *0.92050485345/(2k) =2.76151456035/(2k).\n\nl=2:5 *0.81915204428/(2k)=4.0957602214/(2k).\n\nl=3:7 *0.5/(2k)=3.5/(2k).\n\nl=4:9 *0.2249510543/(2k)=2.0245594887/(2k).\n\nNow, summing these:\n\n1 +2.76151456035 =3.76151456035.\n\n+4.0957602214=7.85727478175.\n\n+3.5=11.35727478175.\n\n+2.0245594887=13.38183427045.\n\nSo,\n\nsum =13.3818342705.\n\nSo,\n\nIm(f(0)) =13.3818342705/(2k) =6.69091713525/k.\n\nNow, with k=2.53e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9,\n\nIm(f(0))=6.69091713525/(2.53e-2 fm\u207b\u00b9) )=6.69091713525 /0.0253 \u2248264.35 fm.\n\nHmm, but the options don't have 264.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct value of k is larger. Because earlier the wavelength approach gave k\u224825.33 fm\u207b\u00b9, which would make 1/k=0.0395 fm, leading to Im(f(0))=0.263 fm. That's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation of k.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that the wave number k in the formula is in units of inverse fermi (fm\u207b\u00b9), not meters.\n\nWait, if k is given in fm\u207b\u00b9, then the calculation would be different.\n\nBut how do I compute k in fm\u207b\u00b9 units?\n\nWait, perhaps using the relation k (fm\u207b\u00b9) = E (MeV) * (1.973e-3 fm MeV\u207b\u00b9 )^{-1}.\n\nWait, I think I remember a relation where 1 fm\u207b\u00b9 \u2248 1.973 MeV.\n\nBecause 1 fm = 1e-15 m.\n\nSo,\n\n1 fm\u207b\u00b9 = 1e15 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nIn terms of energy, E = \u0127 c k.\n\nSo, E = \u0127 c * k.\n\nIf k is in fm\u207b\u00b9,\n\n\u0127 c = 197.3 MeV fm.\n\nSo,\n\nE (MeV) = 197.3 MeV fm * k (fm\u207b\u00b9).\n\nSo,\n\nk (fm\u207b\u00b9) = E (MeV) / 197.3 MeV fm.\n\nSo,\n\nk =50 MeV / 197.3 MeV fm =50 /197.3 \u22480.2535 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo, k\u22480.2535 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, that makes more sense.\n\nSo, with k=0.2535 fm\u207b\u00b9,\n\nIm(f(0))=6.69091713525 / (2*0.2535) fm.\n\nCompute denominator: 2*0.2535=0.507.\n\nSo,\n\nIm(f(0))=6.69091713525 /0.507 \u224813.19 fm.\n\nBut that's still not matching any options.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Because if E=\u0127 c k,\n\nthen k= E/(\u0127 c).\n\nBut with \u0127 c=197.3 MeV fm,\n\nso k=50 MeV / (197.3 MeV fm ) \u2192 50/197.3 \u22480.2535 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo Im(f(0))=6.69091713525 / (2*0.2535) \u224813.19 fm.\n\nBut again, none of the options match.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about the phase shifts.\n\nWait, perhaps the imaginary part is calculated as (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i \u03b4_l} -1.\n\nWait, but no, the imaginary part is sum (2l+1)/(2k) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using the sum over l=0 to l=4, but the rest are ignored, implying that l=0 to 4 are the only terms, and higher l are zero.\n\nSo perhaps the sum is correct as computed.\n\nBut then why the options are all in the hundreds or thousands of fm?\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that the formula for Im(f(0)) is sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l / (2k), but k is in 1/fm.\n\nWait, if k is 0.2535 fm\u207b\u00b9,\n\nthen 1/(2k) =1/(2*0.2535) fm =1/(0.507) fm\u22481.972 fm.\n\nSo,\n\nIm(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l * 1.972 fm.\n\nWhich would be:\n\n13.3818342705 *1.972 fm \u224826.43 fm.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l/(2k), with k in 1/fm.\n\nSo, with k=0.2535 fm\u207b\u00b9,\n\nsum=13.3818342705.\n\nSo,\n\n13.3818342705/(2*0.2535) =13.3818342705/0.507\u224826.43 fm.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate Im(f(0)) as (sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l )/(2k).\n\nBut with k=0.2535 fm\u207b\u00b9,\n\nIm(f(0))=13.3818342705/(2*0.2535) fm\u224826.43 fm.\n\nBut no option matches.\n\nWait, perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians.\n\nWait, the problem states the phase shifts are in degrees. So I've assumed degrees, but perhaps I should have used radians.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. Let me try.\n\nBecause when computing sin \u03b4_l, if \u03b4 is in radians, the values will be different.\n\nSo, if I mistakenly took \u03b4 in degrees, the actual \u03b4 should be converted to radians.\n\nSo, let me recompute the sines with \u03b4 in radians.\n\nCompute each \u03b4 in radians:\n\n\u03b40=90\u00b0 \u2192 \u03c0/2 \u22481.5708 rad. sin(1.5708)=1.\n\n\u03b41=67\u00b0 \u2192 67 * \u03c0/180 \u22481.16937 rad. sin(1.16937)=approx 0.9165.\n\n\u03b42=55\u00b0 \u219255 * \u03c0/180\u22480.95993 rad. sin\u22480.8192.\n\n\u03b43=30\u21920.5236 rad. sin=0.5.\n\n\u03b44=13\u21920.2269 rad. sin\u22480.2258.\n\nSo,\n\nl=0:1 *1/(2k).\n\nl=1:3 *0.9165/(2k).\n\nl=2:5 *0.8192/(2k).\n\nl=3:7 *0.5/(2k).\n\nl=4:9 *0.2258/(2k).\n\nCompute sum:\n\n1 =1.\n\n3 *0.9165=2.7495.\n\n5 *0.8192=4.096.\n\n7 *0.5=3.5.\n\n9 *0.2258\u22482.0322.\n\nSum:\n\n1 +2.7495=3.7495.\n\n+4.096=7.8455.\n\n+3.5=11.3455.\n\n+2.0322=13.3777.\n\nSo sum=13.3777.\n\nThus, Im(f(0))=13.3777/(2k).\n\nNow, with k=0.2535 fm\u207b\u00b9,\n\nIm(f(0))=13.3777/(2*0.2535) \u2192 13.3777/0.507\u224826.40 fm.\n\nStill, no match with the options.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects the use of the non-relativistic formula for k.\n\nSo, using non-relativistic k= sqrt(2mE)/(\u0127).\n\nE=50 MeV=8.01e-13 J.\n\nm=9.11e-31 kg.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(2mE)=sqrt(2*9.11e-31 *8.01e-13 )=sqrt(1.458e-43 )= approx 3.82e-22 kg m/s.\n\n\u0127=1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo,\n\nk=3.82e-22 /1.0545718e-34 \u22483.62e12 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWhich is 3.62e12 m\u207b\u00b9=3.62e12 *1e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9=3.62e-3 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo,\n\n1/k=1/(3.62e-3 fm\u207b\u00b9)=276.2 fm.\n\nThus,\n\nIm(f(0))=6.69091713525 *276.2 fm\u22481847 fm.\n\nNo, that's way beyond the options.\n\nHmm, I'm really stuck here. Perhaps I should try to use the options to reverse-engineer.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 355.351 fm, D is 251.271 fm.\n\nIf I compute Im(f(0))=sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l / (2k), and set it equal to one of these options, perhaps I can find the correct k.\n\nAssume option D:251.271 fm.\n\nSo,\n\n251.271 fm = sum/(2k) \u2192 2k= sum / Im \u2192 2k=13.381834 /251.271 \u2192 2k\u22480.05326 fm\u207b\u00b9 \u2192k\u22480.02663 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nBut earlier, using E=50 MeV, I found k\u22480.2535 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWhich is much larger than 0.0266 fm\u207b\u00b9. So that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the formula again. Could it be that the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l ) * (1/(2k)) ?\n\nIn that case, if sum is 13.38, and 1/(2k)=Im,\n\nthen Im=13.38/(2k).\n\nIf Im is 177.675 fm (option C), then 177.675=13.38/(2k) \u2192 2k=13.38/177.675 \u21922k\u22480.0753 fm\u207b\u00b9 \u2192k\u22480.03765 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWhich is much smaller than the calculated k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = [sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l ] * (1/k).\n\nIn that case, 177.675=13.38/(k) \u2192k=13.38/177.675\u22480.0753 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWhich would imply a much smaller k than calculated.\n\nI'm really not sure. Perhaps I should give up and make an educated guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute each term as (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l and then multiply by (1/(2k)).\n\nBut without knowing k accurately, it's hard.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using k in fm\u207b\u00b9, but in the formula, k is in m\u207b\u00b9, so when I compute 1/k, I need to convert it to fm.\n\nBecause 1 fm=1e-15 m \u2192 1 m=1e15 fm.\n\nSo, if k is in m\u207b\u00b9, then 1/k is in m, which is 1e15 fm.\n\nSo, if k=2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9,\n\n1/k=1/(2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9 )= (1/2.53e13) m =3.95e-14 m=3.95e-14 *1e15 fm=39.5 fm.\n\nSo,\n\nIm(f(0))=6.6908 *39.5 fm\u2248264 fm.\n\nBut none of the options match.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I forgot to include the factor of 1/(2k) correctly.\n\nWait, the formula is sum (2l+1)/(2k) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nSo, factor is 1/(2k).\n\nSo, if k=2.53e13 m\u207b\u00b9,\n\nthen 1/(2k)=1/(5.06e13 m\u207b\u00b9)=1.976e-14 m=1.976e-14 *1e15 fm=1.976 fm.\n\nSo,\n\nIm(f(0))=13.381834 *1.976 fm \u224826.43 fm.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute using the relativistic expression for k in terms of MeV.\n\nWait, another approach: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nBut perhaps for electrons, the mass is considered, leading to a different k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin \u03b4_l.\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try using k=1.97e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9, which is 1.97e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, but that's 1.97e-15 fm\u207b\u00b9=1.97e-15 *1e15 m\u207b\u00b9=1.97e-0 m\u207b\u00b9, which is not correct.\n\nI'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess. The options are A)87163, B)355, C)177, D)251. From earlier, when I calculated 264, which is close to option D (251), perhaps due to rounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is 251, so the answer is D.\n\n\nTo calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Im}(f(0)) = \\frac{1}{2k} \\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \\sin \\delta_l\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute the sum of terms\nThe given phase shifts are \\(\\delta_0 = 90^\\circ\\), \\(\\delta_1 = 67^\\circ\\), \\(\\delta_2 = 55^\\circ\\), \\(\\delta_3 = 30^\\circ\\), and \\(\\delta_4 = 13^\\circ\\).
