      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question is about three exoplanets\u2014Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're in a system with circular orbits, and they were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not too sure about that; maybe I don't need to know exactly how they were discovered for this problem.\n\nSo, the key data given here are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The problem is asking about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. The options are various factors, like 10.4, 3.2, etc.\n\nLet me jot down the given information:\n\n- Ratio of equilibrium temperatures:\n  - Planet1 to Planet2: approximately 1.4 (so T1/T2 \u2248 1.4)\n  - Planet2 to Planet3: approximately 2.3 (so T2/T3 \u2248 2.3)\n  \n- Ratio of masses:\n  - Planet1 to Planet2: approximately 1.15 (M1/M2 \u2248 1.15)\n  - Planet2 to Planet3: approximately 1.35 (M2/M3 \u2248 1.35)\n  \nAlbedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth. So, similar reflectivity, which probably means the same albedo in the equilibrium temperature formula.\n\nThe question is, by what factor is Planet3's orbital period larger than Planet1's? So, I need to find P3 / P1.\n\nI remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by a formula. The formula I think is something like:\n\nTe = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 D\u00b2) ]^(1/4)\n\nWait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think again. The equilibrium temperature is based on the star's luminosity, the distance from the star (D), the planet's albedo (a), and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (\u03c3). The formula I recall is:\n\nTe = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 \u03c0 D\u00b2 \u03c3) ]^(1/4)\n\nYes, that sounds right. Because the planet absorbs energy from the star, which is spread out over its cross-sectional area (\u03c0 R\u00b2, but then the planet emits from its entire surface area, 4\u03c0 R\u00b2, hence the 1/4 factor, but in the formula, it's represented as 16 pi somewhere... I might get that mixed up. Alternatively, another version I've seen is:\n\nTe = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (4 \u03c0 D\u00b2 \u03c3) ]^(1/4) * (1/4)^(1/4)? Hmm, no, maybe not. Let me clarify. Wait, the energy received per unit area (like per square meter) is L/(4\u03c0 D\u00b2), right? The planet's cross-section is \u03c0 R\u00b2 and it receives that, but then it emits from the entire surface, 4\u03c0 R\u00b2. So the energy balance equation is:\n\nIncoming energy = Outgoing energy.\n\nIncoming is L/(4\u03c0 D\u00b2) * (1 - a) * \u03c0 R\u00b2, because the cross-section area is \u03c0 R\u00b2.\n\nOutgoing is 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 * \u03c3 Te^4.\n\nSetting them equal:\n\nL/(4\u03c0 D\u00b2) * (1 - a) * \u03c0 R\u00b2 = 4 \u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 Te^4\n\nSimplify:\n\nL (1 - a) / (4 \u03c0 D\u00b2) * \u03c0 = 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 Te^4\n\nThe \u03c0 cancels: L (1 - a) / (4 D\u00b2) = 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 Te^4\n\nSo, solving for Te:\n\nTe^4 = L (1 - a) / (16 \u03c0 D\u00b2 \u03c3)\n\nThen,\n\nTe = [ L (1 - a) / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 D\u00b2) ]^(1/4)\n\nSo that's correct. So the equilibrium temperature depends on the fourth root of the luminosity, the square root of the distance, and so on.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, the albedo (a) is given as 0.3 for all three planets, so that term is the same for all. So when comparing the temperatures of the planets, the a will cancel out.\n\nWait, but L is the star's luminosity, which is the same for all three planets, since they're orbiting the same star. So L, a, and \u03c3 are the same for all three. So when we take the ratio of their temperatures, the L, a, and \u03c3 terms will cancel out.\n\nThe only variable in the equilibrium temperature formula for each planet is D, the distance from the star. So the equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets will depend on the inverse square of their distances.\n\nLet me think: for two planets, planet A and planet B,\n\nTeA / TeB = [ (D_B / D_A )^2 ]^(1/4) = (D_B / D_A )^(1/2 )\n\nSo the ratio of their temperatures is the square root of the inverse of the distance ratio.\n\nSo, T_A / T_B = sqrt( D_B / D_A )\n\nBecause Te is proportional to (1/D)^0.5.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Because the formula is Te proportional to (1/D)^(1/2). So if planet A is closer (smaller D), it's hotter.\n\nSo, from the problem, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So T1 / T2 \u2248 1.4.\n\nUsing the above, T1 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )\n\nSo, 1.4 \u2248 sqrt( D2 / D1 )\n\nSquaring both sides: (1.4)^2 = D2/D1 \u2192 1.96 = D2/D1 \u2192 D2 = 1.96 D1.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014no, that's not correct. Because T1 is the temperature of Planet1, which is closer or farther?\n\nWait, let's clarify: if Planet1 is closer to the star than Planet2, then Planet1 has a higher temperature than Planet2. Because being closer means higher Te.\n\nIn our case, T1/T2 is 1.4, so T1 is hotter than T2. So Planet1 is closer to the star than Planet2. So D1 < D2.\n\nSo from the formula:\n\nT1 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )\n\nSo 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1) \u2192 Squaring: 1.96 = D2/D1 \u2192 D2 = 1.96 D1.\n\nThen, the ratio of the distance between Planet2 and Planet1 is 1.96.\n\nSimilarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3.\n\nSo T2 / T3 = 2.3.\n\nUsing the same formula: T2 / T3 = sqrt( D3 / D2 )\n\nSo 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2) \u2192 Squaring: 5.29 = D3/D2 \u2192 D3 = 5.29 D2.\n\nNow, substituting D2 = 1.96 D1:\n\nD3 = 5.29 * 1.96 D1.\n\nCalculating 5.29 * 1.96:\n\nLet me compute that. 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 *1.96 is approx 0.5684. So total is about 9.8 + 0.5684 = 10.3684. So D3 \u2248 10.3684 D1.\n\nSo the distance of Planet3 is about 10.368 times that of Planet1.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the orbital period. So how does the distance from the star relate to the orbital period?\n\nI remember Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star) divided by the mass of the star. Wait, but in our case, all three planets are orbiting the same star, so the mass term is the same for all. So for a star of mass M, Kepler's law is:\n\nP^2 \u221d D^3 / M\n\nBut since M is the same for all, P^2 \u221d D^3.\n\nSo, P is proportional to D^(3/2).\n\nSo, for any two planets, P2/P1 = (D2/D1)^(3/2).\n\nWe can use that to find the ratio P3/P1.\n\nBecause we know D3 = 10.3684 D1.\n\nSo, P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).\n\nLet me compute 10.3684^(3/2).\n\nFirst, take the square root of 10.3684:\n\n\u221a10.3684 \u2248 3.22.\n\nThen, raise that to the third power: 3.22^3.\n\n3.22 * 3.22 = approx 10.3684. Then 10.3684 *3.22 \u2248 let's see:\n\n10 *3.22 =32.2, 0.3684 *3.22 \u22481.187. So total approx 33.387.\n\nWait, but wait, it's (10.3684)^(1.5) = sqrt(10.3684) * (10.3684)\n\nWait, no. a^(3/2) is a * sqrt(a). So 10.3684 * sqrt(10.3684) \u2248 10.3684 *3.22 \u2248.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, that's approximately 33.387.\n\nSo P3/P1 is approximately 33.4. So the period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times larger than Planet1.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check. Because Kepler's third law in the context of planets around a star is:\n\nP^2 = (4 \u03c0^2 / (G M)) * a^3.\n\nSo, yes, P^2 \u221d a^3, with M being the mass of the star. So for the same star, P is proportional to a^(3/2).\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Because in our case, the problem is giving me the mass ratios between the planets. I'm not sure if that comes into play here.\n\nWait, the problem gives the mass ratios between Planet1 and Planet2 (M1/M2 \u22481.15) and Planet2 and Planet3 (M2/M3\u22481.35). So, M1 is about 15% more massive than M2, and M2 is about 35% more massive than M3.\n\nBut wait, in Kepler's third law, the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass. So when calculating the orbital period, the planet's mass doesn't significantly affect the period. So for our purposes, the planet's masses don't matter, because the star's mass dominates. So the mass ratios given in the problem are probably a red herring. They probably don't affect the orbital period, which depends only on the distance from the star and the star's mass.\n\nSo, I think I was correct before; the mass ratios don't come into play here. So the period ratio is solely determined by the distances.\n\nSo, then, according to my earlier calculation, P3 is about 33.4 times P1, which would correspond to option D) ~33.4.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations I did earlier.\n\nFrom T1/T2 = 1.4, so 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1) \u2192 D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \u2192 D2 =1.96 D1.\n\nFrom T2/T3=2.3 \u2192 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2) \u2192 (2.3)^2 = D3/D2 \u2192 5.29 = D3/D2 \u2192 D3=5.29 * D2.\n\nSubstituting D2=1.96 D1, D3=5.29 *1.96 D1 \u2192 5.29 *1.96= approx 10.3684 D1.\n\nSo yes, D3 is about 10.3684 times D1.\n\nNow, P is proportional to a^(3/2), where a is the semi-major axis (distance from star). So P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).\n\nAs calculated, (10.3684)^(3/2) \u224833.387.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 33.4. Looking at the options, D is ~33.4. So the correct answer is D.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because another option is ~3.2 (option B). Maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck the steps.\n\nWait, another way to approach this: Let's compute the ratios step by step.\n\nFirst, find D2 in terms of D1.\n\nT1/T2 =1.4 \u2192 sqrt(D2/D1)=1.4 \u2192 D2 = (1.4)^2 D1 = 1.96 D1.\n\nThen, T2/T3=2.3 \u2192 sqrt(D3/D2)=2.3 \u2192 D3= (2.3)^2 D2 =5.29 D2.\n\nSubstituting D2=1.96 D1, D3=5.29 *1.96 D1=10.3684 D1.\n\nSo D3 is about 10.3684 times D1. Now, the period is proportional to D^(3/2), so:\n\nP3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).\n\nCompute 10.3684^(3/2):\n\nFirst, sqrt(10.3684)=3.22.\n\nThen, 3.22^3.\n\n3.22 *3.22 =10.3684.\n\n10.3684 *3.22 = let's compute:\n\n10 *3.22 =32.2.\n\n0.3684 *3.22 \u2248 1.187.\n\nSo 32.2 +1.187=33.387.\n\nSo approximately 33.4. So option D is correct.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15. So M1/M2=1.15. Does that affect the period?\n\nIn Kepler's third law, the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass, so, no. The period only depends on the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. So the planet masses don't influence the period. So the mass ratios given are probably a distraction. Unless the problem is considering something else, like TTV method, which uses the gravitational interactions between the planets. But I think for the purposes of this question, which is about the equilibrium temperature and orbital period, the planet masses don't come into play.\n\nSo, the answer should be option D, ~33.4.\n\n\nTo determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply relevant physical principles.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratios**:\n   - \\( T_1 / T_2 \\approx 1.4 \\)\n   - \\( T_2 / T_3 \\approx 2.3 \\)\n\n2. **Mass Ratios**:\n   - \\( M_1 / M_2 \\approx 1.15 \\)\n   - \\( M_2 / M_3 \\approx 1.35 \\)\n\n3. **Albedo**:\n   - Albedo \\( a = 0.3 \\) for all planets.\n\n4. **Orbital Period Relationship**:\n   - From Kepler's Third Law: \\( P^2 \\propto D^3 \\), where \\( D \\) is the distance from the star.

From \\( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \\):\n   \\[\n   1.4 = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_2}{D_1}} \\implies \\frac{D_2}{D_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \\implies D_2 = 1.96 D_1\n   \\]\n\n2. From \\( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \\):\n   \\[\n   2.3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_3}{D_2}} \\implies \\frac{D_3}{D_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \\implies D_3 = 5.29 D_2\n   \\]\n\n3. Substitute \\( D_2 = 1.96 D_1 \\) into \\( D_3 = 5.29 D_2 \\):\n   \\[\n   D_3 = 5.29 \\times 1.96 D_1 = 10.3684 D_1\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Orbital Period Ratio\nFrom Kepler's Third Law, \\( P \\propto D^{3/2} \\).

Compute \\( \\sqrt{10.3684} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{10.3684} \\approx 3.22\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute \\( (10.3684)^{3/2} = 10.3684 \\times 3.22 \\):\n   \\[\n   10.3684 \\times 3.22 \\approx 33.4\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. The mass ratios are irrelevant to the orbital period calculation, as the planet masses are negligible compared to the star's mass in Kepler's Third Law.\n\n**Final Answer**: D) ~33.4",
