      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. It's about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. I remember that stability constants (\u03b2) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the \u03b2, the more the complex is favored.\n\nThe question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D, which are percentages.\n\nAlright, let's break down the problem. We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. Wait, I should note that \u03b21 probably refers to the first complex, \u03b22 the second, etc.\n\nI think the complexes form in a stepwise manner. The first complex is Co(SCN), the second is Co(SCN)2, and so on. But wait, how many complexes are there? The stability constants go up to \u03b24, so maybe four complexes? That can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, the stability constant for each step is given, so the overall stability constant for each complex is the product of the previous \u03b2s.\n\nWait, the stability constant for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex from the ions. So, for example, the formation of Co(SCN)^n+ would have a stepwise \u03b2 each time. So, for each additional SCN- that binds, there's a \u03b2. So, the overall formation constant for, say, Co(SCN)_2^2+ would be \u03b21 * \u03b22. Similarly, Co(SCN)_3^3+ would be \u03b21*\u03b22*\u03b23, and Co(SCN)_4^4+ would be \u03b21*\u03b22*\u03b23*\u03b24.\n\nWait, but wait. What is the question asking? The blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands. So, the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^n+. The color might correspond to a specific complex, like the one with two SCN ligands.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about the percentage of this specific complex among all cobalt species. So, I need to calculate the distribution of Co species and find the fraction that is the dithiocyanato complex.\n\nSo, to find the distribution, I need to compute the fraction of each possible complex. The possible complexes are [Co], [Co(SCN)], [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3], [Co(SCN)_4], assuming all four are possible. But wait, the stability constants go up to \u03b24=16. Hmm, but how does that fit?\n\nWait, each \u03b2 is for adding one more SCN- ion. So the stepwise \u03b2 for the nth step is given. So the overall stability constant for the mth complex is the product of \u03b21 through \u03b2m.\n\nWait, but in terms of the formation, each step is adding another SCN-.\n\nSo, the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+:\n\nCo^2+ + SCN^- \u2194 [Co(SCN)]^+ with \u03b21 = 9.\n\nThe second complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0:\n\n[Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- \u2194 [Co(SCN)_2]^0 with \u03b22 =40.\n\nSo overall, the stability constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is \u03b21 * \u03b22 = 9*40 = 360.\n\nSimilarly, the third complex would be [Co(SCN)_3]^-:\n\n[Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- \u2194 [Co(SCN)_3]^- with \u03b23=63. So overall \u03b21*\u03b22*\u03b23=9*40*63=22680.\n\nAnd the fourth complex would be [Co(SCN)_4]^2-:\n\n[Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN^- \u2194 [Co(SCN)_4]^2- with \u03b24=16. So overall \u03b2 for this would be 9*40*63*16= 362880.\n\nWait, but the initial metal ion is Co^2+. So each complex is Co^2+ with n SCN- ligands. So the possible species are [Co(H2O)_6]^2+ (the aqua complex), but wait, the problem states 'all cobalt-containing species', and the ligands are SCN-.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that the solution contains Co(II) and thiocyanate. So the possible complexes are the various [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) species, along with the free Co^2+.\n\nWait, more accurately, the solution has Co^2+ and SCN^- ions. So the possible species are:\n\n1. Co^2+ (free ion).\n\n2. [Co(SCN)]^+.\n\n3. [Co(SCN)_2]^0.\n\n4. [Co(SCN)_3]^-.\n\n5. [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.\n\nEach of these can form, depending on the stability constants and the concentrations.\n\nBut the problem is about finding the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.\n\nSo, to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, we need to calculate the mole fractions (or concentrations) of each species and find the percentage.\n\nThe approach is to consider the formation of each complex step by step, using the stability constants and the concentrations.\n\nThe general approach for such problems is to consider the formation of each complex in sequence, using the given stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. The fraction of each species can be determined using the stepwise formation constants and the overall concentrations.\n\nThis is similar to calculating the distribution of species in a solution with multiple possible complexes, which can be modeled using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal ions.\n\nSo, the formula for the fraction of each species can be determined.\n\nLet me think about the variables.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the following:\n\nThe free Co^2+ concentration as [Co^2+] = x.\n\nThe concentration of [Co(SCN)]^+ as y.\n\nThe concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 as z.\n\nThe concentration of [Co(SCN)_3]^- as a.\n\nThe concentration of [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} as b.\n\nBut because we have multiple steps, perhaps we can model the fraction of each species in terms of the free Co^2+ concentration.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the method of successive approximations or assume that the free Co^2+ is much lower than the other species, but given the concentrations, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to use the cumulative formation constants and the expression for each species in terms of [Co^2+] and the ligand concentration.\n\nThe cumulative formation constant K1 for [Co(SCN)]^+ is \u03b21 =9.\n\nThe K2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is \u03b21*\u03b22=9*40=360.\n\nK3 is \u03b21*\u03b22*\u03b23=9*40*63=22680.\n\nK4 is \u03b21*\u03b22*\u03b23*\u03b24=9*40*63*16=362880.\n\nWait, but wait, the stability constants are given as \u03b21, \u03b22, etc., which are the stepwise constants. So, the overall formation constant for each complex is the product up to that step.\n\nSo, the formation constants for each species are:\n\nK1 = \u03b21 =9 \u2192 [Co(SCN)]^+.\n\nK2 = \u03b21 \u03b22=360 \u2192 [Co(SCN)_2]^0.\n\nK3=9*40*63=22680 \u2192 [Co(SCN)_3]^-.\n\nK4=9*40*63*16=362880 \u2192 [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.\n\nSo, the fraction of each species can be calculated using the formula:\n\nf_i = (K_i [Co^2+][L]^i) / (1 + K1 [L] + K2 [L]^2 + K3 [L]^3 + K4 [L]^4 )\n\nBut wait, that's the general approach. Because each species is formed by adding i ligands to the metal.\n\nBut wait, the ligand here is SCN^-.\n\nBut in this case, the total ligand concentration is given as [SCN^-] =0.1 M. So [L]=0.1 M.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The ligand concentration is 0.1 M, but when it forms complexes with Co^2+, the concentration of free SCN^- will change. However, considering that the ligand is in excess (0.1 M is much higher than the metal concentration?), perhaps we can approximate [L] as constant.\n\nWait, the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, which is 0.01 M. The ligand is 0.1 M. Since the ligand is in much higher concentration, the change in [SCN^-] upon complexation is negligible, so we can treat [SCN^-] as approximately 0.1 M.\n\nThat would make the calculations easier.\n\nSo, assuming [SCN^-] =0.1 M throughout.\n\nSo, the fraction of each species (f_i) is given by the term:\n\nf_i = (K_i [Co^2+][L]^i ) / (1 + K1 [L] + K2 [L]^2 + K3 [L]^3 + K4 [L]^4 )\n\nBut wait, actually, [Co^2+] is x, and the sum of all species must equal the total cobalt concentration, which is 0.01 M.\n\nWait, the total Co is 0.01 M, and it's distributed among all possible species.\n\nSo, [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = 0.01 M.\n\nBut [Co^2+] is x, and the other terms can be expressed in terms of x and [L] (0.1 M).\n\nAlternatively, the fractions can be represented by using the formation constants and the concentrations.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model each species as a function of x, and then sum them to find x.\n\nWait, but that might get complicated. Maybe using the assumption that the free Co^2+ is much less than the other species, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the distribution of Co among the different complexes, using the stepwise formation constants and the ligand concentration.\n\nAnother approach is to compute the conditional formation constants.\n\nBut perhaps the simplest way is to compute the fraction of each species using the formula:\n\nf_i = K_i * [L]^i / (1 + sum K_j [L]^j for j=1 to 4 )\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the fraction of each species is determined by the sum of all possible complexes.\n\nWait, let me think. The fraction of the nth complex is (K_n [L]^n [M]) / (1 + K1 [L] + K2 [L]^2 + K3 [L]^3 + K4 [L]^4 )\n\nBut in this case, [M] is the free metal ion concentration, which is x. So, the sum of all the species is [M] (x) plus all the complexes.\n\nWait, but the total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, so:\n\nx + y + z + a + b = 0.01.\n\nBut y = K1 x [L] = \u03b21 x [L].\n\nz = K2 x [L]^2 = \u03b21 \u03b22 x [L]^2.\n\na = K3 x [L]^3 = \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 x [L]^3.\n\nb = K4 x [L]^4 = \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 x [L]^4.\n\nSo, substituting all:\n\nx + \u03b21 x [L] + \u03b21 \u03b22 x [L]^2 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 x [L]^3 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 x [L]^4 = 0.01 M.\n\nFactor x:\n\nx [1 + \u03b21 [L] + \u03b21 \u03b22 [L]^2 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 [L]^3 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 [L]^4 ] = 0.01.\n\nSo, x = 0.01 / [1 + \u03b21 [L] + \u03b21 \u03b22 [L]^2 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 [L]^3 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 [L]^4 ].\n\nOnce x is known, the fractions can be calculated.\n\nSo, let's compute each term in the denominator.\n\nGiven \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\n[L]=0.1 M.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm 1: 1.\n\nTerm 2: \u03b21 [L] =9 *0.1 =0.9.\n\nTerm3: \u03b21 \u03b22 [L]^2=9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.\n\nTerm4: \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 [L]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3.\n\nLet me compute 9*40=360, 360 *63=22680. 22680 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001 =22.68.\n\nTerm5: \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 [L]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.\n\nCompute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16=362880. 362880 * (0.1)^4= 362880 *0.0001=36.288.\n\nSo the denominator is: 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = let's add them:\n\n1 + 0.9 =1.9.\n\n1.9 +3.6 =5.5.\n\n5.5 +22.68=28.18.\n\n28.18 +36.288=64.468.\n\nSo denominator is 64.468.\n\nThus, x=0.01 /64.468 \u2248 0.00015517 M.\n\nWait, that's approximately 1.55e-4 M.\n\nNow, the fractions of each species can be calculated as:\n\nf_i = (K_i [L]^i x ) / ( sum of all terms )\n\nWait, but more accurately, since we have x, each species is:\n\n[Co^2+] =x =1.55e-4 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)]^+ = y = \u03b21 x [L] =9 *1.55e-4 *0.1 = 9 * 1.55e-5 =1.395e-4 M.\n\n[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = z= \u03b21\u03b22 x [L]^2= 9*40 *1.55e-4 * (0.1)^2.\n\nWait, 9*40=360, 360 * 1.55e-4 = 5.58e-2.\n\nThen multiply by (0.1)^2=0.01: 5.58e-2 *0.01=5.58e-4 M.\n\nSimilarly, [Co(SCN)_3]^- = a= \u03b21\u03b22\u03b23 x [L]^3=9*40*63 *1.55e-4 * (0.1)^3.\n\n9*40=360, 360*63=22680.\n\n22680 *1.55e-4 = approximately 22680 *1.55e-4: let's compute 22680 *1.55.\n\n22680 *1=22680.\n\n22680 *0.55=12474.\n\nTotal is 22680 +12474=35154.\n\n35154 *1e-4 = 3.5154.\n\nThen multiply by (0.1)^3=0.001: 3.5154 *0.001=0.0035154 M.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I messed up the exponents.\n\nWait, let me recalculate.\n\nWait, 9*40=360, 360 *63=22680.\n\nSo, 22680 * [L]^3 * x.\n\n[L]^3 is (0.1)^3=0.001.\n\nx is 1.55e-4.\n\nSo, 22680 *0.001 *1.55e-4.\n\n22680 *0.001 =22.68.\n\n22.68 *1.55e-4 = approximately 0.0035154.\n\nSo, a=0.0035154 M.\n\nSimilarly, [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} =b= \u03b21\u03b22\u03b23\u03b24 x [L]^4.\n\nWhich is 9*40*63*16 * x * (0.1)^4.\n\nCompute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880.\n\n362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288.\n\n36.288 * x =36.288 *1.55e-4 \u2248 0.005627 M.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n36.288 *1.55e-4 = ?\n\nMultiply 36.288 by 1.55e-4.\n\n36.288 *1.55 = let's compute.\n\n36 *1.55=55.8.\n\n0.288 *1.55=0.4464.\n\nTotal 55.8 + 0.4464 =56.2464.\n\nSo 56.2464e-4 =5.62464e-3 M.\n\nSo, b=5.62464e-3 M.\n\nNow, let's list all the species concentrations:\n\nx = [Co^2+] =1.55e-4 M.\n\ny= [Co(SCN)]^+ =1.395e-4 M.\n\nz= [Co(SCN)_2]^0=5.58e-4 M.\n\na= [Co(SCN)_3]^- =0.0035154 M.\n\nb= [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}=5.62464e-3 M.\n\nWait, let me check these calculations again. Because when I calculated x, the denominator was 64.468, so x=0.01 /64.468 \u2248 0.00015517 M.\n\nWait, so the fractions:\n\nNow, the total of all species should add up to 0.01 M.\n\nLet me sum them:\n\nx: 1.55e-4 =0.000155.\n\ny:1.395e-4=0.0001395.\n\nz:5.58e-4=0.000558.\n\na:0.0035154.\n\nb:0.00562464.\n\nAdding them:\n\n0.000155 +0.0001395 =0.0002945.\n\n+0.000558 =0.0008525.\n\n+0.0035154=0.0043679.\n\n+0.00562464=0.00999254 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.01 M (close enough, considering rounding errors).\n\nSo, the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex (z) is 5.58e-4 M.\n\nTo find the percentage, we take (z / total Co) *100.\n\nTotal Co is 0.01 M.\n\nSo, (5.58e-4 / 0.01) *100 =5.58%.\n\nWait, that's 5.58%, but none of the options are that low. The options are 16.9%, 25.6%, 38.1%,42.3%.\n\nHmm, that suggests I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, where did I go wrong? Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the denominator. Let me double-check that.\n\nDenominator:\n\n1 + \u03b21 [L] + \u03b21 \u03b22 [L]^2 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 [L]^3 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 [L]^4.\n\nGiven \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\n[L]=0.1.\n\nSo,\n\nTerm1:1.\n\nTerm2:9 *0.1=0.9.\n\nTerm3:9*40 * (0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.\n\nTerm4:9*40*63 * (0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.\n\nTerm5:9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4= 362880 * 0.0001=36.288.\n\nAdding all terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468. That's correct.\n\nSo x=0.01 /64.468 \u2248 0.00015517 M.\n\nThen,\n\ny= \u03b21 x [L]=9 *0.00015517 *0.1=9*0.000015517=0.00013965 M.\n\nz= \u03b21 \u03b22 x [L]^2.\n\nWhich is 9*40=360 \u2192 360 *0.00015517=0.055861 \u2192 then multiply by [L]^2=0.01 \u2192 0.055861 *0.01=0.00055861 M.\n\nAh, wait, I see where I went wrong earlier. I think I correctly calculated z as 5.58e-4 M.\n\nWait, but if I calculate the fraction of z over the total, it's (5.58e-4 / 0.01) *100 =5.58%, which isn't matching the options. So perhaps there's a miscalculation in the way the fractions are calculated.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the mole fractions instead of the concentrations. Because the fractions should sum to 1, but in this case, they sum to about 1, but the percentage of each species over the total is what we're after.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way I model the fractions is incorrect.\n\nWait, another approach: using the distribution of the species based on the formation constants and ligand concentration.\n\nI think the correct way is to calculate the fraction of each species as:\n\nf_i = (K_i [L]^i ) / (1 + sum_{j=1 to 4} K_j [L]^j )\n\nBut wait, let me think about the general approach. The fraction of each species is based on their formation constants and the ligand concentration.\n\nSo, for each species [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, the fraction is:\n\nf_n = (K_n [L]^n ) / (1 + sum_{m=1}^4 K_m [L]^m )\n\nBut wait, that would give the fraction of each species relative to the free metal.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nThe total concentration of the metal is given by:\n\n[Co_total] = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.\n\nWhich is:\n\nx + y + z + a + b =0.01.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nx (1 + \u03b21 [L] + \u03b21 \u03b22 [L]^2 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 [L]^3 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 [L]^4 ) =0.01.\n\nSo x =0.01 / (1 + \u03b21 [L] + \u03b21 \u03b22 [L]^2 + ... )\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nSo, the fractions of each species are:\n\ny = \u03b21 x [L] \u2192 (\u03b21 [L] x ) / [Co_total].\n\nSimilarly, z =\u03b21 \u03b22 x [L]^2 \u2192 (\u03b21 \u03b22 [L]^2 x ) / [Co_total].\n\nWait, but [Co_total] is 0.01, so:\n\nf_n = (\u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2n [L]^n x ) / [Co_total].\n\nBut x = 0.01 / (denominator), so substituting:\n\nf_n = (\u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2n [L]^n * (0.01 / denominator )) / 0.01.\n\nSimplify:\n\nf_n = (\u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2n [L]^n ) / denominator.\n\nWhich is the same as (K_n [L]^n) / denominator.\n\nSo, the fractions are each (K_n [L]^n) divided by the denominator, which is the sum of all terms.\n\nSo, the denominator is 64.468.\n\nSo, let me compute each K_n [L]^n:\n\nK1 [L]^1:9 *0.1=0.9.\n\nK2 [L]^2:360 *0.01=3.6.\n\nK3 [L]^3:22680 *0.001=22.68.\n\nK4 [L]^4:362880 *0.0001=36.288.\n\nSo, the fractions are:\n\nf1 = 0.9 /64.468 \u22480.01397.\n\nf2 =3.6 /64.468\u22480.0558.\n\nf3=22.68/64.468\u22480.352.\n\nf4=36.288/64.468\u22480.5629.\n\nWait, but wait:\n\nf1=0.9/64.468\u22480.01397 \u2192 ~1.4%.\n\nf2=3.6/64.468\u22485.58%.\n\nf3=22.68/64.468\u224835.2%.\n\nf4=36.288/64.468\u224856.3%.\n\nWait, but wait, what about the free Co^2+? Oh, right, the first term in the denominator is 1, which corresponds to Co^2+.\n\nSo, the fraction of free Co^2+ is 1/64.468\u22480.015517 \u2192 ~1.55%.\n\nSo, the fractions are:\n\nf0 (free Co^2+): ~1.55%.\n\nf1 ([CoSCN]^+): ~1.4%.\n\nf2 ([Co(SCN)_2]^0):5.58%.\n\nf3 ([Co(SCN)_3]^-):35.2%.\n\nf4 ([Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}):56.3%.\n\nWait, adding these fractions: 1.55 +1.4=2.95; +5.58=8.53; +35.2=43.73; +56.3=100.03% approximately. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the question is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is f2=5.58%.\n\nBut none of the options match this. So, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.\n\nHmm, that suggests I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the wrong species. The problem states 'blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes.' So dithiocyanato implies two SCN ligands, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.\n\nBut according to the fractions, that's about 5.58%, which is not an option.\n\nSo, perhaps I have a misunderstanding of the stability constants.\n\nWait, perhaps the stability constants are given as the overall \u03b2 for each complex, not stepwise. Oh! That's a possibility I didn't consider.\n\nWait, the problem says the stability constants are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So, perhaps \u03b21 is the stability constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, \u03b22 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, \u03b23 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- and \u03b24 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2\u2212}.\n\nWait, that would make sense if the \u03b2 values are for each complex, not stepwise.\n\nIn that case, the approach changes. Because then each K_i is the overall \u03b2 for the ith complex.\n\nSo, for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, \u03b22=40, and [Co(SCN)_3]^- has \u03b23=63, and so on.\n\nIn this scenario, the formation would be:\n\nCo^2+ + 2 SCN^- \u2194 [Co(SCN)_2]^0, with \u03b22=40.\n\nCo^2+ +3 SCN^- \u2194 [Co(SCN)_3]^- , \u03b23=63.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the stability constants for each complex are independent, which isn't the usual way it's presented. Normally, \u03b2's are stepwise.\n\nBut perhaps the question is presenting them as overall \u03b2's. Let me think.\n\nIf \u03b21 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, \u03b22 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc., then the fractions would be calculated using each \u03b2_i [L]^i.\n\nSo, the denominator would be 1 + \u03b21 [L] + \u03b22 [L]^2 + \u03b23 [L]^3 + \u03b24 [L]^4.\n\nWhich with [L]=0.1, let's compute each term.\n\nDenominator =1 +9*0.1 +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1 =1.\n\n9 *0.1=0.9.\n\n40*(0.01)=0.4.\n\n63*0.001=0.063.\n\n16*(0.0001)=0.0016.\n\nSum:\n\n1 +0.9 =1.9.\n\n+0.4 \u21922.3.\n\n+0.063 \u21922.363.\n\n+0.0016\u21922.3646.\n\nSo denominator is 2.3646.\n\nThus, x = [Co^2+] = 0.01 /2.3646 \u22480.004226 M.\n\nNow, calculate the fractions:\n\nf0 =1/2.3646 \u2192\u22480.4226 \u219242.26%.\n\nf1 =\u03b21 [L] / denominator =9*0.1 /2.3646 =0.9 /2.3646\u22480.381 \u219238.1%.\n\nf2=\u03b22 [L]^2 / denominator=40*(0.01)/2.3646=0.4 /2.3646\u22480.169 \u219216.9%.\n\nf3=63*(0.001)/2.3646=0.063 /2.3646\u22480.0266 \u21922.66%.\n\nf4=16*(0.0001)/2.3646=0.0016/2.3646\u22480.000676 \u21920.0676%.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n42.26 +38.1=80.36; +16.9=97.26; +2.66=99.92; +0.06=99.98%. Close enough.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is f2=16.9%, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.\n\nSo, if this approach is correct, the answer is D)16.9%.\n\nBut earlier, when considering the stepwise \u03b2's, I calculated about 5.58% for [Co(SCN)_2]^0.\n\nSo, the confusion is whether the \u03b2's are stepwise or overall.\n\nThe problem statement says: \"the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16.\"\n\nIn standard practice, \u03b2's are stepwise, meaning \u03b21 is for the first ligand, \u03b22 for the second, etc. So, the overall \u03b2 for the second complex would be \u03b21*\u03b22.\n\nBut perhaps the question is presenting them as overall \u03b2's. Because in that case, the calculation leads to the dithiocyanato complex being about 16.9%, which is option D.\n\nBut in the earlier approach, using stepwise \u03b2's, the percentage was about 5.58%, which isn't an option.\n\nBut since the given options include 16.9%, which is option D, I think the correct approach is to use the overall \u03b2's for each complex.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be D)16.9%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)\u2082]\u2070, among all cobalt-containing species, we analyze the distribution of species using the given stability constants and ligand concentration. The stability constants provided are interpreted as overall stability constants for each complex, not stepwise constants. The complexes and their stability constants are:\n\n- **[Co(SCN)]\u207a**: \u03b2\u2081 = 9  \n- **[Co(SCN)\u2082]\u2070**: \u03b2\u2082 = 40  \n- **[Co(SCN)\u2083]\u207b**: \u03b2\u2083 = 63  \n- **[Co(SCN)\u2084]\u00b2\u207b**: \u03b2\u2084 = 16  \n\nThe total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate ligand concentration is 0.1 M. The fraction of each species is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nf_i = \\frac{\\beta_i [\\text{SCN}^-]^i}{1 + \\sum_{j=1}^4 \\beta_j [\\text{SCN}^-]^j}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute the denominator\nThe denominator is the sum of all terms:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}^-] + \\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}^-]^4\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n- \\( \\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \\cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \\)  \n- \\( \\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \\cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \\)  \n- \\( \\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \\cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \\)  \n- \\( \\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \\cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \\)  \n\nAdding these terms:\n\n\\[\n1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute the fractions\nThe fraction of each species is:\n\n\\[\nf_i = \\frac{\\beta_i [\\text{SCN}^-]^i}{2.3646}\n\\]\n\n- For **[Co(SCN)\u2082]\u2070** (\\(i = 2\\)):\n\n\\[\nf_2 = \\frac{\\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2}{2.3646} = \\frac{40 \\cdot (0.1)^2}{2.3646} = \\frac{0.4}{2.3646} \\approx 0.169 \\, \\text{(or 16.9%)}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Verify the sum of fractions\nThe fractions of all species should sum to 1:\n\n- \\( f_0 \\) (free Co\u00b2\u207a): \\( \\frac{1}{2.3646} \\approx 0.4226 \\, \\text{(42.26%)} \\)  \n- \\( f_1 \\) ([Co(SCN)]\u207a): \\( \\frac{\\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}^-]}{2.3646} = \\frac{0.9}{2.3646} \\approx 0.381 \\, \\text{(38.1%)} \\)  \n- \\( f_2 \\) ([Co(SCN)\u2082]\u2070): \\( \\approx 0.169 \\, \\text{(16.9%)} \\)  \n- \\( f_3 \\) ([Co(SCN)\u2083]\u207b): \\( \\frac{\\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}^-]^3}{2.3646} = \\frac{0.063}{2.3646} \\approx 0.0266 \\, \\text{(2.66%)} \\)  \n- \\( f_4 \\) ([Co(SCN)\u2084]\u00b2\u207b): \\( \\frac{\\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}^-]^4}{2.3646} = \\frac{0.0016}{2.3646} \\approx 0.000676 \\, \\text{(0.0676%)} \\)  \n\nSumming these fractions:\n\n\\[\n0.4226 + 0.381 + 0.169 + 0.0266 + 0.000676 \\approx 1.0\n\\]\n\nThe calculations are consistent, and the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)\u2082]\u2070, is **16.9%**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**D) 16.9%**",
