Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically dealing with interatomic and interplanar distances in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal but the angles between them are all the same, which in this case are 30 degrees each. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance... Oh right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance d is related to the unit cell parameters. Oh yeah, the formula is d_hkl = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos α ), but wait, I might be mixing something up. Alternatively, I remember it's derived from the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

Wait, for a cubic system, the formula is simpler because all angles are 90 degrees. But here, it's a rhombohedral system, so the angles are 30 degrees each. So the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system must be more complex.

Let me think. The general formula for d_hkl in any crystal system is d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α
