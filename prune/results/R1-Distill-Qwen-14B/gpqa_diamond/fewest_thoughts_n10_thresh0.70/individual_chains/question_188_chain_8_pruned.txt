Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma equal to 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, wait. I think the formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ), but wait, no, that's not right. Oh, right, for a cubic crystal, it's simpler, but rhombohedral is more complex because the angles aren't 90 degrees.

Oh, right! The general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is derived from the structure factor. For a rhombohedral system, the formula is d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos γ - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos α ) ), where a is the lattice parameter. Wait, but wait—wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the edges a, b, c are equal, right? So a = b = c. And the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees in this case.

So the given interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, inter
