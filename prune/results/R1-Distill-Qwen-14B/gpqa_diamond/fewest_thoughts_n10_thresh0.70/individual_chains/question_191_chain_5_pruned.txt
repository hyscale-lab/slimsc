Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's see what the question is.

The compound given is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, so that's a cyclohexanone ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group, which is -CH2OH, and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is the same as isopropenyl, right? So it's like CH2=C(CH3)- attached at the 5 position.

The first step is treating this with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide to form product 1. Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used for deprotonating things. And benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent, so maybe an alkylation is happening here.

Looking at the starting material, the cyclohexanone has a ketone at position 1. I remember that when a ketone is treated with a base, it can form an enolate. Sodium hydride would deprotonate the alpha position, right? The alpha carbons are adjacent to the carbonyl, so in cyclohexanone, positions 2 and 6 are alpha. Wait, but the substituents are at 3 and 5. Hmm.

Wait, the starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl) and 5-(prop-1-en-2-yl). So, the substituents are at 3 and 5, and the ketone is at 1. So the carbons adjacent to the ketone would be 2 and 6. So when sodium hydride deprotonates, it would abstract a proton from either C2 or C6.

But the substituents are at 3 and 5. So, the enolate would form from either C2 or C6. Then, when benzyl bromide (which has a benzyl group, -CH2Ph) is added, it would attack the enolate carbon, leading to alkylation.

Wait, but where would the benzyl group attach? If the enolate is formed at C2 or C
