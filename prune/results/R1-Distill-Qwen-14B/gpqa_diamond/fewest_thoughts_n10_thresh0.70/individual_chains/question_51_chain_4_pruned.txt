Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the net potential energy when a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: there's a conducting sphere with radius R, and it's grounded. A charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of this sphere. I need to calculate the potential energy of this system.

Wait, potential energy... I remember that for charges, the potential energy is related to the work done to bring the charges together. But wait, in this case, the sphere is conducting and it's grounded, so that should change things.

When a conductor is grounded, it means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge can flow to or from the Earth. So, if I place a charge near it, the sphere might induce some charges or something like that.

Let me recall the method of images. Oh right, the method of images is used in electrostatics to solve problems with conductors. For a point charge near a conducting sphere, the induced charges can be modeled by an image charge.

Wait, so when you have a charge outside a grounded conducting sphere, the sphere's induced charges can be considered as if there's an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge's position and magnitude depend on the geometry.

I think the image charge q' is placed in such a way that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero because it's a conductor. So, the image charge should be located along the line connecting the center of the sphere to the point charge q.
