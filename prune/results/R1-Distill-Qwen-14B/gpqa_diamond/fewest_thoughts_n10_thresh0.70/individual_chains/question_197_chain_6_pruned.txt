Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the given options. The data given are the IR and NMR spectra of Compound X.

First, I'll start by analyzing the IR data to get some clues about the functional groups in Compound X. The IR shows strong absorption between 3400-2500 cm⁻¹, which probably indicates an -OH group because that's where O-H stretches usually appear. Also, there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Then, the peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of aromatic rings, possibly with some conjugation.

Next, looking at the ¹H NMR data to get more structural information. The peaks are:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm, which is a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. That makes sense because carboxylic acids have protons around that region, and the broad signal suggests it's exchanging or in a more acidic environment.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is in the aromatic region. A double doublet (d) with 2H suggests maybe two protons that are each adjacent to one other proton, like in a para-substituted benzene ring. For instance, in a para-substituted aromatic compound, like para-xylene or something with substituents at the para positions, you get doublets because each proton has two neighboring equivalent protons.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, but lower in the aromatic region. This might be due to deshielding, possibly because of an electron-withdrawing group. Since there's a carbonyl group (from IR), maybe it's a substituent attached to the ring that's electron-withdrawing, like a carbonyl group itself.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet around 3 ppm. This could be a methylene (CH₂) group adjacent to an electronegative atom or part of a chain, maybe near an oxygen or in a branched structure.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, maybe part of a chain, like a CH₂ connected to another CH₂ or a branch.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet (d is doublet, but that might be a typo) wait, no, the question says it's a doublet. Wait, 3H as a doublet—could be a methyl group attached to a CH₂, perhaps as in a CH₂CH₂CH3 group. Or maybe a geminal di-substitution? Wait, but 3H as a doublet, maybe adjacent to a CH that has another group. Or maybe it's a CH₂CH3 group, but wait, a doublet for 3H would imply two neighboring protons. Hmm, maybe it's a methyl group attached to a carbon with a neighboring CH₂.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet with 3H, which is a classic terminal methyl group in a chain, like the end of an ethyl group. So, maybe something like CH₂CH₂CH3, where the terminal CH3 is a triplet.

Putting this together, the NMR suggests a structure with a carboxylic acid group, an aromatic ring with para substituents, and a side chain that includes a CH₂CH₂CH3 group (since we have the t at 0.9 ppm and the 1.4 ppm doublet which could be a CH₂ adjacent to a CH(CH3)).

Wait, let's think about the substitutions on the benzene ring. The two
