Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that looks a bit complicated. I'm a bit rusty on enthalpy of formation, but let me think through this.

Wait, the question gives me the enthalpy of atomization for carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, atomization is breaking all bonds of an atom in a molecule. So for carbon, that's the energy needed to break all its bonds, probably in graphite or something. But how does that tie into enthalpy of formation?

The other given are bond energies: H-H is 100, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400 kJ/mol. So, to find the enthalpy of formation, I must use these bond energies to calculate the energy change when the molecule is formed from its elements.

The general approach is to calculate the total energy required to break all bonds in the reactants (which are elements in their standard states) and subtract the energy released when the bonds in the product are formed. So, the enthalpy of formation is the difference between the bond energies of the reactants and the product.

Wait, but enthalpy of formation is usually given as the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for this molecule, which is an alkene with multiple double bonds, I need to figure out how many of each bond there are in the molecule and then apply the formula.

Let me think about the structure again. The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me count the number of each type of bond.

First, the molecule is a hydrocarbon. Let's count the number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

Let me try drawing it or at least visualizing it. So, the structure is:

- The first part is (CH3)2C=CH-: That's a (CH3)2C group connected via a double bond to a CH group.
- Then there's a CH2- group.
- Next is CH(CH3)-: a CH group with a methyl branch.
- Then another CH2- group.
- Followed by CH=C(CH3)2. So another double bond, with a CH connected to a C(CH3)2.

Wait, actually, maybe it's better to count each type of bond systematically.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the molecule as consisting of several double bonds and then the rest single bonds.

So, let's try to find the number of each type of bond in the entire molecule.

First, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me list all the bonds:

1. The double bonds: I see two double bonds in the structure. One at the beginning and another at the
