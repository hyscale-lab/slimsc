Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics. Right, we need to apply special relativity formulas.

Alright, let's break it down. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the same direction. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy.

First, I think I should calculate the relative speed between them. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh wait, right! The formula is (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v2*v1)/(c²)), but wait, which one is moving faster? 0.6c is larger than 0.5c, so the astronaut with mass 2m is moving faster. So from that astronaut's frame, the other should be moving at a slower speed.

Wait, no, wait. I might have that backwards. Let me think. If I'm in the frame of astronaut A (mass 2m) moving at 0.6c, then the other astronaut (B, 3m) is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's perspective, the speed of B would be (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5*0.6 c²)/c²). Wait, no, because relative velocity isn't that straightforward. Oh right, the formula is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1v2)/c²). But wait, I need to make sure I get the signs right. Since both are moving in the same direction, v2 is 0.5c, and v1 is 0.6c. So v2 (from A's frame) is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²/c²) = 1 - 0.3 =
