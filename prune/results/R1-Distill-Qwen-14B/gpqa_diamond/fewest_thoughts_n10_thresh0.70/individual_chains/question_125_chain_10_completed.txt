Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a particle in a potential. Hmm, let's see... The question is about finding the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. 

Wait, the potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. I remember that in such a system, each direction (x, y, z) behaves like a 1D harmonic oscillator.

The energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. The energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. For each direction, the energy is (n_i + 1/2) ħω, where n_i is the quantum number for that direction (n_x, n_y, n_z). So the total energy is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Or wait, another way to think about it is that each dimension contributes n_i + 1/2, so adding them gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, but another approach is to use the concept of the principal quantum number. In 3D, the energy depends on the sum n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So each energy level corresponds to a specific 'n' value, and each state with the same 'n' has the same energy. 

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. For the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2,...). Here, n is the sum of the three quantum numbers: n = n_x + n_y + n_z. 

So the ground state is n=0, which would be n_x=0, n_y=0, n_z=0. The first excited state would be n=1. But the question is about the third excited state. Wait, wait—third excited state. Does that correspond to the fourth energy level? Because the ground state is the first, then first excited is next, etc. 

Wait, let's think about the numbering. The ground state is the lowest energy, n=0. Then the first excited state is n=1, because that's the next possible sum. The second excited state would be n=2, and the third would be n=3. So the third excited state is n=3. 

So the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Oh wait, no, wait. Because for n=3, E= (3 + 3/2) ħω? Wait, no, the formula is E = (n + 3/2) ħω, right? So n=3 would make E=(3 + 3/2) ħω. Wait, 3 + 3/2 is 4.5, which is 9/2. So E=(9/2) ħω, which matches option A and C. 

Now, the second part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. That's the degeneracy. The degeneracy for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator at energy n is given by the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers n_x + n_y + n_z. So the number of states is (n + 2 choose 2), I think. Because it's the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = n. 

Wait, the formula for the number of solutions is (n + 3 -1 choose 3-1) ) = (n+2 choose 2). So for n=3, that would be (3+2 choose 2) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So the degeneracy is 10. 

Looking at the options: option A says energy (9/2) ħω and 10 eigenfunctions. Option C has the same energy but 3 eigenfunctions. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The third excited state: ground is n=0, first excited n=1, second n=2, third n=3. So yes, n=3. The number of states is (3+2 choose 2) = 5*4/(2) =10. So the first part of the question is (9/2) ħω, second part 10. So option A is correct.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels for such a system are quantized and given by $E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega$, where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the sum of the quantum numbers in the three spatial dimensions. 

For the third excited state, the quantum number $n$ corresponds to $n = 3$, as the ground state is $n=0$, the first excited state is $n=1$, the second excited state is $n=2$, and the third excited state is $n=3$. Substituting $n=3$ into the energy formula, the energy of the third excited state is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy of the energy levels in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is determined by the number of ways to distribute the quantum number $n$ among the three dimensions, i.e., the number of non-negative integer solutions to $n_x + n_y + n_z = n$. For $n=3$, this is given by the combinatorial formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{n + 2}{2} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10$**

Answer: A
