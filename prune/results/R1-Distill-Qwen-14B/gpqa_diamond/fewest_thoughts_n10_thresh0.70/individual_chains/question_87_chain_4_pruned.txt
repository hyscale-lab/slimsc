Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So that's a benzene ring with two substituents. The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Hmm, wait, benzene is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add two more carbons. So each substituent is one carbon? Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? No, wait, di-substituted means two substituents on the ring, each attached to the ring. So each substituent is a group attached to the benzene ring.

The peaks in the FTIR indicate a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like -X, where X is Cl, Br, etc.). So the substituents on the benzene are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, the substituents can't both be carbonyl groups because that would make it more than two substituents? No, di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. So each substituent is a group. So one substituent is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think. The aromatic ring has two substituents. One substituent has a carbonyl group, so perhaps it's a ketone or an aldehyde attached to the ring. But if it's a carbonyl group, that would be something like a carbonyl attached as a substituent. Oh wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like an acetyl group or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone substituent), and the other substituent is a halogen. So the molecule is something like benzene with a carbonyl group in one position and a halogen in another.

Wait, but the molecule has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6 carbons. So the substituents contribute 2 carbons. So two substituents, each with one carbon? Because 6 + 1 + 1 = 8. So each substituent is a single carbon. So one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone: C=O, but that's
