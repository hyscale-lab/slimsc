Okay, so I've got this problem here about a Lagrangian and figuring out the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that renormalizability has to do with the dimensions of the coupling constants and the terms in the Lagrangian.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Oh right, σ matrices are antisymmetric and appear in expressions involving angular momentum or electromagnetic interactions maybe.

So first, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I remember that each term in the Lagrangian should have mass dimension [L] = 4, because in four spacetime dimensions, the action is dimensionless, and the integral is over four dimensions. So each Lagrangian term must be dimension 4.

The Lagrangian term here is L_int, so each term in it must have dimension 4. So let's break down each part of the term:

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}.

I think ψ is a spinor field, so its mass dimension should be [ψ] = 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the Dirac equation tells us that the field has dimension 3/2 (since the derivative has dimension 1, and the equation is first order, so each ψ has (4-1)/2 = 3/2).

So ψ̄ has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is made from γ matrices, which are dimensionless. The commutator [γ_mu, gamma_nu] is also dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So no contribution to the dimension from there.

F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is derived from the vector potential A, which has dimension 1. The field strength is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each derivative is dimension 1, so F has dimension 2 (because each A is dim 1, and each derivative adds 1). So [F^{μν}] = 2.

Putting it all together, the term is κ * ψ̄ * σ_{μν} * ψ * F^{μν}.

Let me compute each part:

[κ] is what we're looking for. [ψ̄] is 3/2, [σ_{μν}] is 0, [ψ] is 3/2, and [F] is 2.

So the product's dimension is [κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2.

Adding those: 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So [κ] +5 must equal 4, because [L] =4.

So [κ] =4-5= -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, about renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥0. Wait, no, actually, wait: in four dimensions, a renormalizable interaction term should have a coupling with dimension ≤4 because each term in the Lagrangian has dimension 4. So the coupling's dimension must be such that when you have the term, it doesn't require higher than certain dimension.

Wait, more accurately, in the renormalizability criteria, the coupling constant's dimension must be ≥ the spacetime dimension (4) minus the number of fields in the term, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Alternatively, for each term in the Lagrangian, the dimension of the coupling must be such that the term is dimension ≤4.

Another approach: when you have a term in the Lagrangian like g φ^n, the dimension of g is [g] = 4 - n [φ]. For the term to be renormalizable, [g] must be ≥0, because higher than that would make the term nonrenormalizable (like higher derivative terms, etc.).

Wait, but in this case, our term is not a simple φ^n; it's a product of a spinor field, another spinor, and a field strength tensor.

Wait, the term is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ.

Wait, ψ is a spinor, so ψ̄ψ is a scalar. So ψ̄ σ ψ would have dimension [ψ̄][ψ][σ], but σ is dimensionless. So [ψ̄][ψ] is 3 each, so 3+3=6? Wait, no. Wait, ψ̄ is (3/2) dimension, ψ is (3/2). So ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2 +3/2)=3, because each ψ is 3/2. But σ is dimensionless, so the product ψ̄ σ ψ is 3.

Then F^{mu nu} is dimension 2. So the entire term is ψ̄ σ ψ F, which would have dimension 3+2=5. But the Lagrangian term must be dimension 4. So to make it dimension 4, κ must provide a factor of -1 (since 5 + [κ] =4, so [κ]=-1).

Now, for the renormalizability: a term is renormalizable if its coupling has positive mass dimension. Because in the interaction term, when you have a term like g φ^m, the dimension of g is [g] = 4 - m [φ]. If [g] is positive (i.e., 4 - m [φ] > 0), then the term is renormalizable. If [g] is negative, the term is nonrenormalizable.

So in our case, [κ]=-1, which is negative. So the term is nonrenormalizable.

Wait, but wait: I might be getting this wrong. Because sometimes people say that a coupling with a negative mass dimension implies nonrenormalizability. Because when you have higher loop corrections, the coupling's dimension affects the superficial degree of divergence. If [g] < 0, then each loop would make the amplitude more divergent, requiring counterterms of higher dimension, which aren't allowed in renormalizable theories.

So in this case, [κ] is -1, which is less than zero
