Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and electron transitions. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about a state |3,0,0> decaying to |1,0,0> through two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, emitting or absorbing photons, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, the selection rules. Oh right, for dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but more specifically, Δn can't be zero. And for angular momentum, the selection rules are Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. So, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can change by one unit, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by -1, 0, or +1.

So the initial state is |3,0,0>. The final state after two transitions is |1,0,0>. Since it's a two-step process, the electron must go from n=3 to some intermediate state, then to n=1. Each step must follow the selection rules.

Let me think about the possible transitions. From n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0. So the first transition must involve l changing by ±1, so l becomes 1. So the first state after the first transition would be |n',1, m'>, where n' is either 2 or 4, but since we're going down to n=1, probably n' is 2, because going from 3 to 4 would require more steps, but maybe it's possible. Wait, but the question is about two transitions, so from 3 to 2, then 2 to 1. Because if it went to 4, it would probably need more steps, but perhaps that's not the case.

So first transition: 3,0,0 -> 2,1, m'. The m' can be -1, 0, or +1. So the intermediate state could have m = 0, 1, or -1. Then the second transition would take from 2,1,m' to 1,0,0. So for the second step, the m must go from m' to 0, which requires Δm = 0, ±1. Let me see.

Wait, for the second transition, the initial state is |2,1,m'>, and the final is |1,0,0>. So for the l in the second step, it goes from 1 to 0, which is allowed because Δl= -1. The m must change from m' to 0. So m' could be 0, 1, or -1.

Wait, but in the first transition, from l=0 to l=1, so m can change by ±1 or 0. So in the first step, the m could change from 0 to -1, 0, or +1. So the possible m' values after first transition are those.

Now, the second transition must take the m' to 0. So looking at the possibilities:

If the first transition gives m'=0, then the second transition can have
