Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem mentions two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, the question is about their luminosities, right? So I think I need to figure out how their luminosities compare.

The question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a star's emission, according to Wien's Law, is related to its temperature. Wien's Law is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Oh wait, that's a key point.

So both stars have the same temperature. Now, since they radiate as black bodies, their luminosity can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but since both stars have the same temperature, the T⁴ part will cancel out when comparing their luminosities. So luminosity is proportional to R². Oh, right! So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1²)/(R2²). Since R1 is 1.5 times R2, that would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. Hmm, but looking at the options, option A is 2.25. That would seem to be the answer. But wait, there's more.

Wait, wait. The problem also mentions radial velocities. The radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Oh, right! Radial velocity affects the observed wavelengths due to the Doppler effect. So the observed wavelength would be different from the rest wavelength.

So earlier, I assumed that the stars' temperatures are the same because the peak wavelengths are the same. But wait, if the stars are moving relative to us, their observed λ_max might be different. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So I think I need to account for the Doppler shift in their observed wavelengths.

Ah, right! So the actual temperature of the stars might be different, but due to Doppler shift, their observed λ_max is the same. So maybe I can't directly say T1 = T2. I need to adjust for the Doppler effect.

Hmm, how does the Doppler effect affect the wavelength? The formula is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ), where v_r is the radial velocity towards or away from us. Wait, wait, no, that's for relativistic speeds, but I think the standard Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1
