Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because epoxides and organocuprates aren't my strongest topics. But let's take it step by step.

So, the question is about the reaction between a saturated epoxide and an organocuprate reagent, specifically Me2CuLi. The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. I need to figure out the product formed.

First, I remember that when epoxides react with organocuprates (like Grignard or Gilman reagents), it's an example of a nucleophilic ring-opening reaction. Organocuprates, being strong nucleophiles, attack the less hindered epoxide carbon. Also, there's something about inversion of configuration when the nucleophile adds to a carbon.

Wait, the question mentions that in disubstituted epoxides, inversion occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile (Nu) adds. So, for each carbon in the epoxide ring, when the Nu adds, the configuration inverts.

Let me imagine the structure of the starting epoxide. The bicyclo system is [4.1.0], which means it's a norbornane derivative. The substituents are at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. The 7-oxa part is the oxygen in the epoxide. So, the structure is a bicyclo heptane with an oxygen bridge, making it an epoxide.

In the bicyclo structure, the oxygen is between carbons 6 and 7, but wait, the numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me try to draw it mentally. The bicyclo [4.1.0]heptane would have two bridgehead carbons connected by a two-membered bridge (since it's 4.1.0). So, the main bridge is four carbons, another bridge is one carbon, and the third bridge is one carbon (the oxygen in this case).

So, the epoxide is a three-membered ring (epoxide) fused to the bicyclo structure. Now, the substituents are at 1R,3R,4R,6S. Wait, the 6S is probably the position where the oxygen is attached. So, the epoxide is between carbons 6 and 7 (but in bicyclo numbering, I think the bridge is between 6 and 7? Not entirely sure, but perhaps that's the case).

Wait, maybe the structure is more like the epoxide is at positions 1 and 2 of the bicyclo system. Hmm, perhaps I should look for a way to figure out which carbons are part of the epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look at the product options and see how the addition would happen.

The product is a cyclohexanol derivative, judging by the options. The starting epoxide is bicyclo, and after opening, it becomes a cyclohexane ring with substituents.

So, the reaction mechanism: the organocuprate (Me2CuLi) will attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide. Once the nucleophile adds,
