Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about two electrons in p orbitals. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about the coupled angular momentum state of two electrons. The state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So l₁ and l₂ are both 1, which makes sense for p orbitals since p has l=1. The total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1.

The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z to be -ħ each. Wait, L₁z and L₂z are the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum of each electron.

So first, I need to figure out what the possible outcomes are when measuring L₁z and L₂z for this state. The state is a coupled state, so it's a combination of the individual states.

I remember that when you have two angular momenta coupled, you can expand the coupled state in terms of the product states of the individual angular momenta. So the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a linear combination of |l₁ m₁> |l₂ m₂> states where l₁=1, l₂=1, and their sum gives l=2 and m=-1.

Wait, but the total m is the sum of m₁ and m₂. So for the total m of -1, m₁ + m₂ must be -1. So possible m₁ and m₂ pairs that add up to -1 are (m₁, m₂) = (-1, 0), (0, -1), etc. But wait, each m can only be -1, 0, +1 for each electron since l=1.

So let's think about the expansion. The coupled state |l₁=1, l₂=1, l=2, m=-1> can be expressed as a sum over m₁ and m₂ such that m₁ + m₂ = -1. So the possible terms would be (m₁, m₂) = (-1, 0), (0, -1). Wait, are there any others? 1 + (-2) but m can't be -2 since l=1. So only those two terms.

Wait, but for two electrons, each with l=1, the total state is a combination of all possible product states where m₁ + m₂ = m_total. Here, m_total is -1. So the state would be a sum of |m₁= -1, m₂=0> and |m₁=0, m₂=-1>, each multiplied by some coefficients.

But wait, I think the expansion also depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The coefficients for each term in the expansion come from the Clebsch-Gordan series. For l1=1, l2=1, and L=2, m=-1, what are the coefficients?

The general expression for the state |l₁ l₂ L M> is the sum over m₁ and m₂ of ( < l₁ m₁ l₂ m₂ | L M > ) |l₁ m₁> |l₂ m₂>.

So for L=2 and M=-1, the possible (m₁, m₂) pairs are (-1,0), (0,-1), and maybe (1, -2) but m₂ can't be -2 because l₂=1, so m₂ can only be -1,0,1. So only the first two are possible.

Wait, so the state |1 1 2 -1> is a combination of |1,-1> |1,0> and |1,0> |1,-1>, each multiplied by a coefficient.

What's the coefficient for each term? Hmm. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling l1=1, l2=1 to L=2.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two angular momenta can be found in tables. Alternatively, I think for L=2, and M=-1,
