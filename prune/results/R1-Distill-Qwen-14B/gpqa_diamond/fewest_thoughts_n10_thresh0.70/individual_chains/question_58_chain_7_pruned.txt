Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I should think through this carefully. Let me try to break it down.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like when calculations give infinite results. It helps to make sense of these infinities by introducing a cutoff or some other method to make the math work.

So, let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity. It's a candidate for a theory that unites quantum mechanics with general relativity. But string theory usually deals with higher energies, right? I'm not sure if it requires regularization. Wait, string theory has a concept called the "string tension," which is a parameter that determines the scale at which string effects become important. But I'm not sure if it needs regularization. I think because string theory is background-dependent and has a different structure, maybe it doesn't require the same kind of regularization as other quantum field theories. Or perhaps it's because string theories are finite? I thought that in some formulations, like the perturbative string theory, they might not have the same divergences as in QED or QCD. But I'm not certain.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics. QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, where the force between quarks becomes weaker at high energies. But QCD calculations often involve things like renormalization. Wait, but renormalization groups and regularization are related. I think QCD needs regularization because, without it, you get divergent loop integrals. Like in calculating beta functions and things. So QCD requires regularization, probably in the form of lattice QCD or other methods.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics. QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that QED does require regularization because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergences. For example, the electron self-energy has divergences that need to be handled. So regularization techniques like cutoff regularization or dimensional regularization are used in QED. So QED definitely requires regularization
