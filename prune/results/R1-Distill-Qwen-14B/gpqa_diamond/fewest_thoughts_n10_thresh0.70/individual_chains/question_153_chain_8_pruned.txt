Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives three separate reactions, A, B, and C, and asks what the products are. There are four options, each giving possible products for A, B, and C. Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. 

So, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because the enolate is stabilized by the two ester groups. The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this is probably something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the (E) configuration, so the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 attached to the p-tolyl group. Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Because acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, but in this case, the substituent is at the 3-position. So it's CH2-CH2-COO... no, wait. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- group. So for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent is on the third carbon of the acrylate chain, which would be the CH2 group adjacent to the COO-. So the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but wait, wait, the numbering. Acrylate is usually CH2=CHCOO-, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.
