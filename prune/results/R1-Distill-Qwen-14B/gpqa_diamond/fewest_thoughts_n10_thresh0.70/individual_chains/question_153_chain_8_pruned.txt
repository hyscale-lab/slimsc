Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction, and I need to figure out the right answer. Hmm, I remember the Michael reaction involves enolates attacking a beta position of another carbonyl compound. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants. I'll tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH as the base. Wait, NaOEt is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate. 

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO)2CH2. When it forms an enolate, the base abstracts a proton from the alpha carbon, creating a conjugate base. The structure would have a negative charge on the central carbon, making it a good nucleophile. 

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. Wait, no, more accurately, the structure is CH2=CH-C(OR)(R'), where R is p-tolyl and OR is OEt. So the acrylate has a double bond between C1 and C2, with the substituents on C2 being OEt and p-tolyl, and C1 is CH2. 

In the Michael addition, the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) will attack the beta position of the acrylate. Wait, no, wait. Actually, in the Michael reaction, the enolate is the nucleophile that attacks the alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl (the electrophilic part). So the acrylate is the Michael acceptor, and the malonate's enolate is the nucleophile.

So the enolate from dimethyl malonate has a structure where the negative charge is on the central carbon. When it attacks the beta position of the acrylate, which is the position adjacent to the carbonyl. So the acrylate is CH2=
