Okay, so I have this question about a genetics experiment gone wrong. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The setup is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a plasmid to overexpress this protein with an added hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and are checking expression, but it's not working as expected.

The problem is that they can't overexpress the protein. So, they looked into the construct and found that the plus strand sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. The sequence seems pretty long, so let me look for any issues.

Wait, the plus strand is the sense strand. Let me read the sequence again. It starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. Then a bunch of other codons. I'm wondering if there's something wrong with the termination or the reading frame.

Looking at the end of the sequence, I see a TGA. TGA is a stop codon. Wait, but where is it located? Let me count. The sequence is long, so I'll look for the end.

Wait, looking at the last part: ...GCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA. So the TGA is near the end. That should be the stop codon.

Hmm, but wait. The ATG is at the beginning, and the TGA is towards the end. So, the coding sequence starts with ATG and ends with TGA. That seems correct, right? But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. So, why?

Looking at the options:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. The problem is in the construct. The HA tag is at the N-terminus. If there's a mutation, it might affect binding. But the question says the construct's plus strand has this sequence. I don't see any obvious stop codons or frameshifts in the middle, but maybe the HA sequence is messed up. But wait, I'm not sure.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. So, maybe the ribosome is stopping before the end. But why would that happen? If there's a stop codon before the end, but the construct ends with TGA, which should be the stop. Unless there's an in-frame stop codon earlier.

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. A linker might provide a site for the protein to be processed. Without it, maybe the protein is getting degraded. But looking at the construct, the HA tag is added at the N-terminus. Do we have a linker? The coding sequence has the HA, then the GADD45G. If the HA is correctly added, but without a linker, perhaps the protein is being recognized as a foreign protein and getting degraded. Or maybe the lack of a linker causes misfolding leading to degradation.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, the stop codon is TGA here. So the question is, does the mouse have a tRNA for UAA? Wait, noâ€”tRNA doesn't recognize stop codons. Stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. So if the stop codon is TGA, the ribosome uses the release factor to terminate. So this option might not make sense.

Wait, let me think again. The plasmid is in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO cells), not mouse cells. Oh, wait no, the question says they're using CHO cells to test the expression. So the cells are CHO, not mouse. So the issue is whether the stop codon is correctly recognized in CHO cells.

CHO cells use the same genetic code as humans,
