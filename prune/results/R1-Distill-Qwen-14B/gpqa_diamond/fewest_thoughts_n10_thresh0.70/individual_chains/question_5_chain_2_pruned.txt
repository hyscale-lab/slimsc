Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator, specifically the muon's momentum operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

First, I remember that when dealing with angular momentum, the operator for each component (like P_x, P_y, P_z) has specific matrix representations. The problem gives me these matrices for each component. So, I think I need to construct the operator along the direction n. Since n is in the x-z plane, it must have components (nx, 0, nz). So, the direction is arbitrary but lies in x-z, meaning the angle theta (θ) is measured from the z-axis, but the phi (φ) must be zero because it's in the x-z plane. Or wait, wait, no. Actually, in spherical coordinates, the direction in the x-z plane would have phi = 0 or pi, but perhaps the exact value isn't needed here.

The operator P would be the vector operator, which in terms of components would be P = nx P_x + nz P_z. Because P is along n, which is in x-z, so the y-component (P_y) isn't involved. So, the operator we're considering is P = nx P_x + nz P_z.

Hmm, but wait, quantum mechanical operators are for angular momentum. Oh, wait, the operator here is probably the spin operator since we're dealing with a muon, which is a lepton with spin-1/2. So, the operator is the spin component in the n direction, right? So, the operator should be S·n, where S is the spin vector operator.

But wait, the problem states it's the operator P, but perhaps P is analogous to the spin operator. So, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which makes sense for a spin-1/2 particle. So, the eigenvector we're looking for is the eigenstate of S·n with eigenvalue ħ/2.

Now, the matrices given for P_x, P_y, P_z are each 2x2. Let me write them down as given:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator in the direction n is P = nx P_x + nz P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, ny is zero, so P_y doesn't contribute.

So, P = nx (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me factor out (ħ/2) as common:

P = (ħ/2) [ nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside:

nx is cos(theta), because in spherical coordinates, for direction n, nx = sin(theta) cos(phi), but since phi is zero (because in x-z plane), nx = sin(theta) * 1 (since cos(0)=1). Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the spherical coordinates. The unit vector in the x-z plane can be written as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since phi is zero, it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Alternatively, perhaps I should be careful. Wait, in spherical coordinates, θ is measured from the z-axis. So, for a direction in the x-z plane, the angle phi is zero or pi, but theta is the angle from the z-axis. So, the components would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So, n has components nx = sinθ, nz=cosθ. So, nx = sinθ, nz=cosθ.

So, the matrix becomes:

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that:

The [0,1;1,0] matrix multiplied by sinθ gives [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
The [1,0;0,-1] multiplied by cosθ gives [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]
Adding these together:

Top left: cosθ
Top right: sinθ
Bottom left: sinθ
Bottom right: -cosθ

So, the matrix is:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

And all multiplied by (ħ/2).

So, the operator is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

Now, the eigenvector we're looking for is the eigenstate of this operator with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, the eigenvalue equation is:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ> 

Wait, because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So, the matrix equation is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * (ħ/2) * |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

We can factor out (ħ/2) on both sides. So, the equation simplifies to:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

So, the matrix equation is:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a
