Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question involves identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data and then determining the product after a reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's give it a shot.

First, let's look at the IR data. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates an -OH stretch or maybe an -NH group. But wait, the strong peak around 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids have a higher wavenumber, around 1700 cm⁻¹ and a broad peak due to O-H stretch. Wait, but in the IR, the 3400-2500 cm⁻¹ region could be an O-H stretch. Let me think. If that's the case, then maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group. Also, there's a peak at 1610 cm⁻¹, which might be C=C stretching, like in an aromatic ring. And 1450 cm⁻¹ could be another aromatic peak, maybe C-O stretching or something else. Not sure about that part.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first is at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). A singlet around 10 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, but wait, wait. Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a triplet if next to CH2, but a singlet might mean it's not split. Alternatively, a phenolic -OH proton might be around 5 ppm, but that's not this. Wait, 10.5 is more like an aldehyde or maybe a carboxylic acid proton. But carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches around 10-12 ppm, but their protons are usually broad singlets. But wait, in the IR, we saw a carbonyl at 1720, which could be a ketone, but if it's a carboxylic acid, that would be around 1700. Hmm, maybe it's a ketone. So perhaps the 10.5 is an aldehyde instead... but wait, in that case, the aldehyde would be a triplet if next to CH2, but this is a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, looking at the other NMR signals. At 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, two protons as a doublet at 8.0 and another two at 7.2, which are also doublets. That suggests a substituent on the benzene ring causing the splitting. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, like a para-dimethyl group or something else.

Then, the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let me think about that. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) is probably a CH3 group attached to a CH2, like an ethyl chain. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, maybe as a CH(CH3) group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group next to another CH, perhaps part of an isobutyl group. So putting that together, maybe the structure has an isobutyl group attached somewhere.

Wait, let's put it all together. The aromatic protons suggest a para-substituted benzene. So maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. One substituent is a group that gives the IR and NMR data, and another substituent is an ethyl group or something else.

Wait, the NMR shows a 1.4 ppm d (3H), which is a methyl group attached to a CH, like in an isobutyl group. Wait, let's draw this out mentally. An isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, wait: iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, wait. Wait, iso-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH2-? No, wait, perhaps I should clarify. The structure of iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), no. Wait, iso-butyl group is actually CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but that's not right. Wait, no, the iso-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that's not correct. Wait, iso-butyl group is the substituent where the branching is on the second carbon. So it's -CH2-CH(CH2CH3), but that can't be right. Wait, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, wait, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, I'm getting confused. Let me think: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3, iso-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, the iso-butyl group is (CH2)2CHCH3? No, perhaps I should think of it as a four-carbon chain where the branching is on the second carbon. So it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that's perhaps not correct. Alternatively, the iso-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? Hmm, perhaps I should move on and then come back.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, so the structure could be something like CH(CH3)CH2CH2-. Hmm, perhaps it's part of a propyl chain. Or maybe it's a CH2CH(CH3) group. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl group, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid, and another substituent that's an isobutyl group.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So if it's a ketone, then the NMR would show a peak for the carbonyl adjacent protons. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid would have a peak around 1700, but here it's 1720, which is more like an ester or a ketone. Wait, maybe it's an ester. So ester carbonyls are around 1730-1750 cm⁻¹, so 1720 would fit, but then the O-H stretch would be around 2500-3000 as a broad peak, but in the IR data, the 3400-2500 region is a broad one, possibly O-H. But a carboxylic acid would have a peak around 2500-3000 cm⁻¹, but in this case, the IR shows a broad peak in 3400–2500, which might be due to an -OH stretch, perhaps from a carboxylic acid. So combining that, maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but let me look at the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) could be a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acids tend to have a broad singlet around 10-12 ppm, so that fits. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but if it's a benzoic acid, then the substituent would be a COOH group, and perhaps another substituent. Hmm.

Wait, but the NMR data also includes a 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 ppm (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), and 0.9 (t,3H). The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group, perhaps the end of an ethyl chain. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl attached to a CH. So maybe it's a CH(CH3) group attached to a CH2, which is connected to another CH2 group, perhaps?

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl group (like COOH) and another substituent which is an ethyl group in the para position. Or perhaps the substituent is a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl chain leading to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl group attached to an isobutyl group. Let me think: benzene-4-CO-R, where R is an isobutyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a ketone, like benzene-4-CO-CH2CH(CH3)2? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think about the reaction. The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that reaction: when a compound has a carbonyl group, especially a ketone or aldehyde, reacting with red phosphorus and HI (phosphorus halogenation) typically converts the carbonyl group into a bromide or iodide. So, for example, a ketone R-CO-R' would react to form R-CH2-R' with the release of CO and HX (like HI). Wait, but wait, the reaction is the Clemmensen reduction? No, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat. Wait, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is the HWE (Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii) reaction? No, that's for alpha-chlorination of carboxylic acids. Alternatively, when a carbonyl is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it's the reduction of the carbonyl group to a methylene group. So, for example, a ketone R-CO-R' would become R-CH2-R' after reaction with PH3/HI (maybe with some other conditions?), but wait, perhaps I'm mixing up reactions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the Halolactam rearrangement or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester. Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think again: red phosphorus and HI. Oh, wait! I think that reaction is used for the reduction of carbonyl groups to CH2 groups. So, a ketone (RCO R') would become RCH2 R' after reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Similarly, an aldehyde would become RCH2- group.

So, if the original compound X has a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde), then reacting it with red P and HI would reduce it to a CH2 group, replacing the carbonyl with a methylene group.

So, to find the product, I need to figure out the structure of compound X, then apply that reaction.

So, let me get back to the spectroscopic data of X.

So, possible structure of X. Let's think: the aromatic ring has two substituents in para positions. One substituent is a carbonyl-containing group (from the IR at 1720). The other substituent is a chain leading to an isobutyl group, perhaps.

Looking at the NMR again:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): likely a carboxylic acid proton.
- 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H): aromatic protons, suggesting para substitution.
- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): perhaps a CH group adjacent to another CH or CH2.
- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): maybe two protons in a CH2 group.
- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain.

Wait, putting this together: perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in one para position and an isobutyl group in the other. Wait, but then the NMR would have a singlet for the COOH proton at ~10 ppm, which matches. The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, which matches the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm signals.

But wait, the other groups: the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be the CH group in the isobutyl chain. So, if the substituent is an isobutyl group attached to the benzene ring, the structure would be, for example, 4-isobutylbenzoic acid.

Wait, but let's check the NMR for the isobutyl group. An isobutyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)2? Wait, no, iso-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)? No, wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. The iso-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. Hmm, wait, no. Let me think: the structure of iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)? No, wait, iso-butyl is actually (CH2)2CHCH3? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of the structure as CH2CH2CH(CH3)2? No, perhaps it's better to think of the iso-butyl group as (CH2)2CHCH3, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the group is a propyl chain with a methyl branch. Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Or maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene, with an ethyl chain. So, the NMR signals would be from that.

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH3)CH2CH2 group? Wait, that would make it a iso-pentyl group? Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, let me consider that the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the benzene. So, for example, benzene-4-CH2-CH(CH3)2. Wait, but then the NMR would show the CH(CH3)2 group. The CH(CH3)2 would have a singlet for the two methyl groups attached to CH, but that's not matching the data. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group with a branching. Let me think of the structure as benzene-4-CH2-CH(CH3)2. But then, the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 next to the benzene, a quartet for the CH(CH3)2, but that doesn't fit the given data. Hmm.

Alternatively, the substituent is a propyl group with a CH in the middle. So, the structure would be benzene-4-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, let's consider the NMR shifts again. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a triplet or multiplet for a CH group adjacent to another CH or CH2. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be a CH2 group next to a CH. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting that together, it looks like a chain: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, because the 0.9 is a triplet, which would come from a CH2CH3 group, so that's an ethyl chain. So perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that can't be right.

Wait, wait. Maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branching, like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Hmm, but then the NMR wouldn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So, the CH(CH3) would have neighboring CH2 groups. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be the two protons on the CH2 next to the CH(CH3), and the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) would be the CH(CH3) group. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is the methyl on CH(CH3), and the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is the terminal methyl from a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, but then where would the CH2CH3 group come from? Oh, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group. So the benzene is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH(CH3), which is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH2CH3. That would make the substituent a pentyl group, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So the benzene is connected to a CH2-CH2-CH(CH3). But then the NMR signals would need to fit that.

Wait, but the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a triplet, implying it's attached to a CH2 group. So it's likely the end of an ethyl chain, like -CH2CH3. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would then be a methyl attached to a CH, so maybe it's a -CH(CH3) group. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be the two protons on a CH2 attached to the CH(CH3). The 2.9 ppm is the CH group itself.

So, putting that together, the substituent on the benzene is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, making the substituent a propyl group with a branching.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So the substituent is a isopropyl group, but then the NMR wouldn't show a CH2CH3. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a butyl group, specifically an iso-butyl group. The iso-butyl group would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, iso-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the iso-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no. Let me think of iso-butyl as the substituent where the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a tert-butyl group, but that would have a singlet for the nine equivalent protons, which doesn't match the NMR data.

Wait, let's think about the NMR of an isobutyl group. The isobutyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. The CH2 group would be a triplet (coupled with the CH), the CH would be a septet (coupled with two CH2 groups), and the CH3 groups would be a triplet. But in the given data, the 1.4 ppm is a d (3H), which is a singlet for a methyl attached to a CH, and the 0.9 ppm is a triplet for a CH2CH3. So that doesn't fit the isobutyl group's NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, like -CH2CH2CH2-. But that's not consistent with the 1.4 ppm d (3H), which would suggest a methyl attached to a CH.

Hmm, maybe it's a 3-pentyl group or another structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)2 group. Then, the CH(CH3)2 would have a singlet for the two methyl groups, but that's not matching the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- group, making a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps it's a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. So, the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch. Then, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H),
- The CH2 adjacent to it at 1.7 ppm (m,2H),
- The CH3 attached to CH at 1.4 ppm (d,3H),
- And the terminal CH2CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

This seems to fit, so the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, that would be a 4-methylpentyl group or something similar.

Wait, but then the substituent would be a 3-pentyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think of the substituent as -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. But that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- group, making it a propyl group with a methyl branch. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)2 group, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- group, which would have a CH(CH3) in the middle, with CH2 groups on either side.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me try to sketch the structure based on the NMR data.

The aromatic part is a para-substituted benzene, so substituents at positions 1 and 4, for example. One substituent is a COOH group (since the 10.5 ppm is a singlet for the COOH proton), and the other substituent is a group that gives the other NMR signals.

The substituent on the benzene is a chain leading to a CH(CH3) group, which is connected to a CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. So the benzene is attached to a CH2, which is connected to a CH(CH3), which is connected to a CH2CH3. But then, the CH(CH3) would have neighboring CH2 groups.

So, for the substituent: benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would make the substituent a hexyl group, but that seems too long. Alternatively, maybe it's benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, making a pentyl group.

Wait, let me look at the NMR shifts again.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is likely the CH(CH3) group. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be the two protons on the CH2 next to CH(CH3). The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is the methyl attached to the CH. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is the terminal methyl from the CH2CH3 group.

So, the structure would be benzene ring with substituents at para positions: one is a COOH group, and the other is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group. Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group with a branch. Alternatively, perhaps it's benzene-4-COOH and benzene-1-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH2CH3. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the substituent is a shorter chain. Let me consider if the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch.

So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 and 4: one is COOH, the other is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but that would give the substituent as CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-, which is a three-carbon chain with a methyl branch. So, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

But then, the NMR of that group would have the CH(CH3) as 2.9 ppm (m,1H), the adjacent CH2 as 1.7 ppm (m,2H), the methyl as 1.4 ppm (d,3H), and the terminal CH2CH3 as 0.9 ppm (t,3H). Hmm, that fits.

So, the substituent on the benzene is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group? Wait, but that's a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- group attached to the benzene, making the substituent a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, but then the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-CH2CH3. No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)2 group. Then, the NMR would show the CH(CH3)2 as a septet, but that doesn't match the data.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. So, it's a butyl group with a methyl branch. Then, the substituent would be a iso-pentyl group. Wait, but I'm not sure about the nomenclature.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. So, the substituent would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3) group at 2.9 ppm (m,1H),
- The adjacent CH2 at 1.7 ppm (m,2H),
- The methyl attached to CH at 1.4 ppm (d,3H),
- And the terminal CH2CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

Wait, that makes sense. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, and the other substituent is a COOH group in the para position.

So, the structure of X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Yes, that matches. Because the substituents are on the para positions: one is COOH, the other is the sec-butyl group.

Now, the reaction: X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. As discussed earlier, this reaction reduces the carbonyl group to a methylene group. So, the COOH group (a carboxylic acid) would be converted to CH2 group. Wait, wait, no. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, the reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI. No, wait, the reaction I was thinking of is the reduction of a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) to CH2. But a carboxylic acid has a carbonyl group, but it's part of the -COOH group. So, reacting a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI would perhaps lead to the formation of a bromide or iodide, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction converts the -COOH into a CH2 group, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group in the carboxylic acid to a methylene group, turning the acid into a methyl group. Wait, but that doesn't make much sense because the carboxylic acid is R-COOH. If we reduce the carbonyl (C=O) to CH2, we'd get R-CH2-OH, which would be a primary alcohol. But the reaction conditions may vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the acid-catalyzed dehydration, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should look up this reaction. Red phosphorus with HI is used in the reduction of carbonyl groups. For example, in the reduction of ketones to alkanes. So, for a ketone R-CO-R', the reaction would produce R-CH2-R'.

So, in the case of a carboxylic acid, which is R-COOH, the reaction would reduce the -COOH to -CH2-OH. Wait, but that's not correct because the reduction would typically go from C=O to CH2. So, -COOH would become -CH2-OH, but that's not a stable product. Alternatively, perhaps it would form R-CH2-OH. But wait, I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the cleavage of the carbonyl group. So, in the case of benzoic acid (benzene-COOH), reacting with red phosphorus and HI would convert the COOH group into a CH2 group, so the product would be benzene-CH2-I or benzene-CH2-H, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen with iodide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the reaction. Another possibility is that the reaction is a substitution of the carbonyl group. So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the reaction would convert the -COOH group into -CH2-I. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group to a methylene group, turning the -COOH into -CH2-OH, which would be a primary alcohol. But then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them seem to match that. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

Wait, option C is the starting material. So, the reaction must be converting X (option C) into another structure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying X. Let me go back. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then upon reaction with red P and HI, what would happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into a bromide. Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible products in the options.

Looking at the options again:

Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So, that's a toluene derivative with isobutyl and methyl groups in the para positions.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, that's a benzene with a sec-butyl and methyl group in the para positions.

Wait, but in the starting material X, the substituents are COOH and sec-butyl. So, after the reaction, perhaps the COOH is converted into a CH2 group, making the substituents CH2 and sec-butyl in the para positions. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of CO2, but that's more like a decarboxylation, which would require heating, perhaps.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkyl iodide. So, the reaction might be substituting the carbonyl oxygen with iodide.

But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but that's more applicable to compounds with leaving groups.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group to a CH2 group, turning X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) into 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl iodide? Or perhaps it's converting the COOH to CH2-I.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into a methyl group, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the presence of a carbonyl group to form an alkane. So, the carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) is converted into a methylene group.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which has a carbonyl group, then the reaction would convert the carbonyl into a methylene group, resulting in 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl iodide? Or perhaps it's a different product.

Wait, but 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid has the structure:

Ph-COOH, where Ph is 4-(sec-butyl)phenyl.

After reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the COOH would be converted into CH2-I. So, the product would be Ph-CH2-I. But looking at the options, that's not present.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction replaces the carbonyl group with a methylene group, so the product would be Ph-CH2-.

Wait, but I'm not seeing that in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not acting on the carboxylic acid group but on another carbonyl group I missed.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that X is a carboxylic acid is wrong. Let me reevaluate the NMR and IR data.

The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which could be an ester, but the broad peak in 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ could be a carboxylic acid O-H. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde or a ketone. If it's a ketone, then the NMR wouldn't have a peak at 10.5 ppm, because ketones don't have protons on the carbonyl. So, the 10.5 ppm peak must be an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid.

So, the initial assumption that X is a carboxylic acid seems correct. Therefore, if the reaction converts the COOH group into a CH2 group, the product would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions.

But looking at the options, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which is para-xylene with an isobutyl group. Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, but in the starting material, there's a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions. After reaction, the COOH is converted to a CH2 group. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH2 group in the para position. But CH2 isn't a substituent; perhaps it's a methyl group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group to a methyl group. So, RCOOH becomes RCH3. So, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would become 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a methyl group in the para position. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the substituents would both be in the para position, but that would be the same as the original substituent.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction converts the COOH to a CH2 group, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH2 group. But that's not possible because benzene doesn't have a CH2 substituent; it has CH groups. Wait, perhaps the product is 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl iodide, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So, benzene with isobutyl and methyl in the para positions.

But in the starting material, the substituents are COOH and the sec-butyl group. After the reaction, if the COOH is converted into a CH2 group, perhaps the product is a toluene derivative with a CH2 group and a sec-butyl group. But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not acting on the carboxylic acid group but on another carbonyl group in the molecule. But wait, the initial assumption is that the compound is a carboxylic acid. Let me re-examine the IR data.

The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which could be a ketone. If the compound is a ketone and a para-substituted benzene, the NMR would have a peak around 2.1 ppm for the carbonyl adjacent CH3, but in this case, the NMR doesn't show that. So, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not a reduction but something else. Let me think: when a compound with a carbonyl group reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it forms an alkane. So, a ketone R-CO-R' becomes R-CH2-R'. So, in the case of X being a ketone attached to the benzene ring, the reaction would convert the ketone into a methylene group.

Wait, but if X is a ketone, like benzene-4-CO-R, then after the reaction, it would become benzene-4-CH2-R.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data again, the 10.5 ppm peak wouldn't be present in a ketone. So, perhaps X is a ketone and another group, but that doesn't fit with the IR data.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which matches the data I thought X had. So, if X is option C, then upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it would reduce the carbonyl group to CH2, so the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH2 group. But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is removing the COOH group. Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into an alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by an -O- group. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The question is to find the product after the reaction. The starting material X is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If the reaction converts the COOH group into a CH2 group, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH2 group in the para position. But that doesn't make sense because the product would have a CH2 group attached, which isn't possible for a benzene ring. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl iodide, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of CO2, leading to a benzene ring with a CH2 group. But that would require decarboxylation, which typically occurs under different conditions, like heating with a base.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not about the COOH group but about another group in the molecule. But I don't see another carbonyl in the NMR data.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the reaction is the substitution of the COOH group with an iodide. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)phenyl iodide. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the correct product is the replacement of the COOH with a CH2 group, making the substituent a CH2 group. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct option is option B or D.

Looking at option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a benzene ring with an isobutyl group and a methyl group in the para positions.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, a benzene ring with a sec-butyl and methyl group in the para positions.

Wait, perhaps the starting material X has a methyl group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions, but that doesn't fit with the initial data. Because the NMR data suggests a substituent with a methyl group attached to a CH, which would be part of a larger substituent, not a simple methyl.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the NMR. Let me reevaluate. The 10.5 ppm peak: in a carboxylic acid, the O-H proton is broad and around 10 ppm. So, that's correct. The aromatic protons are two doublets, suggesting para substitution.

The other signals: 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 ppm (m,2H), 1.4 ppm (d,3H), 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, benzene-4-COOH and benzene-1-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's a longer chain than necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, making the structure benzene-4-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3) group.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- group. The NMR would then show:

- The CH(CH3) at 2.9 ppm (m,1H),
- The adjacent CH2 groups at 1.7 and 0.9 ppm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group, leading to the NMR signals.

But I'm still not confident. Perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the correct starting material is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Then, upon reaction, the COOH is converted into a CH2 group.

But looking at the options, none of them match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in identifying X.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester. Let me think: the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ could be an ester. Then, the NMR would have a peak for the ester's CH3COO group. But the 10.5 ppm peak would not fit an ester, as esters don't have protons there. Unless it's an aldehyde, but then the IR would show a peak around 2800 cm⁻¹ as well.

Wait, perhaps the peak at 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton. So, the compound would be an aldehyde with a carbonyl group. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the aldehyde to a CH2 group.

So, if X is an aldehyde, like benzaldehyde derivative, then the product after reaction would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group where the aldehyde was.

But looking at the NMR again, the 10.5 ppm peak could be an aldehyde. So, perhaps the starting material is benzaldehyde with a substituent.

But then, the aromatic protons would be at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, which would fit a para-substituted benzaldehyde.

Wait, but then the other substituent would be a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Hmm, perhaps the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the aldehyde to a CH2 group, making 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 4-(sec-butyl)methylbenzene. But that would require the product to have a methyl group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions, which is option D.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, the product after reaction would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D.

But wait, let me check the NMR data again. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, then the NMR would have:

- A peak around 9.8-10 ppm for the aldehyde proton, which matches the 10.5 ppm peak.
- Aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches.
- The substituent's NMR: the CH(CH3) at 2.9 ppm, the adjacent CH2 at 1.7 ppm, the methyl at 1.4 ppm, and the terminal CH2CH3 at 0.9 ppm.

So, that would fit. Then, after reaction, the aldehyde group (-CHO) is converted to -CH2-, making the substituent a methyl group in the para position, along with the sec-butyl group.

So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.

So, the correct answer would be D.


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction involving Compound X, which has the following IR and NMR data:

### IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an -OH stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group, likely a carboxylic acid or ester.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching.

### NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH group adjacent to a CH(CH₃).
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH₂ group adjacent to a CH.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet, likely from a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, likely from a terminal CH₃ group in an ethyl chain.

### Reaction:
Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which is known to reduce carbonyl groups (e.g., carboxylic acids or aldehydes) to methylene (-CH₂-) groups.

### Analysis of Compound X:
- The IR and NMR data suggest that Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The para-substituted benzene has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sec-butyl group (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)).

### Reaction Outcome:
The reaction with red phosphorus and HI reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methylene group (-CH₂-), while the sec-butyl group remains unchanged. This results in the formation of **4-(sec-butyl)toluene**, which is a benzene ring with a methyl group (-CH₃) and a sec-butyl group in the para positions.

### Matching with Options:
- **Option A**: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid – Incorrect, as the reaction does not produce a propanoic acid derivative.
- **Option B**: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene – Incorrect, as the substituents do not match the reaction outcome.
- **Option C**: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid – Incorrect, as this is the starting material, not the product.
- **Option D**: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene – Correct, as it matches the product formed after the reduction of the carboxylic acid group.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

Answer: D
