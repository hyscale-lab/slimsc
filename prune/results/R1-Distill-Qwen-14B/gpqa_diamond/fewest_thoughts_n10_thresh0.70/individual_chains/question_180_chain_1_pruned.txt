Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about calculating the minimum energy of a system of charges. Okay, let me read it again.

So, there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their masses are negligible. 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system in Joules, correct to three decimals.

Wait, I remember that the potential energy in an electrostatic system is related to the configuration of charges. Since the system is isolated and we're looking for the minimum energy, I think this might involve the potential energy each charge contributes to the others.

Each charge is 2e. So each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge, which is like 2*1.6e-19 Coulombs. So 3.2e-19 C each.

Now, the 13th charge is fixed at point P, so let's call that charge Q. The other 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of these 12 charges is 2m away from Q. So Q is fixed at P, and the 12 are each 2 m away from P.

Wait, but how are the 12 arranged? Oh, but since they're constrained to stay at 2m from P, perhaps they're each at the same distance. But their exact
