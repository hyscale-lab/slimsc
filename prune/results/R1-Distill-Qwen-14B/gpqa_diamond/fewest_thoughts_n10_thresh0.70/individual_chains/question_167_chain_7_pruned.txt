Okay, so I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from quantum information theory.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N. Right, where alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase, and N is the normalization constant. Oh wait, N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). So for phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5, I'll need to compute N first.

Wait, let's plug in the values. phi is -pi/4. So sin(2*phi) would be sin(-pi/2) which is -1. Oh right, because 2*(-pi/4) is -pi/2. So sin(-pi/2) is -1. Then exp(-2*alpha²) with alpha=0.5. Let's compute 2*(0.5)^2 = 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 1/sqrt(e) which is about 0.6065. So N squared is 1 + (-1)*0.6065 = approximately 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) which is about 0.6275.

But wait, normalization requires that N is correct. So
