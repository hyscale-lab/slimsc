Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about two compounds, A and B, which when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce different diketones. I need to find out what A and B are from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that hydrochloric acid and sodium nitrite are involved in some kind of reaction. Oh right, I think it's related to the formation of carbocations or maybe some kind of nucleophilic substitution. Wait, wait. Oh! The nitrous acid conditions, like HCl and NaNO2, are used in the production of diazonium salts, but that's for aromatic amines. But wait, maybe it's something else. Oh, maybe it's the Beckmann rearrangement? I think that's when an oxime is treated with acid and rearranges to form an amide or something else. Or wait, another possibility: maybe it's the Stephen reduction? No, that's for ketones to aldehydes using H2S and a catalyst. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another thought. The reaction conditions here might be for the formation of carbamates or the like. Or perhaps it's about the formation of geminal diols. Oh! Wait, I think the treatment with HCl, NaNO2, and H2O could be leading to the formation of a carbonyl group through some kind of elimination. Or maybe it's about the Hofmann or Curtius rearrangement? No, those are for amides and such.

Wait a second, I recall that when a cyclic hemiacetal or something like that is treated with an acid, it might break down. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe this is about the formation of a ketone via the hydrolysis of a nitrile? No, that would involve different reagents.

Wait, another angle: the products are diketones. That means two ketone groups in each molecule. So the starting materials must somehow form two ketones. How can that happen? Oh! Maybe the starting materials have two alcohol groups that are adjacent or something, and under certain conditions, they get dehydrated to form ketones.
