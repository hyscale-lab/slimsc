Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and then looked at the target gene in each mutant. The changes are in the first exon area.

The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, I'm thinking about how mutations in the gene could affect the protein it produces. If the anti-nutritional compound is made by the protein from this gene, a mutation that disrupts the protein's function would be desirable.

The intact gene sequence is given, and each mutant has a change in the first exon. Exons are coding regions, so changes here can affect the amino acids in the protein.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The sequence changes from TCT to TAC in the first part. Let's see, the original is TCT (which is Ser), and mutant 1 has TAC (which is Tyr). So that's a substitution of Ser to Tyr. That's a missense mutation. Depending on the position, this might change the protein structure, but maybe not completely disrupt it.

Mutant 2: The change is from TCG to TAA. Let's see. Original is TCG (Ser), mutant is TAA. Wait, wait, TAA is a stop codon. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the mutant 2's sequence at that position is TAA. Wait, no, looking at the sequences:

Wait, the intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant 2's sequence is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

So, let me compare:

Original first part is TTTCTCGC...

Mutant 2: TTCTAAGC...

So in the original, it's TTTCTCGCTGGTACT..., while in mutant 2, it's TTCTAAGCTGGTACT...

Wait, maybe I should look at the exact location where the mutation occurs. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look at each change in the coding sequence.

Wait, perhaps I should compare the mutant sequences to the wild type to see what changes occur.

Let me write down the wild type (intact gene) and each mutant's changes.

Wild type: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, comparing the first parts:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT G...

So, the change is at position where in wild it's TTT CTC, in mutant1 it's TTC TAC.

Wait, the exact point where the change occurs: The wild has TTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant1: TTCTACGCTGGTACT....

Wait, so in the wild, the first few nucleotides are ATG TTT CTC GCT... So, the sequence is ATG followed by TTT, then CTC, then GCT, etc.

In mutant1, the sequence is ATG TTC TAC GCT...

So, the third codon in wild is CTC (Ser), and in mutant1, it's TAC (Tyr). So, the change is CTC → TAC.

Which is a substitution of Ser (CTC) to Tyr (TAC). So, that's a missense mutation; it changes one amino acid to another. Could affect the protein, but perhaps not a knockout.

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to wild:

Wild: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant2: ...TTCTAAGCTGGTACT...

So, the wild has TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant2 has TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT.

Wait, so the nucleotides after ATG are TTCTAAGCT...

Wild is TTTCTCGCT... So, in the wild, after ATG, it's TTT (Phe), then CTC (Ser), then
