Okay, so I'm faced with this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So I need to figure out the density of each option and see which one is the highest.

Let's look at each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So Earth's density is known. What's Earth's density again? I think Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So if this planet has the same mass and radius, its density would be the same as Earth's. So density for a would be 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, wait. But wait, the density is given as 5.5, same as Earth. So if the density is fixed, then the mass doesn't affect the density. So option b's density is 5.5.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, composition affects density. So if the composition is same as Earth, when mass increases, how does density change? Wait, Earth's composition is rock, metal, etc., which are dense. If the planet is more massive but same composition, does its size (radius) increase proportionally? Let's think: if you increase the mass while keeping composition same, the radius would increase, but how does that affect density?

Density is mass/volume. Volume is proportional to radius cubed
