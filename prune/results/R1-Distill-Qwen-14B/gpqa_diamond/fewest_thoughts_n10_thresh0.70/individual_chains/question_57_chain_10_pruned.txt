Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons, and I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. But wait, what's the exact formula?

The question gives me phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And I'm supposed to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. Oh right, these are the partial wave phase shifts for each angular momentum l. The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over these phase shifts, but I think the imaginary part specifically relates to the sum of the sine terms of these phase shifts.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l+1) * (sin δ_l) / (1 - cos δ_l) ) * e^{i(l δ_l)} ) * ... something with spherical Bessel functions or plane waves? No, wait, that's when you include all the terms. But maybe for the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ=0 degrees, we can simplify things.

Wait, when θ=0, the direction is along the incident beam. The imaginary part of the amplitude f(θ) at θ=0 is given by (1/k) times the sum from l=0 to L of (2l
