Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The options are four different structures, all seem to have a carboxylic acid group, maybe. Let me jot down the details.

First, the FTIR data: a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak around 3000 usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The strong peak at 1700 is probably a carbonyl group (C=O). Since the broad peak is at 3000, maybe it's a carboxylic acid because they have strong O-H stretches that are broad.

Then the 1H NMR data: several peaks, none are vinyl (so no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens). So the compound doesn't have any alkenes or aromatic rings, I think. Also, there are two specific signals mentioned. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets (that's a mouthful), and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that suggests some complex splitting due to neighboring protons.

Wait, what do those splitting terms mean? Let's break it down. A doublet is two peaks, a triplet is three, quartet four, etc. So a doublet of triplets would be each peak in the doublet splitting into triplets. But maybe I should think about how many neighboring protons each group has.

Looking at the structures given:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, perhaps I can draw the structures to visualize better. Let me try.

Option D: It's CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the central part is two CH groups each attached to CH3 and another CH group. So it's like CH2CH2-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH. Wait, no, wait. The formula is more like:

The main chain is probably something like -(CH2)-COOH, with substituents. Let me see each option's structure.

Option A: The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COO
