Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then there's something about a product of a keto acid reacting with X containing 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The question is asking about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm, I think I'll need to figure out what X, Y, W, G, and B are. Let me break it down.

First, the reaction: X reacts violently with Y to produce gas W and precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B.

Let me think about possible reactions. One common violent reaction could be a metal reacting with acid. For example, maybe X is a metal and Y is an acid like sulfuric or hydrochloric. The reaction would produce hydrogen gas (H2), which is a possibility for W.

But wait, the gas W's molecule has equal neutrons and protons. So each molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about simple gases. Hydrogen has H2. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so that's 0 neutrons and 1 proton per molecule, but that doesn't fit the condition. Wait, the molecule as a wholeâ€”each molecule would have same number of protons and neutrons. So for H2, each molecule has 2 protons (since 2 H atoms) and 0 neutrons. No, that's not equal. So that's not it.

Wait another gas: CO2. Each molecule has 22 neutrons? Let me think. Carbon has 6 pro
