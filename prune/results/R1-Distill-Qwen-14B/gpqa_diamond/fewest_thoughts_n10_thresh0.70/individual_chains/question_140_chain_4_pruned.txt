Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces gas W, a precipitate G, and some substance B. Let's see what I can figure out from each part.

First, substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. That makes me think of elements with common isotopes, like chlorine which has Cl-35 and Cl-37. So maybe X is something that has chlorine in it, but maybe it's the heavier isotope.

The reaction is violent, so perhaps it's a rapid reaction. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm. Wait, same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule? Or each molecule of W has the same number? Wait, the question says "molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." Oh wait, no, I think I misread. It says "the gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So each molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So the element in gas W has an atom where the number of neutrons equals protons. So that would mean for each atom, n = p. That would mean the isotope has a mass number of 2p, since mass = p + n. So 2p = mass number. So possible elements are maybe hydrogen (if it's H, then n=0, but that can't be). Wait, waitâ€”each atom in gas W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So each atom is an isotope where n = p. So possible atoms are: for example, carbon-12 (p=6, n=6), oxygen-16 (8 each), nitrogen-14 (7 each), etc. But wait, the gas is probably something common. Like CO2? No, wait, CO2 wouldn't have each molecule's atoms with n=p. Wait, no, the molecule as a whole? Or each atom in the molecule? The question says "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." Oh, wait, maybe I misread. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons in total. For example, if each molecule has one atom, and that atom has n = p. Or perhaps the molecule has a certain number of each.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. But I think each atom in the molecule has n = p. So possible atoms are:

- For example, carbon-12: 6 protons, 6 neutrons. So each atom in W would be C-12. But what gas would that form? CO2? No, that's not a gas with same n and p in each atom. Wait, perhaps the gas is carbon dioxide, but each carbon atom has n=p. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like CO (carbon monoxide). But each carbon would have to have n=p. So perhaps the gas is CO, where each C is C-12 and each O is O-16: C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons; O has 8 protons,
