Okay, so I have this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator models. But wait, the question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model or non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor accounts for the bond length changing during vibration, unlike the rigid rotor which assumes a fixed bond length.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I need to figure out the momentum of the photon involved.

First, let me think about what the fundamental state means. In quantum mechanics, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. For a diatomic molecule modeled as a rigid rotor, the energy levels are quantized and given by something like E_J = B J (J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number, and B is the rotational constant. But wait, this is the non-rigid rotor model, so maybe it's a bit different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is combining both rotation and vibration, like the rotation-vibration spectrum.

Wait, the problem gives me the angular frequency of vibration, w. Oh, right, so the molecule's vibration is considered, which is the stretching and compressing of the bond. So the energy levels for vibration are given by E_n = (n + ½) h w, where n is the vibrational quantum number. 

But wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy after absorption. So the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, so the next state would be the first excited state, but I'm a bit confused. Because in quantum mechanics, the energy transitions can involve both rotational and vibrational changes.

Wait, in the rotation-vibration spectrum, the molecule can change both vibrational and rotational states when it absorbs a photon. The fundamental vibrational transition is from n=0 to n=1. But when it does that, the rotational state can also change, typically by delta J = ±1. However, the problem says the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps it's considering the next state in terms of the overall energy, which would be the first excited vibrational state with the lowest rotational state? Or maybe the molecule is in the ground vibrational state and ground rotational state,
