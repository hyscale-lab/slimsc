Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me read the question again.

The question is asking which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density. The options are A to D, each corresponding to one of the a-d choices. So I need to compare each option's density.

Let me think about what I know. Density is mass divided by volume. So for each planet, I can calculate density using their mass and radius (since volume depends on radius).

Starting with option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Earth's density is around 5.5 g/cm³, right? Because Earth is mostly rock and metal. So option a would have a density of about 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but wait, the question says the planet's density is about 5.5. That's given, so that's straightforward. Hmm, but wait, I might be misreading. Oh, no, the option says the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5. So that's the given density. So that's 5.5.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Same composition implies same density as Earth, because density depends on composition. So if Earth is 5.5, this planet should also have 5.5. But wait, wait, same composition but more mass? Wait, same composition would mean same density, but let's think about it. The formula for density is mass over volume. If the planet has more mass but same composition, then its radius must be larger. Because if you add more mass without changing density, the radius increases. So for option c: same density as Earth, so 5.5. So the density is same as a and b.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition, so same density as Earth, which is 5.5. So same as a, b, and c.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options are different. Hmmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me re-read them.

Wait, option d says same composition as Earth but half the mass. Wait, same composition implies same density. So Earth's density is 5.
