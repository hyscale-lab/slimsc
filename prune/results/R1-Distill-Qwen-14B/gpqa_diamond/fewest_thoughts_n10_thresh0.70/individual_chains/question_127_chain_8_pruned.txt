Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about what happens when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. Hmm, I remember that heating can lead to certain reactions, like elimination or maybe rearrangements. Wait, but wait, what's the structure of 5-butylnona-2,6-diene?

Let me try to draw this structure. Nona means nine carbons. The diene is at positions 2 and 6, so the double bonds are between C2-C3 and C6-C7. And there's a butyl group at position 5. But butyl has four carbons. Oh wait, wait. Actually, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene would be a nine-carbon chain with a butyl substituent on the fifth carbon. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the numbering. Let me think. The main chain is nona (nine carbons). The substituent is a butyl group on carbon 5. So, the structure would be:

1   2       3   4   5                6   7   8   9
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2
