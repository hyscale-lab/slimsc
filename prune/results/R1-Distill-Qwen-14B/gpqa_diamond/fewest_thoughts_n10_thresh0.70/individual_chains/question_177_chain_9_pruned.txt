Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read the question carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Wait, the brightest wavelength is the peak emission for a black body, right? Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength given by Wien's Law.

Wien's Law says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So, if the peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be the same because lambda is the same. So T1 = T2. Got it.

The problem also mentions their radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but how does radial velocity affect the observed wavelength? Oh, that's the Doppler effect. But wait, the question says the astronomers found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, so I think that refers to the intrinsic peak, not the observed one. Because if they're moving, the observed wavelength would shift, but the question states the peak wavelengths are the same. So maybe the velocities don't directly affect the calculation here. Because their intrinsic (rest) wavelengths are the same, leading to same temperatures.

Now, the problem says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. So luminosity (L) of a star depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh wait, the Stefan-Boltzmann law. So L is proportional to R² T⁴.

Since we know that R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2 (because lambda_max same), let's plug these into the formula.

So L1 = (R1²) (T1⁴) = (1.5 R2)² * (T2⁴) = (2.25 R2²) * T2⁴.

And L2 = R2² * T2⁴.
