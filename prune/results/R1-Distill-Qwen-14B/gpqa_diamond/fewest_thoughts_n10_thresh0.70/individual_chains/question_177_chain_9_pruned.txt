Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question says.

Alright, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember something about blackbody radiation and the peak wavelength. Oh right, Wien's Law! The peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the star. So if both stars emit at the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Now, the stars are being treated as black bodies. So their luminosity, L, depends on their radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since we're comparing L1 and L2, the constants will cancel out.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2, let's plug these into the formula.

L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)² σ T²⁴
L2 = 4π R2² σ T⁴

So when I take the ratio L1/L2, it should be ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) / ( R2^2 ) ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

But since T1 = T2, the temperature terms cancel out. So it's (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. That would make option A (~2.25) correct, right?

Wait, but the question mentions radial velocities. Oh, right! The radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Hmm, how does that affect the observed wavelengths or the luminosity calculation?

Wait a second, the stars are moving, so their observed wavelengths might be Doppler shifted. The problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So their rest wavelengths are the same, but because of their motion, the observed wavelengths are the same, or the rest wavelengths are the same?

Wait, the question says, "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the observed wavelengths are the same. But wait, no. Let me think again. When a star is moving towards or away from us, its emitted wavelengths are shifted. But for the peak emission, which is determined by the star's temperature, the shift would affect the observed wavelength. But the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So if one star is moving towards us (blue shift) and the other moving away (red shift), but their observed emission peaks are at the same wavelength. Hmm, but in this problem, Star_1 has zero radial velocity, so no Doppler shift, while Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s. 

Wait
