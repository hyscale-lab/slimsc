Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, X has an isotope that's heavier than the usual one. Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, that makes me think W is probably H2O or something else where protons and neutrons are equal. Wait, but H2O: each H has 1 proton, O has 8. So water has H (1) and O (8). Wait, but in terms of each atom, H has 1p, 0n (if it's H-1). O has 8p and 8n (since oxygen's atomic number is 8, so neutral has 8 electrons, hence 8 protons, and its usual isotope is O-16, which has 8 neutrons). So the molecule H2O: each H has 1p and 0n, O has 8p and 8n. So total for the molecule: H2 has 2p, O has 8p. Total protons: 10. Neutrons: O has 8, H has 0 each. So total neutrons:8. Wait, but the question says gas W has same number of neutrons and protons in
