Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit overwhelmed, but I'll try to break it down step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene, and I have to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the given options. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me visualize that structure. 

So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (C(CH2CH3)3), and position 3 has a nitro group (-NO2). Wait, wait, noâ€”actually, numbering might be a bit different. Oh wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, and substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me think about the actual structure. 

Wait, benzene is symmetric, so the positions are relative, but the substituents' positions are fixed in the target. The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, numbering the ring, substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). Let me sketch this mentally: so, the substituents are in a meta arrangement relative to each other? Or maybe ortho and meta. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to figure out the order of reactions.

I remember that when you're doing electrophilic substitution reactions on benzene, the order in which substituents are added can affect the positions where new groups attach. So, the directing effects of the substituents matter a lot. For example, activating groups direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions (ortho/para), while deactivating groups direct them differently.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's think about their directing effects. Ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an O-alkyl group), so it's ortho/para-directing. The tert-butyl group is a bulky, activating, but it's a strong alkyl group, so it's also ortho/para-direct
