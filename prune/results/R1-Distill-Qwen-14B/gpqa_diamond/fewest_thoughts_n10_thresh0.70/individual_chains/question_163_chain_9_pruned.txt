Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry and pH calculations can be a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution using a monobasic strong acid. The goal is to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid needed and determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given, so I'll need to calculate both values to choose the correct option.

First, I need to figure out how much Fe(OH)3 I have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 will help here. Let me calculate that. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, and Hydrogen (H) is 1 g/mol. So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol. 

So the number of moles of Fe(OH)3 is mass divided by molar mass. That's 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Hmm, wait, maybe I should do it more accurately. Let me see: 106.85 is approximately 106.85, so 0.1 divided by that is roughly 0.000936 mol. So approximately 9.36e-4 moles.

Now, Fe(OH)3 is a triprotic base, I think. Because it has three OH- groups. So when it reacts with a strong acid like HCl, it should donate three H+ ions. The reaction would be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O.

So the stoichiometry is 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacting with 3 moles of H+ (from the acid). Since the acid is monobasic and strong, each mole of acid provides one mole of H+.

So for 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)3, I need 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 moles of H+ ions.

The acid solution is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter. So to find the volume needed, I can use M = n/V → V = n/M. 

So the volume of acid needed is 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have that. Let me check the options again. Option C is 28.05 cm³ and a pH of 2.04. Option B is 30.09 cm³ and pH 2.69, etc.

Wait, but I'm calculating the minimum volume needed to dissolve all the Fe(OH)3. So perhaps that's correct, but the problem mentions that the total volume is 100 cm³. Wait, no, wait. Let me re-read the question. It says, "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the solution's total volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³. Oh, so the acid is added to the solution, making the total volume 100 cm³. So I have to consider that the acid's volume is part of that 100 cm³. Hmm, that complicates things because the acid's volume affects the concentration.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again. The problem says that after adding the acid, the total volume is 100 cm³. So the solution's total volume after mixing is 100 cm³. So the acid's volume is part of that. So when I add V cm³ of acid, that's added to the initial solution's volume. Wait, but wait, what's the initial solution? If I'm dissolving Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³, perhaps the Fe(OH)3 is in a solution of 100 cm³, and I'm adding the acid to that, so the total volume would be 100 cm³ plus the acid's volume. Hmm, but that's not possible unless the acid's volume is negligible, which it's not. So maybe the question assumes that when you add the acid, the total volume becomes 100 cm³. So the acid's volume plus the solution's volume equals 100 cm³. Wait, but the initial solution's volume is probably close to 100 cm³, but maybe the acid is just a small volume. Alternatively, perhaps the solution volume is 100 cm
