Okay, so I've got this question about general relativity or differential geometry—something like that. The question gives a metric and asks about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is like a solution to Einstein's equations, especially in 2+1 dimensions, right? Or wait, maybe it's a 2D surface with some specific properties.

The metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) * (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a 2-dimensional metric because there are dx² and dy². But actually, pseudospheres are surfaces, so maybe this is in 3D? Hmm, wait, I might be confusing things. Let me think. Oh, wait, in 2D, a pseudosphere is a space with constant negative curvature. But the metric given here is in terms of x and y, so it's a 2-dimensional space, but perhaps embedded in 3D?

Wait, no, the metric is for a 2-dimensional surface because it's expressed in dx and dy. So the question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, but wait, in 2D, the pseudosphere would be a surface of revolution, right? Like the tractricoid.

But I'm a bit confused about the exact definition. Anyway, the main point is to find the area from the given metric. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So this is
