Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about rotavirus and immune response. Let me read through the question carefully.

So, the scenario is that they've tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and given them to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes showed high variability. The question is asking which process is taking place.

Hmm, I remember that Peyer patches are a type of lymphoid tissue in the small intestine. They're involved in mucosal immunity, right? So when the rotavirus proteins are given orally, they probably get taken up by these patches.

Stomach acid destroying some fluorescence makes sense because the stomach has low pH which can denature proteins. But the ones that made it through the stomach and intestinal mucus must have been taken up by the Peyer patches. Then, the cells there are proliferating. Sequencing the variable heavy chains shows high variability, which suggests something is causing the diversity in the B cells.

Looking at the options:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This is a process where B cells diversify their antibodies after the initial immune response. It occurs in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. It's a source of variability in the immune response.

B) Complement activation: That's part of the immune response, but it doesn't directly explain the variability in variable heavy chains. It's more about marking pathogens for destruction.

C) Class switching recombination: This changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't create new variable regions. The variable region is determined earlier.

D) VDJ recombination: This happens during the development of B cells in the bone marrow, where the variable, diversity, and joining segments are combined to create the unique antigen-binding sites. But this process happens early on, during lymphocyte development, not during a response.

So, in this scenario, the GFP-tagged capsid proteins are likely acting as antigens. In the Peyer patches, which are part of the immune tissue, B cells are activated. When B cells are activated, they form germinal centers where somatic hypermutation occurs. This process introduces point mutations in the variable regions of the B cell receptors, increasing the diversity of the immune response. High variability in the variable heavy chains suggests that this process has happened.

Wait, but why not VDJ recombination? Because VDJ is during the initial formation of B cells. But here, the cells are proliferating and showing new variations, which would be due to hypermutation after the initial response.

So the process taking place is somatic hypermutation, which is option A.


The question involves an experiment where GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are administered to mice via oral gavage. The experiment observes fluorescence destruction by stomach acid and entanglement in intestinal mucus, with some proteins reaching Peyer patches. Fluorescent Peyer patches are identified, and proliferating cells are isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells reveals high variability. The task is to determine which process is responsible for this variability.

Peyer patches are specialized lymphoid tissues in the small intestine involved in mucosal immunity. When rotavirus capsid proteins are ingested, they are likely taken up by these patches, where B cells are activated. High variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that diversifies the B cell receptors. 

**Option A (somatic hypermutation):** This process occurs in germinal centers of lymphoid tissues during the immune response. It introduces point mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors, increasing diversity. This matches the observed variability in the variable heavy chains.

**Option B (complement activation):** While complement activation is part of the immune response, it does not directly explain the variability in the variable heavy chains. It is more about marking pathogens for destruction.

**Option C (class switching recombination):** This process changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions of the B cell receptor, which are responsible for antigen binding.

**Option D (VDJ recombination):** This process occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments are combined to form unique antigen-binding sites. However, this happens early in development, not during a subsequent immune response.

Given the context, the observed variability in the variable heavy chains is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in the germinal centers of Peyer patches during the immune response. This process diversifies the B cell receptors, leading to the high variability seen in the experiment.

Answer: A
