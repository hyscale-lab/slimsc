Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion. Hmm, I remember that pions are subatomic particles, right? The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a Pi(+) pion decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. Oh wait, the pion is stationary, so that might simplify some things because the initial momentum is zero.

Let me jot down what I know. The rest mass of the Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. The neutrino is tricky because I think it has almost zero mass, so maybe we can neglect its rest energy. So the products are the muon and the neutrino. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products must be zero. That means the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. 

Wait, but how does that help me find their kinetic energies? Oh right, because the pion's rest mass is higher than the muon's, some energy must be converted into kinetic energy for the products.

I remember that in particle decays, the energy and momentum are conserved. So maybe I can use energy and momentum conservation here.

Let me think. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is negligible).

So energy conservation: E_pion = E_mu + E_nu.

And momentum conservation: since the initial momentum is zero, the vectors of the muon and neutrino momenta must add to zero. So p_mu = -p_nu, meaning their magnitudes are equal, p_mu = p_nu = p.

The energy of each particle is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). Since we're working in units where c=1 (like MeV and MeV/c etc.), maybe I can ignore c terms for simplicity.

So E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = sqrt( p^2 + m_nu^2 ). But m_nu is almost zero, so E_nu is approximately p.

So putting it together: 139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2 ) + p.

Hmm, solving for p. Let me let x = p.

So 139.6 = sqrt( x^2 + 105.7^2 ) + x.

Let me rearrange: sqrt(x^2 + 105.7^2 ) = 139.6 - x.

Now square both sides: x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2.

So left side is x^2 + 105.7^2, right is 139
