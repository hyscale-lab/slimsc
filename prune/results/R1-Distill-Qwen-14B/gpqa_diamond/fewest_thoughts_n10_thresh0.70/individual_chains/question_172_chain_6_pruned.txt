Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think this through. 

Alright, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation here probably refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy state relative to a lower one. I remember that in thermal equilibrium (which the question states, LTE), the population of energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann distribution.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature. The formula I recall is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ), where k_B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. 

In this case, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's call E the energy difference, so E = 1.38e-23 J. 

For star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. So the ratio n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or maybe the excitation potential is twice as much? Wait, no. Let me read again.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." Oh, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. So the ratio of the populations (n_upper/n_lower) is higher in star_1. So, I think that (n_upper/n_lower)_1 = 2 * (n_upper/n_lower)_2.

Let me set it up. Letâ€™s denote the ratio for star 1 as x and for star 2 as y. So x = 2y. But according to the Boltzmann equation, x = exp(-E/(k_B T1)) and y = exp(-E/(k_B T2)).

Wait wait, no. Because
