Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with the excitation of atoms in stars, the Boltzmann distribution comes into play. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium.

The question states that iron atoms in star_1 have twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, no, wait. The iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited. Oh, wait, actually, the problem says the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. So, the energy difference ΔE is given.

In LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula is n_j / n_i = (g_j/g_i) * exp( - (E_j - E_i)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So, in this problem, let's denote the two energy levels as i and j, with j being the higher energy level. The ratio of populations would be n_j / n_i = (g_j/g_i) * exp( - ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E_j - E_i.

Wait, but in the problem, it's observed that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited (n_j) as in star_2. Wait, no, the problem says the specific energy level is twice as excited. Wait, I think I need to parse the question again. 

Oh, it says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So, maybe the ratio of the number of atoms in that energy level in star_1 compared to star_2 is 2:1. Wait, no, the question isn't exactly clear. Let me read it again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." Hmm, perhaps the excitation refers to the number of atoms in that energy level. So for star_1, n_j = 2 * n_j' where n_j' is the same
