Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both systems exhibit eclipses, and their periods are given—2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. The periods are the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. So, the orbital period is the same as the eclipse period since eclipses happen when the stars are aligned along our line of sight.

Then, there's some spectroscopic data. For system_1, the two stars have radial velocity (RV) variations with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. I'm supposed to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm, okay. So the key here must be relating the radial velocity amplitudes to the masses of the stars in each system. I remember that in binary stars, the more massive star moves slower in its orbit, and the less massive one moves faster. So the RV amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses.

Wait, the formula I'm thinking of is that the velocity of each star is inversely proportional to its mass. So if star A has mass M_A and velocity v_A, and star B has mass M_B and velocity v_B, then M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A. Because the center of mass is stationary, their velocities are related by their masses.

Also, the orbital period is the same for both stars in a binary system. So the period P is the same for both.

Now, the mass function comes into play here. The mass function relates the mass of the companion to the observed velocities and the period. The formula is something like f(M) = (v^3 P) / (2π G), but wait, maybe it's more precise to think about the mass ratio.

Alternatively, the mass ratio q is M_secondary / M_primary. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Each star's velocity is given by v = (2π a) / P, where a is the semi-major axis of their orbit around the center of mass. But since the two stars are orbiting each other, their semi-major axes add up to the separation between them, a_total = a1 + a2. And from Newton's form of Kepler's third law: (M1 + M2) P^2 = (4π²/G) (a1 + a2)^3.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider the mass function or the relation between the velocities and the masses.

From the radial velocity measurements, the primary star's velocity (the one with the larger RV amplitude) must be the less massive star. Because the less massive star moves faster in orbit.

Wait, wait. So for system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5 km/s. So the primary (the one with higher RV) is the one moving faster. So let me say that star A has velocity 10 km/s, star B has 5. So M_A / M_B = v_B / v
