Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor tells us about the geometry of spacetime. But here, it seems like it's a two-dimensional metric because we only have dx and dy terms.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, what's the difference between a pseudosphere and a regular sphere? Oh, a sphere has positive curvature, while a pseudosphere has negative curvature, like a saddle shape.

The metric given looks a bit like a line element in some coordinate system. Let me try to understand the form of the metric. It's in terms of x and y, so perhaps it's a two-dimensional space. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which reminds me of the metric for a sphere, where you have terms like (r² - x² - y²) in the denominator. But wait, here the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which suggests that r² is 4, so r is 2. Oh, the radius is 2, as the question states.

Wait, but a regular sphere's metric in 2D would have something like (r² - x² - y²) in the denominator, but that's for polar coordinates.
