Alright, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The scenario is that I've synthesized a small peptidic compound. The 1H NMR of the crude compound mostly matches what's expected, except for two peaks that look like they come from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals, adding up to 1H. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the reason. Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So, what's going on here?

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. 

First, the NMR part: two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Normally, each proton should give a single peak. But having two peaks suggests something's splitting or causing the signal to split. But the question says that spin-spin coupling is ruled out. So it's not like a neighboring proton causing splitting. What else could cause duplicate peaks?

Wait, another possibility is that the molecule is exchanging between different environments. Like, maybe the compound has some sort of exchange process that's causing the proton to split the peak. Or perhaps the molecule is in different conformations that are rapidly interconverting, but in NMR times, that would usually average out. Hmm, but the peaks are separate, so maybe the exchange isn't fast enough, causing two distinct peaks. Alternatively, maybe it's a diastereomer situation. But wait, the options say something about that. Let me think.

The LC-MS part shows two peaks with the same mass. Same mass implies same molecular weight. So the molecular formula is the same, but perhaps different structures. But wait, the mass spectrum is consistent with the expected molecule, so maybe the same structure but different in some way that doesn't change the mass. But how?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If that were the case, the mass would be different. Because a precursor would have a lower mass (like the starting material before a reaction). But the question says the mass is consistent, so A might not fit.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so LC-MS would show two peaks if the column is ch
