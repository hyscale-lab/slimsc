Okay, so I've got this question about which physical theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, let's break it down.

I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. It's like a way to make the math work by introducing a temporary cutoff or some other method, and then you remove it in the end. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or have certain properties that prevent such divergences.

Looking at the options:

A) Superstring Theory. I think string theory deals with strings as fundamental particles instead of point particles. Since it's a theory that includes gravity and is a candidate for quantum gravity, maybe it handles high energies better. Oh wait, I've heard that string theories have a kind of "cutoff" naturally because they involve higher-dimensional spaces and maybe the strings themselves prevent the same kind of divergences. So perhaps superstring theory doesn't need regularization? Or does it? I'm not entirely sure.

B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, right? I remember that QCD calculations do require renormalization, which often involves dealing with divergences. But wait, since QCD is asymptotically free, at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, which might mean that perturbative methods work better. But do they still need regularization? I think they do because even with asymptotic freedom, you get divergences in loop calculations, so you need to regularize them before renormalizing.

C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established theory, but I know it has issues with divergent results in calculations like the electron self-energy. So they definitely use regularization in QED. Techniques like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, etc., are used here. So QED requires regularization.

D) Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, this is the non-quantum version. Classical theories don't have the same issues with infinities that quantum theories have. Like, in Maxwell's equations, you don't run into the same problems of point charges having infinite self-energy or electrons being able to radiate forever. Because in classical ED, you model things with fields and continuous charge distributions, so maybe it's finite and doesn't need regularization.

So the
