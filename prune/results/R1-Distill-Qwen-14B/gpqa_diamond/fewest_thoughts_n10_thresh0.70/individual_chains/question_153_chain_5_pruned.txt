Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the Michael addition reactions. I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The key here is that the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate. 

There are three separate reactions given, labeled (A), (B), and (C). Each has its own reactants and conditions, and I need to determine the major products. Let's take them one by one.

Starting with reaction (A): the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. 

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile, right? Because it's a di-carboxylate, so it's a strong electron donor. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw that structure. The acrylate has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, with a p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C6H4-CH2-OCH3, I think. Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt or something else? Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3, but wait, no, the acrylate group is CH2=CHCOO-. So in the case of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3? No, wait, maybe I confused the positions. Maybe it's CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 with a CH2 group attached to the p-tolyl? Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Hmm, no, maybe that's not right. Wait,
