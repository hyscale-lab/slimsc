Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is equal to c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The S matrix has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So, let me write that out.

So S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And Ay = c * S. So let's compute Ay. Since c is h/(4π), substituting that in:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ].

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Remember, eigenvalues come from solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So let's set up the matrix (Ay - aI). That would be:

[ -a      (-i h/(4π)) ]
[ (i h/(4π))  -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ].

Calculating that determinant: a² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))² ].

Wait, what's (-i)(i)? Let's compute that. (-i)*i = -i². i squared is -1, so that's -(-1) = 1. So the term becomes (1)*(h²/(16 π²)).

So the determinant equation is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So solving a² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π). Wait, wait, because the square root of (h^2)/(16 π^2) is h/(4π), right? Because (h/(4π))^2 is h²/(16 π²).

So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). But wait, looking at the options, option A says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because my eigenvalues are real. Oh wait, no, the eigenvalues are purely real here?

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think. Angular momentum operators usually have eigenvalues that are real. So in this case, Ay is a Hermitian operator? Because S is a Hermitian matrix? Let me check.

The matrix S is: [0, -i; i, 0]. The conjugate transpose would be [0, i; -i, 0]. Which is the same as S because the diagonal is zero, and the off-diagonal terms are negatives. So S is Hermitian. Then, since c is a real constant, Ay is also Hermitian. So the
