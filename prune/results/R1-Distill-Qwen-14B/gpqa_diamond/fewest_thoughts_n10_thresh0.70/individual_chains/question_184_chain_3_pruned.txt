Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D with a series of reactions. Hmm, I need to determine which sequence of reactions will give the desired product.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule. Let's see: the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, no. Wait, the numbering is 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro. Oh wait, benzene is a ring, so substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, does benzene have a 1, 2, 3 numbering? That would be adjacent positions. So the substituents are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So the substituents are meta to each other? Let me think.

Wait, when numbering benzene, the substituents are numbered in such a way that their positions are the lowest possible. So if the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, that's adjacent.

But wait, the structure is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene ring has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. That would make them adjacent. So ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2 (which is next to 1), and nitro at 3 (next to 2 and opposite to 1). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me imagine the benzene ring:

Positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent. So ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So the order is 1, 2, 3 in a row. That would mean ethoxy and tert-butyl are meta to each other, maybe? Or wait, in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 3 are meta, 2 is in between. So each substituent is adjacent, but in a ring, each position is next to two others.

But maybe the arrangement is such that ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3 (which is opposite to 1?), but no, wait, no, because 3 is next to 2 and 4. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the substituents' relative positions.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Their positions are 1, 2, and 3. So ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So the substituents are in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern.

Wait, but how can three substituents be arranged on a benzene ring? Each substitution directs the next substitution. So the order of substitution matters because each incoming group affects where the next group goes.

So, the plan is to figure out the order of substituents. Let's think about the directing effects of each group.

Nitro groups are meta directors. Ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an ether) and is ortho/para directing. Tert-butyl is a bulky group, which is a deactivating (since it's an alkyl group, but wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Alkyl groups are activating because they're electron-donating through induction, but bulky. So tert-butyl is an activating group, ortho/para-directing.

Wait, but wait, wait. Nitro is meta-directing, deactivating. Ethoxy is activating, ortho/
