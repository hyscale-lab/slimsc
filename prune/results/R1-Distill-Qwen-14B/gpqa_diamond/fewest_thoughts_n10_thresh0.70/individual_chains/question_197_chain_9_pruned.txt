Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product formed when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A, B, C, D, each a different organic compound.

First, I need to analyze the spectral data given. Let's start with the IR. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1.

IR peaks can tell us a lot about functional groups. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 suggests an -OH group because O-H stretches typically appear there. The very strong peak around 1720 cm-1 usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester or maybe an acid. Could it be a carboxylic acid? Wait, but wait; carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300, which is a bit lower than this. Alternatively, esters have carbonyls around 1730-1750. But wait, 1720 could be a ketone as well, but if there's an -OH peak, maybe it's an acid. Hmm.

Looking further, the peaks at 1610 and 1450 are in the range for aromatic rings. Those are probably C=C stretches in a benzene ring. So, the molecule probably has a benzene ring, a carbonyl group, and an -OH group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:

10.5 ppm: A broad singlet, integrating for 1H. That's a strong indication of an -OH proton. Or could it be an aldehyde? No, aldehyde protons are around 9-10, but they are usually sharp singlets. But this is a broad singlet, so more likely an -OH. So, maybe a carboxylic acid, since the -OH would be broad.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. In aromatic regions, a doublet could mean two equivalent protons adjacent to substituents. If the ring is para-substituted, the protons on each substituent are equivalent. So if a benzene ring has two substituents, maybe in para positions, the protons would be split into doublets.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, 2H. This could be the other set of protons on the benzene ring. So if the ring has two substituents, one in the para position, the adjacent protons would be split into these doublets. So the ring has substituents in the para positions, making this a para-disubstituted benzene.

Looking at the substituents: one substituent could be an -OH group (since that's in the IR) and another substituent that
