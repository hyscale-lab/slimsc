Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem is about identifying the product of a reaction involving Compound X. The reaction uses red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in the hydrolysis of certain functional groups, maybe something like an ester or an alkyne. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, when you have an ester reacting with HI under certain conditions, like with red phosphorus, it's probably a hydrolysis reaction, maybe leading to a carboxylic acid. Or wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, but that's more for elimination reactions. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh, wait, maybe it's about the cleavage of an ether or something else. Hmm, not sure yet.

Let me look at the data given for Compound X. The IR and NMR spectra are provided. I think starting with the IR might help. The IR has strong peaks around 3400-2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since the other peaks are at 1720, 1610, 1450, etc., maybe it's an ester group? Because 1720 is a strong carbonyl peak, which could be an ester (C=O). 1610 and 1450 might be C=C aromatic ring vibrations. 

Wait, the 1720 cm^-1 peak is a strong absorption, probably an ester (RCOOR'), but it could also be a ketone or maybe a nitrile, but nitriles are around 2200, so not that. So ester is more likely. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring with an ester group attached. 

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's a really high ppm, maybe an aldehyde proton? But wait, an aldehyde is around 9-10 ppm. But wait, a carboxylic acid would have a broad peak around 10
