Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many distinct hydrogen signals are in the 1H NMR of product 4. Hmm. Let's break this down step by step. I remember that each step involves a reaction, and each product's structure affects the next. So I need to track each reaction to understand the final structure.

First reaction: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Wait, what's that? Oh right, that's a bromination reaction. Acetic acid has a hydroxyl group, which is a good nucleophile. But wait, with bromine and pyridine, maybe it's a substitution. Oh, wait! I think that's the formation of an acyl bromide. Because when acetic acid reacts with acetic anhydride and Br2, it's a common way to make acetyl bromide. So product 1 would be CH3COBr, right? Because the OH in acetic acid gets replaced by Br. Yeah, that makes sense.

Second step: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid. What's that? Acid catalyst, so it's probably a nucleophilic substitution. Acetyl bromide (CH3COBr) reacting with ethanol. So the Br is replaced by OEt. So product 2 would be ethyl acetate, CH3COOEt. Because the bromide leaves, and the ethanol acts as a nucleophile. Yeah, that's the esterification reaction.

Third step:
