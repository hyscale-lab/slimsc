Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Lagrangian and figuring out the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) [γ_μ, γ_ν]. Oh right, the gamma matrices. So σ is an antisymmetric tensor made from the gamma matrices. 

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. I remember that in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the Lagrangian density has dimensions of [Mass]^4 in four spacetime dimensions. So the term κψ̄ σψ F must have dimension 4.

Wait, what's the dimension of each field here? Let's see. The Dirac spinor ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2, right? Because in 4D, the field ψ has [ψ] = [Mass]^(3/2), since the action (which is integral of Lagrangian) is dimensionless.

What about σ_{μν}? Since it's constructed from the gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (they're just matrices), and the commutator [γ_μ, γ_ν], which is also dimensionless. So σ_{μν} has the same dimension as [γ matrices], which is zero. Wait, but wait, no. Oh wait, the sigma is multiplied by i/2, but i is dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

Wait, wait, no—actually, σ_{μν} is a tensor of two gamma matrices. So each gamma matrix is dimensionless, so σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ ψ would have dimensions [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] = (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) = 3. 

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is a derivative of the gauge field A, so F has the same dimension as ∂μ Aν. The gauge field A has dimension 1, so ∂μ has dimension 1 (since it's d/dx, and x has dimension -1 in mass units). So F has dimension [∂] [A] = 1 + 1 = 2. 

So putting it together: κ * [ψ̄ σ ψ] [F] must be dimension 4.

So [κ] + [ψ̄ σ
