Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the expectation value of spin along the y-direction. Hmm, the electron is in the state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that notation means a two-component vector, right? So the spin state is a column vector with the first component 3i and the second component 4. 

The question is asking for the expectation value of S_y. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket notation: ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩, where Ô is the operator. For spin systems, the spin operator S along a direction is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix in that direction.

Oh right, S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the sigma_y matrix. The sigma_y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the operator S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

So, the state vector is ψ = [3i, 4]^T. To find the expectation value, I'll need to compute ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩.

Wait, let me write that out. The spinor ψ is a column vector, so its conjugate transpose (bra) would be a row vector [ -3 (since the conjugate of 3i is -3), 4 ].

So, the steps are:

1. Compute ψ† (the conjugate transpose of ψ), which is [ -3, 4 ].
2. Multiply this by the sigma_y matrix.
3. Then multiply the result by ψ.
4. Finally, multiply by ħ/2 to get the expectation value.

Alternatively, I can write it as ψ† * sigma_y * ψ * (ħ/2).

Let me break it down step by step.

First, ψ is [3i, 4]^T. So ψ† is [ -3, 4 ].

Now, sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when I compute ψ† sigma_y, that's a matrix multiplication.

Let me compute that: 

ψ† sigma_y = [ -3, 4 ] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Wait, no, wait. Matrix multiplication for a 1x2 times 2x2 gives 1
