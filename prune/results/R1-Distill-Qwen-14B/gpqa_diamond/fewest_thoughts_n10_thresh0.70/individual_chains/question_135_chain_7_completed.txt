Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the kinematically allowed decays of this boson X. The problem gives me the Lagrangian interaction term, and the mass of X is 6 GeV. Hmm, I remember that for a particle to decay into another pair of particles, the combined mass of those particles must be less than the mass of X. So first, I need to look at the possible fermions that X can interact with.

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse this better. So the interaction term is proportional to X times the fermion fields. That probably means that X couples to fermions with some coupling strength λ. So the fermions that X can decay into must be the ones present in this Lagrangian.

Wait, but the Lagrangian includes a term (v + X), so maybe the interaction is with the fermion ψ_f. Oh, right, because the term is X(y) times ψ_f bar times ψ_f. So that suggests X is a boson that couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. So X can decay into a pair of fermions ψ_f. But which fermions are we talking about here?

Hmm, the possible fermions depend on the types of particles that ψ_f represents. Wait, the problem doesn't specify which fermions are present. But wait, the options are given as decay channels into various quarks and leptons. So I need to figure out which fermions are light enough for X (6 GeV) to decay into them.

Wait, but maybe the ψ_f in the Lagrangian are all possible fermions, but for each decay channel, the mass of the fermions must be less than X's mass. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the sum of the masses is less than 6 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the fermions' rest mass is important. For example, top quark is about 173 GeV, which is way beyond 6 GeV. So if X is 6 GeV, it can't decay into top quarks because their mass is higher. Similarly, the bottom quark is around 4.7 GeV, so maybe X can decay into b quarks.

Wait, but wait, I think the process is X → f f-bar. So each f must have a mass less than X's mass (divided by 2, because each f has mass m, so 2m < M_X). So X is 6 GeV. So each fermion's mass must be less than 3 GeV. Because, you know, the rest mass of each fermion must be less than half of X's mass.

Wait, but let me think again. For a particle to decay into two particles, the mass of each must be less than the parent's mass. But for fermions, like quarks, their rest mass is a factor, but also, in the decay, the energy available in the rest frame is M_X, so the sum of the rest masses must be less than M_X. So for each fermion pair, 2m_fermion < M_X.

So M_X is 6 GeV. So 2m_f <6 → m_f <3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, that's correct. So each fermion's mass must be less than 3 GeV. So what fermions have masses less than 3 GeV?

Let me list the known fermion masses:

Leptons:
- Electron: ~0.511 MeV (negligible)
- Muon: ~105.7 MeV
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV

Quarks:
- Up: about 2.2 MeV
- Down: about 4.7 MeV
- Strange: ~100 MeV
- Charm: ~1.5 GeV (but wait, 1.5 is more than 3? No, 1.5 <3. So it's allowed)
Wait, wait, wait. Let me get accurate numbers.

Wait, the current masses:

Up quark: ~2.2 MeV (current quark mass)
Down: ~4.7 MeV
Strange: ~100 MeV
Charm: ~1.5 GeV (so 1500 MeV)
Bottom: ~4.7 GeV (so 4700 MeV)
Top: ~173 GeV

So for each fermion, if we're considering their rest masses, then when X (6 GeV) decays into f f-bar, each f must have mass < 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, in reality, the quarks are confined, so you can't have isolated quarks. But in the context of this question, perhaps X can decay into quark-antiquark pairs, which would form hadrons. But the question is about the possible decay products, regardless of whether they're observed as free particles or as hadrons (like jets). So for the purpose of this question, I think we can consider the quarks as possible decay products, assuming that the interaction allows it.

So let's see:

Which quarks have mass less than 3 GeV?

Charm: 1.5 GeV <3 → allowed.
Bottom: 4.7 GeV>3 → not allowed. So X can't decay into b quarks.

Wait, wait, but wait, wait. Wait, no, X is a boson that couples to ψ_f, which perhaps are all possible fermions. So which fermions have masses less than 3 GeV? Let's list them:

Leptons:

Electron: 0.511 MeV → allowed.

Muon: 105.7 MeV → allowed.

Tau: 1.78 GeV → 1.78 <3 → allowed.

Quarks:

Up: 2.2 MeV → allowed.

Down: 4.7 MeV → allowed.

Strange: about 100 MeV → allowed.

Charm: 1.5 GeV → allowed.

Bottom: 4.7 GeV → too heavy.

Top: way too heavy.

So X can decay into any of these fermion pairs as long as their combined mass is less than X's mass. Wait, but wait, the problem is that when X decays, each fermion must have a rest mass less than X/2.

So for each fermion f, 2m_f < M_X → m_f < M_X/2 =3 GeV.

So what fermions have m_f <3 GeV?

All except bottom and top.

So possible fermions are: u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Wait, but what about the masses of the up quark? Are they considered when X decays into u u-bar?

Hmm, but in reality, the up quark is so light that even with its mass, 2m_u is about 4.4 MeV, which is negligible compared to X's 6 GeV. So X can certainly decay into u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Wait, but wait, the decay into e+ e- would have 2m_e ≈ 1 MeV, which is way below 6 GeV. Similarly for mu and tau. So all these are allowed.

But wait, the problem is about the allowed decays at the lowest order. The interaction term is given as L = -λf ψ_f bar (v + X) ψ_f. So X couples to each fermion species f. So in principle, X can decay into any f f-bar pair, provided that 2 m_f < M_X.

So, the allowed decay channels for X are into each fermion species where m_f < 3 GeV.

So the possible fermions are:

- e, mu, tau (all leptons)
- u, d, s, c (quarks; bottom is too heavy)

So, the decay channels would be:

X → e+ e-
X → mu+ mu-
X → tau+ tau-
X → u u-bar
X → d d-bar
X → s s-bar
X → c c-bar

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option A says X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, b has mass 4.7 GeV, which is above 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar because 2m_b (around 9.4 GeV) is way above X's mass of 6 GeV.

So option A includes b, which is incorrect. So A is wrong.

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Ah, that's right. Because c has 1.5 GeV <3 GeV. So yes, allowed.

So option B includes c, which is allowed. It does not include b, which is correct.

But wait, I thought X could decay into c c-bar because 2 * 1.5 =3 GeV, which is equal to X's mass. Wait, wait, 2m_c is 3 GeV, and X is 6 GeV. So 3 GeV is exactly half, so that's allowed. So yes, X can decay into c c-bar.

Wait, but some might argue that the mass needs to be strictly less. So if 2m_c =3 GeV, then M_X=6 GeV, so 3 GeV is exactly half. So that's allowed. So option B includes c, which is correct.

Option C includes top quarks, which is impossible because m_t is 173 GeV. So C is wrong.

Option D includes b and tau, but not c. Wait no, option D includes b? Let me check.

Option D: X→ b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b is too heavy, so D can't be correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So according to that, B is correct.

Wait, but the options are as follows:

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Which matches the allowed fermions. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me recheck the possible fermions. So any fermion whose mass is less than 3 GeV can be a decay product. So the allowed fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. So for each, X can decay into the pair.

So the decay channels in option B are exactly these.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the interaction term is given as L = -λf ψ_f bar (v + X) ψ_f.

Wait, what's ψ_f? I think each ψ_f represents a particular fermion species. So the interaction term couples X to each fermion species f.

So X can decay into any of the f f-bar pairs allowed by mass.

So the possible decays are X→ f f-bar, where f is any of e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

But in the options, option B includes all of these. So option B says X can decay into c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term in the Lagrangian, \(-\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f (v + X) \psi_f\), indicates that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the combined rest mass of the fermion pair must satisfy \( 2m_f < M_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This implies \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays:
1. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.

2. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed ( \( 2m_b > M_X \) ).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed ( \( m_t \gg M_X \) ).

Thus, the allowed fermion pairs for \( X \to f \bar{f} \) are \( e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c} \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t \gg M_X \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
