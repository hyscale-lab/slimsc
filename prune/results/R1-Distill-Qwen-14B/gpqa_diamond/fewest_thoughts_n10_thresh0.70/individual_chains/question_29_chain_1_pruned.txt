Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The scenario is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar, which is good because droughts can ruin crops. But there's a problem: it has an anti-nutritional compound. That means it's not good for food because it's harmful or makes it hard to digest. So the goal is to eliminate this compound.

They found the gene responsible for this compound, and it's made of five exons and four introns. So, five exons mean the gene is split into five parts that are coding for the protein, and four introns are the non-coding parts in between.

They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants. EMS is ethyl methanesulfonate, which I remember is a mutagen that causes point mutations, typically adding methyl groups to DNA, leading to base changes. So they're looking for mutations in the gene that would stop the production of the anti-nutritional compound.

They sequenced the target gene in all mutants and found changes in the first exon area. So the mutations are in the first exon.

The question is, which mutation would most likely eliminate the compound. So we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. That could be a missense mutation (changing one amino acid) or a nonsense mutation (early stop codon), or perhaps a frameshift, but in this case, it's point mutations since EMS induces point mutations.

Looking at the options, the options are Mutant 1 through 4, each with a different sequence.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence compared to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So looking for differences. Let's compare each nucleotide. Let's line them up.

Intact: ATGTTT CTCGCT GGTACT TCTGTG GATGAA CATATT TATTGT C... etc.

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCT GGTACT TCTGTG GATGAA ... etc.

Wait, maybe I should write each position.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to see where each mutant differs.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The change is in the first part. Let's look at the first few nucleotides.

Intact: positions 1-20: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTA...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTA...

So comparing each position:

Position 4 in the intact is T. In Mutant 1, position 4 is T as well. Wait, perhaps I should break it down:

Wait, let me index each nucleotide.

Intact:

1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: C
7: T
8: C
9: G
10: C
11: T
12: G
13: G
14: T
15: A
16: C
17: T
18: T
19: C
20: G

Wait, maybe I should look for where each mutant differs.

Mutant 1:

5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Looking at each position:

1-3: same as intact (ATG)
4: T in intact, T in mutant (same)
5: T in intact, C in mutant. Ah, here's a change. So position 5: T -> C.

Wait, wait, let's see. Intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compare the sequences letter by letter.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, the first part:

Intact: ATGTTT CTCGCT GGTACT...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCT GGTACT...

So, the first part is different. Let me write them:

Intact: ATGTTT CTCGCT GGTACT...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCT GGTACT...

Wait, so the first four nucleotides are ATGT for both? Wait, let me check:

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the sequences as:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So, the first part of the intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

So, the change occurs after the ATG. Let's see:

After ATG, the next triplet in intact is TTT (positions 4-6: T T T), and in mutant 1 it's TTC (T T C) at positions 4-6. So, position 6: C instead of T.

Wait, but wait, the mutations are in the first exon. So any changes in the coding sequence could lead to changes in the protein.

But how does this affect the protein? Let's check the amino acids.

The start codon is ATG (Methionine, Met). Then the next codon in the intact gene is TTT, which is Phe (F). In Mutant 1, it's TTC, which is also Phe (since the third base is C instead of T; but in DNA, TTC would transcribe to AAG, which is Lys (K) in mRNA. Wait no, wait: DNA is read as template to mRNA. Let me think: DNA is transcribed into mRNA. mRNA is written as the same as the DNA but T becomes U.

Wait, the gene is DNA, so the mRNA would be complementary. So
