Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, the operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each of which is a 2x2 matrix scaled by ħ/2. So I think P is a vector operator, and we're looking for its eigenvector along some direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the direction can be described with an angle θ from, say, the z-axis. Since it's in the x-z plane, the angle φ would be 0 or something, but I think in spherical coordinates, any point in x-z would have φ=0 or π, but since it's arbitrary, maybe we can parameterize it with θ and φ=0. Or perhaps not, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

But the eigenvector is for the operator P along direction n. So the operator is P·n̂, where n̂ is the unit vector in the direction of n. Since n is in the x-z plane, n̂ would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but wait, since n is in x-z, φ=0, so n̂ becomes (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

Wait, no, x-z plane implies that the angle around the y-axis is either 0 or π. So φ is 0 or π, but since it's arbitrary, maybe we can just say φ=0 for simplicity because any direction in x-z can be represented with φ=0 and θ varying.

So the direction vector would then have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, the position vector is (r sinθ cosφ, r sinθ sinφ, r cosθ). But since φ=0, it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the operator P·n̂ would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction component. So P·n̂ = Px * (n_x) + Py * (n_y) + Pz * (n_z). But since n_y is zero because the direction is in x-z, the Py term drops out. So P·n̂ = Px * (sinθ) + Pz * cosθ.

Wait, no, wait, I think I have it the other way around. The direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so its components would be (a, 0, b), and since it's a unit vector, a² + b² = 1. Let me denote n_x = a, n_z = b. So n_x² +
