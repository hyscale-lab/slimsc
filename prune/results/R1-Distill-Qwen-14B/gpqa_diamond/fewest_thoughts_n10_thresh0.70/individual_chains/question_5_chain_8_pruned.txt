Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give me the components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. I need to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Hmm, right. So first, I remember that the operator P can be expressed in terms of its components. Since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), I think. So the operator P along direction n would be the dot product of n with the Pauli matrices.

Wait, no, operator P is given for each component. So the total operator P should be P = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz. But since n is in the x-z plane, ny is zero. So P = nx Px + nz Pz.

Wait, what's the direction? Oh, n is in x-z plane, so n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps, but since P is a vector operator, I'm probably looking at a spin-1/2 system. So the operator P would be the spin operator along direction n.

But wait, the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator is P = n · (Px, Py, Pz), but since n is in x-z, the y-component (ny) is zero. So P = nx Px + nz Pz.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The problem is about the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I need to find a vector |v> such that P|v> = (ħ/2)|v>.

So first, I should construct the matrix for P. Since P is nx Px + nz Pz, and since the direction is in x-z, it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps. But maybe I can express this
