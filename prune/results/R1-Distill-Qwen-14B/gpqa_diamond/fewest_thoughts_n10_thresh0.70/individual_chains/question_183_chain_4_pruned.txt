Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product after a reaction. Hmm, index of hydrogen deficiency—I remember that's the same as the degree of unsaturation. Right, each ring or double bond counts as one, and each triple bond as two, I think. So I need to figure out the structure of the product and then calculate its degree of unsaturation.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me draw its structure in my mind. So, cyclohexene—so a six-membered ring with a double bond. Wait, it's cyclohex-3-ene, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, I guess. Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group, which is a carbonyl attached to a methyl (since formyl is CHO). And at position 5, there's a vinyl group—vinyl is CH₂CH₂ but with a double bond, so it's CH₂CH₂ with a double bond, so it's a CH₂CH₂ where the CH₂ is attached to the ring. Wait, no—the vinyl group is CH₂=CH–, right? So the substituents are at positions 2 and 5. So the ring has a double bond between 3 and 4, a formyl at 2, and a vinyl at 5.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Wait, red phosphorus and HI—I remember that's a reaction to break alkenes. Like, the Prins reaction? Or maybe it's a hydrohalogenation? No, wait. Red phosphorus is used in the addition of HI to alkenes. I think when alkenes react with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it's a way to add HI across the double bond. But wait, isn't HI a strong acid and a good electrophile? Oh, but red phosphorus is used to prevent the formation of the carbocation, maybe? Or perhaps it's a way to facilitate the addition without rearrangement. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics. Let me think—another reaction I know is that when alkenes react with concentrated HI, especially with red phosphorus as a catalyst, it's for the formation of vicinal diiodides, but wait, that's more like when you have excess HI and the reaction is an addition across the double bond. Alternatively, perhaps red phosphorus is involved in the dehydrohalogenation or some other mechanism.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me recall: The reaction of alkenes with HI in the presence of red phosphorus is known as the hydroiodination reaction. Red phosphorus reacts with HI to form phosphorus triiodide (PI3), which is a good catalyst for the addition of HI to alkenes. So the process is similar to hydroboration, but in this case, it's adding HI across the double bond in a specific way. In this case, since HI is a strong acid, the addition would follow anti-Markovnikov orientation because the H adds to the less substituted carbon. Wait, no, wait—actually, when using HI with a catalyst like red phosphorus, the addition is typically anti-Markovnikov. But wait, I'm getting confused—another possibility is that the double bonds are being hydrogenated. But no, red phosphorus isn't typically used for hydrogenation; that's more like using H2 and a catalyst.

Wait another thought: Another reaction I remember is the addition of HI to alkenes leading to diiodides. But wait, the initial molecule has two double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring (cyclohex-3-ene) and one in the vinyl group (CH₂=CH–). So maybe both of these double bonds are reacting with HI.

Wait, the starting molecule has two double bonds: the cyclohexene ring (so a six-membered ring with a double bond) and the vinyl group (CH₂=CH–). So two double bonds in total.

So, when we add HI using red phosphorus, what happens? For each double bond, the HI would add across it. Let me think about each double bond.

First, the cyclohexene ring: when it reacts with HI, each double bond would open up. Let's say the cyclohexene ring's double bond is between C3 and C4. Adding HI across it would result in an addition product. Since HI is added in an anti-Markovnikov way, the H would add to the less substituted carbon. But wait, in a ring, both carbons in the double bond are similar in substitution. So perhaps it doesn't matter which way it adds. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexene would add two equivalents of HI, but wait, the reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI would lead to diaddition? Or is it a single addition?

Wait, no, I think each double bond can add one equivalent of HI. But since the reaction is with excess HI, maybe each double bond would add once. Let's think: the cyclohexene ring's double bond would add HI, and the vinyl group's double bond would also add HI. So each of the double bonds would become a single bond with two iodides attached.

So, the starting molecule has two double bonds. After reaction with HI (excess
