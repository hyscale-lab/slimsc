Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to form a product with two oxygen atoms.

The options given are A) 35, B)25, C)31, D)29. The question is asking for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Also, if there are multiple instances of an element, sum all their masses, whether they are heavier or lighter isotopes.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by figuring out what each part means.

First, the reaction part. Substance X reacts with liquid Y. The products are gas W and precipitate G. G, when heated, gives B. B's melting point is near 277 K. Wait, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, so B is probably a solid at room temperature but melts just above 0. Hmm, or wait, 277 K is 4°C. Maybe it's a solid that melts around that temperature. I'm not sure yet.

Gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. So the molecule must have an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let me think about possible gases. Maybe H2O? No, because H2O has 2 H (each 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and O with 8 protons and 8 neutrons. Wait, H2O's molecule has (2 H: 2 protons, 2×0 neutrons) total H protons is 2, O has 8 protons. So molecule has 10 protons. The neutrons: O has 8, H has 0 each, so 8. So protons 10, neutrons 8. Not equal.

What about CO2? CO2 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons usually) and two O (8 protons each, but wait, the molecule's
