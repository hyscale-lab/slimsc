Okay, let me try to work through this problem. It's a bit complicated, but I'll take it step by step.

So the question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, a precipitate G forms, and when G is heated, it releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. That's just above freezing point of water, so maybe B is something like ice, but wait, no, since 277 K is 4°C, perhaps B is a solid like something else. Maybe it's a metal like mercury, but no, mercury is liquid around room temp. Hmm, maybe B is something like ammonium chloride? Or maybe it's a substance that melts just above 0°C. Alternatively, maybe it's a salt that crystallizes at that temperature. Alternatively, perhaps B is water ice, but that would be 273 K, so a bit higher. Hmm, maybe I should think about what else could have a melting point around that.

The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Wait, if a molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, that's interesting. Let me think about possible gases. For example, H2O has 10 protons (since O is 8, H is 1 each) and neutrons in H2O: oxygen has 8 neutrons, H has 0 (assuming protium). So total neutrons: 8. But protons: 2 H atoms contribute 1 each, O contributes 8, total 10. So protons 10, neutrons 8. Not equal. So that's not W.

Another thought: CO2? Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's ^12C). Oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if ^16O). So CO2 molecule would have C:6 p, 6 n; each O:8 p, 8 n. So in the molecule, total protons:6 + 8*2 =22, total neutrons:6 +8*2=22. Oh!
