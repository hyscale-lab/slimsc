Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a star that's being observed by astronomers. The star has the same radius as the Sun, so R_star = R_sun. One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by these spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler since they have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spots are at 5000 K.

The problem states that because only one hemisphere is spotty, when we observe the star's brightness over time (photometric time-series), we'll see periodic variations due to the star rotating and the spots coming into and out of view. These variations can look similar to the presence of an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

The question is asking, if the star wasn't covered by these spots, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve? In other words, we need to find R_planet / R_star such that the dip in brightness when the planet transits is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

Hmm. So I think I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots and then find what planet radius would cause the same dip.

First, let's think about the brightness variation due to the spots. When a star has spots, the observed brightness changes as the spots rotate into and out of view. Because the spots are cooler, when they are on the visible side, the star's overall brightness decreases.

The star's total luminosity without spots is L0 = 4πR_star²σTeff⁴. But with spots, the effective area emitting at a lower temperature is (filling factor) * (area of hemisphere). Wait, wait. The filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots.

The hemisphere area is 2πR_star² (since a sphere is 4πR², so a hemisphere is half that). So the area of the hemisphere is 2πR².

So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Each spot has a lower temperature. The spots are T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K.

The total luminosity from the star when the spots are facing us would be the normal luminosity minus the luminosity from the spots (since they're cooler and emit less). So the change in luminosity would be the difference between the normal spot area and the cooler spot area.

The normal luminosity from the spotted area (without spots) would be (area of spots) * σTeff^4. But with spots, it's (area of spots) * σ(T_spot)^4.

So the dip in luminosity is the difference: ΔL = (area of spots) * σ(Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

Wait, no. Wait, the star's total luminosity without spots is L0 = 4πR²σTeff^4. When spots are present, the total luminosity is L = L0 - (filling factor * 2πR²) * σ(T_spot^4) + (filling factor * 2πR²) * σ(Teff^4)? No, wait, that's not right. Let me think again.

No, wait, the star's surface as seen from Earth is divided into the spotted area and the non-spotted area. The spotted area emits less. So the total luminosity is:

L = (Unspotted area) * σTeff^4 + (Spotted area) * σT_spot^4.

The unspotted area of the hemisphere is (1 - 0.2) * 2πR² = 0.8 * 2πR² = 1.6πR². The spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

So L = [1.6πR² * σTeff^4] + [0.4πR² * σT_spot^4].

The change in brightness when the spots are facing us compared to when they're not is the difference between the full star (no spots) and when the spots are visible.

Wait, but the full star without any spots would have a luminosity of L_full = 4πR²σTeff^4. But in our case, the star only has spots on one hemisphere. So when the spots are on the far side, the hemisphere we see is completely normal. When the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere comes into view, the luminosity is as calculated above.

Wait, but the star is
