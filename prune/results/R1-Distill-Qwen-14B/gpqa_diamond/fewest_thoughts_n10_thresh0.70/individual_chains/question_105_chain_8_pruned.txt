Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, it's about a star similar to the Sun, with some dark spots on one hemisphere. The question is about comparing the brightness variations caused by these spots to those that would be caused by an exoplanet. The goal is to find the radius of such a planet relative to the star that would produce the same signal.

Wait, so the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. Oh, right, the Sun's radius is often used as a baseline. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, so the filling factor is 0.2. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. But wait, waitâ€”no, the temperature difference is 1000K, but are the spots hotter or cooler? Oh, the spots are dark, so they're cooler. So their temperature is 6000 - 1000 = 5000K?

The star's brightness variations are due to rotational modulation. So as the star spins, the spots come into and go out of view from our perspective, causing dips in brightness. But since only one hemisphere is spotty, the brightness would vary as the star rotates, perhaps with a dip each time a spot comes into view.

The problem states that this situation can resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So when we look at the star's light curve, the dip when a spot is visible is similar to a planet transiting the star.

The question is asking, to produce the same amplitude in the brightness variation, what would be the radius of a planet relative to the star's radius? So in other words, what R_planet/R_star would give the same change in brightness as the spotted star.

Wait, but the star isn't completely spotty, just one hemisphere with spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (area of a hemisphere). Hmm, because one hemisphere is spotty, the spots cover 20% of that. So total area is 0.2
