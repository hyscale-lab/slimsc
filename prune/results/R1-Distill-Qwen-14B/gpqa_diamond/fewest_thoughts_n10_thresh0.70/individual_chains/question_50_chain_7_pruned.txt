Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem here. Let me read it again carefully. Hmm, the question is about determining the number of loops in a Feynman diagram based on the given "size estimate" expression. 

So, the note says: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I remember that loop diagrams in Feynman diagrams contribute terms that depend on factors like the coupling constants, the number of loops, and some factors from integrals over loop momenta.

I think the key is to look at the dependence on the number of loops. I recall that each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of (4π)^(-d), where d is the dimension, but wait, in 4D spacetime, each loop would contribute (4π)^(-4) or something like that? Or perhaps each loop brings a 1/(4π) factor. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think.

Wait, I remember that when you compute loop integrals in four dimensions, you often see factors like 1/(16π²) per loop because the integral in four dimensions has a volume factor proportional to (4π)^2, and perhaps another factor from the measure. So maybe each loop adds a 1/(16π²) term, which is (4π)^2? Hmm, no. Wait, the integral over the loop momentum in four dimensions would typically involve a factor like ∫d^4k/(2π)^4. So the (2π)^4 comes from the denominator, but when you evaluate it, you get factors like 1/(16π²) for each loop. So each loop brings a 1/(16π²) factor, which is 1/(4π)^2. Wait, 16 is 4 squared. So if each loop contributes 1/(4π)^2, then two loops would be (1/(4π)^2)^2 = 1/(4π)^4, but wait the given expression has 1/(4π)^6. So maybe the number of loops is three because 6 divided by 2 is three loops.

Wait, but let me think again. Let's see the exponents. The expression is 1/(4π)^6. So if each loop contributes (1/(4π)^2), then the exponent is 2 per loop
