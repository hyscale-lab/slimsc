Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. Let me break it down.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0. So, C is 9, H is 11, N is 1, O is 2. Plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5 degrees of unsaturation. So that could be like a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds, so 3 degrees) plus maybe an amide group or ester (another degree) and a double bond or ring somewhere else.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are broad peaks, probably from N-H or O-H stretching. But wait, the 3420 is medium to strong, and 3325 is also medium to strong. Hmm. O-H would be a broad peak, but maybe around 3200-3600. Alternatively, N-H stretching in amines or amides would also be around there. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is probably an ester or amide carbonyl. Ester carbonyls are usually around 1720-1740. Amide carbonyls are a bit lower, maybe 1680-1700. So 1720 is more like an ester.

Wait, but looking at the options: 

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. That would have an amide group. So the carbonyl peak would be lower, maybe 1680? Or maybe it's an amide II band? Not sure. Alternatively, if it's an ester, then the carbonyl is at 172
