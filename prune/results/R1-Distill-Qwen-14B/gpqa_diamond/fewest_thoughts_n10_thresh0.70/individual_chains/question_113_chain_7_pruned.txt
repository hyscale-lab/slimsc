Okay, I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and think through each step. So, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with similar structures, varying in the number of hydrogens and oxygen atoms.

The data given includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each piece of information.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. But wait, sometimes it's also C-H in alkanes or alkenes, but the broadness suggests O-H, like alcohol or maybe carboxylic acid. Oh, but wait, if it's a very broad peak, maybe it's an alcohol or something with hydrogen bonding, like a carbonyl group. Hmm, but I'll get back to that.

Then, two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are in the range of carbonyl groups. 1700 is typical for a carbonyl like a ketone or aldehyde, maybe an ester or acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, but lower, perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an amide? But wait, amides usually have lower wavenumbers, so maybe it's something else. Wait, another possibility: maybe the 1700 is a ketone or ester, and the 1650 could be an conjugated double bond, like an aromatic ring or a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, but wait. I recall that in some cases, a carbonyl can be conjugated with another group. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. In that case, the carbonyl peak might be around 1700, and the conjugated double bond might show a peak around 1650. So maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one carbonyl and some conjugated system.

Moving on to the 1H NMR spectrum. It mentions that there are several peaks, including those corresponding to
