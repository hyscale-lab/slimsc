Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the spectroscopy details. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Alright, let's break down each technique's data. Starting with the FTIR. The spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H groups because of hydrogen bonding. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, the question says "very broad"â€”so maybe it's an -OH stretch. Also, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, 1700 is a classic carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like C=C in a conjugated system) or an amide, but I don't think amides are in the options here.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond somewhere, maybe an alkene.

The Mass Spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about what fragments give 45. Common fragments include CH3O (but that's more like 31?), CO (28), maybe something else. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of something like (CH3)2O, which is 31, no. Oh, wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of HCOOCH3 (methyl formate), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment from a larger molecule. For example, in esters, if a molecule breaks at the ester group, you might get a fragment like CH3COO- something else, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, 45 could be a three-carbon fragment, like (CH2)2O or similar. Or maybe it's the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's higher. Hmm, not sure. I'll have to think about this more.

Now, the molecular formulas are all C6H something O and O2. Let's list the options:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

Let me think about each one. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation for each.

Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no N or X here.

For A) C6H12O2: C=6, H=1
