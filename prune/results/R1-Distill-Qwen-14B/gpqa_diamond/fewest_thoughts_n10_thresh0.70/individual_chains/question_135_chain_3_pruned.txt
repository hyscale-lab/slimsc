Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see what I can figure out. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given, but I don't think I need to get into the details of that because the problem is more about kinematics. Oh right, kinematically allowed decays depend on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions it can decay into.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So I need to find which fermion pairs the X can decay into. Fermions come in different types, right? Like quarks, leptons, etc. Each has their own mass.

First, I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the combined mass of the fermion pair must be less than or equal to the mass of the boson. Because energy and mass are related via E=mc², so the rest mass needs to be considered.

Wait, but fermions come in particles and antiparticles. So when X decays, it would produce a particle and its antiparticle. Like, say, a quark and an antiquark, or a lepton and antilepton.

So, the possible decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs. Now, each fermion has a certain mass. Let me list the masses of the known fermions:

Quarks:
- Up (u): around 2.2 MeV
- Down (d): around 4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): about 95 MeV
- Charm (c): around 1.3 GeV
- Bottom (b): about 4.5 GeV
- Top (t): way heavier, about 173 GeV

Leptons:
- Electron (e): 0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Neutr
