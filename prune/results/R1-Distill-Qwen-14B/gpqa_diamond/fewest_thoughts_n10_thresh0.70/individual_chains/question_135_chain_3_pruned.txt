Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question is about the possible decay products of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure if I need to use all the details from it. The Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f_bar(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, not entirely sure what that tells me, but maybe it's about which fermions the boson X interacts with.

Wait, the boson is interacting with fermions ψ_f, so the decay products would be pairs of these fermions. So the possible decay channels are into fermion-antifermion pairs. 

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So for each possible decay into a pair of particles, the combined mass of the pair must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, the rest mass of the parent must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. Otherwise, that decay isn't kinematically allowed.

So I need to figure out which fermions have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

The fermions we're considering are the quarks and leptons. Let me list their masses:

Quarks:
- Up (u): around 2 MeV (since it's light)
- Down (d): about 4-5 MeV
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- Bottom (b): around 4.5 GeV

Leptons:
- Electron (e-): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ-): ~105 MeV
- Tau (τ-): ~1.77 GeV

Wait, but when a boson decays into a fermion pair, it can be any pair as long as the total mass is less than or equal to the boson's mass. So for each fermion f, the mass of the pair would be 2m_f (since each has mass m_f, and for a pair you have two of them). Because the rest mass of
