Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down.

The question says it's a one-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed, v_max. The options are all different formulas, some involving c, the speed of light. So it's definitely a relativistic effect here.

Wait, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator would just be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², right? So the maximum speed would be sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic question, so I can't just use classical mechanics.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So the oscillator's maximum speed can't exceed c. But how does that affect the equations?

In the relativistic case, the energy isn't just kinetic plus potential; it's the total energy, which includes relativistic kinetic energy. Oh right, the relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², and the total energy would include the potential energy as well.

Wait, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². But in relativity, I'm not sure if that changes. I think in this problem, they're assuming that the potential energy still follows the classical form because it's just a force F = -kx. So the potential energy U is (1/2)kx².

So the total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. At maximum displacement, x = A, the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so all the energy is potential. Then, when it passes through the equilibrium point, all the energy is kinetic. Wait, but that's the classical case. In reality, due to relativity, I think the expressions are a bit more complicated.

Let me think. When the oscillator is at maximum displacement x=A, its speed is zero. So the total energy E is just the potential energy U(A) = (1/2)kA². Then, when it's at x=0, the speed is maximum, and all that potential energy has
