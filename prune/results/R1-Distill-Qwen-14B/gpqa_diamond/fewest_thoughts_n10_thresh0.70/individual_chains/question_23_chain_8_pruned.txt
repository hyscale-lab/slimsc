Okay, let me try to figure out this chemistry problem. So, the question is about an experiment where a specific compound is reacted with hydrogen bromide, and then they use TLC to check the reaction progress. The reactant spot has diminished, which means the reaction has started, and two new spots have formed, indicating two products.

The compound in question is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw that structure to visualize. So, it's a benzene ring with an oxy group attached, and the oxygen is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: the double bond starts at carbon 3. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that doesn't make sense because a four-carbon chain can't have a double bond at position 3. Oh wait, maybe I got the numbering wrong. Let me think again. The butenyl group is four carbons with a double bond. The substituent is at position 1, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, maybe the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 isn't right. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C2 and C3, right? Because the substituent is at position 1. So, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, no. Wait, but for a four-carbon chain, the double bond can be between C3 and C4, but that's the same as just being at the end. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me write the structure: the group is but-3-en-1-yl, which would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but at position 3. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH
