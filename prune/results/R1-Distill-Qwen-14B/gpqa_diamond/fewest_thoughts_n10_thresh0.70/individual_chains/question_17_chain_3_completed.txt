Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So the question is, what's the concentration of calcium ions when there's a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Oh wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant is a big number because it's a strong complex.

Wait, the problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So the complex is CaY^2- maybe? Because EDTA is usually Y^4- and when it complexes with Ca^2+, it forms CaY^2-. Right. So the complex is the product, and I need to find the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions.

I think the formula for the formation constant is Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA]). But wait, I'm a bit confused. The formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction is Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

In this solution, the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But wait, if the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, does that mean that the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M? I think so, because it's the concentration of the complex formed.

So the problem is like, given [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, Kf =5x10^10, find [Ca^2+].

But wait, what about the concentration of EDTA? Because EDTA is in solution as Y^4- or H4Y? Oh wait, no. At the given pH, which is ideal, the EDTA would be in the form that makes the formation constant valid. So I can assume that the EDTA is present as Y^4-? Or wait, I think the formation constant uses the concentration of EDTA^4- as the form. So if the pH is such that EDTA is deprotonated enough, then [EDTA^4-] is equal to the total EDTA concentration.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says we can assume the pH is ideal. So perhaps we can proceed under the assumption that the concentration of EDTA^4- is equal to the total EDTA in solution. But wait, wait, no. Because in the solution, the total EDTA would be the sum of all the species, but if Kf is so large, the majority of EDTA would be tied up in the complex. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's say that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since the complex is CaY^2-, that comes from 1 mole of Ca^2+ and 1 mole of EDTA^4-. So the reaction is Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-.

So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, that would imply that the moles of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are each 0.02 M? No, wait, because the complex formation is a 1:1 ratio. So if [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, then [Ca^2+] and [EDTA^4-] would be? Hmm, but wait, if the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, then the initial concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- would be 0.02 M each, but because the complex forms, they would decrease, and the complex increases.

Wait, but that's under the assumption that no complex was formed initially. But in this case, the given concentration is the complex. So maybe the setup is that the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, which implies that all the Ca^2+ is in the complex. But that can't be right because in reality, some Ca^2+ would dissociate.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the formation constant equation.

So, Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] )

Let me let s be the concentration of free Ca^2+.

So, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M (given).

What about [EDTA^4-]? Hmm, in the absence of other information, maybe we can assume that EDTA is in excess, but that may not be the case here. Alternatively, since the problem gives the concentration of the complex, perhaps the EDTA is just present as the complex and any free EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex.

Wait, but without knowing the initial concentrations, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is such that the concentration of EDTA^4- is negligible compared to the complex.

Wait, maybe I need to think about it as a 1:1 complex. Let me let x be the concentration of free Ca^2+.

Then, the concentration of free EDTA^4- would be y, but I'm not sure. Hmm, but in the complex, the EDTA is bound as Y^4-, so the free EDTA would be in solution as Y^4- and other species, but at the given pH, perhaps we can ignore other forms and assume that EDTA is almost entirely as Y^4-.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

When you have a complex, the concentration of the complex is equal to the amount that's formed. So the initial concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- would both be 0.02 M, assuming they only form the complex. But wait, no, because when they form the complex, the free [Ca^2+] and [EDTA^4-] would be lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are much higher than the Kf, but that's not the case here because Kf is very large, so the complex should form almost completely.

Wait, maybe the solution is that the concentration of free Ca^2+ is Kf^-1 multiplied by the concentration of the complex, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption is that the concentration of free EDTA is approximately equal to the concentration of free Ca^2+, due to the stoichiometry of the reaction. Because for each mole of CaEDTA^2- that dissociates, one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of EDTA^4- are produced.

So, let me model it that way.

Let the concentration of free Ca^2+ be x. Then, the concentration of free EDTA^4- would also be x, because each dissociation gives one of each.

So, substituting into the formation constant equation:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] )

Which is:

5e10 = 0.02 / (x * x )

So 5e10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-12 / 5 = 4e-13? Wait wait, no. Let me compute it again.

Wait, 0.02 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2) / (5e10) )= 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Hmm, wait 1e-6 is 1e-6, but 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13, so square root is 2 x 10^(-6.5) → which is 2 x (10^-6 * 10^-0.5) → 10^-0.5 is about 0.316. So x ≈ 2*0.316e-6 → 0.632e-6 → 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That's very close to what I just calculated.

So the concentration of Ca^2+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Alternatively, let me double-check the math. Let me write it again:

5e10 = 0.02 / (x²)

So x² = 0.02 /5e10 → 0.02 is 2e-2 → 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2 /5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. Wait, no, 2e-2 /5e10 = (2e-2) / (5e10) )= (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7 → 2 *3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7, so yes, approximately 6.3e-7 M.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant equation for the reaction:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is given as:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Here, the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M, and \(K_f = 5 \times 10^{10}\). Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) be \(x\). Since the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the concentration of free \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) is also \(x\). Substituting into the equation:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 2 \times 0.316 \times 10^{-6} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which matches option C.

**Answer: C**
