Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think. The question says it's a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, stochiometric means that the ratio is 1:1, right? So each Ca^2+ is bound to one EDTA^4-.

The given data is that the pH is ideal, which I guess means that the EDTA is in its correct deprotonated form to form the complex. The temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_ca-edta, is 5x10^10.

So, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions. The formation constant, Kf, is a measure of the stability of the complex. The higher the Kf, the more stable the complex.

The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Because the Ca is bound into the complex, the free Ca^2+ concentration should be really low, especially given such a high Kf.

Wait, the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the complex as CaY^2-, where Y is EDTA. So, the initial concentration of CaY^2- is 0.02 M. Since the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, all the calcium is bound into the complex. So, the complex dissociates as:

CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-

But wait, no, because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, but the formation is Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, maybe it's better to write the formation reaction. The formation of the complex is Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = Kf.

But in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. Assuming that the pH is such that EDTA is fully deprotonated (so [EDTA^4-] is high enough), so the reverse reaction (dissociation) is what we're looking at.

Wait, but if the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that the dissociation is minimal because Kf is large. So, the concentration of free Ca^2+ and free EDTA^4- would be very small.

Wait, but the problem is asking for [Ca^2+], right? So, let's set up the equation.

Let’s denote the concentration of free Ca^2+ as x. Similarly, the concentration of free EDTA^4- would be y. But wait, because the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-, for each mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of each ion is produced.

Wait, but if the initial concentration is 0.02 M of complex, and if some of it dissociates, the change would be:

At equilibrium:
[CaY^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kf is large so x is very small)
[Ca^2+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x (since each complex dissociates into one of each ion)

Wait, but wait. The formation constant is given as Kf = 5e10. So, Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

So, substitute:

5e10 = (0.02 - x)/(x * x)

But x is so small compared to 0.02 that 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So,

5e10 ≈ 0.02 / (x^2)

Solve for x^2:

x^2 ≈ 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2 /5 ) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So:

x^2 = (2e-2) / (5e10) ) = (2 /5 ) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, since 6.5*2=13.

Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, so 1e-6 squared is 1e-12. Hmm, wait, 2e-6 is 2 x 1e-6. So (2e-6)^2 is 4e-12. Oh wait, I think I messed up the exponents.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. So square root is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) → 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2 because 6.5 * 2 =13. So 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(4e-13):

sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7.

So 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7.

Wait, so x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches this.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.

So Kf = 5e10 = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

Assuming [CaY^2-] is approximately 0.02 M because x is so small.

So 5e10 = 0.02 / (x^2)

x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, no, 0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5?

Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, so 2e-6.5 is 2 * (1e-6.5) = 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7, which is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

So, yes, option C is correct.


To determine the concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is given as \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Assuming the dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K_f \), the equilibrium concentrations can be approximated as:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) at equilibrium be \( x \). Since the dissociation is minimal, \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.
