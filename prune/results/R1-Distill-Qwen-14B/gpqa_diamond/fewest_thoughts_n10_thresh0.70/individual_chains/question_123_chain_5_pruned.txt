Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, I need to figure out how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. 

The problem says that the supernova ejecta and the galaxy are both inertial frames. So, I guess that means I can use special relativity principles here because the frames are moving relative to each other and are inertial, not accelerating. 

Wait, the ejecta is moving towards the center of the galaxy. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. Oh right, that's a pretty high speed, 60,000 km/s. Since that's a significant fraction of the speed of light, I think relativistic effects might come into play here.

Let me recall the basics. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 1/5th the speed of light. That's beta (β) equals 0.2. Gamma factor (γ) is 1 over the square root of (1 - β²). Let me calculate that. 

Beta is 0.2, so beta squared is 0.04.  1 - 0.04 is 0.96. The square root of 0.96 is approximately 0.9798. So 1 divided by that is around 1.0208. So gamma is approximately 1.0208.

Now, time dilation comes into play. The time experienced in the galaxy's frame (let's call it T) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (t) by the gamma factor. So T = gamma * t.

Wait, but wait. The problem says 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So t is 50 seconds. So T would be gamma times that. Let me compute that. Gamma is approximately 1.0208, so T ≈ 1.0208 * 50 ≈ 51.04 seconds.

But wait, I'm not sure if I'm mixing up the frames. Let me think: in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s. 

Wait, no, because if one frame is moving at v relative to another, the other frame moves at -v in the first. But in terms of the problem description, the ejecta's frame sees the galaxy moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the galaxy's frame sees the ejecta moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy.

So, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s. So the distance it travels in that frame is velocity multiplied by the time it's been moving. But wait, what's the time in the galaxy's frame?

Wait, in the ejecta's frame, their time is t = 50 seconds. But the galaxy's frame will see this time as longer due to time dilation
