Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of quantum mechanics concepts. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about the uncertainty principle. It says an electron is moving at a speed v = 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nanometers. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the electron's energy ΔE. The options are A to D, with different orders of magnitude.

Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The formula I recall is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But wait, sometimes people use ΔxΔp ≈ ħ/2 or even just ħ, depending on the context. Since the question asks for the minimum uncertainty, I think it's using the equality, so ΔxΔp = ħ/2.

Wait, but when the problem says minimum uncertainty, that would correspond to the case where the product equals ħ/2. So that's the starting point.

So first, I need to find the uncertainty in momentum Δp. Once I have that, I can relate it to the uncertainty in energy ΔE. But how?

I know that the momentum p is related to velocity v and mass m by p = mv. But since we're dealing with uncertainties, the uncertainty in momentum Δp would be mΔv, assuming that Δv is small compared to v. Wait, but is that correct? Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of kinetic energy, which is (p²)/(2m). So the uncertainty in energy ΔE would come from the uncertainty in p squared, right?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the uncertainty in energy in terms of the momentum uncertainty. Since the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be (Δp)^2/(2m), approximately. Because the square of the uncertainty in p would contribute to the uncertainty in p squared, which is the numerator in the kinetic energy.

So putting it all together: first find Δp from the uncertainty principle, then compute ΔE as (Δp)^2/(2m).
