Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products there are.

Wait, first, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, wait, maybe that's a typo. Benzene derivatives are often named with the substituents in order of their positions. Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? Or is it a typo for 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Hmm. Wait, the structure would have a bromine at position 1 and a methyl group at position 2. Or maybe the "d" stands for something else. Oh, wait, maybe it's 2,4-dimethyl? But the question says 1-bromo-2-d. Hmm, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a bromine in position 1 and a deuterium (d) in position 2. Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, but the "d" is confusing.

Wait, maybe the compound is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because sometimes the 'd' might be a typo, or maybe it's a substituent. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromine on one position and a di-substituted something else. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe the "d" is a mistake, and the structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction first. The reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. That's a strong base, typically used for deprotonating compounds, especially in elimination or aromatic substitution reactions. In the context of benzene rings, NaNH2 is used for dehydrohalogenation or for forming aryl rings through elimination, perhaps for a coupling reaction.

Wait, another possibility: in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, a benzene ring with a leaving group like bromine might undergo elimination. Wait, but wait, benzene is an aromatic ring, and substituting a bromine with something else would require some kind of substitution.

Hmm, wait, maybe this is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation scenario, but no, because Friedel-Crafts uses AlCl3 as a catalyst, and the solvent is different. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that, the ring is usually activated towards nucleophilic attack, which often requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, but not sure if that's enough.

Wait, another thought: when NaNH2 is used with aryl halides, it can induce elimination reactions. For instance, in the benzidine rearrangement or something else, but perhaps more relevant is the formation of benzynes. Wait, benzynes are formed when a dihalobenzene undergoes dehalogenation, but in this case, we're starting with a mono-bromo compound. So that might not apply.

Alternatively, maybe this is a case where the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromine, leading to an elimination. So if the bromine is on position 1, and there's a hydrogen on position 2, the base could abstract that hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, that would form a diene, but with a leaving group (Br) already on C1. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the bromine is in position 1, and position 2 has a deuterium? Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene. So the ring has a Br at position 1 and two methyl groups at position 2? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,6-dimethylbenzene. Hmm, maybe the substituents are at positions 1 (Br), 2 (CH3), and 6 (CH3). Or perhaps just a single methyl at position 2.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction regardless. Let's say the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. So the structure is bromobenzene with a methyl group at the ortho position relative to bromine. When treated with NaNH2, which is a strong base, perhaps it abstracts a proton alpha to the bromine.

So if the bromine is at position 1, and the methyl is at position 2, then the alpha hydrogens would be at positions 3, 4, 5, and 6? Wait, no. Wait, the positions adjacent to the substituent would be positions ortho, meta, and para. Wait, but in this case, the methyl is at position 2, so the alpha hydrogens would be on the same carbon as the methyl? No, the methyl is at position 2, so the adjacent carbons are 1 (bromine), 3 (ortho to methyl), and 6 (ortho to methyl). Hmm, perhaps the hydrogen on position 3 or 6 are alpha to the bromine.

Wait, perhaps the base (NH2-) abstracts a hydrogen from position 2, but wait, position 2 has a methyl group. So, the hydrogens in position 3 or 4? Let me draw the structure.

Benzene ring with Br at position 1, methyl at position 2. So the substituents are at 1 and 2. So the adjacent positions would be 3, 4, 5, and 6. Wait, perhaps the hydrogen at position 3 is adjacent to both Br and methyl.

Wait, let me think about the mechanism. The base could abstract a proton that's adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a benzyl carbanion. Then, perhaps the bromide leaves, forming a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction, forming a benzene ring with a double bond, which would form a diradical or a benzyne intermediate.

Wait, but starting from 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, when treated with a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps we get dehydrohalogenation, removing H and Br, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. That would give an ortho-doubly substituted benzene, but wait, because the ring can't have a double bond adjacent to a substituent without some rearrangement.

Wait, but perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a carbanion next to Br. Then, the Br leaves as Br-, forming a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could then undergo some further reactions, possibly leading to elimination or ring expansion.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that, the ring needs to be electron-deficient. The Br is an electron-withdrawing group, but with only one substituent, it's unclear if that's sufficient for nucleophilic attack. Plus, NaNH2 is a strong base but perhaps doesn't supply a good nucleophile in this context.

Hmm, another thought: in the presence of NaNH2, perhaps the compound undergoes elimination, forming a benzene ring with two double bonds (a diene). But that seems unlikely because benzene is already aromatic. Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is replaced by a deprotonated species.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a benzene ring with a deprotonated position. Wait, but in this case, the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is aprotic. So perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a carbanion, which then could react further. But without a good electrophile, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination, leading to the formation of a benzyne intermediate. But for benzyne, you need two leaving groups, right? Because the base would extract a hydrogen from each of two adjacent positions, leading to the formation of a triple bond or a diradical, and then the loss of the two leaving groups (like two bromides) would form a triple bond. But in this case, we have only one bromide. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I should consider the possibility of forming an aryne. For that, you usually need a dihalide, but in this case, the starting material is a mono-halide. So maybe it's not going to form an aryne.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the bromide is replaced by an amide group. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile in that sense. Alternatively, perhaps the amide acts as a base, leading to deprotonation and elimination.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the solvent is liquid ammonia, which can act as a good solvent for such reactions. In that case, the reaction might be a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. But wait, benzene is already aromatic; adding another double bond would not be possible without disrupting the aromaticity.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else. But what? NaNH2 is providing NH2- as a base, but in this solvent, perhaps it's also a nucleophile. So maybe the Br is replaced by NH2, forming aniline. But wait, under such conditions, would that happen?

Wait, another possibility: in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, the compound might undergo elimination, resulting in the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond, which would be an antiaromatic compound, but those are not stable. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a strong electron-withdrawing group. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups in the starting material (assuming they are present) could influence the reactivity.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Let me think about that. Bromine at position 1, methyl at 2 and 4. So the structure looks like this: Br at 1, methyl at 2 and 4. Then, when treated with NaNH2, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, which is adjacent to the Br. Then, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2, and between C4 and C5? No, that's not possible because benzene is a ring with alternating double bonds. Alternatively, the elimination leads to the formation of a triple bond? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a ring contraction or expansion, but I don't recall such mechanisms.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction. For example, the Grignard-like reaction where NaNH2 facilitates the coupling of aryl halides. But in that case, you might form a biaryl compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is o-bromotoluene, which is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. When treated with a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps it undergoes an elimination reaction, producing toluene and HBr. But that would require the removal of two substituents, which doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, removing H and Br to form a double bond. So, the product would have a double bond between C1 and C2, making a ring with a substituent (methyl) on C2 and a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but in that case, the ring would have a double bond, but benzene already has three double bonds. So that would disrupt the aromaticity, which is not favorable. Hence, I'm probably on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the bromide is replaced by an amide group, but that would require a good nucleophilic environment, which might not be present here.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is the formation of a benzene ring with a cyano group or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, where the NH2- acts as a nucleophile. But for that, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which usually requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. Bromine is an EWG, but perhaps in combination with other groups, the ring could be activated.

If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the ring has two methyl groups (which are electron-donating) and a bromine (which is electron-withdrawing). So the ring is a bit conflicting in terms of activation. Wait, if the ring is activated in such a way that nucleophilic substitution is possible, then the NH2- could attack the ring, replacing the Br.

But wait, in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the substituents should be in the correct positions. Usually, the leaving group is activated by strong EWGs in positions that can stabilize the transition state, like para or ortho positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the NH2- replaces Br. Let's say that's possible, then the product would be 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is aniline derivative.

But wait, under what conditions does NaNH2 in ammonia cause substitution? I thought that for substitution, you usually need a good leaving group and a good nucleophile. Alternatively, in aromatic substitution, sometimes strong bases can deprotonate and facilitate elimination, but perhaps in this case, the substitution is possible.

But if the substitution occurs, then the product would be a single compound, right? So in that case, there's only one product. But the question is asking how many possible products, which suggests more than one.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to multiple substitution positions. For example, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and the substitution occurs at the bromine, then the product is 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene. But if elimination occurs, perhaps multiple products form.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is elimination, leading to the formation of a diradical or a triple bond, which could form different products based on where the elimination occurs. But if the starting material has symmetric substituents, perhaps only one product forms.

Wait, another angle: the starting material has methyl groups in positions 2 and 4. So, the structure is symmetric along the 1-3 axis. So, if elimination occurs, perhaps it can happen in more than one position, but due to symmetry, only one product forms.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of two different products. For example, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3 or position 5, leading to different sites of elimination.

Wait, let me try to imagine the structure: Br is at position 1, methyl groups at 2 and 4. The base could abstract a hydrogen from position 3 or position 5. If it abstracts position 3, then elimination would lead to a double bond between C1 and C2, along with the methyl at C2. Similarly, if it abstracts position 5, elimination would lead to a double bond between C1 and C6, but C6 doesn't have a substituent in this case.

Wait, but if the ring has methyl groups at 2 and 4, then the positions adjacent to Br (position 1) are 2 (methyl) and 6. So, the base could abstract a hydrogen from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and forming a double bond between 1 and 6. But position 6 doesn't have a methyl group. Wait, but then the product would have a double bond between 1 and 6, with methyl groups at 2 and 4.

Alternatively, the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, leading to a double bond between 2 and 3, but that's adjacent to the methyl group.

Wait, maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a conjugated diene. But in a benzene ring, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes non-aromatic, but that's not favorable.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible products. If the reaction is substitution, then one product. If elimination leads to different products based on where the H is abstracted, but due to symmetry, maybe two products.

Wait, wait. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, then the structure is symmetric along the axis through position 1 and 4. So, positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. So, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3 or 5, which are symmetric, leading to the same product. So perhaps only one product.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, which is adjacent to the Br, that would give a different product. But position 6 is adjacent to position 1 (Br), and position 2 (methyl) is adjacent to position 1 as well.

Wait, no, position 6 is adjacent to position 1 and position 5. So, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, then elimination would occur, leading to a double bond between 1 and 6. But position 6 is across from the methyl group at position 2, so that might form a different structure.

Wait, but if the starting material is symmetric, perhaps products from position 3 and 6 are different. So, how many distinct products would that lead to?

Wait, position 3 is meta to the methyl at position 2, and position 6 is para to it. So, eliminating from position 3 would give a different product than eliminating from position 6.

Wait, but in the starting material, the methyl groups are at positions 2 and 4. So, position 3 is between 2 and 4, and position 5 is between 4 and 6.

Wait, perhaps the elimination from position 3 would result in a double bond between 1 and 2, but position 2 already has a methyl. So that might not be possible. Alternatively, elimination from position 6 would result in a double bond between 1 and 6.

But wait, can a double bond be formed between position 1 and 6 in a benzene ring? That would require breaking the existing bonds and forming a new double bond, which might not be feasible because benzene is already aromatic.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another approach. The reaction conditions are NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. This is a strong base, and in such conditions, sometimes elimination reactions occur, such as the formation of alkynes from dihalides, or the formation of benzynes.

Wait, but for benzynes, you need two halogen atoms adjacent to each other. Since our starting material has only one Br, that's not possible. So, perhaps elimination isn't feasible here.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and the reaction leads to the formation of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (toluene derivative) by eliminating HBr. So, the Br leaves, and a hydrogen is abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond, which then maybe isn't possible because of aromaticity. Alternatively, perhaps the Br is replaced by a hydrogen, but that's substitution, which would require a proton source, but NaNH2 is a base, not a proton donor.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group (NH2), but with the solvent being ammonia, which is a good source of NH2-.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if substitution occurs, and the Br is replaced by NH2, then the product would be 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene. But I'm not sure if that's the case under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. But as I thought earlier, that would disrupt the aromaticity, which is not favorable.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and no product forms. But that's not one of the options. The options start at 1.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of the possible products when a bromobenzene derivative is treated with NaNH2. For example, in the case of bromobenzene, NaNH2 would deprotonate it, but perhaps in this case, it leads to some elimination.

Wait, another approach: the number of possible products depends on the number of possible sites where elimination or substitution can occur. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, then possible sites for elimination are positions 3, 5, and 6. But due to symmetry, some positions may lead to the same product.

Wait, if the starting material is symmetric, then elimination at position 3 and position 5 would give the same product because the ring can rotate. Similarly, elimination at position 6 would give a different product.

So, that would lead to two possible products: one from elimination at positions 3 or 5, and another from elimination at position 6.

Wait, but wait, when you eliminate from position 3, you lose H from 3 and Br from 1, forming a double bond between 1 and 2, but position 2 has a methyl group. So, that might not be possible because forming a double bond between C1 and C2 would be adjacent to the methyl group. Alternatively, maybe the ring can't form that double bond due to steric hindrance or because it disrupts the aromaticity.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination from position 6 would form a double bond between C1 and C6, which is adjacent to the methyl at C2. Wait, but C6 is adjacent to C5 and C1. So, maybe the double bond would be between C1 and C2 (as that's adjacent to the methyl at C2) or between C1 and C6.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond, but that's not possible because benzene already has all the necessary double bonds. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to a benzene ring with a triple bond, but that's even less likely.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possibility of the starting material being 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene and the reaction leading to the formation of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (toluene derivative) by eliminating HBr.

But how? That would require the loss of H and Br from adjacent positions. But in the starting material, Br is at position 1, adjacent to position 2 (methyl) and position 6. So, for elimination, the base would abstract a hydrogen from position 6, and the Br would leave, leading to a double bond between 1 and 6.

But that's not possible because benzene already has all its double bonds in place. Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes non-aromatic, but that's not favorable.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option in the choices.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzyl anion, which could then react further, but without an electrophile, perhaps it doesn't.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a coupling reaction where the bromine is replaced by an aryl group, but that would require a specific setup, like a Ullmann reaction, which uses copper catalysts. Since NaNH2 is the reagent, that might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is simply a substitution where the bromide is replaced by an amide group, leading to a single product. So, only one product forms, which would correspond to option B) 1.

But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a deuterium, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let me think about the possible products again.

If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and the reaction is a substitution where Br is replaced by NH2, then the product is 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene. That's one product.

If elimination occurs, perhaps two products form, depending on where the elimination happens. But if the starting material is symmetric, maybe only two products are possible.

Wait, but the starting material has two methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. So, positions 3 and 5 are equivalent, and position 6 is unique. If elimination occurs at position 3 or 5, due to symmetry, it would give the same product. If elimination occurs at position 6, it would give a different product. So, that's two possible products.

But wait, can elimination occur at position 6? Let's see: the Br is at position 1. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 has a methyl group, so the H available for abstraction would be at position 6. So, the base could abstract H from position 6, leading to the formation of a double bond between 1 and 6. But in that case, the ring would have a double bond, but benzene is already aromatic, so that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction doesn't lead to elimination but substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a deprotonated site. But without an electrophile, perhaps that's not feasible.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that to happen, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack. Bromine is an EWG, but in this case, there are methyl groups which are EDGs. The methyl groups are in positions 2 and 4, which are ortho and para to the bromine. So, perhaps the ring is activated in such a way that substitution is possible.

In that case, the NH2- would attack the ring, replacing the Br. Since the ring has symmetry, perhaps the substitution could occur in more than one position, but given the substituents, substitution would only be possible at the bromine position.

Wait, but the bromine is in position 1, so substitution would replace it with amino. But in that case, there's only one product: 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene.

So that would be one product. So, the answer would be option B) 1.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps during the reaction, the amino group can attack at different positions, but in this case, the ring is symmetric. So, the substitution would only occur at the bromine site, leading to a single product.

Alternatively, maybe there's another outcome.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option here.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with two substituents: an amino group and the methyl groups. But that's substitution, leading to one product.

Wait, I'm getting stuck between substitution leading to one product and elimination leading to, perhaps, two products.

Wait, another approach: the number of possible products depends on whether the reaction leads to substitution or elimination, and how many distinct products each would yield.

If substitution occurs, only one product. If elimination occurs, perhaps two products. So, the total number of products would be one plus two, but that's three. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but if the reaction leads to substitution, it's one product. If elimination leads to two products, but maybe only one is possible due to the structure, then the total products would be one (substitution) plus one (elimination) = two.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via substitution but via elimination, leading to two products: one from elimination at position 3/5 and another at position 6. But I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Wait, but in reality, NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, typically used for deprotonating compounds. So, perhaps the reaction is deprotonating the compound, leading to a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbanion, but without an electrophile, that's not leading to a product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for similar reactions. When an aryl bromide is treated with a strong base like NaNH2, what happens?

Wait, I remember that in some cases, aryl halides can undergo elimination to form alkynes, but that usually requires two halogen atoms adjacent to each other. Since our starting material has only one bromine, that's not applicable.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen that's alpha to the Br, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbanion, which could then lose the Br- as a leaving group, forming a new bond. But without an electrophile, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps this leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a new substituent, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible products and their number more carefully.

If substitution occurs, product is 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene (one product).

If elimination leads to two possible products (due to different sites of elimination), then substitution plus elimination would give three products. But I'm not sure if elimination is feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination isn't possible, leading to only substitution as the product, which is one product.

But I'm not certain about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option.

Wait, another angle: in the starting material, 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the methyl groups are in positions 2 and 4. So, the molecule is symmetric along the axis through position 1 and 4. So, any elimination that occurs on one side would mirror on the other, leading to the same product.

So, if elimination occurs at position 3, which is equivalent to position 5 due to symmetry, then only one product from elimination. If elimination also occurs at position 6, which is unique, that would give a second product. So, substitution (1 product) plus elimination (2 products) would total three products. But I'm not sure if substitution or elimination is the main pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps only elimination occurs, leading to two products.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the possible products.

If the reaction leads to substitution, then one product. If elimination leads to two products, then total products would be three.

But I'm not sure which is the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to one product via substitution and another via elimination, totaling two products.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is two products. So, option C) 2.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is elimination, leading to two products because of the possible sites of elimination, but due to symmetry, only two distinct products form.

Alternatively, maybe elimination isn't possible, and substitution is the only pathway, leading to one product.

Hmm, I'm probably overcomplicating. Let me think again: the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene.

When treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, the base could abstract a hydrogen alpha to the Br. The alpha positions are 3 and 5 (due to symmetry), and 6.

If the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3 or 5, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but since C2 has a methyl, that's possible? Or perhaps not because the ring can't have a double bond adjacent to a substituent without breaking aromaticity.

Alternatively, elimination from position 6 would form a double bond between C1 and C6.

But in both cases, would that lead to a non-aromatic compound, which is unstable? So perhaps elimination isn't feasible.

If elimination isn't possible, then substitution is the only pathway, leading to one product: 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene.

In that case, the answer would be option B) 1.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the directing effects. Bromine is a meta director. But in substitution, the incoming group would come into the ring at a position that's activated.

Wait, but if substitution occurs, the position of substitution would be determined by the directing effect of the existing substituents. But if substitution is happening at the Br's position, that's the only site where substitution can occur, leading to a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to multiple positions of substitution, but given the substituents, I don't think that's the case.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is one product. So option B) 1.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, and the reaction conditions suggest a potential substitution or elimination mechanism. Here's the analysis:

1. **Starting Material**: The compound is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, where bromine is at position 1, and methyl groups are at positions 2 and 4. The molecule is symmetric along the axis passing through position 1 and 4.

2. **Substitution Pathway**:  
   - NaNH₂ can act as a nucleophile, replacing the bromine atom with an amino group (-NH₂). This would result in the formation of 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene.  
   - Substitution occurs exclusively at the bromine position due to the directing effects of the substituents, leading to a single product.

3. **Elimination Pathway**:  
   - Elimination requires the abstraction of a hydrogen atom adjacent to the bromine (alpha hydrogen). The possible alpha positions are 2, 3, 5, and 6.  
   - Positions 3 and 5 are symmetric, so elimination at these positions would yield the same product. Elimination at position 6 would lead to a different product.  
   - However, forming a double bond in the benzene ring disrupts aromaticity, making elimination unlikely under these conditions.

4. **Symmetry Considerations**:  
   - The molecule's symmetry reduces the number of distinct products. Elimination at positions 3 and 5 would yield one product, while elimination at position 6 would yield another. However, elimination is not favored due to the aromaticity of benzene.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   - Substitution is the dominant pathway, leading to a single product (1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene).  
   - Elimination is unlikely due to the aromaticity of benzene, and no additional products are expected.

Thus, the reaction produces only one product. 

Answer: B
