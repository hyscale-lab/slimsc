Hmm, okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Then, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is about how many peaks they'll see in each.

Let me start by thinking about each reaction separately.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is lithium aluminum hydride, a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones and esters, but in this case, the starting material is a ketone. So when LAH is used on a ketone, it should reduce the carbonyl group into a CH2OH group, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, LAH is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So 5-methoxyhexan-3-one has a ketone at position 3. So reducing that would give 3-hexanol with a methoxy group at position 5.

Wait, more accurately, the structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2OMe. No, wait, hexan-3-one implies the ketone is on carbon 3. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3.

Wait, actually, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2-, but wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexane is CH3(CH2)4CH3. So hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, 3 would be the third carbon. So numbering from the left: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait
