Okay, so I've got this problem here where I have to figure out what value the algorithm gives for the input ACAGTGACC. The examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. I'm a bit confused about what the algorithm is doing, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I'll look at the examples to see if I can spot a pattern. Let's break them down.

AGG is the input, and the output is 115. Let's index each nucleotide. So A is position 1, G is 2, G is 3. If I think about their positions, maybe each nucleotide contributes a certain value based on its position or its type.

Another example is TGCTGA -> 176. Let's list the nucleotides: T, G, C, T, G, A. So that's 6 nucleotides, and the output is 176.

Hmm, maybe each nucleotide has a specific numerical value. I'll list the possible values. Let's see:

A, T, C, G. Maybe each has a value. Let's think, in DNA, A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, G is 4? Or perhaps another order. Wait, another thought: sometimes in DNA, the values are associated with their positions in the alphabet, but A is 1, C is 3, G is 7, T is 20? No, that seems too high. Or maybe they're assigned as A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4.

Wait, let's compute for the first example. AGG:

A is 1, G is 4, G is 4. So if it's adding them, 1+4+4=9. But the output is 115, which is way bigger. Hmm, maybe it's a product? 1*4*4=16, which is not 115. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps each nucleotide's value is multiplied by its position. Let's try that.

For AGG: positions 1,2,3.

A(1) *1 =1, G(4)*2=8, G(4)*3=12. Sum is 1+8
