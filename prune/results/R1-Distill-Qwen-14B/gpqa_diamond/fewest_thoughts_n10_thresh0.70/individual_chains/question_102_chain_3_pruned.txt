Okay, so I've got this question about a genetic construct and why the eGFP isn't showing up in the mice. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the setup: They've made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So two genes in one vector. The ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end and fused to eGFP. 

So the ligand is under the CBA promoter. The CBA promoter is known to be a strong promoter, maybe from the cytomegalovirus, but I think it's constitutive, so expressed in various tissues. The receptor is after an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, which is often used to express a second gene in a bicistronic vector. So the first gene (ligand) is under the CBA promoter, and the second (receptor) is under the control of the IRES, which might be dependent on the first promoter.

Now, the stop cassettes. Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP. And between receptor and eGFP, a lox2272-stop-lox2272. I remember that loxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. The stop cassette would prevent expression unless Cre is present to excise it. So, the ligand would only be expressed if Cre is active because without Cre, the stop cassette would block the mCherry expression. Similarly, the receptor and eGFP might be under a different regulation.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic. So perhaps in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed because the stop is after mCherry? Or maybe the other way around. Let me think: The ligand is 5', so its ORF is first. Then a stop cassette. Then mCherry. So in the absence of Cre, the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. But when Cre is present, it would delete the stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed downstream of the ligand. Similarly, the receptor has a stop cassette upstream, so without Cre, the receptor is not expressed, because the stop is before it. Wait, no, the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. Oh, wait, the vector is ligand (CBA) -> stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP) -> mCherry. And then the IRES, receptor ORF, stop (lox2272-stop-lox2272), eGFP.

Wait, bicistronic vectors typically have two ORFs in one transcript, separated by an IRES. So the transcript would be: CBA promoter drives the first ORF (ligand), then the IRES, then the second ORF (receptor). So in the vector, the ligand is first, followed by an IRES, then receptor.

But in this case, the vector is more complex. The ligand is at the 5' end, then a stop,
