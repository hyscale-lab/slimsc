Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to arrange some nucleophiles from the most reactive to the least reactive in an aqueous solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me read the question again. The problem lists five nucleophiles:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide
3. Propionate
4. Methanol
5. Ethanethiolate

And I need to arrange them from most reactive to least reactive. The options are A to D, each giving a different order. I remember that nucleophilicity depends on several factors like the solvent, the basicity of the nucleophile, and maybe the size of the atoms involved.

Wait, the question specifies it's in aqueous solution, so it's a polar protic solvent. In such solvents, the more polarizable and less solvated a nucleophile is, the more reactive it tends to be. Also, stronger bases are generally better nucleophiles, but in polar protic solvents, solvation can play a big role, making weaker bases better nucleophiles because they're less stabilized by solvation.

Let me list out the nucleophiles and think about their properties.

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: That's a cyclohexoxide ion. It's a conjugate base of an alcohol, so it's a strong base. But wait, it's a bulky base because of the cyclohexane ring and the methyl group. In SN2 reactions, bulky nucleophiles aren't as reactive because they can't approach the electrophilic center as easily. But wait, in terms of basicity, it's a strong base.

2. Hydroxide ion (OH⁻): This is a strong base and a good nucleophile. In aqueous solution, though, it's highly solvated. But wait, in a polar protic solvent, smaller and more highly charged ions are more solvated, which can decrease their nucleophilicity. So maybe hydroxide isn't the most nucleophilic here.

3. Propionate ion (CH₂CH₂COO⁻): This is the conjugate base of propionic acid. It's a weaker base compared to hydroxide because it's the conjugate base of a weaker acid (carboxylic acids are stronger acids than water, so their conjugate bases are weaker). So propionate is a weaker base. But in a polar protic solvent like water, weaker bases can sometimes be better nucleophiles because they're less solvated. Wait, no, actually, stronger bases are better nucleophiles in aprotic solvents, but in protic solvents, solvation can reduce their effectiveness. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the correct approach is to compare their basicity and how solvated they are. Stronger bases are more polarizing and should be better nucleophiles unless they're too solvated. In polar protic solvents, the more the nucleophile is stabilized by solvation (like OH⁻), the less reactive it is. So, perhaps in water, the order is different because of solvation effects.

4. Methanol (CH3OH): This is a neutral molecule. It's a weaker base and nucleophile compared to deprotonated species. Because in water, it's not ionized much, so it's a poor nucleophile. The hydroxide is a much stronger base and would be a better nucleophile, but maybe not when solvated.

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻): Wait, no, ethanethiolate is the conjugate base of ethanethiol (CH3CH2SH). Thiol is a stronger acid than water, so its conjugate base (HS⁻) is weaker than OH⁻. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the pKa of H2O is about 15.5, and the pKa of H2S is around 7. So H2S is a stronger acid than H2O, so its conjugate base (HS⁻) is weaker than OH⁻. So HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. But in terms of nucleophilicity, in polar protic solvents like water, HS⁻ is a better nucleophile than OH⁻ because it's less solvated. Oh, wait, that's right. Because S is larger than O, the HS⁻ ion is less solvated. So in water, HS⁻ is a better nucleophile than OH⁻. So Ethanethiolate would be more nucleophilic than hydroxide in aqueous solution.

So let's list the nucleophiles in order of their basicity. The stronger the base, the more likely it is to be a good nucleophile, but in aqueous solution, solvation can reduce that effect.

Looking at each:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻): weaker base than OH⁻, but less solvated because S is larger. So in water, it's a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

2. Hydroxide (OH⁻): strong base, but highly solvated in water. So maybe in water, it's not the best.

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: it's a strong base because it's an alkoxide, but it's bulky. Bulky nucleophiles are worse in SN2 reactions, but what about in terms of basicity and nucleophilicity in SN1, for example? Wait, the question is about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, so in a substitution reaction, which would be SN2.

Wait, but the problem statement is about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, so it's about which is a better nucleophile in that environment.

So for each nucleophile:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻): weaker base than OH⁻, but less solvated because S is bigger. So in water, HS⁻ is a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: strong base, but bulky. So in SN2, bulky nucleophiles are less reactive because of steric hindrance. But in terms of basicity and nucleophilicity in a polar protic solvent, maybe it's less reactive because of solvation.

Wait, no, alkoxide ions are strong bases, but in water, they are highly solvated. So they might not be as good nucleophiles as, say, HS⁻, which is less solvated.

So the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution (polar protic solvent) may be influenced by both basicity and solvation.

Let me think: in polar protic solvents, the weaker bases (like RS⁻) are better nucleophiles because they are less solvated. The stronger bases (like OH⁻) are more solvated and hence less nucleophilic.

So the order from most to least reactive nucleophiles in aqueous solution would be:

Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) is the strongest nucleophile in water because it's less solvated than OH⁻, even though it's a weaker base.

Then comes hydroxide ion (OH⁻), but wait, I thought that in water, OH⁻ is more solvated and less nucleophilic than HS⁻. So HS⁻ is more reactive than OH⁻.

Next comes 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate. Wait, no, that's a very strong base, but maybe it's more solvated and less reactive. Or perhaps since it's bulky, it's less reactive.

Wait, the cyclohexanolate is a strong base, but in water, it's highly solvated. So maybe its nucleophilicity is lower than that of HS⁻ and even OH⁻? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think again. The basicity order is:

HS⁻ is weaker base than OH⁻. Because H2O has a higher pKa than H2S (pKa is about 15.5 for H2O, and about 7 for H2S, so H2S is a stronger acid). So the conjugate base of H2S is HS⁻, which is weaker than OH⁻.

So in terms of basicity: OH⁻ > 4-methylcyclohexanolate (which is an alkoxide, so strong base) > other species.

Wait, wait, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is an alkoxide, so it's a strong base, stronger than OH⁻? No, wait, no. Wait, the pKa of alkanols is about 19-20, so their conjugate base (the alkoxide) has a higher basicity than OH⁻, which has a pKa of about 15.5. So the alkoxide is a stronger base than OH⁻.

Wait, that's right. For example, the pKa of ethanol is about 19, which means that the conjugate base (ethoxide) has a higher basicity than OH⁻, whose conjugate acid is water (pKa ~15.5). So, the order of basicity is: 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest base) > OH⁻ > Ethanethiolate (weaker base) > Propionate (weaker than HS⁻?) Wait, no, propionate is the conjugate base of propionic acid, which has a pKa around 4.8. So propionic acid is a stronger acid than H2S (pKa ~7), so propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻. Because the weaker the acid, the stronger the conjugate base. Wait, propionic acid has a lower pKa than H2S? No, wait, propionic acid pKa is around 4.88, H2S is about 7. So propionic acid is stronger acid than H2S, so propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻. So in terms of basicity:

4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest base) > OH⁻ > Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) > Propionate (weaker base than HS⁻) ?

Wait, no, because Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) has a pKa of about 7 for its conjugate acid. Propionic acid is about 4.88, so propionate is weaker base than HS⁻? Wait, no, because the higher the pKa of the acid, the weaker the acid, the stronger the conjugate base. So, H2S has a pKa of ~7, propionic acid pKa 4.88, so H2S is a stronger acid than propionic acid. Therefore, propionate (A-) is a stronger base than HS⁻.

Wait, that's correct. So the order of basicity is:

4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (pKa of about 20) > OH⁻ (pKa 15.5) > Propionate (pKa 4.88) > Ethanethiolate (pKa 7) ?

Wait, no, wait: the pKa of the acid is inversely related to the strength of the base. So, a higher pKa of the acid means a weaker acid, so stronger conjugate base.

So, propionic acid has a pKa of ~4.88, which is lower than H2S's pKa of ~7. So H2S is a weaker acid than propionic acid. Therefore, HS⁻ is a weaker base than propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻), because propionate is the conjugate base of a stronger acid.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. If acid HA has a lower pKa, it is a stronger acid. So, propionic acid is stronger acid than H2S, which has a higher pKa. So, the conjugate base of propionic acid (propionate) is weaker than the conjugate base of H2S (HS⁻). Because stronger acids have weaker conjugate bases. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, stronger acids lose protons more easily, so their conjugate bases are weaker. So, if HA has a lower pKa (stronger acid), A⁻ is a weaker base.

So, H2S (pKa ~7) is weaker acid than propionic acid (pKa ~4.88), so HS⁻ is a stronger base than propionate.

Wait, that makes sense. So the order of basicity is:

4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest base) > OH⁻ > Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) > Propionate (weaker base).

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight.

- The pKa of the acid determines the strength of the base after deprotonation.

HA → H+ + A⁻.

If HA has a lower pKa (stronger acid), then A⁻ is a weaker base. Because it's readily given up as H+.

So, for the given substances:

- 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: comes from deprotonating 4-methylcyclohexanol, which has a pKa around 20. So the conjugate base (the cyclohexanolate) is very strong.

- Hydroxide ion (OH⁻): comes from water, pKa 15.5. So OH⁻ is a strong base.

- Ethanethiolate (HS⁻): comes from H2S, pKa ~7. So HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻.

Wait, no. Because H2S is a stronger acid than water. Because H2S has a lower pKa than water. So the conjugate base of H2S (HS⁻) is a weaker base than OH⁻. Because stronger acid → weaker conjugate base.

So, the order of basicity is:

4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (highest basicity) > OH⁻ > Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) > Propionate.

Wait, no. Wait, propionate comes from propionic acid, which has a pKa of ~4.88. So propionic acid is a stronger acid than H2S (pKa 7). So, propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻? No, wait. Because propionic acid is a stronger acid than H2S, its conjugate base (propionate) is weaker than HS⁻'s conjugate base. Wait, no, the propionate comes from a stronger acid, so it's a weaker base.

So, the order of basicity is:

4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest base) > OH⁻ > Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) > Propionate (weaker than HS⁻? No, wait. Wait, propionate is weaker base than HS⁻, because propionic acid is stronger acid. So propionate is weaker base than HS⁻. So the order is 4-methylcyclohexanolate > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate? No, because propionate is weaker than HS⁻? Wait, no.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.

List the acids and their pKa:

- H2O: pKa ~15.5
- H2S: pKa ~7
- HOC(CH2CH3)CH2CH2CH3 (4-methylcyclohexanol): pKa ~20
- CH3CH2CH2COOH (propionic acid): pKa ~4.88

So, the conjugate bases:

- 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: from pKa 20 → strong base
- OH⁻: from pKa 15.5 → strong but weaker than cyclohexanolate
- HS⁻: from pKa 7 → weaker base than OH⁻
- Propionate (CH2CH2COO⁻): from pKa 4.88 → weaker base than HS⁻.

Wait, no. Because propionic acid is stronger than H2S, its conjugate base (propionate) is weaker than HS⁻. So in terms of basicity:

4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest) > OH⁻ > HS⁻ > Propionate.

So, the basicity order is 1 > 2 > 5 > 3.

But in terms of nucleophilicity in a polar protic solvent (like water), the order is different because of solvation effects.

In polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity tends to follow the trend of weaker bases being better nucleophiles because they're less solvated.

Wait, no. I think in polar protic solvents, the more polarizable and less solvated nucleophiles are better. So larger atoms (like S) are less solvated than smaller ones (like O), so HS⁻ is less solvated than OH⁻, making it a better nucleophile in water.

So, in water, the order of nucleophilicity is:

HS⁻ (Ethanethiolate) > OH⁻ > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate > ... ?

Wait, but 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is bulky. So in SN2 reactions, it's not as effective because of steric hindrance. So maybe its nucleophilicity is lower than that of OH⁻, despite being a stronger base.

But wait, the question is about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, so I think it's about the intrinsic nucleophilicity, not considering steric factors. Or perhaps the question is more about which is a better nucleophile, regardless of steric hindrance.

Wait, but the question asks about reactivity as a nucleophile, so it's about how well they can attack in a reaction. So steric factors matter. So the 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a strong base but bulky, so it's a poor nucleophile in SN2 reactions.

So putting it all together, the order in terms of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution:

Ethanethiolate (5) is the most reactive because it's less solvated and a good nucleophile.

Then comes hydroxide (2), which is a strong base but more solvated than HS⁻, so its nucleophilicity is lower than HS⁻.

Then, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1), but it's bulky. So maybe it's less nucleophilic than OH⁻ because of the bulk, but more reactive than the others?

Wait, no, wait. In SN2 reactions, the nucleophile's basicity and solvation are important, but so is its size. HS⁻ is larger, so less solvated, better nucleophile. Then OH⁻, then the alkoxide (but bulky), then propionate, but wait, propionate is a weaker base, so less nucleophilic.

Wait, but in the given options, the order is from the most reactive to least. So perhaps the order is 5 (HS⁻) > 2 (OH⁻) > 1 (cyclohexanolate) > 3 (propionate) > 4 (methanol).

Wait, but methanol is a neutral molecule. It's a poor nucleophile because it's not deprotonated. So in aqueous solution, it won't be a good nucleophile because it's not ionized. Its ionization would be minimal, so the nucleophilic species would be CH3OH, which is not a strong nucleophile.

So, the order in nucleophilicity in aqueous solution would be:

Ethanethiolate (5) > Hydroxide (2) > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4).

Wait, but wait. Propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻ and OH⁻, so in a polar protic solvent, it's less nucleophilic. Methanol is even less reactive because it's neutral.

So putting it all together:

5 > 2 > 1 > 3 > 4.

Wait, but looking at the options provided.

The options are:

A) 5, 2, 3, 1 and 4 → 5,2,3,1,4

B)2,5,1,4,3 → 2,5,1,4,3

C)2,5,3,4,3 → seems unlikely, as 3 appears twice.

D)5, 2, 1,3 and 4 → 5,2,1,3,4.

Wait, my order is 5, 2, 1, 3,4, which matches option D. Option D is "5,2,1,3 and 4".

Wait, the options list the order as:

A) 5,2,3,1,4

B)2,5,1,4,3

C)2,5,3,4,3

D)5,2,1,3,4.

So my conclusion is D.

Wait, but I thought that the cyclohexanolate (1) is a stronger base than OH⁻ (2), but in aqueous solution, it's more solvated and maybe less reactive. Alternatively, maybe it's the opposite because of steric hindrance.

Wait, another thought: since 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is bulky, it's less effective as a nucleophile despite being a strong base. So in terms of nucleophilicity, it might be less reactive than hydroxide. So the order would be 5 (HS⁻) > 2 (OH⁻) > 1 (cyclohexanolate) ?

Wait, no, because the cyclohexanolate is stronger base but bulky, maybe its nucleophilicity is lower than OH⁻.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think of actual data or examples. For instance, in SN2 reactions, iodide is a better nucleophile than hydroxide in polar aprotic solvents, but in polar protic, it's the other way around because of solvation. So, in water, HS⁻ (like I⁻) is a better nucleophile than OH⁻, but maybe not.

Wait, in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity for some common nucleophiles is often: I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻. But for O and S nucleophiles, HS⁻ is a better nucleophile than OH⁻ in water because S is less electronegative and larger, so less solvated.

So, Ethanethiolate (5) is more reactive than hydroxide (2).

Now, between the alkoxide (1) and hydroxide (2): the alkoxide is a stronger base, but in water, it's more solvated. So, in water, would hydroxide be a better nucleophile than the alkoxide?

Wait, I think that in water, the alkoxide (like cyclohexanolate) is a weaker nucleophile than hydroxide because it's more stabilized (solvated) and perhaps less available. Or maybe the opposite.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the solvation. The alkoxide ion is a strong base but in water, it's surrounded by water molecules tightly. So, when it comes to nucleophilicity, the more stabilized (solvated) the ion is, the less reactive it is as a nucleophile.

So, OH⁻ is less stabilized (solvated) than the cyclohexanolate? Wait, no, the cyclohexanolate is a larger, perhaps more polarizable ion.

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe the order is that the cyclohexanolate is a better nucleophile than OH⁻, but that seems counterintuitive because in water, the OH⁻ is a stronger base and more likely to attack.

Alternatively, perhaps in aqueous solution, the more polarizable nucleophiles are better. So, larger, less solvated ions are better. So, HS⁻ is better than OH⁻, but the cyclohexanolate is bulky, so its nucleophilicity is worse than OH⁻.

Wait, but the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, but in aqueous solution, perhaps it's not as good a nucleophile because it's more solvated.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 5,2,3,1,4 → 5 (HS⁻), 2 (OH⁻), 3 (propionate), 1 (cyclohexanolate), 4 (methanol).

D)5,2,1,3,4 → 5,2,1,3,4.

I think the correct order is 5 (HS⁻) > 2 (OH⁻) > 1 (cyclohexanolate) > 3 (propionate) > 4 (methanol).

Because:

- HS⁻ is less solvated than OH⁻ → more nucleophilic.

- OH⁻ is a stronger base but more solvated than cyclohexanolate?

Wait, no, cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, but in aqueous solution, it's more solvated. But I'm not sure whether it's more or less nucleophilic than OH⁻.

Alternatively, cyclohexanolate may be less nucleophilic than OH⁻ because of higher solvation. So the order would be 5 > 2 > 1.

But wait, in reality, in aqueous solution, the larger and less electronegative nucleophiles are better. So HS⁻ is better than OH⁻, which is better than, say, iodide in some cases.

But for OH⁻ and the alkoxide, which one is better.

Wait, maybe the cyclohexanolate is a weaker nucleophile in water than OH⁻ because it's more bulky. So the order would be 5 > 2 > 1.

Then, the propionate is less nucleophilic than cyclohexanolate because it's a weaker base, so 3 comes after 1.

And methanol is the least reactive because it's neutral.

So the order is 5,2,1,3,4.

Which matches option D.


To determine the reactivity of the given nucleophiles in aqueous solution, we consider factors such as basicity, solvation effects, and steric hindrance. In polar protic solvents like water, nucleophilicity is influenced by how well a nucleophile is solvated. Stronger bases are often more solvated, reducing their nucleophilicity. Additionally, larger, less electronegative atoms (e.g., sulfur) are less solvated, making them better nucleophiles in such environments. Steric hindrance can also reduce the reactivity of bulky nucleophiles.

### Analysis of the Nucleophiles:
1. **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: A strong base due to its alkoxide nature, but it is bulky, which reduces its nucleophilicity in SN2 reactions. In aqueous solution, it is highly solvated, further limiting its reactivity.
2. **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: A strong base and a good nucleophile. However, in aqueous solution, it is highly solvated, which reduces its nucleophilicity compared to less solvated species like HS⁻.
3. **Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻)**: A weaker base compared to OH⁻ and HS⁻. In aqueous solution, it is less nucleophilic due to its weaker basicity and greater solvation.
4. **Methanol (CH₃OH)**: A neutral molecule and a poor nucleophile in aqueous solution because it is not deprotonated. Its nucleophilicity is minimal compared to the ionic species.
5. **Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)**: A weaker base than OH⁻ but less solvated due to sulfur's larger size and lower electronegativity. This makes it a better nucleophile in aqueous solution compared to OH⁻.

### Order of Reactivity:
Based on the above analysis, the nucleophiles are arranged from the most reactive to the least reactive in aqueous solution:
1. **Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)**: Most reactive due to less solvation and larger size.
2. **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: Second due to strong basicity, but solvation reduces its reactivity.
3. **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: Less reactive due to steric hindrance and solvation.
4. **Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻)**: Weaker base and more solvated, reducing its nucleophilicity.
5. **Methanol (CH₃OH)**: Least reactive as a neutral molecule.

### Correct Option:
The correct order is **5 > 2 > 1 > 3 > 4**, which corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
