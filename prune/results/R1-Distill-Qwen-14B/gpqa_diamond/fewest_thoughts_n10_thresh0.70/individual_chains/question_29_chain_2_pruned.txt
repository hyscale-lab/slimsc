Okay, so I have this genetics problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it unusable for food, so the goal is to get rid of it. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking at the target gene sequences. The question is which mutation would eliminate the compound.

The intact gene sequence is given, and four mutants have changes in the first exon. I need to figure out which mutation would probably inactivate the gene, thereby stopping the compound's synthesis.

First, I should recall what EMS does. EMS (Ethyl Methanesulfonate) is a mutagen that primarily causes point mutations, usually leading to base substitutions. It's more likely to cause transitions (like A↔G or C↔T) rather than transversions.

Looking at the sequences, I need to see where the mutations are and what kind of changes they cause.

The intact gene's first part is: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

The mutants:

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, comparing to the intact gene, the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... in the wild type.

Mutant 1's sequence starts with ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... So looking at the changes:

Wild: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Looking at each position:

Compare each triplet. Let's see:

First 12 bases:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG
Mutant 1: ATG TCT ACG C...

Wait, perhaps I should line them up:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG
Mutant1: ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for differences.

Looking at the first part of the sequence:

Wild: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

So in the wild type, it's TTCT CGCT GGTACT...

In mutant1, it's TTCT ACGT... Hmm, maybe I should write the exact nucleotides.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the wild type and mutant1 sequences side by side.

Wild:
5' ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Mutant1:
5' ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT
