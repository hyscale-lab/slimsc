Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is understanding how the temperature affects the ratio of atoms in different energy levels. I remember from my studies that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The equation states that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is proportional to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by the thermal energy (k*T).

The Boltzmann factor equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, and k is the Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. So, when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature decreases. But wait, how does that affect the photospheric temperature? Because the spots are cooler regions, but the surrounding areas are hotter? Or does the overall Teff just average it out?

Wait, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So, does that mean the average temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K? Or is the temperature structure different? Hmm, but for the purposes of this problem, I think we can take the effective temperature as the average, so the photosphere's overall temperature is 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, no. Wait a second. Because when spots cover part of the surface, the total emitted flux changes. The spots are cooler, so they emit less flux. So the overall effective temperature is lower. But when considering the photosphere, the regions without spots are hotter, and the spots are cooler. But for the purpose of this problem, the question is about the photosphere, so the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when the spots are present. Or wait, maybe the problem is that the star's overall Teff is 5500 K when spots are present. But the actual photospheric temperature varies across the surface. But the problem says, in the stellar photosphere, so maybe we're considering the effective temperature as the average.

Wait,
