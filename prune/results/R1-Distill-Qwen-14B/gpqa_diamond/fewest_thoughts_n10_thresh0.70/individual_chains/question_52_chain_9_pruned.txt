Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect certain ratios of atoms in the photosphere. Hmm. I remember that when stars have spots, it can change their overall brightness and temperature, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

So, the star in question has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. But I don't think the radius and mass are directly relevant here; the question is more about the temperature effect from the spots.

Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, that's a significant drop. I wonder how that affects the photosphere.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question asks by what factor this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. 

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2 where n1 and n2 are the populations of two energy levels. The ratio decreases when spots are present. So, when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations is given by (n1/n2) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The transition between these two levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. That's in the ultraviolet range, I think. So that's probably a forbidden line or something. But the main point is that the energy difference can be found from the wavelength.

So first, I need to find the energy difference ΔE between the two levels. Since the transition wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So
