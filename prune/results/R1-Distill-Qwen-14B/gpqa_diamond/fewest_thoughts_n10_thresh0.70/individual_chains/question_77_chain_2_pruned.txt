Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a reaction involving 1,5-dienes. The reaction usually happens under heat or light and it rearranges the double bonds.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let me look at the first part: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene is treated with BuLi followed by H+. Wait, BuLi is a strong base, but in this context, maybe it's deprotonating something. Oh right, BuLi is often used to deprotonate compounds to form enolates or to generate organometallic reagents. But wait, after that, H+ is added. So maybe it's a conjugate addition or something else.

Wait, the starting material is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw that structure. So the benzene ring has a substituent. The substituent is an oxy group (O), which is attached to a methyl group (CH2O-). Then, the other end of the oxy group is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So, the structure is: benzene-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-. Wait, no, wait. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the structure is CH2-O-(CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2). Wait, maybe I should think of it as:

The substituent is (CH2CH2CH(CH3)) but with a double bond. Wait, but the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3. No, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with the double bond between 2 and 3. So the substituent is O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2, but with the double bond between C2 and C3. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double between 2 and 3? Or wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? No, no. The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at C2. So, structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C2 and C3. Wait, maybe another way: the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. So the structure is CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-. Wait, no, but it's (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl, so the substituent is CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-? Wait, perhaps it's CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- but that would be a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to figure this out. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CHCH2CH2-?
