Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's start with part A.

The first reaction is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene treated first with BuLi and then H+. Wait, BuLi is a strong base, usually a good nucleophile too. But what's happening here with this molecule?

The structure of the starting material for A is a benzene ring with an attached group. The group is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. Breaking that down: the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, so it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, but I think I got that wrong. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at carbon 2. So structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2 as the substituent?

Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be the group where the double bond starts at carbon 2. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-, but wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So the but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2- attached via the first carbon.

Wait, maybe I should draw it. Let's see: the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl). So the main chain is four carbons, with a double bond between 2 and 3. So positions are 1,2,3,4. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the substituent is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl
