Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let's see what's given.

Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 * M2. Hmm, but wait, the problem is about luminosity, which I think relates more to radius and temperature than mass, unless other factors are involved. But maybe the mass isn't directly relevant here. I'll keep that in mind.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength due to blackbody radiation. Remember, the peak wavelength λ_max is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2. Got it.

Then, the radial velocities: Star_1 is at 0 km/s, Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Radial velocity... Oh, wait, that's about Doppler shift. When a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength of the spectral lines shifts. But wait, in this case, they've determined the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest, which is the peak emission. If the stars are moving, their emission is Doppler shifted. So perhaps the observed λ_max is different from the actual emitted λ_max?

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths they appear brightest are the same. So maybe the observed λ_max is the same for both. Hmm, that would imply that their actual emitted wavelengths differ due to Doppler effect.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think again. The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. But we can't ignore the Doppler shift because their velocities are different. So the actual emitted wavelengths would be different, but the observed ones are the same. Hmm, because one might be moving towards or away, causing blueshift or redshift.

Wait, radial velocity is 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. But the signs matter. Radial velocity could be positive (moving away, causing redshift) or negative (moving towards, blueshift). The problem says Star_1 has 0, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 has 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away, so redshift. But wait, I'm not sure about the direction. The problem just says 700 km/s, perhaps we can consider it as positive ( recession). So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s.

So the observed λ_max is same for both. But Star_1 is not moving
