Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

So, the problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I think that's related to black body radiation and the peak wavelength. Oh right, Wien's Law says the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same? Because λ_max * T = constant (Wien's displacement law). So T1 = T2.

Wait, but mass and radius are given. How does that tie into the temperature? Well, in main-sequence stars, hotter stars are more massive and larger, but maybe in this case, the temperatures are the same because their peak emission wavelengths are the same. So T1 = T2.

Now, the problem mentions that the luminosity is computed. The stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies. So the luminosity formula for a star is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So I can write L1 and L2 using that.

Given that R1 is 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2, let me plug these into the equations.

L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)² σ T⁴
L2 = 4π R2² σ T⁴

So when I take the ratio L1/L2, the 4π σ T^4 terms will cancel out.

So L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) / ( R2^2 ) = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25. So the ratio would be 2.25, right? So Star_1 is 2.25 times more luminous than Star_2.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says that the stars' luminosities were computed, but there's more information: radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Do I need to consider Doppler shift here?

Hmm, the peak wavelengths are the same, but star 2 is moving. So the observed wavelength would be affected by Doppler shift. Let me think. The peak wavelength is where the stars emit, but due to their motion, the observed wavelength might be different. But the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, but that could be due to their actual emission being shifted.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's unclear whether the wavelengths are the rest wavelengths or observed wavelengths. Oh, the question says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest
