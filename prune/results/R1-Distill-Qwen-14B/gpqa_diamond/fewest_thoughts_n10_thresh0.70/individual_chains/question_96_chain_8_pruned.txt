Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about finding the order of magnitude of the entropy of a supermassive black hole. They give me the angular size of the event horizon and the distance to the galaxy. The options are all powers of ten, so I probably need to use some formulas and approximations.

First, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. So I need to find the area A.

The event horizon's area depends on its radius. Oh right, the Schwarzschild radius R_s is given by R_s = (2 G M) / c². So A = 4 π R_s². So if I can find the mass M of the black hole, I can compute A and then S.

But how do I find M? They give the angular size θ and the distance d. Oh, I think I can use the small angle approximation. When the angle is small, the relationship between the actual size (like the diameter of the event horizon) and the distance is θ ≈ (size) / d. But since θ is given in degrees, I should convert it to radians first because the formula uses radians.

Wait, the angular size θ is given as 10^-17 degrees. Let me convert that to radians. Since 180 degrees is π radians, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ_rad = 10^-17 degrees * (π radians / 180 degrees) ≈ (10^-17 * π) / 180 radians.

But wait, actually, for very small angles, θ (in radians) is approximately equal to (size)/(distance). So the size of the event horizon, which is the diameter, is approximately θ * d. Wait, no, the Schwarzschild radius is R_s, so the diameter is 2 R_s. Or wait, the angular size could be the diameter or the radius? Hmm, I need to be careful here.

Wait, when you measure the angular size of the event horizon, it's the apparent size as seen from a distance. So the diameter of the event horizon would produce an angle θ. So the diameter would be θ (in radians) multiplied by the distance d. So diameter = 2 R_s = θ_rad * d.

So solving for R_s: R_s = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

Wait, let's check that. The angular size θ is the angle subtended by the diameter of the event horizon. So yes, θ ≈ (2 R_s) / d. So R_s = (θ * d) / 2. But θ is in radians here, right?

So putting it all together, R_s = (d * θ_rad) / 2.

Once I have R_s, I can find the mass M using R_s = (2 G M) / c². Solving for M: M = (R_s c²) / (2 G).

Then, the area A is 4 π R_s², so plugging that into the entropy formula.

So let's compute step by step.

Given:
d = 1e10 parsecs. Wait, parsecs to meters. 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 m approximately.

θ = 1e-17 degrees. Let's convert that to radians: θ_rad = 1e-17 * (π / 180) ≈ (3.1416 / 180) * 1e-17 ≈ 1.745e-19 * 1e-17 = 1.745e-26 radians. Wait, wait, wait, let me calculate that correctly.

Wait, 1 degree is π/18
