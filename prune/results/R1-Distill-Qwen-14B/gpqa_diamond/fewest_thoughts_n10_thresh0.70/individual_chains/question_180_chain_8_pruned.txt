Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about finding the minimum energy of an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and they have negligible mass. 

Wait, so 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. I think that means the 13th is at the center, and the others are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters, right? 

The question is asking about the minimum energy of the system. I remember that the energy in electrostatic systems is related to the potential energy between charges. Oh right, the formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But wait, when you have multiple charges, you have to consider all pairs, so the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

So, since we're dealing with identical particles, all the charges are the same. Each is 2e, so q = 2e. The elementary charge e is about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs, so each charge is 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Now, the system has 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters from P. So, the potential energy would come from two parts: the interactions between the fixed charge and the 12 others, and the interactions among the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but the problem mentions it's an isolated system. So, I think that's just telling me that there's no outside influence, so all the energy comes from the interactions between the charges in the system.

Let me think about each part separately.

First, the potential energy between the fixed charge at P and each of the 12 others. Since each of the 12 is 2 meters away, the distance between P and any of them is 2 m. There are 12 such charges, so for each, the potential energy U is k * (2e)*(2e) / (2). Wait, wait, no, the fixed charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e. So each pair
