Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, it's about particles colliding in a detector and their Lorentz factors. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The problem says that when particles collide at the center of a spherical detector, they produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, we need to find the Lorentz factor required so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Wait, so the initial setup is a Lorentz factor of about 20, and only 1/3 reach the walls. So, I need to find the factor that makes 2/3 reach the walls.

I remember that the Lorentz factor, gamma, is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But more importantly, I think the problem is about how far a particle travels before decaying. Because, if the particles decay quickly, they might not make it to the detector walls.

The particles are fast-decaying, so the decay length matters. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. I think the formula for the decay length is c multiplied by the lifetime (proper time) multiplied by gamma. Because, in the lab frame, the lifetime is dilated by gamma, so the lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime.

So, if the decay length is L = c * gamma * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime. But wait, in the problem, the particles are produced at the center of the detector, so the maximum distance they can travel without decaying is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters.

So, when gamma is 20, only 1/3 reach the walls. That suggests that the decay length is about 30 meters times 1/3, which is 10 meters. Because, if their decay length is 10 meters, then on average, only particles that decay after traveling more than 10 meters will reach the walls. Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, no. If the decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying, then the probability that
