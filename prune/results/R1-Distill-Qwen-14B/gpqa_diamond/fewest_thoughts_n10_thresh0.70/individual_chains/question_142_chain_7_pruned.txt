Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics question about density matrices. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, I'm trying to recall—what's the difference between a pure state and a mixed state? Oh right, a pure state is a single vector in the Hilbert space, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, while a mixed state is a statistical mixture of pure states, hence the density matrix is a convex combination of projectors.

So looking at the given ρ, it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. Each of those terms is a projector, and since they sum to the identity matrix when multiplied by 1/2, this must be a mixed state. Wait, wait—no, wait. Let me think again. Because |0⟩ and |1⟩ are orthogonal, the sum |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is actually the identity matrix for a 2x2 system. So when multiplied by 1/2, it's (I)/2.

So ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. That's a diagonal matrix with 1/2 and 1/2 on the diagonal. So the density matrix should look like [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. 

Now the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on how to interpret density matrices geometrically. I remember that for a qubit, the state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. For pure states, the state is a vector on the surface, but for mixed states, it's inside the sphere.

The general form of a qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector in 3D space (x, y, z), and σ are the Pauli matrices. When you expand this, you get:

ρ = (1/2)([[1,0],[0,1]] + r_x σ_x +
