Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu. The magnetic moment is given as mu equals gamma multiplied by S_z. So, mu = γ S_z. I remember that the magnetic moment usually relates to the spin in some way, and gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio.

The setup is that initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So, the field switches from Z to Y direction.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So, when the magnetic field changes, the spin state might precess or something, leading to oscillations in the expectation value of S_z over time.

Hmm, right. I think this has to do with spin precession under a magnetic field. When the magnetic field changes direction, the spin state will start to precess around the new field direction. But how does that affect the expectation value of S_z?

Wait, the initial state is when the magnetic field is along +Z. So, the spin would be aligned with the field. Because for a spin 1/2 particle, the eigenstates of S_z are |+z> and |-z>, with eigenvalues +1/2 ħ and -1/2 ħ, respectively. So, the magnetic moment mu would be proportional to S_z, so mu would be aligned with the field.

Initially, the particle's spin is in the +Z direction, so the expectation value of S_z is maximum. Then, when the field is suddenly turned off and then on in the Y direction, the spin state might not be an eigenstate of S_y anymore, leading to time evolution.

Wait, but when the field is turned off, the system's Hamiltonian changes. Initially, the Hamiltonian was H_initial = -μ·B, which for B along Z is H_initial = -μ_z B. After the field is turned on along Y, H_final = -μ_y B, right? Or wait, μ is given as γ S_z, but in that case, when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment is along Y as well.

Wait, I'm a bit confused
