Okay, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Both planets were detected using the radial velocity method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. The question says their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii but Planet_1's star is more massive.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. Wait, the formula I'm thinking of is the probability P = (R_planet / R_star)² * (a_planet / (a_planet * (1 - e²)^0.5)) ) but wait, since the orbits are circular, the eccentricity e is zero. So that simplifies it.

Wait, no, maybe I should think again. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's orbit that aligns with our line of sight. Oh wait, no, it's actually more about the alignment. The probability is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but wait, that's not right either. I think the actual probability is (R_p / R_s) squared multiplied by (something related to the orbital distance).

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think. The transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(a_p)) * something else? No, wait. Another approach: the probability that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective is roughly (R_star + R_p) / a_p. But wait, actually, that's not quite right. The standard formula I remember is that the transit probability (P) is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / (R_s + R_p)) )). Hmm, maybe that's more correct.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p / (R_s))^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 + (M_p / M_s)^(1/3)) ) but wait, that's not right either. Alternatively, I recall that the probability is about (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e^2))) but since e=0, it
