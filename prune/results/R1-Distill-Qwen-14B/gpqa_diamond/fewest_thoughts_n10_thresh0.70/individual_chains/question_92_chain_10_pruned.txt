Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. It looks like a molecule with two double bonds. There are some methyl groups attached, I think. So, maybe it's a diene or some conjugated system? Not sure if that's relevant right now, but perhaps it matters for the bonds.

The problem provides some bond energies:

- Enthalpy of atomization of carbon: 1000 kJ/mol. Wait, atomization is the energy required to break a molecule into its constituent atoms. So for carbon, to turn C(s) into C(g), it's 1000 kJ/mol. But how does that factor into calculating enthalpy of formation?

Wait, the enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for a hydrocarbon like this, it's formed from carbon and hydrogen.

The bond energies given are for H-H (100 kJ/mol), C-C (200), C=C (300), and C-H (400). So, I think I need to calculate the total bond energies in the compound and relate that to the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, how does this work? Oh right, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. The formula I remember is:

ΔHf = [Σ bond energies of reactants] - [Σ bond energies of products]

But wait, wait, in this case, I think the approach is a bit different. Because when a molecule is formed, bonds are broken and formed. So the enthalpy change is based on the bond energies.

Alternatively, the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule, minus the bond energies of the elements (but since elements are in their standard states, maybe we subtract the bond energies for the elements as they are).

Wait, let me clarify. The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf
