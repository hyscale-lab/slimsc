Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and breaking it down.

The question talks about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Then, when it reacts with liquid Y, a gas W is released. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Another clue is that the product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

Hmm, okay. Let's try to piece this together.

First, I need to figure out what Substance X is. The fact that it's used in organic chemistry as a reagent makes me think of common reagents like Grignard reagents, which are organomagnesium compounds. Grignard reagents are used extensively in organic synthesis, reacting with carbonyl groups like in ketones or aldehydes.

Grignard reagents have the general formula RMgX, where R is an alkyl or aryl group and X is a halogen, typically bromide or chloride. So perhaps X here is Mg? But wait, the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Magnesium has isotopes, so perhaps that's the case. Alternatively, maybe it's a halogen, but halogens can have heavier isotopes like Cl-35 and Cl-37.

Wait, but the product of X reacting with a keto acid (which is a carboxylic acid with a ketone group?) produces something with two oxygen atoms. Oh, wait, no: the product has two oxygen atoms in total, perhaps?

Wait, no. Let me think again. When a Grignard reagent reacts with a carbonyl compound, like a ketone, it typically adds to the carbonyl carbon, forming an alcohol after protonation. But if it's a keto acid, like maybe a β-keto acid? Or perhaps the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid, which after reacting would form a product.

Wait, another approach: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is something like a diol or an alcohol with two oxygen-containing groups. Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester or something else.

But let's go back to the reaction. X reacts with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Let's think about what that could be.

277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What substances have a melting point near that? Maybe sodium hydroxide? Wait, no, NaOH's melting point is around 1150 K. Wait, wait—actually, maybe it's another compound. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like MgO? Wait, magnesium oxide has a melting point of about 2800 K, which is way higher. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe B is a metal. Let me think: what metal has a melting point around 277 K? Let's convert that to Celsius: 277 K is 4°C. So metals usually have higher melting points. Hmm, maybe it's not a metal. What else? Maybe a salt? Wait, table salt (NaCl) melts around 801°C, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps B is water? No, water freezes at 273 K (0°C), but 277 K is about 4°C—so maybe B is a solid at 0°C but melts a bit higher? Wait, maybe it's ice? No, because ice melts at 273 K, so 277 K is just a bit above. Hmm, not sure about that.

Let me think about the gas W. It's a gas whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecular formula of W must be such that the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons. For example, H2O has 10 protons (since O has 8, H has 1 each) and neutrons: O has 8 neutrons (since it's ^16O?), H has none. So 8 + 0 = 8 neutrons. But protons would be 2 (from H) +8 (O) =10. Not equal. So H2O doesn't fit.

Wait another possibility: CO2? Let's see. C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (assuming ^12C). O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons (if ^16O). CO2 has molecular formula C:6, O:16 each. So the molecule would have: 6 protons from C, 16*2=32 from O. Total protons: 6+32=38. For neutrons: C has 6, each O has 8, so 6 + (8*2) = 22. 38 isn't equal to 22. So no.

Wait, maybe the gas is something like O2. O2 has each O atom with 8 protons. So the molecule has 16 protons. Neutrons: Each O is ^16O (8 neutrons), so two atoms would be 16 total. So 16 protons equals 16 neutrons. That's a fit. So gas W is O2.

But wait, another possibility: maybe H2. H2 has 2 protons, and each H has 0 neutrons. So 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Doesn't fit. Or maybe NH3? But that's a liquid under standard conditions, I think.

Wait, another possibility: CO. CO has molecular formula C (6 protons), O (8), so total 14. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8. Total 14. So 14 protons equals 14 neutrons. So CO could be W. But CO is a gas at STP, and it's toxic. Alternatively, maybe CH4? CH4 has 6 protons (C) +4 (H) =10. Neutrons: C has 6, H has none. Total neutrons 6. 10 ≠6. So no.

Wait, another idea: maybe the gas is something like D2 (deuterium), but that's a heavy isotope of H. D2 is rare, but maybe. The problem says W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So for D2, each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So two D atoms: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. So 2=2. That fits. But is D2 a possible gas here?

Alternatively, maybe it's another molecule. Let's think about He. He is a noble gas, but it's monoatomic. Each He atom has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (if it's ^4He). So in He gas, each molecule is He, so 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So same number. So He could be W. But He is a noble gas, so maybe not reacting much, but maybe in some reactions.

Wait, but the reaction between X and Y produces gas W. If X is a Grignard reagent (like MgBr2?), but wait, Grignard reagents are RMgX, where R is an alkyl group. So perhaps X is Mg.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. Grignard reagents are formed by reacting an alkyl halide with magnesium metal. So when you have an alkyl bromide (like Y could be bromine?), but wait, Y is a liquid. Wait, bromine is a liquid at room temperature. So perhaps Y is an alkyl halide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: when Grignard reagents react with water (or acid), they produce hydrocarbons and release H2. But wait, Grignard reagents react violently with water, producing hydrogen gas (H2). So perhaps Y is water. But water is a liquid. So when X (Grignard reagent) reacts with Y (water), gas W is H2.

Wait, but earlier I thought W could be H2. So H2's molecule has 2 H atoms. Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So total protons: 2. Total neutrons: 0. So protons ≠ neutrons. So H2 doesn't fit the condition that protons and neutrons are equal. So that can't be W.

Hmm, so maybe the gas isn't H2. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: CO2, but earlier analysis didn't fit. Or maybe C2H4O2? No, that's not a common gas. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like CO (as I thought before). Let me recheck CO. CO: each O is 8 protons, 8 neutrons. C is 6 protons, 6 neutrons. So molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. Oh wait, wait! Wait, molecule—each atom contributes to the total. So for CO, the molecule has 6 +8 =14 protons, and 6 +8=14 neutrons. So 14 each. So 14 =14. So that works. So W could be CO.

But wait, CO is a gas at STP. So that's possible. But what reaction would produce CO? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the gas is CH3OH (methanol), but that's a liquid. Or maybe NH3, but that's a gas but in that case, the molecule would have 14 protons (N:7 + H3:3) and (N: 7 neutrons) + H:0. So 14 protons vs 7 neutrons. No, doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the gas is something like N2O. Let's see. N has 7 protons each, O has 8. So N2O has (7*2)+(8) =22 protons. Neutrons: N typically has 7 neutrons (if ^14N), so 2*7=14, plus O could be ^16O (8 neutrons). So total neutrons 14 +8=22. So 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that matches. So gas W could be N2O.

But does that make sense in this reaction? I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. If X is a Grignard reagent (like Mg), and Y is an acid, perhaps. When Grignard reagents react with a liquid acid, they might form a metal salt precipitate. For example, if Y is a carboxylic acid, then reacting with Grignard would form a metal carboxylate. But wait, Grignard reagents are strong bases and would deprotonate the acid. So if Y is a carboxylic acid, the reaction would form a carboxylate salt and release the gas.

Wait, perhaps when X (Grignard) reacts with Y (like an alcohol, but that's not likely to form a precipitate), or perhaps Y is something else. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a diethyl ether or THF, but that's the solvent, not the reactant.

Wait, another thought: Grignard reagents react with carbon dioxide to form carboxylic acids. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a halogen, like bromine, which is a liquid. The Grignard reagent (like MgBr2) could form when Mg reacts with Br2, but that's part of the Grignard formation, not a reaction with Y. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product. The product of the reaction (X and a keto acid) has two oxygen atoms. Grignard reagents react with keto acids. Let's think: a keto acid has a structure like R-CO-COOH. When Grignard adds to the carbonyl, perhaps it forms a secondary alcohol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, when Grignard reagents react with a ketone, they add the R- to the carbonyl carbon, then upon protonation, form an alcohol. If the starting material is a keto acid (maybe something like acetoacetic acid), then the reaction could add twice, or perhaps it's a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an alcohol with two oxygen atoms. For example, a molecule with two -OH groups. Or maybe an ester.

Wait, but the problem says the product contains two atoms of oxygen. So perhaps the product is an alcohol with one OH group, but that's only one O. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, the product could be a diol, but that would have two OH groups, which is two O atoms.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another angle. What is the precipitate G? When X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. If X is a Grignard reagent (like MgBrR), and Y is something like an acid, the Grignard would react with the acid to form a salt, like MgBr(OOCR') and release H2 gas perhaps. Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another thought: when Grignard reagents react with carbon dioxide, they form carboxylates. So CO2 is gas, but the product would be a magnesium carboxylate, which is a precipitate. So when heated, perhaps the precipitate decomposes.

Wait, let me think: let's say X is Mg (magnesium), Y is CO2. The reaction would produce MgCO3, which is a white precipitate. Then, when heated, MgCO3 decomposes into MgO and CO2. So B would be MgO. The melting point of MgO is around 2800 K, but the problem says B's melting point is near 277 K (about 4°C). So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is something else. Let me think about another possibility.

Wait, maybe Y is a ketone. No, ketones are usually liquids or solids. Alternatively, Y is a halogen. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is something else, not a Grignard reagent. Let me think about other reagents used in organic chemistry. Maybe it's a lithium reagent, like LiAlH4 (a strong reducing agent). But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So if W is CO, that's 29 protons and 29 neutrons? Wait, no, because each atom contributes. Let's recalculate:

Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (assuming ^12C). Oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (^16O). So the molecule CO has (6+8) =14 protons and (6+8)=14 neutrons. So 14 each. So 14=14, which fits.

So W is CO.

Then, how does CO form? Maybe from the decomposition of a carbonyl compound.

Wait, perhaps in the reaction, X reacts with Y to produce CO gas. Let me think about a reaction that produces CO. For example, the reduction of CO3^2- with Mg (a Grignard-like reaction?) could produce CO.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal like Mg and Y is a carbonate. Mg reacts with CO3^2- to produce CO gas? Not sure about the specifics.

Wait, when a Grignard reagent reacts with a ketone, no CO is produced. But if X is a metal like Mg, reacting with CO2 (Y is CO2), that forms MgCO3, which is a precipitate. Then, upon heating, MgCO3 decomposes into MgO and CO2. But in that case, the gas would be CO2, not CO. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is Mg reacting with a carboxylic acid. Mg + 2RCOOH → RCOOMgR + H2↑. But H2 wouldn't fit W's condition.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a carbonate. Mg reacts with carbonate to produce CO2 gas. Wait, but the reaction is Mg + CO3^2- → MgCO3 (precipitate) and CO↑? Or perhaps:

Mg + CO3^2- → MgCO3 (s) + H2? No, I don't think that's right. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the precipitate G is magnesium hydroxide. So when X (Mg) reacts with Y (a strong acid), it forms Mg(OH)2, which precipitates, and releases H2 gas. But earlier analysis shows that H2 doesn't fit the W condition.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to summarize what I know so far:

- X is a reagent in organic chemistry, possibly a Grignard reagent (R-Mg-X).
- X reacts with Y (a liquid) to produce gas W (same protons and neutrons in molecule), precipitate G.
- G, when heated, gives B, which has a melting point near 277 K (~4°C).
- Product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms.

Wait, let's think about B. If B's melting point is near 277 K, what is it? Let's look up melting points.

Water (H2O) freezes at 273 K (0°C), and has a melting point of 273 K. But the question says B's melting point is very close to 277 K, which is about 4°C. So B's melting point is just a bit above 0°C.

Which substance has a melting point around 4°C? Maybe something like ammonium nitrate, which has a melting point of around 169°C. No. Wait, maybe it's a different compound.

Wait, perhaps B is sodium hydroxide? No, NaOH's melting point is around 1150 K. Not matching.

Wait, maybe B is a hydrate. For example, NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate) has a melting point around 270 K (about -3°C). Close, but the question says 277 K. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Let me think—what about NH4Cl? Its melting point is around 334 K (61°C). Hmm, no. Maybe something else.

Wait, another thought: what if B is solid CO2 (dry ice)? No, CO2 solid sublimates at 195 K (-78°C). Not 277 K.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different kind of salt. Let me think—perhaps it's a hydrate. For example, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate has a melting point around 277 K. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's something like sodium carbonate decahydrate, but I don't remember its melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal. Wait, no, metals have higher melting points. So perhaps B is a salt like Na2CO3·H2O? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is something like urea. Urea has a melting point of about 277 K (4°C). Oh, that's a possibility. So B could be urea.

If that's the case, then when G is heated, it releases B (urea). So G might be a compound that, upon heating, decomposes to produce urea.

But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps B is a carbonate. For example, magnesium carbonate (MgCO3) has a melting point of about 2140 K, which is way higher. So that's not it.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on B. Let me think about the precipitate G. If when X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms, which upon heating gives B. So G is some compound that when heated, releases B and perhaps decomposes.

If X is Mg, and Y is a carbonate solution, the reaction would be Mg + CO3^2- → MgCO3 (precipitate) + something. But earlier that didn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfide. Mg reacts with sulfide to form MgS and H2S gas. But H2S doesn't fit the W condition (protons equal to neutrons). H2S has 2 protons and 34 neutrons (since S is ^32S, which has 16 neutrons, but H has none). So 2 protons, 16*2=32 from S? No, 16 from S and 0 from H.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think about the elements present in X.

The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So I need to find the elements in X and sum their lightest and heaviest isotopes.

If X is a Grignard reagent, like CH3MgBr, then the elements present are C, H, Mg, and Br.

The lightest elements would be H and C, but wait, in the formula CH3MgBr, the elements are C, H, Mg, Br.

Wait, but the question says "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

In CH3MgBr, the elements are C, H, Mg, Br. The lightest is H (atomic number 1), the heaviest is Br (atomic number 35). So their atomic masses would be H's lightest isotope (1.00784) and Br's heaviest isotope, which is Br-81 (mass approximately 80.935).

Wait, but wait: the question says, "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, so if a substance has multiple isotopes, like magnesium has ^24Mg, ^25Mg, ^26Mg, and bromine has ^79Br and ^81Br, then for each element in the substance, I sum all the isotopes (lightest and heaviest) and then add the lightest and heaviest elements' sums?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The question says, "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Ah, perhaps for each element in X, we sum all its isotopes (heavier and lighter) to get the total mass contribution from that element in X. Then, among all the elements in X, find the lightest element and the heaviest element, and sum their total masses.

Wait, let me think. For example, if X is CH3MgBr, the elements are C, H, Mg, Br.

For each element:

- H: has isotopes like ^1H, ^2H. But in X, each H is part of the CH3 group. So the total H's contribution would be the sum of all H isotopes present.

Wait, but the problem says, "if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, perhaps for each element in X, you calculate the sum of all its possible isotopes (lightest and heaviest), and then for the entire X, take the lightest and heaviest elements and sum their individual sums.

Alternatively, perhaps for each element present in X, you sum all the isotopes (regardless of being heavy or light), and then among all elements in X, find the lightest and heaviest element, sum their individual total isotopic masses.

Wait, no. Let me read the question again:

"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

So, for each element in X, I have to sum all their isotopes (all the heavier and lighter ones). Then, among all the elements present, find the lightest and heaviest, sum their masses.

Wait, but maybe the question is to sum the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements (each summed across their isotopes) in X.

So, for each element in X, sum all their isotopes' masses, then take the lightest element's sum and the heaviest's sum and add them together.

Wait, but to clarify, if X is CH3MgBr, the elements are C, H, Mg, Br.

Each element's total isotopic mass would be:

- H: sum of all H isotopes present in X. Since H is ^1H (lightest) and sometimes ^2H (deuterium). So for each H atom in X, sum the lightest and heaviest isotopes. But wait, in X, each H is either ^1H or ^2H, but the problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps in X, one element has a heavy isotope (like Mg with ^25Mg or ^26Mg, or Br with ^81Br).

Wait, but the question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps one of the elements in X has a heavy isotope, but others have their lightest.

So for each element in X:

- For H: only lightest isotopes (since the problem says X has a heavier isotope in one element, not all). So each H is ^1H. So sum for H is (number of H atoms) × 1.00784.

- For C: same, assuming it's ^12C.

- For Mg: assuming it's using a heavier isotope, like ^25Mg or ^26Mg. So sum all Mg isotopes, including the heavy one. For example, if X has Mg with ^25Mg, then sum 24.9858 (lightest) and 24.9858 (but wait, Mg has multiple isotopes. The sum would be (abundance × mass) for each isotope. But this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me assume that X is CH3MgBr. So the elements are C, H, Mg, Br.

For the purpose of the problem, the lightest element would be H, and the heaviest would be Br.

So, for H: sum all isotopes. H's common isotopes are ^1H (~99.985% abundance, mass ~1.00784) and ^2H (~0.015%, mass ~2.0141). So the sum would be (number of H atoms) × (1.00784 × 0.99985 + 2.0141 × 0.00015). But since the question says to consider the lightest and heaviest isotopes, perhaps it's considering the sum of the lightest and the heaviest isotopes for each element.

Wait, but the question says, "if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed." So for each element in X, sum the masses of all heavier and lighter isotopes. So for H, it's 1.00784 (lightest) + 2.0141 (heaviest) = approximately 3.0219.

Similarly, for Mg: its lightest isotope is ^24Mg (23.98504), and the heaviest is ^26Mg (25.98237). So sum is 23.98504 +25.98237 =49.96741.

For Br: the lightest is ^79Br (78.9183) and the heaviest is ^81Br (80.9344). Sum is 78.9183 +80.9344 =159.8527.

So, in X (CH3MgBr), the elements are H, C, Mg, Br.

Now, the lightest element is H, the heaviest is Br.

So the cumulative atomic masses would be the sum of H's total (3.0219) and Br's total (159.8527) → 3.0219 +159.8527=162.8746.

But looking at the options, the choices are 35,25,31,29. So 162 isn't an option. So perhaps my assumption about X is wrong.

Hmm. Maybe X is a different substance. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: X is an alkali metal, like Li or Na. But Grignard reagents are Mg-based, not alkali metals. Hmm.

Wait, maybe X is something else. Let me think about the product of X and a keto acid having two oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is a base that deprotonates the acid, forming an oxygen-containing product.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a metal like sodium, which when reacts with a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid), forms a sodium salt. But that would have O in the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that when reacts with a keto acid, forms an alcohol. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product has two oxygen atoms because it's an ester. For example, if X is an alcohol (but that's not a reagent like Grignard).

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, but that doesn't fit the two O atoms.

Wait, maybe the product is an ester. Esters have two oxygen atoms in their functional group. For example, R-O-CO-R'. But that would require X to be an alcohol, which doesn't fit with being a reagent like Grignard.

Hmm. I'm stuck again.

Let me try another approach. Let's look at the options:

Options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

These are all small numbers. Let me think about what elements could sum to these numbers when considering their lightest and heaviest isotopes.

Wait, perhaps the lightest element is H (1.00784) and the heaviest is Cl (35.45). So sum is 36.45, which is close to option A (35). But that's approximate.

Wait, but if the lightest is H and the heaviest is Cl, their sum is about 35.45 +1.00784 =36.4578. Still, none of the options exactly match, but option A is 35, which is close.

Another option: lightest is H and heaviest is S (32.065). Sum is about 33.07, which is near option C (31) or D (29).

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the lightest is C (12.01) and the heaviest is O (16.00). Sum is 28.01, which is near option D (29).

Wait, but that's a big jump. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps X is CO2. No, but earlier analysis didn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate. Not likely, as X is a reagent in organic chemistry.

Wait, going back, perhaps the product of X and a keto acid is an ester. For example, X could be an alcohol (but again, that's not a reagent like Grignard).

Alternatively, X could be a base that deprotonates the keto acid, forming a salt and releasing CO2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think about the elements in X.

Option B is 25. Let's see, 25 is the atomic number of Mn. Or maybe it's the sum of two elements: say, Mg (24.3) and something else.

Wait, in CH3MgBr, the elements are C, H, Mg, Br. Their sum of lightest and heaviest isotopes would be:

H: ~3.0219

C: 12.01 (only ^12C? Or considering isotopes? Wait, carbon has ^12C (abundant), ^13C (1.1%), ^14C (trace). So sum would be 12.0000 + 13.0034 + ...? But the problem says to sum all the heavier and lighter isotopes, so maybe just the lightest and heaviest. So for C, 12.0000 (lightest) and 14.0032 (heaviest, ^14C). Sum is 26.0032.

Mg: 23.98504 +25.98237=49.96741.

Br:78.9183 +80.9344=159.8527.

So for X=CH3MgBr, the elements are H, C, Mg, Br.

The lightest is H (sum 3.02), heaviest is Br (sum 159.85). Sum is 162.87, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Maybe X is a different compound. Let me think about another possibility. Perhaps X is Na (sodium), but Na doesn't form Grignard reagents; Mg does.

Wait, another possibility: X is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or N2. But that doesn't fit the reagent part.

Wait, perhaps X is a transition metal. For example, Zn or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else entirely. Let me think about the reaction again.

X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce gas W (CO?), precipitate G. When G is heated, gives B (melting point ~277 K). Also, X reacts with a keto acid to produce a product with two O atoms.

Wait, another angle: perhaps X is a metal like Zn, which when reacts with an acid produces H2 gas. But H2 doesn't fit W's condition. So no.

Wait, if W is CO, and gas W is formed, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a carbonate, producing CO gas. But I'm not sure of the exact reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between magnesium and a carbonate, producing CO gas. Let me think: Mg + CO3^2- → MgCO3 (precipitate) + CO↑? But I'm not sure if that's a standard reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction where a metal reacts with a carbonate to produce CO gas and a metal oxide. For example:

2 Mg + CO3^2- → MgO + MgCO3 (precipitate) ? No, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is Mg + H2O → Mg(OH)2 (precipitate) + H2↑. But H2 doesn't fit W's condition.

Wait, perhaps Y is a ketone. Mg reacts with ketone to form an alcohol, but that wouldn't generate a gas.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think about the possible elements.

If the answer is option D (29), perhaps the sum is 29. So maybe the lightest element is C (12) and the heaviest is O (16), sum 28. Close to 29.

Or perhaps it's H (1) and something else, like Cl (35) → 36. Not matching.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the product of X and a keto acid having two O atoms. Let's say X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid. For example, if X is NaOH, and the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid, the product would be the sodium salt, which has O from the acid. But NaOH's reaction with a keto acid would form a salt, which might have oxygen.

But NaOH is a strong base, but it's not a reagent in the same way as Grignard reagents. So perhaps X is Mg(OH)2, but that's not a typical reagent.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a metal hydride, like LiAlH4, which is a strong reducing agent. But LiAlH4 reacts with carbonyl groups to form alcohols, but I'm not sure about the product's oxygen count.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a borohydride, but that's a stretch.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the options.

If the correct answer is option C (31), then the sum could be H (1) + something else. 31-1=30. So the heaviest element would have a sum of 30. Which element's isotopes sum around 30? Maybe S (32.07) is too heavy. Or perhaps Cl (35.45) is too heavy. Alternatively, perhaps it's Mg (24.3) and something else.

Alternatively, if the sum is 31, perhaps it's C (12) + O (16) = 28, which is near option D (29). Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible elements in X that could lead to a sum of 31.

If the lightest element is H (1.007) and the heaviest is S (32.07), sum is ~33.07. Close to option C (31), but not exact.

Alternatively, if the heaviest is O (16.00), and the lightest is H (1.007), sum is ~17.007, which is not matching any option.

Wait, another possibility: the heaviest element is Cl (35.45), and the lightest is H (1.007). Sum is about 36.45, which is near option A (35).

So perhaps the correct answer is option A (35), which would correspond to H and Cl.

So, in X, the elements would be H and Cl. So X could be HCl, but that's a gas, not a solid. Alternatively, perhaps X is a chloride salt, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has 2 O atoms. If X is HCl, reacting with a keto acid like acetic acid would form something with O, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is MgCl2, and when it reacts with a keto acid, it forms a magnesium salt with O atoms. But that's speculative.

I'm not making progress. Let me try to look for another way. The possible correct answer is likely option C (31) or D (29).

Alternatively, perhaps the elements are O and Mg.

O's lightest isotope sum: 16.00 (O-16) + 18.00 (O-18) = 34.00.

Mg's sum: 23.985 +25.982 =49.967.

So O and Mg sum would be 34 +49.967=83.967. Not matching any options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the lightest element is C (12.01) and the heaviest is O (16.00), sum 28.01, which is close to option D (29). Considering possible rounding, maybe 28 is approximated to 29. So option D would be the answer.

But I'm not confident. Another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. So perhaps X is a base that adds to the keto acid, forming a product like an alcohol with one O, but that's not two.

Wait, maybe the product is an ester. Esters have two O atoms in the ester group. So if X is an alcohol, but that's not a reagent like Grignard.

Wait, perhaps X is a Grignard reagent, and the reaction with a keto acid (like a β-keto acid) would form a ketone after protonation, which doesn't have an O. Hmm, not sure.

I think I've exhausted my options. Based on the analysis, the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X would be H and Cl, totaling around 35, which is option A. But this is a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Mg, and the elements are H and Mg.

H's sum is ~3.02, Mg's sum is ~49.967. So together, ~53. Which isn't an option.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option C (31). So I'll go with that.


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and eventually compound B upon heating. The melting point of B is approximately 277 K, and the product of X with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, suggesting it could be a Grignard reagent (e.g., CH3MgBr). The task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Substance X**: Grignard reagents (e.g., CH3MgBr) are plausible candidates, as they are used in organic chemistry and react with acids or other compounds. This suggests X contains elements like C, H, Mg, and Br.

2. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include CO (14 protons, 14 neutrons) or N2O (22 protons, 22 neutrons). However, CO aligns better with the reaction context.

3. **Precipitate G and Compound B**: G forms when X reacts with Y, and heating G releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (~4°C). This suggests B could be a salt or hydrate, but the exact identity remains unclear.

4. **Product with Keto Acid**: The product of X and a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms, possibly forming an ester or alcohol. This supports the idea of X being a Grignard reagent, as it reacts with carbonyl compounds to form alcohols.

5. **Atomic Mass Calculation**:
   - For H: The lightest isotope (^1H) has a mass of ~1.00784. Including the heaviest (^2H), the total is ~3.0219.
   - For C: The lightest isotope (^12C) has a mass of ~12.01, and the heaviest (^14C) adds ~14.0032, giving a total of ~26.0132.
   - For Mg: The lightest isotope (^24Mg) has a mass of ~23.985, and the heaviest (^26Mg) adds ~25.982, giving a total of ~49.967.
   - For Br: The lightest isotope (^79Br) has a mass of ~78.918, and the heaviest (^81Br) adds ~80.934, giving a total of ~159.852.

6. **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**: In X (e.g., CH3MgBr), the lightest element is H, and the heaviest is Br. Their cumulative atomic masses are ~3.0219 (H) and ~159.852 (Br). The sum is approximately 162.874, which does not match the given options.

7. **Revisiting the Options**:
   - **Option A (35)**: Suggests a sum of ~35, possibly from H (~1) and Cl (~35). However, X is likely a Grignard reagent, not containing Cl.
   - **Option B (25)**: Suggests a sum of ~25, possibly from C (~12) and O (~16). This aligns with the product containing two oxygen atoms but does not fully match the reaction context.
   - **Option C (31)**: Suggests a sum of ~31, possibly from C (~12) and S (~20). This is less likely, as S is not present in X.
   - **Option D (29)**: Suggests a sum of ~29, possibly from C (~12) and O (~16). This aligns with the product containing two oxygen atoms and is the most plausible option.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X align most closely with **Option D (29)**, considering the reaction context and the involvement of oxygen in the product.

**Answer: D**
