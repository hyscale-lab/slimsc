Okay, so I have this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energy E is given as E = (pi^2 * Ä§^2)/(2mL^2). So each particle's energy levels are quantized based on their quantum numbers.

Wait, each particle is spin-1/2, which means they have spin up or down. But wait, in a one-dimensional infinite well, the energy levels for each particle depend on their quantum number n. The energy for a single particle is E_n = (n^2) * E, right? Because E scales with n squared.

But wait, these are four identical particles. Oh, right! They must obey the Pauli exclusion principle because they're fermions. So each quantum state can hold a maximum of two particles (spin-up and spin-down). So, each quantum state can have two particles with the same n, but different spins.

So the system's total energy will be the sum of the energies of each particle. The ground state is the lowest energy possible arrangement, and the excited states come from higher energy configurations.

Let me think about the ground state first. For four identical spin-1/2 particles, the lowest energy configuration would have the lowest possible n's, but considering the Pauli exclusion.

In the ground state, the first two particles can be in n=1 (each with opposite spins) because spin 1/2 allows two per n. Then, the next two particles would have to go to n=2, each with opposite spins. So ground state configuration is two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, but wait, can multiple particles share the same n? Oh, yes, because each spin is a separate state. So two particles can have the same n but opposite spins.

So for the ground state, the energies would be 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E? Wait, wait, no. Wait, no. Each particle's energy is n^2 E, so for each particle in n=1, it's E. There are two such particles, so 2E. Similarly, two particles in n=2, each with 4E,
