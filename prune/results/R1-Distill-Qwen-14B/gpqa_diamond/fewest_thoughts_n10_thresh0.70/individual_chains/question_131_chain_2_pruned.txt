Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. So, dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride, which makes sense. The anhydride has some specific NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, which is pretty downfield. That usually suggests something with aromatic protons, but wait, maybe it's an alkyne or an ester? Hmm, but anhydrides... Wait, in 1H NMR, a peak at 7 ppm could be aromatic protons, but another possibility is that it's an alpha proton to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. But wait, for an anhydride, the carbonyl would be around 170-185 ppm in 13C NMR. 

Looking at the 13C NMR data: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 ppm is probably a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, like a carbonyl adjacent carbon. 165 ppm is more in line with a carbonyl, maybe the anhydride carbonyl. Wait, but anhydrides usually have two carbonyl carbons. Hmm, but the question says two peaks in 13C, so maybe the carbons are equivalent due to symmetry? Oh, wait, the anhydride formed from a cis-alkene in a dicarboxylic acid. If the starting alkene is cis, then the rings formed (maybe a cyclic anhydride) might have symmetry.

Wait, let's think about this. If the starting material is a cis-dicarboxylic acid with an alkene, dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride, right? For example, if the alkene is between the two carboxylic acid groups, then upon dehydration, they would form a five-membered ring (if the alkene is in the correct position) as a cyclic anhydride. So maybe it's something like a cyclic structure, perhaps a maleic anhydride derivative, but with
