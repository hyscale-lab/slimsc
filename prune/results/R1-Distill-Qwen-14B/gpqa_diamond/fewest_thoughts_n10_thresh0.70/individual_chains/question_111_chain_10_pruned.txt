Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question has two parts, A and B, and I need to figure out which major products are formed in each reaction. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products for A and B.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacts with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Oh wait, t-BuOK is a strong base, so maybe it's an enolate formation reaction. 

So, the starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The cyclohexanone ring has substituents at the 2, 6, and 1 positions (wait, no, the 1 is the ketone). Let me draw the structure mentally. The cyclohexanone has a ketone at position 1, and at position 2, there's an ethyl group, and at position 6, a methyl group. Wait, wait, no. The numbering: if it's 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, that would be the cyclohexane ring with a ketone at carbon 1. Carbon 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group (since it's 2,6-dimethyl). So, carbon 2 has two substituents: ethyl and methyl, and carbon 6 has a methyl. So the structure would be: position 1 is the ketone, position 2 has ethyl and methyl, position 6 has methyl. 

When t-BuOK is used, it deprotonates the ketone to form the enolate. But where? The enolate formation depends on where the alpha protons are and which site is more acidic. The alpha positions are adjacent to the ketone. Let's see: the carbonyl is at position 1. So the adjacent carbons are 2 and 6. Wait, the carbonyl is at position 1, so the alpha carbons are positions 2 and probably 6 as well. 

So, the enolate could form at either position 2 or 6. But wait, in a cyclohexanone, the
