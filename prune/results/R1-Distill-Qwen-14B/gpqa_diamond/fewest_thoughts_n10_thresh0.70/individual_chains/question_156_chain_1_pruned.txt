Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are analyzed using HPLC columnsâ€”both standard (achiral) and chiral. The options are about the number of peaks observed in each.

First, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are typically used for epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation is an oxidation reaction where the double bond is converted into an epoxide. So, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide.

Wait, but wait. The reaction is followed by aqueous acid. Oh right, I think that epoxides can undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening reactions. So the initial reaction is epoxidation, and then in acidic conditions, the epoxide might open up.

So, for each starting alkene, Reaction 1 is (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 is (Z)-oct-4-ene. Each is treated with mCPBA, which forms an epoxide. Then, acid is added, leading to ring-opening.

Now, what's the structure of the products? Let me think. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the center. But wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, octene is eight carbons. So oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle, between carbons 4 and 5.

Epoxidation of (E) and (Z) isomers. Epoxidation with mCPBA is an electrocyclic reaction, I think, which proceeds via a cyclic transition state. For alkenes, the endo transition state is usually favored. But wait, wait. For epoxidation, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, so when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, the peracid adds across the double bond. The reaction forms an epoxide, and the configuration depends on the starting alkene's geometry. For example, in (
