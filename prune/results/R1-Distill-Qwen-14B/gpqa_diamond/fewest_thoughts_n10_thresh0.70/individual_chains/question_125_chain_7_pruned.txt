Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow and think through everything. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, right, I remember that the potential is V(r) = (1/2)mω²r², which is similar to the 3D case where each direction contributes a 1D harmonic oscillator.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with that energy. Oh wait, right, in quantum mechanics, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers, and in the 3D harmonic oscillator, each energy level has a certain degeneracy, meaning multiple eigenfunctions share the same energy.

So, I think the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh, wait no, the formula is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. But since in 3D, each direction contributes, and for each mode, the energy is (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding them up gives E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So the total n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers.

Wait, but sometimes the principal quantum number is used, where n = 2l + something? No, that's more for hydrogen-like atoms. For the 3D isotropic oscillator, the energy depends on the sum of the three quantum numbers. So n_total = n_x + n_y + n_z. Each n_i is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). So the energy levels are E = (n_total + 3/2) ħω.

Now, the third excited state. Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy, which is (0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. First excited state would be when n_total is 1: E = (1 + 3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω. Second excited state is n_total = 2: (7/2) ħω
