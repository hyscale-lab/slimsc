Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think through it.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are A to D: Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

First, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are like infinities that pop up in calculations which don't make physical sense. So regularization is a way to handle these by introducing a cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite before renormalization.

So each option: let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Wait, string theory is a theory of quantum gravity, right? It's supposed to be a theory that unites quantum mechanics with general relativity. I think in string theory, the fundamental objects are strings rather than point particles. Now, since string theory incorporates gravity, maybe it doesn't have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories? Or does it? Because I remember that in string theory, especially the perturbative approach, you calculate using Feynman diagrams similar to QFT, but maybe the way the interactions work leads to better behaved theories. Or wait, no—string theory still has loop diagrams which can be divergent. But I think that string theory doesn't require the same kind of regularization because it's background-independent and maybe the divergences are handled differently or not present. Or perhaps superstring theory is finite, meaning it doesn't need regularization because it doesn't have the same divergences as other theories.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, right? And it's known to be asymptotically free, which means that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, so perturbation theory works. But wait, does QCD require regularization? I think so. Because in QCD you have things like confinement and the formation of quark-gluon plasmas. But even in perturbation theory, loop diagrams can have divergences, so you'd need regularization methods like dimensional regularization or lattice methods. So QCD does require regularization, which would mean it's not the correct answer.

Option C: Quantum
