Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question involves the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. They want to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which the question states we can assume.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The ratio of the number of particles in level 2 to level 1 is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is lower. But wait, wait a minute—spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when spots cover 40% of the surface, the average Teff drops. But wait, the question says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. But I'm not sure how this affects the local conditions.

Wait, but the question says when the star's surface is not covered, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But wait, that might not be the local temperature but the average. But for the photosphere, I think the photons we observe are coming from different parts. So the effective temperature is an average, but the star's actual photosphere might have regions at different temperatures.

Wait, no, the problem says that the photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the average temperature of the photosphere is lower when spots are present. But wait, the photosphere itself might have a lower average temperature because spots are cooler. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, but that doesn't make physical sense because spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem states that when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is being considered as 5500 K for the purpose of this calculation. Or maybe the average temperature is 5500 K, which would imply that the emission from the spots and the surrounding photosphere is blending into an effective temperature of 5500 K.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So do we model the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present? Or is each region (spot and non-spot) at its own temperature?

Wait, the problem says that the star's surface is covered by spots—40% of the surface is spots. So the rest 60% is at 6000 K, and the spots are cooler. But the effective temperature of the whole star drops to 5500 K when spots are present.

But when looking at the photosphere as observed, the presence of spots could lower the overall emission, but each region (spot and non-spot) has its own temperature. So the observed spectrum is a combination of the two regions.

Wait, but the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Hmm, perhaps the star's photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K in that case. Or perhaps the star's average temperature is 5500 K, but the spots are cooler. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. So the key is to find the ratio n1/n2 or n2/n1, and see how it changes when the temperature changes.

Wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't.

Wait, the ratio could be n_upper / n_lower. Because in the Boltzmann equation, higher energy levels have fewer atoms, so n_upper < n_lower. So if the temperature increases, the ratio n_upper/n_lower increases because the exponential term becomes less negative.

Wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That would mean that when the overall temperature is lower, the ratio is lower. So maybe the ratio is n_upper / n_lower, and when T is lower, this ratio decreases.

Wait, let me think: the Boltzmann factor is exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, the exponent is negative. So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio (n2/n1) increases. So when T is higher, (n2/n1) is higher.

In the problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K. So that's lower than 6000 K. So (n2/n1) would be lower when T is lower. So the ratio (n2/n1) decreases when T decreases.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. So the ratio (n2/n1) is lower in the spotted case. So the question is, what is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So the factor would be (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots.

Wait, let me get this right. The ratio when there are no spots is higher than when there are spots. So the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots divided by (n2/n1)_with_spots.

Wait, but the problem asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots divided by (n2/n1)_spotted.

So, let me model this.

The ratio R = (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Given that E2 > E1, (E2 - E1) is positive.

So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so R increases.

So when the star has no spots, T is 6000 K. When it has spots, T is 5500 K. Therefore, R_no_spots = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k * 6000) ), R_spotted = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k * 5500) )

The factor is R_no_spots / R_spotted = [exp( -ΔE/(k * 6000) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k * 5500) ) ] = exp( [ΔE/(k) ] (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Wait, because the exponents are subtracted. Let me compute the exponent.

Exponent: [ -ΔE/(k * 6000) ) ] - [ -ΔE/(k * 5500) ) ] = ΔE/(k) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ) ]

Wait, wait, no. Because the factor is [exp(a)] / [exp(b)] = exp(a - b).

So a is -ΔE/(k*6000), and b is -ΔE/(k*5500).

So a - b = [ -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] - [ -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ] = ΔE/(k) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ) ]

Which simplifies to ΔE/(k) [ (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) ] = ΔE/(k) * (500) / (3,300,000) )

Wait, 5500 * 6000 = 33,000,000. So 500 / 33,000,000 = 5e2 / 3.3e7 = approximately 1.515e-5.

So the exponent becomes (ΔE/k) * 1.515e-5.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact numbers yet. Let me compute 1/5500 and 1/6000 first.

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818 per K.

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667 per K.

So the difference is approximately 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151 per K.

So the exponent is ΔE/(k) * 0.000015151.

But wait, what's ΔE in terms of the wavelength? The transition corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. So that's 1448 Angstroms, which is 1448e-10 meters.

The energy of a photon is E = hc / λ, where h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and λ is wavelength in meters.

So ΔE = hc / λ.

Let me compute ΔE.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.37e-18 J.

But Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.37e-18) / (1.38e-23) ≈ 9.93e4 ≈ 99,300.

Wait, so ΔE/(k) ≈ 1e5.

So the exponent is (1e5) * (0.000015151) ) = 1e5 * 1.5151e-5 ≈ 1.5151.

So the exponent is about 1.515.

So the factor is exp(1.515) ≈ e^1.515.

What's e^1.5? e^1 is about 2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.648, so 2.718 * 1.648 ≈ 4.48. But 1.515 is a bit higher than 1.5.

e^1.515 ≈ e^1.5 * e^0.015 ≈ 4.48 * 1.015 ≈ 4.55.

So the factor is approximately 4.55.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, so that's probably the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake with the exponents or the setup.

Wait, let's re-express the factor:

Factor = exp( (ΔE/k) * (1/(T1) - 1/(T2)) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure about the setup. The factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spotted.

Which is [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T_spotted) ) ]

The (g2/g1) terms cancel, so we have exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_no_spots) ] + [ ΔE/(k T_spotted) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_no_spots) ] )

Wait, no. Wait, when you take the ratio, it's (exp(a)) / (exp(b)) = exp(a - b), where a is the exponent from the no-spots case, and b is the exponent from the spotted case.

So a = -ΔE/(k T_no_spots) ) = -ΔE/(k * 6000)

b = -ΔE/(k T_spotted) ) = -ΔE/(k * 5500)

So a - b = [ -ΔE/(6000 k) ] - [ -ΔE/(5500 k) ) ] = ΔE/(k) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ) ]

Which is the same as before. So the exponent is ΔE/(k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000).

So the way I did it earlier is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when the star has spots, the effective T is 5500 K. So T_spotted is 5500, T_no_spots is 6000.

So the factor is exp( (ΔE/k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Which I calculated as approximately 1.515, so exp(1.515) ≈ 4.55.

So the factor is about 4.55. The closest option is C) ~4.5.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ~2.9, which is about e^1.08, which is about 2.95, but our exponent was around 1.515, which gives about 4.55.

So the correct answer should be C) ~4.5.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation of 1/5500 -1/6000.

1/5500 is approximately 0.000181818.

1/6000 is approximately 0.000166667.

Subtracting gives 0.000015151.

So 0.000015151 ≈ 1.5151e-5.

Multiply by ΔE/(k) which we found to be about 99300 (since 1.37e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ 99300).

So 99300 * 1.5151e-5 ≈ 99300 * 0.000015151 ≈ 1.506.

So the exponent is approximately 1.506.

So exp(1.506) is e^1.506.

e^1 is 2.718, e^0.5 is 1.648, so 1.506 is 1.5 + 0.006.

e^1.5 is about 4.4817. e^0.006 is about 1.006.

So 4.4817 * 1.006 ≈ 4.51.

So the factor is approximately 4.51, which aligns with option C) ~4.5.


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation governs this ratio:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The problem states that the star's effective temperature (\(T_{\text{eff}}\)) is 6000 K when there are no spots and 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. The ratio of the number of atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots, indicating that the ratio is sensitive to the temperature change.

The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spots}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation for each case, the statistical weights \(g_2/g_1\) cancel out, leaving:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) corresponds to the transition between levels associated with a wavelength of 1448 Å. Using the relation \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h\) is Planck's constant (\(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\)), \(c\) is the speed of light (\(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\)), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.37 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Boltzmann's constant is \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), so:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.37 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.93 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
\]

Next, we compute the temperature term:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}.
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001818, \quad \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001667,
\]

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.00001515 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right) = (9.93 \times 10^4)(0.00001515) \approx 1.515.
\]

Finally, the factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.515) \approx 4.55.
\]

This matches closely with option C (\(\sim 4.5\)).
