Okay, so I have this question about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. Hmm, let me think through this. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to piece it together.

First, I need to understand what regularization is. From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. These infinities are a problem because they don't give physical results, so we need to regularize them to make the math work and get finite, meaningful answers.

The question is asking which theory doesn't need this regularization when energies are high. So, I should look at each option and see if they naturally avoid these infinities or if they require some form of regularization.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I know string theory deals with particles as strings vibrating. It's supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity, I think. Also, I've heard that string theories don't have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories because they're background-dependent and maybe have a more consistent structure. But wait, do they still need regularization? Or do they handle high energies without it? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD calculations often involve things like renormalization, which is related to dealing with infinities. But wait, when energy scales are high, QCD becomes asymptotically free, right? So at high energies, the coupling constant becomes small, making perturbative calculations manageable. But does that mean it doesn't require regularization? Or do they still need it because of other divergences, like in loop calculations? I think QCD does require regularization, even though it's manageable at high energies because of asymptotic freedom.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know it's a well-tested theory, but it does have issues with divergences. For example, when calculating the self-energy of an electron, you get infinities. So, QED definitely requires regularization. But wait, since it's a renormalizable theory, maybe it's handled through renormalization rather than needing a separate regularization step. Or is regularization part of the process? I think regularization is a tool used in QED before renormalization. So yes, QED
