Okay, so I've got this question about Feynman diagrams and loop counts. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question says that a colleague has a Feynman diagram with some factors next to it labeled as "size estimate." The factors are alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. And we need to find out how many loops the diagram has based on this.

Wait, I remember that in Feynman diagrams, each loop contributes a certain factor to the overall calculation. Specifically, each loop introduces a factor of 1/(16 pi^2), I think, because of the integration in loop momentum. So when you have multiple loops, the denominator would have higher powers of pi.

Looking at the factors given, the term is 1/(4pi)^6. Let me compute that. (4pi)^6 is (4^6)(pi^6), so 4^6 is 4096, and 6 powers of pi. So 1/(4pi)^6 is 1/(4096 pi^6). But wait, each loop contributes a 1/(16 pi^2) factor, right? So let's see how many loops would that be. 

Each loop gives 1/(16 pi^2). So for n loops, it's (1/(16 pi^2))^n. Let's see how that compares to our term. Our term is 1
