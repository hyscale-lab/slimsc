Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might overlap and not be distinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. But wait, each state's uncertainty is ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ/τ2. So the total uncertainty is roughly the sum of these two?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the resolving power in terms of the Fourier transform. The width in time affects the width in energy. But in this case, each state has its own lifetime, so perhaps the broader (longer lifetime) state has a smaller energy uncertainty. 

Wait, no. Let me think again. The energy uncertainty ΔE is inversely proportional to the lifetime τ. So a state with a shorter lifetime (like τ1=1e-9 s) has a larger ΔE1, because ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1. Similarly, τ2 is 1e-8 s, which is ten times longer, so ΔE2 is smaller.

So, to resolve two states, the energy difference between them must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties, right? Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, the two energy levels might not be distinguishable due to their uncertainties overlapping.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to consider the uncertainty principle for each state. So for the first state, the energy uncertainty is ΔE1 = ħ/τ1, and for the second, ΔE2 = ħ/τ2.

But wait, the problem is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. Let me denote ΔE = |E2 - E1|. To resolve them, ΔE should be much larger than the uncertainty in each. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the energy uncertainty of each state. Or maybe it's the sum of the two uncertainties?

Wait, maybe I should calculate the energy uncertainty for each state. Let's compute that.

Given:

τ1 = 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1. Let me compute this.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ΔE1 = (1.05457e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05457e-25 J.

But wait, the answer options are in eV. I need to convert this to eV.

1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J.

So, 1.05457e-25 J / 1.60218e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, that's 6.58e-7 eV, which is 0.000000658 eV. Hmm, that's a small number.

Wait, but ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV. Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = ħ/τ2 = 1.05457e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05457e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.05457e-26 / 1.60218e-19 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.58e-8 eV.

So, the energy uncertainty for the first state is larger than that of the second.

But the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. To distinguish them, the energy difference ΔE should be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties, perhaps? Or is it that each should be larger than the other's uncertainty?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in each energy level. Alternatively, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty of the measurement.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the energy difference has to be larger than the energy uncertainty of each state. Because each state has its own uncertainty, and you want to have the difference larger than either of them so that they don't overlap.

Wait, but let me think of the widths. If two states have energy uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2, then to clearly distinguish them, the difference between E1 and E2, ΔE, should be at least as big as the sum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is less than the sum, the two energy bands could overlap. So ΔE ≥ ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Compute ΔE1 + ΔE2: 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = approximately 7.238e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be at least about 7.2e-7 eV or higher.

Now looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → smaller than 7.2e-7, so no.

B) 1e-11 eV → way smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 eV.

Wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001. Let's compare to 7.2e-7 which is 0.00000072. So 1e-4 is much larger. So this would be sufficient.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 7.2e-7, so not enough.

So the only option that's larger than 7.2e-7 is option C, which is 1e-4 eV. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I do the calculation correctly? Because 1e-4 is 10^4 times larger than 7.2e-7. So yes, it's definitely larger.

So the answer would be option C.


To determine the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar
\]

Here, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). The energy uncertainty for each state is given by:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}
\]

For the first state with lifetime \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.60218 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.60218 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

For the second state with lifetime \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.60218 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of both states:

\[
\Delta E \geq \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E \geq 6.58 \times 10^{-7} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

Now, compare this threshold with the given options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} < 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) → Too small.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} < 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) → Too small.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} > 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) → Sufficiently large.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} < 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) → Too small.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.
