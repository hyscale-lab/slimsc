Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, both planets are Earth-like and have the same mass. They've been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives us their minimum masses and orbital periods. The key here is that Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1's period is P1 = P2 / 3. 

Wait, orbital period is how long it takes to orbit the star. Shorter period means it's closer to the star since orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law. So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is to its.

Also, both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies the calculations. The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is more massiveâ€”twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But same radius? Interesting. So, the two stars must have different densities because mass and radius are the same, but Planet_1's star is more massive but same size. Wait, no, same radius but different mass. So higher mass in same radius implies higher density. But how does that affect transit probability?

The question is about the transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting
