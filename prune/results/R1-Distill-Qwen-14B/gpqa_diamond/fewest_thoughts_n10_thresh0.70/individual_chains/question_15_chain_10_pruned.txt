Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about detecting transiting planets. Hmm. Let's see what the question is. So, the researchers want to observe either Planet_1 or Planet_2 because they have limited time and want to choose the one with the highest probability of transiting.

Wait, transiting probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight, right? I remember that for a planet to transit, its orbit must be edge-on relative to us. But not all planets are in such an orientation. The probability of a planet transiting is higher when its orbital plane is more likely to be aligned with our line of sight.

So I think the probability of transit is related to the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. Oh wait, more precisely, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), where R_star is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, no, I think I might be mixing it up. Let me think again.

No, wait, the probability of a random alignment being edge-on is actually given by (R_star / a), because it's the ratio of the star's radius to the distance where the planet is. So the probability is higher when a is smaller (since a is the distance from the star, so closer planet has a smaller a, so higher probability). But wait, also, how do the masses and other factors come in?

Wait, the problem says both planets have the same masses. Also, their orbits are circular. The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, right, because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same radius as Planet_1's host.

So the transit probability depends on the planet's orbital distance. Hmm. Let me try to remember the formula. Oh yes, the transit probability P is approximately (R_star / a) divided by (something else?), or is it just proportional to R_star/(a * something)? Wait, I think the probability is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, but perhaps there's another factor. Wait, I think the formula is P ≈ (R_star / a) × (something else). Or maybe it's a certain function involving orbital parameters.

Alternatively, another approach: the probability of a transiting orbit is proportional to (R_star / a
