Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. The question is about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, symmetry can be a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to remember what C3h symmetry means. From what I recall, symmetry elements include things like axes, planes, and centers. C3h is one of the point groups in molecular symmetry. Let me think... Oh right, C3h has a principal three-fold axis (C3), and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The molecule should have a three-fold rotation that leaves it looking the same, and when you reflect it across a horizontal plane, it should also look the same.

So, the options are four molecules, each with a different structure. I need to analyze each one.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Hmm, triphenylene is a fused ring system, but the substituents might affect the symmetry. Trifuran suggests three furan-like rings. Wait, the substituents are phenylene groups. If the molecule has three phenyl groups attached symmetrically, maybe that could give it C3h symmetry. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure. If the substituents are placed symmetrically around a central point, maybe a three-fold axis would work.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Benzo implies a benzene ring fused with something. The trifuran suggests three furan rings. So maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that gives certain symmetry. If the substituents are in positions that allow a three-fold rotation, perhaps C3 symmetry exists, but I'm not sure if there's a mirror plane as well.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl groups are bulky, attached to a borate. So the structure is probably something like (isopropyl)3B(O-)R. The molecule would have a central boron atom with three isopropyl groups around it. Is this structure symmetrical? Since all three substituents are the same, maybe there's a three-fold axis. If the molecule is symmetrical around a C3 axis, but does it have a mirror plane? Wait, if you have three identical groups around a central point, like in BF3, that's trigonal pyramidal, but with three identical substituents it might have C3 symmetry. But wait, triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar structure around boron? Or maybe it's a trigonal pyramidal if the charge affects it. Wait, no, the borate would have a negative charge. So the structure is [B(O R)3]^-. Each isopropyl group is the same, so the molecule should have a C3 axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm. If you imagine a plane cutting through the boron atom and the center, maybe. But wait, mirror planes can be a bit tricky here. Alternatively, if it's trigonal pyramidal, the symmetry would be Td, which has multiple symmetry elements. Or wait, if the molecule is symmetrical around a C3 axis but without a mirror plane, then the point group would be D3h? Or maybe C3v? I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the molecule doesn't have a mirror plane, so it wouldn't have C3h symmetry.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine, right? Its structure is like a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with an amine group. So, it's a bridge structure. Quinuclidine has a high degree of symmetry. It has a center of inversion and several mirror planes. Wait, but what's its point group? I think quinuclidine is in the Td point group. So that's tetrahedral symmetry. So it might have a three-fold axis but also other symmetry elements. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's in the C3h symmetry because of the mirror plane and the three-fold axis. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I should think about each molecule's structure.

Starting with option C, triisopropyl borate. The structure is [B(OiPr)3]^-. Boron is in the center, with three identical isopropyl groups attached. So the geometry around boron is trigonal planar. If the molecule is symmetrical, the point group is D3h, which includes a C3 axis and a σh plane. Wait, D3h has a principal C3 axis, three C2 axes perpendicular to it, and a horizontal mirror plane. So if that's the case, then triisopropyl borate would have C3h symmetry, which is D3h? Or am I mixing up the notation?

Wait, no. Point group symbols can be a bit confusing. The C3h point group is a subgroup of D3h. C3h has a C3 axis and a σh plane, but no other symmetry elements. Wait, or is C3h a different notation? Alternatively, D3h includes C3 and σh, but also other elements like C2 and others. So perhaps triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, which includes a σh plane, so it would have C3h symmetry as a subset. Hmm, but the question is asking which molecule has C3h symmetry, so if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it would also have C3h, but maybe the question is about the exact symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the point group wrong for triisopropyl borate. Let me think again. The molecule has three identical groups attached to a central atom in a trigonal planar geometry. The trigonal planar with three identical substituents would have D3h symmetry. Because it has a C3 axis, a σh plane, and other elements. So the point group is D3h. But does D3h include C3h? Well, the C3h is a point group with a C3 axis and a σh plane, but without any other symmetry elements. Whereas D3h has more elements, like C2 axes perpendicular to the principal axis. So if the molecule has D3h symmetry, it also has C3h as a subset. So the molecule would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but the question is which molecule has C3h symmetry. So if a molecule has D3h, it definitely has C3h. So triisopropyl borate might be a candidate.

Now, looking at option D, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclo structure. Its structure is a bridge with three bridges of two carbons each. The molecule has a high symmetry. It has a center of inversion and multiple mirror planes. The point group is Td, which is tetrahedral. So, in Td, there is a three-fold axis, but also other symmetry elements like C2 axes and inversion centers. So, in Td, the molecule doesn't have a σh plane, because the mirror planes are different. Wait, no, I'm not sure about that.

Wait, the Td point group has four C3 axes, three C2 axes, and six σ planes. So, a molecule with Td symmetry doesn't have a σh plane, but it has other mirror planes. So, it wouldn't have the C3h symmetry because C3h requires a σh plane. So, quinuclidine's point group is Td, which doesn't include a σh. So option D is out.

Now, looking at option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. So benzo implies a benzene ring fused to a furan ring in certain positions. The trifuran suggests three furan-like rings. Wait, the benzo is attached to the furan system in positions 1,2-c and 3,4-c' and 5,6-c''. So the molecule is a tricyclic structure with three benzene rings attached in a symmetric fashion? Or maybe it's a more complex structure. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 6-membered system with three substituents arranged symmetrically.

If the substituents are arranged in a trigonal fashion, maybe the molecule has a C3 axis. But does it have a σh plane? If the structure is symmetric across a plane, then yes. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold axis but lacks a mirror plane, so it would be C3 without the h.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. So this is a triphenylene group attached to a trifuran system. Triphenylene is a symmetric structure, a fused benzene ring system. The substituents are arranged in a way that might give three-fold symmetry. If the three phenyl groups are arranged symmetrically around a central point, and the trifuran parts are symmetric, then the molecule might have a C3 axis. Additionally, if there's a mirror plane through the center, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps option A is similar to option B but with more substituents. If the substituents are arranged in such a way that there's a mirror plane and a three-fold axis, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again: the question is about C3h symmetry, which requires a three-fold rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh).

Looking back at the options, option C is triisopropyl borate. If it has D3h symmetry, then it definitely has C3h. So that's a possibility. But perhaps another option has a C3h.

Option D, quinuclidine, has Td symmetry, which doesn't include σh, so no.

So between A, B, and C.

Option C: [B(OiPr)3]^-. Trigonal planar, three identical substituents, so yes, it has a C3 axis. Does it have a σh plane? If the molecule is planar, then yes. Because if you imagine a mirror plane cutting through the boron and the central point, perhaps each isopropyl group is a mirror image. So, the molecule would have a σh plane, making its symmetry C3h or higher. So, the point group would be D3h, which includes C3h as a part.

So, if that's the case, then option C would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but the options are:

A) triphenyleno...

B) benzo...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So the question is which of the four has C3h.

Wait, but let me think about the other options again.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... So the benzo is attached to the trifuran in a way that perhaps the substituents are at 1,2; 3,4; 5,6 positions, which could lead to a three-fold symmetry. But without seeing the structure, it's hard to say. Maybe the substituents are arranged symmetrically in a trigonal fashion, giving a C3 axis. But does it have a mirror plane?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that each is across from each other, making a C3 axis but no mirror plane.

Option A: triphenyleno... So triphenylene is a structure with three benzene rings fused in a symmetric way, perhaps like three rings attached to a central point. If each benzene is attached at 120-degree intervals, then the molecule would have a C3 axis. If there's a mirror plane that bisects through the center and reflects the substituents, then it has a σh plane, leading to C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a trigonal fashion, but without a mirror plane. Hmm.

Wait, without knowing the exact structures, it's a bit challenging, but let me think about common structures.

Triisopropyl borate is a known compound, and its structure is trigonal planar around boron, with three identical isopropyl groups. This would give it D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So option C definitely has C3h.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Wait, D3h has a principal C3 axis, a σh plane, and other elements. So if a molecule has D3h, it has C3h as a part of its symmetry. So option C would have C3h symmetry.

Looking back at the options, the answer is either C or perhaps A. So which among the four has C3h.

Wait, another angle: which of these molecules is known to have C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine is known to have Td symmetry, so it's out.

Triisopropyl borate (option C) is trigonal planar, so D3h, meaning it has C3h.

Option A: triphenyleno... Well, triphenylene itself is a molecule with three benzene rings in a symmetric arrangement. Triphenylene has a C3 axis, and a σh plane, so maybe it has C3h symmetry. But then the rest of the structure is a trifuranhexaone. Hmm, not sure.

Well, if I can't visualize the structures, I might have to rely on elimination.

The options are A, B, C, D.

D is Td, so no.

C is D3h, so yes.

So the answer would be option C.

Wait, no. Wait, the options are:

A) ...trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) ...trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine.

Wait, but I thought option C is triisopropyl borate, which has D3h symmetry. So it has C3h, so option C is correct.

So the answer should be C.


To determine which molecule has **C3h symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry properties. **C3h symmetry** requires a principal three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Let us evaluate each option:

### Option A: **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
This molecule consists of a triphenylene core fused with a trifuran system. Triphenylene itself has a symmetric arrangement of three benzene rings, which could potentially provide a C3 axis. However, the trifuran system introduces additional complexity, and it is unclear whether a horizontal mirror plane exists. Without a definitive structural analysis, it is uncertain if this molecule has C3h symmetry.

### Option B: **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
This molecule features a benzene ring fused with a trifuran system. The arrangement of substituents could allow for a C3 axis, but the presence of a horizontal mirror plane is not evident. The symmetry likely falls short of C3h due to the lack of a clear σh plane.

### Option C: **Triisopropyl Borate**
Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar geometry around the boron atom, with three identical isopropyl groups attached. This structure has a principal C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), making it symmetric under C3h operations. The point group for this molecule is **D3h**, which includes C3h as a subset. Therefore, triisopropyl borate definitely has C3h symmetry.

### Option D: **Quinuclidine**
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine with a highly symmetric structure. Its point group is **Td**, which includes a three-fold axis (C3) but lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Since C3h symmetry specifically requires a σh plane, quinuclidine does not exhibit C3h symmetry.

### Conclusion
Among the options, only **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) has the required C3h symmetry. It has a principal C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, fulfilling the criteria for C3h symmetry.

**Answer: C**
