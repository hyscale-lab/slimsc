Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see what it's all about. The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I'm supposed to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ_f f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think I need to parse this. So the interaction is between the boson X and fermions ψ_f. The term looks like a Yukawa coupling. The v is probably the vacuum expectation value, but maybe it's just a constant here.

But the important thing is the interaction is with the fermion fields ψ_f. So when X decays, it can decay into a pair of fermions. The possible decays depend on which fermions are allowed by the interaction and kinematics.

The X boson's mass is 6 GeV. So for a decay X → f f̄ to happen, the fermion's mass must be less than or equal to half of X's mass. Because in the rest frame of X, each fermion would have energy at least equal to their rest mass, so 2m_f ≤ m_X. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, let me think again. The rest mass of each fermion has to be less than or equal to half of X's mass because each would carry away at least their rest mass energy. So 2m_f ≤ m_X → m_f ≤ m_X/2 = 6/2 = 3 GeV.

So I need to list all fermions with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

What fermions are there? Let's list the known elementary fermions and their masses:

- Up quark (u): ~1.5 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~2-5 GeV (but average around 3-4, but maybe for this problem we take it as about 3?)
Wait, I think the current understanding is that the up quark is about 2.2 MeV, down about 4.7 MeV, but wait no—that's way too low. Wait, no, I'm mixing with the masses in the proton. No, actually, the masses are:

Wait, perhaps I should recall the approximate masses:

Electron: 0.0005 GeV (about 0.5 MeV)
Muon: ~0.1 GeV (100 MeV)
Tau: ~1.78 GeV
Neutrinos: even lighter, negligible.

Quarks:
Up: ~2.2 MeV (0.0022 GeV)
Down: ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
Charm: ~1.3 GeV
Strange: ~100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
Top: way too heavy, 173 GeV, so can't decay into top.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because in the options, I see particles like
