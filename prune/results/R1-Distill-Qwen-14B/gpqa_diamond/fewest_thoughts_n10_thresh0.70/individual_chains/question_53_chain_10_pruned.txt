Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So, that's a benzene ring, right? And it's di-substituted, meaning two substituents are attached to the ring. The substituents could be anything, but the question gives some clues from the spectroscopy data.

The FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a characteristic carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. So the compound has an ester functional group somewhere.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals.

- Two signals for aromatic-H. So the aromatic protons are split into two different environments. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two sets. For example, if the substituents are para, we might have two equivalent sets, but maybe they are ortho, meta, or something else. Wait, but wait: the substituents are two groups, so the ring could be para, meta, or ortho. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is something else.

- Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, another is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets or multiplets, depending on their coupling. So maybe there's an alkene group adjacent to an ester or another group.

- Two signals for –CH3 groups. Each as separate signals. So, two different methyl groups. But wait, if each is a separate signal, they must be in different environments. So perhaps two different methyl groups attached somewhere.

No signals for –CH2 groups. So the molecule doesn't have any methylene groups. That suggests that any CH2 groups are either absent or perhaps part of a more complex structure where they don't show up as separate signals. But I'm not sure about that yet.

So putting this together, the compound is a di-substituted benzene with an ester group and another substituent that contributes to the NMR signals mentioned.

Now, the options are about the molecular formula: C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

Let me think about the possible structures. Since there's an ester group, the structure could be something like a substituted phenyl ester. For example, maybe it's an aromatic ester with an alkyl chain.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR. Two aromatic protons. So perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic protons would be two sets of two each. Wait, no. Wait, in a para-disubstituted benzene, each substituent is opposite each other, so the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. Let me
