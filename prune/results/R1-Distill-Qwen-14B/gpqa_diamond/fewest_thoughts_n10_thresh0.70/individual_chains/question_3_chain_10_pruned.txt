Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition of 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of sigma_z. The operator given is 10σ_z +5σ_x. I need to find the expectation value of this operator up to one decimal place. The options are A to D.

Hmm, expectation values. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure over many measurements. For a given state, the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.

So the operator here is 10σ_z +5σ_x. I remember that σ matrices are the Pauli matrices. So σ_z and σ_x are 2x2 matrices. Let me write them out.

σ_z is [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. And σ_x is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. 

The state given is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Let me note that |↑⟩ is [1, 0] and |↓⟩ is [0, 1] as column vectors. So ψ can be written as a vector: [0.5, (√3)/2]†.

Wait, the dagger here is for the conjugate transpose, but since the coefficients are real, it's just the transpose. So ψ is a column vector with first element 0.5 and second √3/2.

So to calculate the expectation value, I can compute ⟨ψ| (10σ_z +5σ_x) |ψ⟩.

I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩, since expectation values are linear.

So first, compute ⟨σ_z⟩. σ_z is diagonal, so its expectation is just the sum of |amplitude|^2 times the eigenvalues. Alternatively, I can compute it using the matrix multiplication.

Wait, for σ_z, the expectation value is actually (0.5)^2 * 1 + (√3/2)^2 * (-1), because |↑⟩ has eigenvalue +1 and |↓⟩ has eigenvalue -1.

Let me compute that. (0.5)^2 is 0.25, multiplied by 1 is 0.25. (√3/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75, multiplied by -1 gives -0.75. So sum is 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σ_z⟩ is -0.5.

Then, the contribution from 10σ_z is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Next, compute ⟨σ_x⟩. Hmm, σ_x is a bit trickier because it's off-diagonal. The expectation value of σ_x is calculated as ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩. Let's compute it using the components.

Alternatively, I remember that for a spin-½ particle in state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σ_x is 2*(Re(b* a)), because σ_x's expectation is (ψ† σ_x ψ). Let me think more about that formula.

Wait, let's do the calculation step by step. Let me write ψ as a column vector: [a, b]^T, where a=0.5 and b=√3/2.

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when I multiply σ_x by ψ, I get [b, a]^T. Then, taking the conjugate transpose (which is [a*, b*]) and multiplying by that gives a*b* + b*a*.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩.

⟨ψ| is [a*, b*], and σ_x |ψ⟩ is [b, a]. So the inner product is a* * b + b* * a.

Which is (a^* b) + (b^* a). Since a and b are real here, it's a*b + b*a = 2ab.

So in this case, a is 0.5, b is √3/2.

So 2 * (0.5) * (√3/2) = 2 * (0.5 * √3/2) = 2*(√3/4) )= √3/2 ≈0.8660.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck. The formula says ⟨σ_x⟩ is (ψ† σ_x ψ), which is (a*, b* ) * σ_x [a, b]^T. So σ_x [a, b]^T is [b, a]^T. Then (a*, b*) multiplied by [b, a] is a*b + b*a. Since a and b are real, this is 2 a b.

So in this case, a = 0.5, b = √3/2.

So 2 * 0.5 * (√3/2) = (2 * 0.5) is 1, and 1 * (√3/2) is √3/2 ≈0.8660.

So ⟨σ_x⟩ is approximately 0.866. Then, the 5σ_x term is 5 * 0.866 ≈4.33.

So the total expectation value ⟨10σ_z +5σ_x⟩ is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the numbers. Because 0.5 is 0.5, and √3/2 is about 0.866.

So 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(√3/2) = 2*( (0.5)*(0.866) ) = 2*(0.433) = 0.866.

Yes. So ⟨σ_x⟩ ≈0.866. So 5 * 0.866 is about 4.33.

So the total expectation is 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866) = -5 +4.33= -0.67.

Looking at the options, let's see:

A) -1.4 → No.

B)1.65 → No.

C)-0.7 → Close to -0.67. Hmm, -0.67 is about -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Wait, but wait, let me compute more precisely.

⟨σ_x⟩ is exactly (√3)/2. Because √3 is about 1.732, so 1.732/2 is 0.866.

So 5 * 0.866 is 4.33.

Then 10 * (-0.5) is -5. So total is -5 +4.33= -0.67. So to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Did I compute the expectation correctly?

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the entire expression as a matrix and calculate manually.

Let me write the state vector ψ as [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Compute 10σ_z: 10 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[10, 0], [0, -10]]

Compute 5σ_x: 5 * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0,5],[5,0]]

Adding these two matrices, 10σ_z +5σ_x = [[10,5],[5
