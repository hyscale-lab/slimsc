Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about an electron traveling at a certain speed, and we're given the uncertainty in its position, Δx, and we need to find the minimum uncertainty in its energy, ΔE. The options are all in terms of powers of ten, so I think it's about using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

Wait, right. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that there's a limit to how precisely we can know both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously. The formula I remember is Δx * Δp ≥ ℏ/2, where ℏ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, but sometimes it's written with just the inequality without the 1/2 factor, so maybe I should be careful. Or perhaps the question uses the principle without worrying about the exact constant factor, just the order of magnitude.

So the problem gives Δx as 0.1 nm. Let me convert that into meters. 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters. Got that.

Now, the electron is moving along the x-direction with speed v = 2e8 m/s. Hmm, but wait, do I need the velocity for this problem? Because the question is about the uncertainty in energy. Oh, right, the energy of a particle depends on its momentum, so perhaps I can find the uncertainty in momentum from the position uncertainty and then relate that to the energy.

Wait, but the problem
