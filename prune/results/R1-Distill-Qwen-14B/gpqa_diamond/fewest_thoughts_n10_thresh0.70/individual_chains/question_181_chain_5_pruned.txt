Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I need to figure out what happens to the flux ratio between two energy bands when that particular branch stops. Alright, let's start breaking this down.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, mainly the proton-proton (pp) chains. I think there are a few branches in the pp chain, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Each of these might produce neutrinos, and the energy of those neutrinos depends on the specific reactions happening.

So, the question is saying that the pp-III branch suddenly stops. That happened about 8.5 minutes ago, which is roughly the time it takes for sunlight to reach Earth. Oh, wait, because neutrinos move at nearly the speed of light, so if the source stops, we'd notice the effect pretty quickly. But since the question is about the flux now, which is after that time, the neutrinos emitted before the stop would still be on their way, but no new ones are being produced from that branch.

Wait, but neutrinos are produced in various parts of the Sun. The pp-III process must be a significant contributor to the solar neutrino flux. So, if pp-III stops, the number of neutrinos coming from that process would drop. But other reactions are still ongoing, so they'll continue producing neutrinos.

I need to figure out what the pp-III process contributes in terms of neutrino energies. I think that the pp-III branch leads to the production of higher-energy neutrinos compared to the other branches. Or was it the opposite? Let me think. The main pp chain starts with two protons fusing into deuterium, emitting a positron and a neutrino. That's the pp-I branch, I think, which produces lower-energy neutrinos. Then, maybe the pp-II and pp-III branches involve more steps, possibly leading to higher-energy particles.

Alternatively, I might be getting this mixed up. Wait, the standard pp chain is the pp-I branch. The pp-II and pp-III are alternative branches, but I'm not entirely sure about their specifics. Oh, right! The pp-III branch might involve reactions that produce higher-energy neutrinos. For example, if the branch produces heavier elements or involves more complex fusion steps, the emitted neutrinos might have higher energies.

So, when the pp-III branch stops, the flux of high-energy neutrinos would drop. But the lower-energy neutrinos from other branches, like pp-I and pp-II, would still be there. So, what's the flux in the two energy bands?

The question is about the ratio of flux (band 1:700-800 keV) to flux (band 2:800-900 keV). Originally, both fluxes would have contributions from all branches. If the pp-III branch is responsible for a significant portion of the high-energy neutrinos, then band 2 (800-900) would be more affected. Let me think: if the pp-III branch is the main source of neutrinos in the higher energy range, stopping it would cause the band 2 flux to decrease more than band 1.

But wait, without knowing the exact energy distribution from each branch, I'll have to make some assumptions. Let's assume that the pp-III branch is a major contributor to higher-energy neutrinos. So, before the stop, a large fraction of the neutrinos in band 2 (800-900) came from pp-III. After the stop, the flux in band 2 would drop significantly, while band 1 (700-800) is less affected.

Wait, but what about the other branches? The pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, perhaps around 200-300 keV, if I remember correctly. So
