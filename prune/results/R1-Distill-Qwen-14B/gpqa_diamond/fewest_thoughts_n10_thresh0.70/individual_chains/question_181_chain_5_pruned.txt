Alright, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it. Okay, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So that makes sense because neutrinos also take about the same time to escape, but wait, actually neutrinos move at nearly the speed of light. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would have already reached Earth, right? Or maybe not? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, I need to figure out how the pp-III branch affects these fluxes.

What do I remember about the pp-III chain and neutrino production? Oh right, the proton-proton chain (pp) is the primary source of solar energy. The pp-I and pp-II branches are part of this, but pp-III is another part. Wait, I'm a bit unsure about the exact details. I think the pp-III branch involves the fusion of two helium-3 nuclei into helium-4, which releases two protons and a lot of energy, producing more neutrons or something? Or wait, no, pp-III is actually the main branch in the proton-proton chain that leads to carbon and then eventually fusing into heavier elements. Oh wait, perhaps I'm mixing this up with other fusion processes.

Wait, the pp-III branch specifically produces high-energy neutrinos. I think the main neutrinos from the Sun are from the pp-III process, which produces electron neutrinos. The neutrino emission from this process is a result of the beta-plus decay steps in the chain. So if the pp-III suddenly stops, that source of neutrinos would be cut off.

So, normally, the pp-III branch is a major contributor to the solar neutrino flux. If it stops, the flux from that part would drop. But the question is about two specific energy bands. So how does the pp-III branch contribute to these bands?

Wait, neutrinos from the pp-
