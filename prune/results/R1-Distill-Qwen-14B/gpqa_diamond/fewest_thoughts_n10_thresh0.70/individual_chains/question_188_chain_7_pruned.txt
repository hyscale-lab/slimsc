Okay, so I have this question about crystallography. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is related to the unit cell parameters. The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Wait, rhombohedral means all edges are equal and all angles are the same, right? So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, interatomic distance is the length of the edge of the unit cell? Or is it the distance between atoms in the structure? Oh, I think for a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', which is the edge length. So I guess here, a = 10 Angstroms.

The question is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance d_hkl is given by the formula 1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) multiplied by some factor involving the angles. Oh wait, no, that's for a cubic system. But this is rhombohedral, which is a special case of a hexagonal system or more generally, a triclinic system? Or wait, no, rhombohedral is a type of crystal system where all edges are equal and all angles are equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula is a bit more complicated.

I think the formula for d_hkl in a rhombohedral crystal is
