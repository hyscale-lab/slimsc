Okay, so I have this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are all some kind of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. Hmm.

Let me look at the NMR data again. The peaks are at 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quadruplets?), 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet), and 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet). Wait, what do these signals correspond to?

Starting with the singlet at 2.1 ppm. That's usually a good clue. A singlet of 3H could be a methyl group attached to something deshielded, like an ester. Acetates have an OAc group, so that methyl would be the acetate's methyl. So that makes sense.

Next, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with a large coupling constant, J=16 Hz. That's a big J. In NMR, a coupling of around 16 Hz suggests a trans coupling in a double bond. So this must be a vinyl proton. In an ester, the double bond would be between the oxygen's adjacent carbons. So, for example, in propenyl acetate or butenyl acetate.

The other signals are at 5.5 and 1.6 ppm. The 5.5 is a doublet of quadruplets or maybe a doublet. Wait, the data says it's a "dq" which might stand for doublet of quadruplets. Hmm. That could mean that the proton is coupling with two different sets of protons. Or perhaps the notation is a bit unclear. Let me think. The 5.5 ppm is in the range for vinyl protons as well. 

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet with 3H. That's probably a methyl group adjacent to a double bond. Like a CH2CH2 group next to a double bond. Wait, no, maybe a CH2CH3 group. But wait, if it's a doublet, that suggests it's coupling with one neighboring proton. So perhaps a CH2 group next to a double bond. Wait, but 1.6 is a bit low for a CH3 next to a double bond. Unless it's in a less substituted position. I'm a bit confused here.

Let me think about what each structure would look like. The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-butenyl acetate.

Wait, Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or is it CH2CH2-OAc? No, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so that's propenyl. Butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- or similar, but butenyl is longer.

Wait, but the ester group is OAc. So for propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But depending on the configuration (cis or trans), the
