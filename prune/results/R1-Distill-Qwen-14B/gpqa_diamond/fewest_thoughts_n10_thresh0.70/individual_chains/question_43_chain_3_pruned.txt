Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct IUPAC name for a benzene ring with several substituents. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when naming benzoic acid derivatives, the parent chain is the benzoic acid part. So the main group is benzoic acid, which is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group attached. The substituents attached to the ring will be numbered based on their positions relative to the carboxylic acid group.

The question says the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group, a carbaldehyde group (which is the formyl group, -CHO), and a cyano group (CN) all meta to each other. Wait, meta to one anotherâ€”that means each of these groups is separated by two carbons. So, if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the formyl and cyano groups should be at positions 3 and 5, right? Because meta is two positions away. Oh wait, no. Wait, if they're all meta to one another, they must each be in positions that are meta to each other. So the three groups (acid, formyl, cyano) are each separated by two carbons. So if the acid is at position 1, then formyl is at 3, and cyano at 5? Or is it another arrangement? Hmm, maybe I should visualize this.

Wait, maybe I should first sketch the benzene ring. Let's imagine the ring with the carboxylic acid (COOH) at position 1. Then the other substituents are meta to each other. But wait, the problem says all three are meta to one another, which might mean that each substituent is meta to the others. So for three groups to all be meta to each other in a benzene ring, they must be placed in positions 1, 3, and 5. Because each is two positions away from the others.

So, COOH is at position 1. Then, formyl (-CHO) is at position 3, and cyano (CN) at position 5. But wait, the problem says that the substituents are meta to one another. So each of them is meta to each other, which would require each pair to be two positions apart. So positions 1, 3, 5.

Wait, but there's another part to the substituents.
