Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because enthalpy calculations can get tricky. Let me read the problem again.

Alright, the question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but it's per mole of acid reacting, I think. But this problem is a bit more complicated because there are three solutions involved, so I need to figure out how they all react together.

Wait, let me think. So, mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, especially the first dissociation, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. When they are mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

First, I should find out the equivalents of H+ and OH- from each solution.

Let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate moles of HCl:
HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.
Molarity (M) = moles / liters.
So, moles HCl = 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

2. Calculate moles of H2SO4:
H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete, releasing 2 H+ ions per mole. But wait, not all H2SO4 is strong in both protons. The first H+ is strong, the second is weaker but still considered for this problem? Wait, in the context of neutralization, I think we might consider both H+ ions, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe the problem assumes only the first dissociation is complete. Hmm, but in the context of neutralization, maybe the H+ from H2SO4 is two per mole, so we have to consider both. Let me check.

Wait, the problem is about neutralization, which is typically between an acid and a base. So for H2SO4, which is a strong acid, both H+ ions are available for reaction. So per mole of H2SO4, we get 2 moles of H+.

So moles H2SO4 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

3. Calculate moles of Ba(OH)2:
Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions. So per mole of Ba(OH)2, 2 moles of OH-.

Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait—when I mix all these together, the H+ and OH- will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the total H+ is (0.1 + 0.18) = 0.28 moles. The total OH- is 0.2 moles. So which one is the limiting reactant?

The H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent because it's less. So all 0
