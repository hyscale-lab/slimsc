Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with some spots on one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. The filling factor is 20%, meaning 20% of that hemisphere is covered in spots. When the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that could mimic an exoplanet transit. The problem is asking what radius an exoplanet would need to have to produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted.

Wait, so normally when an exoplanet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. In this case, the spots are causing a similar effect, so we need to find the planet radius that would cause the same dip as the spots.

Hmm, I think I remember that the change in brightness (ΔF) when a planet transits is given by the formula (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

But wait, the spots are a bit more complicated. They cover part of the star and are cooler. So when the spots are facing us, they make the star appear dimmer. The change in brightness would depend on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

The filling factor is 0.2, so 20% of the hemisphere's surface is covered by spots. But wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So the total area of the spots would be 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2). Because the surface area of a sphere is 4π R², so a hemisphere is 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) = 0.1 π Rstar². Wait, maybe I should think about it as the fraction of the hemisphere covered.

Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by
