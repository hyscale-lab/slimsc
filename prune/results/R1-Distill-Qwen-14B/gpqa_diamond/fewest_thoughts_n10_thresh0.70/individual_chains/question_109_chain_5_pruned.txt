Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a bound system of two nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on the given conditions. Let's try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says the initial state is a 1S0 state. From what I remember, the notation is (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, S is 0 because 2S+1=1 implies S=0. L is S, so L must be 0 as well. And J is 0. So the initial angular momentum quantum numbers are L=0, S=0, J=0.

The two nucleons emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. I think parity has to do with whether the system is symmetric under spatial inversion. The intrinsic parity of the emitted particle X is given as -1. But I'm not exactly sure how that plays into the problem yet.

Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, T is the isospin? Oh right, isospin is a part of the nuclear force symmetry, but in this problem, it's given that T(NN) is 0. So T=0.

So the equation: 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. Let me write that as 0 â‰¡ (S + L + 1) mod 2. Which implies that S + L +1 must be even. So S + L must be odd because adding 1 to an odd number gives even.

Wait, let me double-check: If 0 = (S + L +1) mod 2. So S + L +1 is even. So S + L is odd. Because even minus 1 is odd. So S + L must be odd.

Wait, but S is the spin of the NN system. Wait, the initial state has spin S=0, right? Because the initial state is 1S0, which has S=0.

Wait, but after emission, what is the spin? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. The initial state is 1S0, which has spin S=0. The two nucleons (the NN system) in the final state must have their own spin and orbital angular momentum. So the final
