Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩ of its spin-up and spin-down states. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx, up to one decimal place. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that expectation values are calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. Since the operator here is 10σz +5σx, the expectation value will be the sum of the expectations of each term.

Wait, but expectation values are linear, right? So the expectation of 10σz +5σx is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That should make things easier because I can calculate each expectation separately.

First, let me find ⟨σz⟩. Since the states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, their expectation values are straightforward. σz |↑⟩ = +1 |↑⟩, and σz |↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩.

The given state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write that as ψ = (1/2)|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. So when I compute ⟨σz⟩, which is ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩, I can expand it.

So, ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ = (1/2)² * (+1) + (√3/2)² * (-1). Let me compute that:

(1/2)^2 is 1/4, multiplied by 1 gives 1/4. (√3/2)^2 is (3/4), multiplied by -1 gives -3/4. Adding them together: 1/4 - 3/4 = (-2/4) = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Then, the expectation value contribution from 10σz is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, the next part is ⟨σx⟩. Oh wait, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which I think is the spin flip operator. The eigenstates of σx are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But in this case, our state ψ is expressed in terms of σz eigenstates, so it's a bit more involved.

I remember that σx can be written in matrix form as [[0,1],[1,0]]. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute ⟨σx⟩ by expanding the terms.

Wait, another approach: the expectation value of σx is given by ⟨ψ|σx|ψ
