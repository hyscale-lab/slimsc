Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles emitted. Hmm, I need to figure out which partial wave isn't permitted based on the given conditions. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state, which emits a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics are involved, and there's this equation: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0, so I guess I need to find out which option violates some conservation laws.

First, let's parse the initial state. The 1S0 state: the general term is (2S+1)LJ. So 1S0 means S=0 because 2(0)+1=1. L is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, which is 0 because it's S (s orbital). So the initial state has S=0, L=0, and J=0 (since J=L+S=0+0=0). 

Now, when the NN emits a particle X, the system becomes the final NN state plus X. The Pauli equation given is T = S + L +1 mod 2. Wait, what does that mean? Oh right, in the context of Pauli's exclusion principle, the total isospin T, spin S, and orbital angular momentum L of the final state must satisfy T = S + L +1 mod 2. So the sum of these three (parity-wise) must be even or odd based on this equation.

Wait, no. Because mod 2, it's like checking if the sum is even or odd. So T equals (S + L +1) mod 2. So T and (S + L +1) should have the same parity.

In the problem statement, the final NN state has T=0. So substituting into the equation: 0 = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So S + L +1 must be even because 0 is even. So S + L must be 1 mod 2, which means S and L must have opposite parities. So S is even (like 0) if L is odd, or S is odd if L is even.

Wait, no. Let me rephrase: 0 = (S + L +1) mod 2. So S + L +1 is even. So S + L must be odd. Because if S+L is odd, adding 1 makes it even. So S + L must be 1 mod 2.

So S and L have opposite parities. So if S is even, L is odd; if S is odd, L is even.

Now, the initial state is 1S0, so S=0, L=0, J=0. When the NN emits X, the final NN state must have some S', L', J' such that angular momentum is conserved. Also, parity must be conserved.

Wait, but the problem says to consider conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So in the process, the initial parity and the
