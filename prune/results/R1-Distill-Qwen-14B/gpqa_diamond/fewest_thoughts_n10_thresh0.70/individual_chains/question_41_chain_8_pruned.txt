Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me think about it. The question says that a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, right? Because in vacuum, c is the speed. So when the medium has an index n, the speed is lower by a factor of n. But wait, in this case, the medium itself is moving. So does the motion of the medium affect the observed speed of light inside it?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. I think that in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, regardless of the motion of the source or the medium. But wait, this is a medium that's moving, not a vacuum. Oh but wait, in reality, the speed of light in a medium is determined by the medium's properties, but when the medium is moving, how does that affect things?

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me recall. In classical physics, without considering relativity, the speed of light in the medium would be c/n, and if the medium is moving at velocity v, the observed speed would be (c/n) plus v, but wait, no, that's not right because in the medium's frame, the
