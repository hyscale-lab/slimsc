Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step. The question is about the reactions of (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are run through HPLC columns. Hmm, I think I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation of alkenes.

So, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA. I think mCPBA would add across the double bond to form an epoxide. Wait, but wait, the geometry of the starting alkene might affect the epoxide's configuration. Since (E)-oct-4-ene has the two higher priority groups on opposite sides, when it reacts, the mCPBA would add in a way that forms an epoxide with a specific stereochemistry.

Wait, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a concerted manner, leading to a trans addition. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide via an electrocyclic opening. Oh, wait, no, the mechanism is that mCPBA adds across the double bond, leading to an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene because the peracid adds in a way that forms an oxide ring. Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Let me think again.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is between C4 and C5. The groups on either end are CH2CH2CH2CH3 on both ends, but wait, no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait no, wait. Octane is eight carbons. Oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's not right. Let me think: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe it's CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but no, wait, no. Let me correct that. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. Wait, maybe I should draw it out.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that can't be right. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond starting at C4? Wait, no. Wait, maybe it's CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. Or perhaps more accurately, CH2CH2CH2- on each end. Wait, maybe it's CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that can't be because that would be a single bond. Wait, perhaps it's (E)-oct-4-ene, so the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with the double bond between C4 and C5, and the substituents on either side being CH2CH2CH2CH3 and CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, perhaps I should think about it as the double bond being between C4 and C5, so each end has CH2 groups leading to the ends.

Anyway, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. For a trans (E) starting alkene, the epoxide would have a certain configuration, and for a cis (Z) starting alkene, it would have another.

Wait, when mCPBA adds to a double bond, the peracid adds across the double bond, and the two new oxygen atoms connect to the adjacent carbons, creating an epoxide. The addition is stereospecific. For a trans (E) alkene, the addition would lead to the epoxide oxygen atoms being on opposite sides. Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the mechanism. mCPBA adds via an electrocyclic opening, which is a concerted process. So, the geometry of the alkene would influence the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, the peracid (mCPBA) adds in a way that forms the epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. So
