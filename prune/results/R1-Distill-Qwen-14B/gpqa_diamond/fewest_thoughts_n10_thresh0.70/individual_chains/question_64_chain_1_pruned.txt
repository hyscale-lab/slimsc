Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it carefully.

The problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams was heated to 200°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases formed. These gases were passed through some tubes. Tube 1, filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, gained 3.60 grams. Tube 2, which had a Ca(OH)2 solution, didn't change in weight. Tube 3, with red-hot copper, gained 0.80 grams of CuO. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure.

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, let's break this down. I think I need to figure out what the original salts were and then count the atoms.

First, when the salts are heated, they decompose or react to form gases. Those gases are then passed through the tubes. Let's think about each tube:

1. Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent. It probably absorbed water. The increase in weight (3.60 g) suggests that water was present. So maybe the gases included water vapor. But Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous and would react with water. So the gas that was absorbed here is H2O.

2. Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 is a base. It would react with acidic gases like CO2. The fact that the weight didn't change suggests that no CO2 was present. Because if CO2 were present, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water, increasing the weight. Since it didn't change, maybe CO2 wasn't a gas produced.

3. Tube 3: Red-hot copper would react with certain gases. The gain of 0.80 g of CuO suggests that a gas containing O2 or another oxidizing agent was present. Wait, but wait, the copper was red-hot, which is in the +1 or +2 oxidation state. If it reacts, maybe it's reacting with SO2 or some other gas that can oxidize it.

But wait, tube 3's increase is 0.80 g. Let's think about the reaction. If the gas is, say, H2S, but that's a reducing agent. Alternatively, SO3? I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility is that the gas is SO2. If SO2 is passed over hot copper, would it react? Let me think. SO2 is an oxidizing agent. It can react with copper, especially in the presence of moisture, to form CuSO4. Wait, but the product is CuO. Alternatively, maybe it's reacting with another gas.

Wait, 0.80 grams of CuO. Let's calculate the moles of CuO. Molar mass of CuO is 63.55 + 16 = 79.55 g/mol. So 0.80 g / 79.55 g/mol ≈ 0.01005 mol. So approximately 0.01 mol of CuO formed.

What reaction would produce CuO? If the gas is O2, then Cu would react as follows: 2Cu + O2 → 2CuO. So for each mole of O2, two moles of CuO are formed. The moles of O2 would be 0.005 mol. But wait, that would require O2 to be present. But wait, in the setup, the salt mixture is heated without air, so maybe O2 is not present. So maybe the gas isn't O2.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is a sulfur-containing compound. Let's think about SO3. SO3 is a strong acid, but when passed through red-hot copper, does it react? Alternatively, perhaps the gas is H2S. But H2S is a reducing agent and would react with CuO. Wait, but in this case, the copper is in the form of metal, so maybe H2S would not react, unless under certain conditions.

Wait, another possibility: the gas is SO2. SO2 is a reducing agent. When SO2 is passed over hot copper, perhaps it oxidizes to form CuSO4. But that's CuSO4, not CuO.

Wait, maybe the SO2 is reacting with Cu. Let's think: 4 Cu + 2 SO2 + O2 → 2 Cu2SO4. But that would require O2 as well. Or, if there's another reaction pathway. Alternatively, SO2 might react with Cu at high temperatures to form CuO and S. Let's check.

The reaction could be: Cu + SO2 → CuSO4 (but that's not giving CuO). Alternatively, maybe 4Cu + 2SO2 → 2Cu2S + O2. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe Cu reacts with SO2 under certain conditions to form CuO and S. Let's write the possible reaction:

Let's say a + b Cu + c SO2 → d CuO + e S.

But I'm not confident in this. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Let me consider all the data together.

The gases passed through the tubes:

- Tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) gained 3.60 g, which is H2O. Because Mg(ClO4)2 would react with water: Mg(ClO4)2 + H2O → Mg(ClO4)2·H2O, but since it's anhydrous, it would probably deliquesce, absorbing water. So the mass increase is the mass of H2O absorbed. So 3.60 g H2O is
