Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about selecting the correct reagents for two specific reactions. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, so I need to think carefully.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different A and B.

Let me start by analyzing the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is methylacetone. When it reacts with NaCN, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. But wait, I think when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's typically under certain conditions. Oh right, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with cyanide in the presence of an acid catalyst. The reaction of ketones with NaCN usually needs an acid, like H+ to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic.

So in this case, butan-2-one with NaCN and reagent A gives a cyanohydrin. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, but butanenitrile would be four carbons. Let me think: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN and OH to the same carbon as the carbonyl. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Hmm, wait the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that out. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methyl, so on the second carbon (from
