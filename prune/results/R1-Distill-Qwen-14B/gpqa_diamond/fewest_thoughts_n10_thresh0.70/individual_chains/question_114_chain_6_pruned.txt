Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A to D, each giving different reagents A and B.

Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyano groups, it's usually a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but ketones aren't typically involved in nucleophilic substitution. Oh wait, maybe it's a substitution on a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe they're talking about the formation of a nitrile through some kind of addition or substitution.

Wait, another thought: the first reaction is adding NaCN to butan-2-one. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So, the structure is a ketone. I remember that ketones can undergo certain reactions where a nucleophile attacks, but in the presence of some acid maybe?

Wait, I think the reaction of ketones with HCN (or its sources like NaCN and H3O+) can lead to cyanohydrin formation. Oh right, when a ketone reacts with HCN (or a cyanide source), under acidic conditions, it forms a cyanohydrin. So the product would have both an -OH and a -CN group on the same carbon.

So the first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions, but without an acid, maybe it's not reacting. Because I think the reaction of HCN with ketones is done in the presence of an acid catalyst. So reagent A might be H3O+ because that would provide the acid needed for the reaction.

So for reaction A, the reagent is H3O+? Looking at the options, option A says A is H3O+, B is HCl. Option B has A as H3O+ and B as CH3COOH. So that's probably for the first part.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is reacting with B (which is H2O) to form an acid. Hmm, wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So I'm thinking about oxidation. Because nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids under certain conditions.

What are the conditions for oxidizing a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I think the typical reagents are acidic conditions with something like KMnO4 or other strong oxidizing agents. Alternatively, perhaps using HCl as a catalyst.

Wait, the reagent B is H2O. Wait, but the reaction is written with H2O as the reagent. Oh, maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction. But nitriles usually hydrolyze under acidic or basic conditions. Let me think.

Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed in two ways: under basic conditions to form carboxylates, or under acidic conditions to form carboxylic acids. So if B is an acid catalyst, like
