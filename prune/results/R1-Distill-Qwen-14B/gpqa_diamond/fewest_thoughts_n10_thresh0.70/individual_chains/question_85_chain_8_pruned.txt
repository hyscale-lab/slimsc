Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's start breaking this down.

First, the question gives me a lot of data. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, a radius of 1.2 solar radii, and a temperature of 6300 K. The two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, have different masses and radii. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with a radius of 1.7 Earth radii, and Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with a radius of 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which is important because albedo affects how much light they reflect and thus their temperature.

The question involves transit and radial velocity methods. Oh right, the transit method measures the dip in starlight as a planet passes in front, which gives the planet's radius. The radial velocity method looks for shifts in the star's spectrum due to the Doppler effect as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The problem gives the Doppler shifts: Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 causes 0.04 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å.

Wait, but how does that help me find the equilibrium temperatures? Oh, right. The Doppler shift relates to the mass and orbital period of the planet because it depends on the star's velocity change. But equilibrium temperature is more about the energy balance between the planet and the star.

Equilibrium temperature formula: T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5. Since albedo is the same for both, that term goes away in the ratio. So the ratio of their temperatures depends on the square root of (R_star/(2a)) for each planet. So T1/T2 = sqrt( (a2) / (a1) ), because when you take the ratio, the R_star/(2a) becomes (1/(a1)) / (1/(a2)) ) = a2/a1, and the square root of that.

So I need to find the ratio of a2 to a1, which are the orbital distances of the two planets.

But how to get a1 and a2? Well, the radial velocity method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The Doppler shift tells us about K. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = ( (P * M_planet sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^0.5 ) )^(1/ (P * (1 year in seconds) ))) Hmm, maybe I should look for another way.

Wait, no, wait. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) )

But since the orbits are circular (e=0), and the planet masses are much smaller than the star's mass, M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

So K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) * M_planet sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since sin i would be 1 for edge-on orbits (which is the case for transit detection), sin i =1.

So K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) * M_planet ) / ( M_star^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

But wait, I have K for each planet. I can write K1 and K2, and relate them to their periods and masses.

But I don't know the periods P1 and P2. Hmm, maybe I can relate their semi-major axes via Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² a³) / (G(M_star + M_planet)) ). Again, since M_planet << M_star, it's approximately P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_star)

So a³ = (G M_star P²)/(4π²)

Thus, a is proportional to (P²)^(1/3) * M_star^(1/3) )

Wait, but I'm trying to find the ratio of a2 to a1.

Alternatively, since both planets orbit the same star, M_star is the same. So the ratio of a2 to a1 is ( (P2² / P1²) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_star^(1/3) / M_star^(1/3) ) ) = (P2²/P1²)^(1/3) ) = ( (P2 / P1 ) )^(2/3 )

So if I can find P2/P1, I can find a2/a1.

But how to find P1 and P2? Well, looking back at the radial velocity semi-amplitude formula.

We can rearrange the K formula to solve for P.

K = (2π G )^(1/3) * M
