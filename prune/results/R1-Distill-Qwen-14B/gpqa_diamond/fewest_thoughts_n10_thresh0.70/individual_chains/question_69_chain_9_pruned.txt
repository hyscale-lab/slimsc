Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me try to unpack what it's asking. Alright, the problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime tau_0 of 8e-16 seconds. They're asking about the minimum resolution needed in the bubble chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, so the first thing I remember is that when particles decay, their lifetime can be longer when they're moving at high speeds due to time dilation from special relativity. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. So, in the lab frame, which is the bubble chamber's frame, the lifetime will be longer.

The formula for time dilation is tau = gamma * tau_0, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is equal to E/(m c²), but since the units here are in GeV and GeV/c², maybe I should think about it in terms of energy. Because the energy E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. Oh wait, actually, rest mass energy is m c², which is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is E/(m c²) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV. Let me compute that.

27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41 *8 is 27.28. So 27 is just a bit less than 8 times 3.41. So approximately 8 times. So gamma is about 7.92 or something. Let me just compute it more accurately.

3.41 * 7 =23.87, 3.41 *7.9= 3.41*(7+0.9)=23.87 + 3.069=26.939. Oh, wait, 26.939 is very close to 27.
