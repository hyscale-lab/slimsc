Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. So, the molecule consists of two atoms, X and Y, and it's in its fundamental state. The task is to find the momentum of a photon that needs to be absorbed so the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Hmm, I remember that in such models, the energy levels are quantized and depend on both rotational and vibrational states. Since it's a diatomic molecule, the motion involves both rotation and vibration.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. But I'm a bit confused about what the "next state with the lowest possible energy" refers to. Does it mean the next higher energy state, either vibrational or rotational?

I think the question is asking about the transition from the ground state to the next higher energy state. Since the molecule is in the fundamental state, which would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0, maybe?), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the fundamental state refers to the lowest vibrational state, and the rotational state is already considered.

Wait, the question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which combines both rotational and vibrational energies. The energy levels are given by something like E = E_rot + E_vib. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state, v=0, and the lowest rotational state, J=0.

So, the molecule is in the (v=0, J=0) state. To switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, it would need to have the smallest possible energy increase. So perhaps it can either increase its vibrational state or rotational state. Which transition would require less energy?

Vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, and rotational are E_rot = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

The energy difference for the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 would be ΔE_vib = ħω. For the rotational transition, the next state would be J=1, so ΔE_rot = E(1) - E(0) = [ (2)(ħ²) )/(2I) ] - 0 = (ħ²)/(I). Which is smaller, ΔE_vib or ΔE_rot?

Wait, that depends on the values. Let me compute both and see.

First, I need the values given:

Masses: Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So the reduced mass μ would be important here. Bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Angular frequency ω is 4e14 rad/s.

Calculate μ: The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22
