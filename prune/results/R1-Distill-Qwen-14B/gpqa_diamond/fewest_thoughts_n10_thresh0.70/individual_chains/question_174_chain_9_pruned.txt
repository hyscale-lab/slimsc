Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I need to figure out the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical approximation. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Wait, I remember that rest-mass energy is calculated using E=mc², but maybe I don't need to get into the units right now. The nucleus undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. So, let's say the masses are m1 and m2. Given that m1 = 2 * m2. Oh wait, no, wait. The problem says the more massive fragment is twice as massive as the other. So, if the masses are m1 and m2 with m1 > m2, then m1 = 2*m2.

Wait, but the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Since m1 is twice m2, substituting gives 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99 M. So, m2 = 0.33 M (approximately 0.33 * M), and m1 is 0.66 M. Wait, but 0.33 + 0.66 is 0.99, which matches. So, m1 is 0.66 M, m

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I remember that in nuclear reactions, energy is released because some mass is converted into energy. But wait, this is about fission, right? So the nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei. 

The problem says the initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Oh wait, right, Einstein's E=mc², so the rest mass is energy. So the mass M is rest mass, and energy is 300 GeV.

Then it says that the nucleus undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Oh, so M is the initial rest mass, but after fission, the total rest mass is 0.99 M. That means some mass is lost, converted into kinetic energy and binding energy or something. But in this case, the problem says to ignore electrons, so maybe the binding energy isn't a factor here.

Wait, wait, the sum of rest masses is 99% of M. So the initial rest mass is 300 GeV, but after fission, the combined rest mass is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the difference is 3 GeV, which is the energy released. But how is that distributed?

The two fragments: let's call their rest masses m1 and m2. The problem says one is twice as massive as the other. Let's say m1 = 2 * m2. Because the problem says "the more massive fragment". So m1 is bigger.

So sum m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Substituting m1 = 2 m2:

2m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M
So m2 = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. Then m1 is 0.66 M.

Wait, but M is given as 300 GeV, but let me see—actually, M represents the rest mass, but in energy terms. So the sum of their rest masses is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. 

Wait, but maybe M is the initial rest mass, so m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M. So m1 = 2 m2. So 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M, m1 = 0.66 M.

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so after fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So their momenta must be equal and opposite. Let's denote their velocities as v1 and v2. But since m1 is twice m2, their speeds will be in a certain ratio.

Wait, but in reality, the velocities would be such that m1 v1 = m2 v2. Because momentum is conserved. So m1 v1 = m2 v2. Since m1 is 2 m2, 2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = 2 v1.
