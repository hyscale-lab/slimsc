Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I need to figure out the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical approximation. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Wait, I remember that rest-mass energy is calculated using E=mcÂ², but maybe I don't need to get into the units right now. The nucleus undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. So, let's say the masses are m1 and m2. Given that m1 = 2 * m2. Oh wait, no, wait. The problem says the more massive fragment is twice as massive as the other. So, if the masses are m1 and m2 with m1 > m2, then m1 = 2*m2.

Wait, but the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Since m1 is twice m2, substituting gives 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99 M. So, m2 = 0.33 M (approximately 0.33 * M), and m1 is 0.66 M. Wait, but 0.33 + 0.66 is 0.99, which matches. So, m1 is 0.66 M, m
