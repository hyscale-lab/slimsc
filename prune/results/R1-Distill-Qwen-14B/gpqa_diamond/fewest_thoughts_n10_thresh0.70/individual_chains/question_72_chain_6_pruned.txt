Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a norbornene structure. So the substituent is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. So the structure must be a norbornene ring with the oxygen group in a specific position.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and since we have dibromomethyl groups, this sounds like an elimination or substitution reaction. Wait, with two equivalents, maybe each of the two bromides is replaced. Oh, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two Br groups on adjacent methyl groups. So perhaps the tert-butoxy group is acting as a base or nucleophile? Or maybe the diene is undergoing some kind of addition.

Wait, I think this is a diels-alder reaction setup, but maybe not. Alternatively, when the diene with dibromomethyl groups is treated with a base like NaI, it might eliminate HBr. But wait, with two equivalents, maybe each of the two Brs is being replaced. Or perhaps it's a substitution reaction where the iodide (from NaI) substitutes the bromide, but that would just form a diiodide. Hmm, but the next step is product 1. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: the diene has two bromomethyl groups. When treated with a base like NaI, perhaps each of the Br in the dibromomethyl groups is replaced by iodide. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene would get two iodide substituents. Then, when it's heated with the norbornene compound, maybe a Diels-Alder-like reaction occurs? Because the norbornene is a diene, and the cyclohexa diene might act as a dienophile. Or wait, norbornene is the diene, and the other compound is the dienophile.

Wait, the
