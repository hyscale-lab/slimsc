Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Hmm, let's read it again.

So, the scenario is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, and it's transiting a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Its orbital period is 3 days. The second planet is bigger, 2.5 Earth radii, and we need to find the maximum orbital period such that it still transits and occults. The options are given.

Wait, what's transit and occultation again? Oh right, transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, blocking some light. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet's light (if it emits any) is blocked from us. But more importantly, for both events to happen, the orbital plane must be aligned so that the second planet's orbit is also edge-on relative to us. Otherwise, we might not see either event.

But wait, the question says both planets share the same orbital plane, so that's already taken care of. So the alignment is correct for both transit and occultation.

So the main thing here is about the orbital periods. I remember that for a planet to transit, it must pass in front of the star, which depends on the alignment of the orbits. But since both are in the same orbital plane, the only condition is that their orbital periods are such that their orbital speeds are such that the transit and occultation can occur.

Wait, actually, the key here is the concept of the transit timing. The transit occurs when the planet is in the same line of sight as the star. So for two planets to both transit, their orbital periods should be such that their transits don't overlap in a way that makes it impossible for both to occur.

Wait, but the problem is about the maximum period of the second planet so that both transit and occultation happen. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is about ensuring that the second planet's orbit is such that it can both transit (i.e., pass in front) and be occulted (i.e., pass behind) as seen from Earth. To have both events, the planet must be in a position where it's moving
