Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I remember that reactions involving ketones and nucleophiles are important, maybe something like a substitution reaction. 

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, NaCN provides CN- as a nucleophile. But wait, under what conditions does that happen? Oh right, I think the formation of a cyanohydrin occurs when a ketone reacts with a cyanide in a basic or acidic condition. 

Wait, cyanohydrin formation— that's when a ketone adds a cyanide nucleophile. But the reaction conditions matter. I remember that in acidic conditions, the ketone is protonated, making it a better electrophile. So for the first step, maybe A is H3O+ (acid). But wait, looking at the product: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So, the ketone has added the CN and OH groups. That's a cyanohydrin, which makes sense. So the first step is the acid-catalyzed addition of CN- to the ketone, leading to the cyanohydrin. So that would suggest that reagent A is H3O+—so looking at the options, which have A as H3O+.

Then the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (H2O) to form the corresponding acid. Wait, so the nitrile group is being hydrolyzed. Wait, nitrile to carboxylic acid. So the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile. How does that happen?

I think nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. If you hydrolyze a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you usually need strong acid or base conditions. But wait, sometimes in the presence of water and acid, especially for certain conditions.

Wait, in the first part, using H3O+ as
