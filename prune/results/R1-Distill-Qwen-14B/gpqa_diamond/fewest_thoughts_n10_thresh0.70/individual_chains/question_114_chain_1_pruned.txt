Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct reagents for the given reactions. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I remember that reactions involving ketones, nitriles, and such usually involve some kind of nucleophilic substitution or maybe addition reactions. Let me think about each step.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN. Wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So, in a ketone, the carbonyl group is a good electrophile. So maybe it's a nucleophilic addition reaction. But when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, what typically happens? I think it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Yeah, a cyanohydrin is when a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group add across the carbonyl carbon.

So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me check the structure. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the 2-hydroxy-2-methyl version would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no. Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, so 2-hydroxy-2-methyl would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure of that product. Butanenitrile has four carbons, with the nitrile on C1. The 2-hydroxy-2-methyl would have the OH and CH3 on C2. So structure would be CH2CN-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be: the nitrile is on C1, then C2
