Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Let me read the problem again to make sure I get the details right.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Oh right, σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. So ε is an energy constant, and n is just a direction, I guess. So this Hamiltonian probably represents some kind of spin in a magnetic field pointing in the direction of n, but scaled by ε. Or maybe it's a spin-orbit coupling term or something, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the main point is to find the eigenvalues.

I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each being 2x2 matrices. The dot product σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. So H is a 2x2 matrix with each component scaled by the respective component of n and multiplied by ε.

Wait, eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix... Hmm, I think each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But wait, that's for each individual matrix. But when you take a linear combination like σ · n, which is a sum of the scaled Pauli matrices, what's the eigenvalue then?

Oh! I remember that for any unit vector n, the operator σ · n has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Because σ · n is a Hermitian operator (since each Pauli matrix is Hermitian and n is real), and it's traceless. The trace of σ · n would be zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero, and n is a unit vector, so when you sum them up, the trace is n_x*Tr(σ_x) + ... but Tr(σ_x)=0, same for others. So the eigenvalues must be +a and -a, but what is a here?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The actual operator is ε times σ · n. So σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, so when multiplied by ε, the eigenvalues become ±ε. So the eigenvalues of H should be +ε and -ε.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's consider a general case. Suppose the Hamiltonian is H = a (σ · n), where a is
