Alright, so I have this physics problem about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, let me try to think through it. I remember that the scalar potential and vector potential are related to the electric and magnetic fields produced by a charge in motion.

The question says we have a point charge q moving with trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a later time t, where t is greater than tr, the time when the field was generated. The vector d is from the field generation point to the observation point r.

Wait, I think the potentials are based on the retarded time concept. Oh right, because the electromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, so the fields we observe at time t are due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, where tr = t - |r - r0|/c, something like that. But in this problem, they've already provided d as the vector from the field generation point to r, so d = r - r0 at the time tr.

The scalar potential V and vector potential A. I remember that for a moving charge, the scalar potential is similar to the static case but with a certain modification, and the vector potential depends on the velocity.

Wait, maybe I should recall the expressions for V and A in the context of retarded potentials. The scalar potential is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|d|), and the vector potential is something like (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (v × something) or directly proportional to v, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, in the Lorentz gauge, the potentials might have a certain form, but I don't think that's directly relevant here.

Wait, another approach: The scalar potential V is typically (q/(4πε₀ r)) at a distance r from the charge. But when the charge is moving, it's not exactly the same because of the time delay. But the options don't all have 1/r, so maybe I should think about it in terms of d.

Wait, looking at the options: Option C and D have terms like (dc - d · v) in the denominator, where dc is probably the magnitude of d multiplied by c, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the expression for scalar potential when the charge is moving.

Oh wait, in the case of a moving charge, the scalar potential is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|d|) evaluated at the retarded time. But wait, that's just the same as the static case because the scalar potential is a sort of Coulomb potential, but the vector potential comes into play for the magnetic field.

Wait, but the vector potential is usually (μ₀ q/(4π r)) * (v × something) or proportional to velocity. Alternatively, I think the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q/(4π)) * (v / (c²)) * (something). Let me think.

Wait, another approach: The fields are calculated using the potentials. The electric field E is -∇V - ∂A/∂t, and the magnetic field B is ∇×A. For a moving charge, the electric field would have a term from the scalar potential and another from the time derivative of the vector potential.

But wait, the problem is asking for the potentials, not the fields. So I need to find expressions for V(r, t) and A(r, t) based on the given scenario.

I remember that in the case of a charge moving with velocity v, the scalar potential is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|d|), but the vector potential is (μ₀ q/(4π)) * (v × (d)/(c² |d|) ), or maybe (v/(c²)) * (something) over d.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the vector potential for a moving charge is given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * (d / |d|³ ), but
