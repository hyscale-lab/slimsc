Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in an electromagnetic field due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I need to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a certain time t and position r. Let me think through this step by step.

The setup is that there's a charge q moving with trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the field at a point r. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. Also, v is the velocity of the charge at time tr, and t is greater than tr, so we're looking at the field after the charge has passed that point.

I remember that potentials are usually derived from the fields using Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential V is related to the electric field E, and the vector potential A relates to the magnetic field B. So, the electric field is E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t, and the magnetic field is B = ∇×A.

But wait, when the charge is moving, it's not just a static situation. I think I need to use the retarded potentials. Because the charge was at a different position when it emitted the field that we're observing now. Retarded time, tr, is the time when the charge was at the position that affects the field at r and t.

So the scalar potential V for a moving charge should be similar to the static case but adjusted for the retarded time. The static case is V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge to the point. But since the charge is moving, we can't just use r directly. Instead, we should use the distance from the charge at the retarded time. So the distance is d, which is the vector from the charge's position at tr (the retarded time) to the point r. So the magnitude of d is the effective distance.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about how exactly d comes into play here. Oh right, in the expression for the potentials, the denominator often involves the term like (d·v), which comes from the relative motion of the charge and the point r.

Let me think about the form of the potentials. The scalar potential V would depend on q, some constants, and the distance scaled by the charge's velocity, I think. Similarly, the vector potential A is proportional to the velocity of the charge and the scalar potential.

Wait, the scalar potential for a moving charge is given by (q/(4πε₀)) multiplied by 1 over (d c - d·v), all over c squared, or something like that. Or maybe it's 1 over (d^2 - (d·v)/c^2)^(1/2) or something else. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, I remember the general expressions for retarded potentials. The scalar potential V(r,t) is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [1 / (|r - r’| - (v·(r - r’))/c²)] evaluated at the retarded time. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The exact expression for V is (q/(4π
