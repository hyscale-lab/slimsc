Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. Let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the brightness changes observed, similar to those caused by an exoplanet. The goal is to find the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star.

Alright, first, let me parse the details. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so R_star is R_sun. The problem says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered, right? So 20% of the star's surface is spots. Oh, but wait, the star's hemisphere is covered. Wait, a hemisphere is half the star. So the entire spot coverage is 20% of the hemisphere. Hmm, no, wait, no. Wait, the question says one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the spots are 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (0.5 * 4πR²) = 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total area covered by spots is 0.4πR².

Now, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spots are 5000 K.

The star's brightness variation is due to rotational modulation—so as it spins, the spots come into and go out of view from our perspective. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, the spots will only be visible when that hemisphere is facing us. So the brightness variation will be periodic, similar to a planet transiting the star.

But the question says that we can mistake this for an exoplanet. So we need to find the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spotted star's variation.

Wait, the problem states: To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet.

Wait, so if the star had no spots, what planet size would cause the same dip in brightness as the spotted star's variation.

I think the approach is to compute the change in brightness caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change.

So when a part of the star is cooler, when that part is facing us (as the star rotates), the total brightness (flux) emitted will decrease. The maximum decrease would be when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us. Or wait, wait, the spots are on one hemisphere, so as the star rotates, the spots come into view. So the maximum dip in brightness would be when the maximum number of spots is visible. Hmm, but the star is covering one hemisphere with spots. So the maximum brightness loss would be when that entire hemisphere is visible.

Wait, no—wait, the filling factor is 20% per hemisphere. So each hemisphere (northern and southern, say) could have spots. But in this case, only one hemisphere is spotty. Let me clarify: "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the other hemisphere is spot-free. So when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere may come into view. So the maximum area that can be blocked (in terms of lower flux) is when the spotty hemisphere is fully visible.

But wait, the star is a sphere. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire hemisphere's spots are visible. So the total flux decrease would be the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when all the spots are on the hemisphere facing us.

Wait, let me think about the flux. The flux from the star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4. So the total flux from the star is F_total = F_star = σ * Teff^4 * 4π R² / 4π D², but wait, that's not necessary here. Because we're comparing changes, perhaps we can compute the fractional change in flux due to the spots.

The star's total flux is F_star = σ Teff^4 * (4π R²) / (4π D²) ) but since we're considering relative changes, the D (distance) cancels out. So we can model the flux as proportional to the surface area times T^4.

So the star's normal flux is F0 = σ * Teff^4 * (4π R²).

When part of the star is covered by spots, the flux is F = F0 - (area of spots) * σ (T_spot)^4.

Wait, but wait, the spots are cooler, so their T is lower, so their flux per unit area is lower. So the total flux when spots are visible is F = F0 - (area of spots) * (σ T_spot^4 - σ T_eff^4). Wait, no. Because each spot contributes less than the rest of the star. So the area not covered by spots contributes σ Teff^4, and the spots contribute σ T_spot^4. So the total flux would be F0 - (area of spots) * (σ Teff^4 - σ T_spot^4) + (area of spots) * σ T_spot^4.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the average flux. The star's entire surface is at Teff, so F0 = σ Teff^4 * 4π R². When some spots are present, the flux becomes F = (4π R² - A_spots) * σ Teff^4 + A_spots * σ T_spot^4. So the change in flux is ΔF = F - F0 = A_spots (σ T_spot^4 - σ Teff^4) = A_spots σ (T_spot^4 - Teff^4).

Wait, but T_spot is lower than Teff, so T_spot^4 - Teff^4 is negative. So ΔF is negative, meaning the flux is lower when spots are present.

So the fractional change in flux is (ΔF / F0) = [A_spots σ (T_spot^4 - Teff^4)] / [σ Teff^4 4π R²] ].

Simplify: (ΔF/F0) = [A_spots (T_spot^4 - Teff^4)] / [4π R² Teff^4 ].

But A_spots is the area of the spots. The filling factor is 20% (0.2), but for which hemisphere? The question says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the total area of spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. The area of a hemisphere is 2π R². So A_spots = 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So plugging that in:

ΔF/F0 = [0.4 π R² (5000^4 - 6000^4)] / [4 π R² (6000^4)] ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

0.4 π R² cancels with 4 π R² in denominator, leaving 0.4/4 = 0.1.

So [(5000^4 -6000^4) ] / (6000^4) * 0.1.

But 5000^4 is (5/6 *6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 * 6000^4.

So 5000^4 = (5/6)^4 * 6000^4.

So 5000^4 -6000^4 = (5/6)^4 - 1 ) *6000^4.

So:

ΔF/F0 = [ ( (5/6)^4 - 1 ) *6000^4 ] / (6000^4) ) * 0.1.

The 6000^4 terms cancel, so we get:

ΔF/F0 = [ (5/6)^4 - 1 ] * 0.1.

Compute (5/6)^4: 5^4 is 625, 6^4 is 1296. 625/1296 ≈ 0.482.

So 0.482 - 1 = -0.518.

Multiply by 0.1: -0.0518.

So the fractional change is about -5.18%, meaning the flux is 5.18% lower when all the spots are visible. But wait, this is the maximum dip. Because the spots are on a hemisphere, so as the star rotates, the spots come into view. So the maximum dip would be when the entire spot area is facing us. But wait, the spot area is 0.4 π R², which is a total area of 0.4 * π R². Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4 π R², so the spot area is 0.4 π R² = (0.4/4) * 4 π R² = 10% of the star's surface. So, a 10% coverage of spots would cause a dip of about 5.18%? Hmm, but wait in the calculation above, it's 0.4 pi R² spots, which is 0.4 pi R² / (4 pi R²) )= 0.1 or 10% of the surface.

So, the maximum dip is about 5.18% of the star's flux, which is about a 5.18% decrease.

But wait, the question says that the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as what would be caused by a planet. So the planet would cause a dip in brightness when it transits the star. The amplitude of that dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area blocked is π R_planet², and the star's area is π R_star² (but wait, that's the area, but when R_planet is much smaller than R_star, the area is roughly (R_p/R_s)^2 times the star's area. So the fractional dip is (R_p/R_s)^2.

Wait, but the dip caused by the planet is (R_p/R_s)^2, because the planet blocks a part of the star's light. The spot situation causes a dip that's about 5.18%.

So to find the planet radius R_p that would cause the same dip, we set (R_p / R_star)^2 = 5.18% = 0.0518.

Wait, but wait, is the dip due to the planet the same as the dip due to the spots? The problem says the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet, so the amplitude of the brightness variation (the depth of the dip) is the same.

So R_p^2 / R_star^2 = dip_fraction.

So R_p = R_star * sqrt(dip_fraction).

So dip_fraction is 0.0518, so sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.227.

Hmm, 0.227 is approximately 0.23. But looking at the options, option D is 0.32, option A is 0.39, option C is 0.11, option B is 0.07. None of them is 0.23. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck.

Let me recompute (5/6)^4.

5^4 = 5*5*5*5=25*25=625.

6^4=6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296.

So (5/6)^4=625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So (5/6)^4 -1 = 0.482253 -1 = -0.517747.

Multiply by 0.1, we get -0.0517747, so the fractional change is approximately -5.177%.

So dip is about 5.18% as I said before.

So R_p^2 = 0.0518 * R_star^2.

So R_p = R_star * sqrt(0.0518) ≈ R_star * 0.227.

Hmm, that's about 0.227 R_star, which is close to 0.23. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, none match. Did I miss a factor? Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the area of spots. Let me go back. The question says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.

So, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere).

Area of hemisphere is 2π R². So spots area is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². Wait, that's correct.

Wait, but when the star is viewed, the maximum area that can be observed from Earth is the entire hemisphere. So when the star's rotation brings the spotty hemisphere into view, the spots' area would be 0.4 π R².

But when the star is not spotty, the dip would be when a planet transits, so the blocked area is π R_p².

So the dip is (π R_p²) / (4 π R_star²) )= (R_p²)/(4 R_star²) )? No, wait, when a planet transits, the blocked area is π R_p², and the star's area is π R_star², so the dip is (R_p²/R_star²).

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the planet can only block a part of the star's disk. The area blocked is π (R_p)^2, the star's area is π (R_star)^2, so the dip is (R_p / R_star)^2.

Wait, but that's the case if the planet is much smaller than the star, so the approximation holds. So if the dip caused by the planet is (R_p/R_star)^2, and the dip from the spots is 5.18%, then R_p/R_star = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.227.

But the options don't have 0.23. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another thing: the dip due to spots is not when the entire spot area is blocked, but when the spots are on the hemisphere facing us. But when the star is a sphere, perhaps the maximum dip occurs when we're looking at the hemisphere with the spots, but only part of the spots are in view. Wait, no. Wait, no, if the star is a sphere, then when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, all the spots on that hemisphere are visible. So the area of spots is 0.4 π R².

Wait, but when the star is viewed from Earth, the area we see is a circle with radius R_star. So the area of the star we see is π R_star². The area of the spots is 0.4 π R², which is 0.4 π (R_star)^2, since R_star is the radius.

So the dip is (0.4 π R_star²) / (π R_star²) ) * fractional drop per spot.

Wait, no. Because each spot has a lower flux. The dip is the difference between the normal flux from the spot area and the lower flux.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. The star's total flux is F0 = σ Teff^4 * 4π R².

When the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 - (A_spots) * (σ Teff^4 - σ T_spot^4).

So the fractional change is (F - F0)/F0 = [ - A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / (4 π R² Teff^4 ) * σ.

Wait, maybe I should compute the fractional change as:

ΔF/F = [ (A_spots (T_spot^4 - Teff^4 )) ] / [4 π R² Teff^4 ].

So (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) is negative, so ΔF is negative, which means F is lower. So the fractional dip is:

|ΔF/F| = [A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / (4 π R² Teff^4 )

= [A_spots/(4 π R²)] * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4.

A_spots is 0.4 π R², so A_spots/(4 π R² ) = 0.4 π R²/(4 π R² ) )= 0.4 /4 = 0.1.

So fractional dip is 0.1 * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4.

= 0.1 * (1 - (T_spot / Teff )^4 )

So substituting T_spot = 5000 K, Teff=6000 K.

(T_spot / Teff ) = 5/6.

(5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482.

So 1 - 0.482 = 0.518.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.0518, which is 5.18% dip.

So the dip is 5.18% when the spotty hemisphere is fully visible.

Now, if a planet were to cause the same dip, then the dip would be (R_planet / R_star )^2 = 0.0518.

So R_p = R_star * sqrt(0.0518).

Calculate sqrt(0.0518): sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

So R_p ≈ 0.2276 R_star.

But looking at the options, the closest is D) 0.32, which is higher, or C) 0.11, which is lower. Hmm, none match exactly. But wait the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Wait, perhaps I've missed something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the spot effect as an increase in brightness. No, spots are cooler, so they make the star dimmer when they're in view.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the average brightness over time. Because the spots are on one hemisphere, and the star is rotating, the total brightness variation would be an average of the spot effect.

Wait, but no, the problem states that the brightness variation is due to rotational modulation, which causes a periodic variation. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we have the maximum dip.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractional dip. Let's recalculate.

Compute (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)/Teff^4.

Teff=6000, T_spot=5000.

Compute 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296 *1e12 =1.296e15.

Similarly, 5000^4= (5e3)^4=625 *1e12=6.25e14.

So (6e3^4 -5e3^4)/6e3^4 = (1.296e15 - 6.25e14)/1.296e15 = (6.71e14)/(1.296e15 )= 0.518.

So 0.1 * 0.518 = 0.0518, which is 5.18%.

So perhaps the calculation is correct.

Wait, but the options don't have 0.227. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area of the spots. The problem says one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the area is 0.2 * (area of the hemisphere).

Area of hemisphere is 2 π R².

So spots area is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4 π R². So the spots cover 0.4 π R², which is 10% of the total area. So the dip when the entire spot area is visible would be 10% of the star's surface, but each spot is cooler, so the dip is more than 10%.

Wait, but when a planet transits, it blocks 10% of the star's surface, but since the planet has no effect on the temperature, the dip is (R_p/R_s)^2.

Wait, in our case, the dip is 5.18%, which is less than 10%. So a planet would need to block 5.18% of the star's light. So the area blocked by the planet would be 5.18% of the star's area.

So, the planet's area is 5.18% of the star's area.

Area of planet's disk: π R_p².

Area of star: π R_s².

So π R_p² / π R_s² = 0.0518 → (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.0518 → R_p/R_s ≈ 0.227.

So why isn't this matching any options? Hmm, perhaps the question is considering the effect differently. Maybe the rotational modulation leads to a periodic variation that's more complex, but the maximum amplitude is what's considered.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the flux from the star without spots is F0 = σ Teff^4 * 4 π R².

When the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 - (A_spots) [σ Teff^4 - σ T_spot^4 ].

So F = F0 - A_spots σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ).

The dip is F0 - F = A_spots σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ).

So the fractional dip is [A_spots σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / F0.

F0 = σ Teff^4 4 π R².

So, fractional dip = [A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / (4 π R² Teff^4 ).

A_spots is 0.4 π R².

So fractional dip = [0.4 π R² (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / (4 π R² Teff^4 ) )

Simplify:

= [0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / (4 Teff^4 ) )

= 0.1 (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 )

Which is the same as before.

So 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.1 * (1 - 625/1296 ) = 0.1 * (671/1296 ) ≈ 0.1 * 0.518 → 0.0518, 5.18%.

So, I think my calculation is correct.

Looking back at the options, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

A) ~0.39 → (0.39)^2=0.1521 → 15.21% dip.

B) ~0.07 → 0.0049 → 0.49% dip.

C) ~0.11 → 0.0121 → 1.21% dip.

D) ~0.32 →0.1024 → 10.24% dip.

Wait, none of these correspond to 5.18%. So perhaps the question is considering the integrated brightness variation over the rotation period, not the maximum dip. Or perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is such that the average dip is 5.18%, but the peak-to-peak variation is larger. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the peak-to-peak variation, which would be twice the dip.

Wait, no. The dip is 5.18% when the spots are fully in view; when the other hemisphere is in view, the star is at maximum brightness (no dip). So the amplitude of the brightness variation is 5.18%.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the star's brightness variation is not just the dip but some combination. Wait, perhaps when the star is viewed with the spot hemisphere, the brightness is lower, and when the non-spot hemisphere is viewed, the brightness is higher than normal? No, because the other hemisphere is not spotty, so its brightness is the same as the rest of the star. So the maximum brightness is when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, so when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the area of the star's disk is the same as the spotty hemisphere. So the brightness would be the same as the star's normal brightness when either hemisphere is facing us. Wait, that can't be. Because each hemisphere has parts in view.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. The star's overall emission is integrated over the entire surface. So whether the spotty hemisphere is facing us or not, the total flux comes from all visible areas.

Wait, no. When you look at the star, you see a circular disk. The flux comes from the part of the star's surface that is in your field of view. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the part of the star's surface that is in our view is the spotty hemisphere. Which has 20% spots. So the flux is lower.

Wait, perhaps this approach is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of view. So the maximum dip is 5.18%, and the planet would cause a dip of the same amplitude when transiting.

So to have the same amplitude, the planet must block the same amount of flux as the spots' effect. So R_p^2/R_star^2 = 0.0518 → R_p = 0.227 R_star.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is considering something else, like the depth of the dip being the same as the planet's.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area blocked by the planet as a fraction of the star's area. The dip is (R_p/R_star )^2.

If the dip is 5.18%, then R_p/R_star = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.227.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip.

Wait, perhaps the star's rotation leads to the spots being viewed not all at once but over time. So the maximum dip is when the entire spotty hemisphere is in view. But the spotty hemisphere is 0.4 π R², which is half of the star's surface (since hemisphere is half the star). Wait, no, the star's surface area is 4 π R². The hemisphere's area is 2 π R². So the spots are 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². So when the spotty hemisphere is in view, the area of spots is 0.4 π R². The area of the star's disk as viewed is π R_star².

Wait, the fraction of the star's disk covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (π R²) )= 0.4 → 40% of the star's disk is covered by spots when the spotty hemisphere is in view.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the spotty hemisphere is a sphere, so when viewed from Earth, the area of the spotty hemisphere that's visible is a circle of radius R_star. So the area is π R_star².

The area of the spots in the spotty hemisphere is 0.4 π R². But R is the star's radius, so R_star. So 0.4 π R_star².

So the fraction is (0.4 π R²) / (π R²) )= 0.4 → 40% of the visible area is covered by spots.

Wait, that's different. So the dip would be 40% of the star's disk being covered by spots, each of which is cooler.

So the dip is (fraction of area covered) * (T_spot^4 - Teff^4 ) / Teff^4.

Wait, no, the dip is the difference between the spot area contributing less flux.

Wait, perhaps the dip is the area covered by spots times (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 ).

Because each spot contributes (T_spot^4) instead of Teff^4.

So the dip would be:

dip = (A_spots_visible / A_visible) * (1 - (T_spot / Teff )^4 )

Wait, but A_visible is π R_star² when the star is viewed.

A_spots_visible is 0.4 π R_star².

So dip_fraction = (0.4 π R²) / (π R² ) ) * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.4 * (1 - 0.482253) = 0.4 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.2071, which is 20.71% dip.

Wait, that's a bigger dip, around 20.7%.

Wait, that's a significant difference. So which approach is correct?

I think the confusion arises from whether the area of the spots is a fixed portion of the entire star, or a fixed portion of the hemisphere.

In the initial approach, the area of spots is 0.4 π R², which is 10% of the entire star's surface. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the visible area of spots is 10% of the entire star, but within the visible hemisphere, which is 50% of the star's surface.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of what fraction of the star's surface is covered by spots when viewed from Earth.

When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². So the fraction of the star's surface that's visible from Earth and covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) )= 0.1 or 10%.

Wait, no, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the visible area is the entire spotty hemisphere, which is 2 π R². The spots are 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². So the fraction of the visible area covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (2 π R² ) )= 0.2 → 20%.

So when the spotty hemisphere is in view, 20% of the visible area is covered by spots. Each of those spots contributes (T_spot^4 ) instead of Teff^4.

So the dip is 20% * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.2 * (1 - 0.482253 ) ≈ 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355 → 10.35% dip.

Ah, that's a different result. So the dip is about 10.35%.

So this approach gives a dip of approximately 10.35%, which would correspond to a planet radius of sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3218 R_star.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

So that's probably the correct answer.

So where did I go wrong earlier? It seems that in the first approach, I considered the spot area as 10% of the entire star's surface, but in reality, when the spotty hemisphere is in view, the spot area is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 10% of the entire star. But within the visible hemisphere, the spot coverage is 20% of that. So the dip is 20% of the visible area, each spot contributing (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 ), so overall dip is 20% * 51.77% ≈ 10.35%.

So the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3218, which is about 0.32. So option D is the correct answer.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Details:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} \) (equal to the Sun's radius).
   - Effective Temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor of 20%**. This means 20% of the hemisphere's surface is covered by spots.
   - Spots Temperature: \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) (1000 K cooler than the star).

2. **Spot Area**:
   - The surface area of one hemisphere is \( 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The area covered by spots is \( 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).

3. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's total flux without spots is proportional to its surface area and temperature: \( F_{\text{star}} \propto \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \times 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - When spots are visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots. The fractional change in flux is:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_0 = \left(\frac{A_{\text{spots}}}{4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2}\right) \times \left(1 - \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4\right)
     \]
   - Substituting values:
     - \( A_{\text{spots}} = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \),
     - \( \frac{A_{\text{spots}}}{4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = 0.1 \),
     - \( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} = \frac{5000}{6000} = \frac{5}{6} \),
     - \( \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 0.482 \),
     - \( 1 - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 0.518 \).

   - Therefore:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_0 = 0.1 \times 0.518 = 0.0518 \, \text{(or 5.18% dip)}.
     \]

4. **Exoplanet Radius**:
   - The dip in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \text{Dip} = \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2.
     \]
   - To match the 5.18% dip:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.0518 \implies \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.0518} \approx 0.227.
     \]

### Reconciling with Options:
The calculated radius ratio (\( \approx 0.227 \)) does not match any of the provided options. However, reevaluating the problem suggests that the dip may instead correspond to the fraction of the **visible hemisphere** covered by spots. Since the spotty hemisphere covers 20% of its visible area:
   \[
   \text{Dip} = 0.2 \times 0.518 = 0.1036 \, \text{(or 10.36% dip)}.
   \]
   - For this larger dip:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.1036 \implies \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1036} \approx 0.322.
     \]

This matches **Option D (~0.32)**.

### Final Answer:
The radius of the exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star is approximately **0.32 times the radius of the host star**.

**Answer: D**
