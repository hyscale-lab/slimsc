Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's try to break it down. So the question is about a star with some spots on it, and how that affects the brightness variations observed. They're comparing it to what an exoplanet would do, and we need to find the radius of such a planet relative to the star.

Okay, let's start with what I remember. When a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of that dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. The formula for the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2, right? Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius.

But wait, in this problem, the star has spots. The spots are cooler or hotter? Well, the star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K different. I think starspots are usually cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the spots would be at 5000K? Or 7000K? Wait, the problem says the temperature difference is 1000K, but it doesn't specify hotter or cooler. Hmm. Oh, but starspots are usually cooler, so I'll assume the spots are 5000K.

The star's hemisphere is covered 20% in spots. Filling factor is 20%—so the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. Wait, the star's radius is the same as the Sun. But the spot coverage is on one hemisphere, so the area is 0.2 * (4πR²/2) = 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR²? Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So if one hemisphere has 20% coverage, the total area with spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². Because a hemisphere is 2π steradians (if R is in radians, but for area it's 2πR²). Wait, no, the area of a sphere is 4πR², so a hemisphere is 2πR². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Oh wait, no, wait. 20% of the entire surface would be 0.2 *4πR²=0.8πR². But in this case, only one hemisphere is spotty with 20% coverage. So the area is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4π R².

But how does this affect the observed brightness? When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. But since only one hemisphere is spotty, the brightness variation would be due to the spots moving in and out of the observed area. Wait, but the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into view as the star spins. So the observed brightness would dip when the spots are on the side facing us, but because the spots are cooler, the total brightness would decrease during each spot transit.

Wait, no. Wait, the star's brightness is measured by the sum of the flux from all the areas visible. The spots emit less flux than the surrounding photosphere. So as the star rotates, the area of spots visible changes, leading to a variation in brightness. But when the spots are on the far side, they don't affect the observed brightness. So the brightness variation is due to the spots moving into and out of the visible hemisphere.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots would come into view from the edge and then block some light when the area with spots is facing us. So the brightness will dip when the spots are in the front, and rise when they're on the back.

Wait, but the way the problem is worded, it says that the star has dark spots on one hemisphere, and the brightness variation is periodic due to rotation. So the star's rotation causes the spots to be visible and then not, leading to a dip in brightness each time.

But in the problem, it's stated that this situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the observed light curve would have a dip similar to a planet transit. So the amplitude of the dip caused by the spots is similar to that caused by a planet.

Wait, but the question is, what would be the radius of the exoplanet (Rpl) relative to the star (Rstar) such that the brightness dip would be the same as the one caused by the spots.

So to find Rpl/Rstar such that (Rpl/Rstar)^2 equals the brightness variation due to the spots.

Wait, but let me get the brightness variation due to the spots.

The total flux from the star without spots is F0. With spots, the flux is F0 minus the flux from the spots when they are on the front.

So the flux from the star when the spots are visible is F = F0 * (1 - f), where f is the fractional change in flux due to the spots.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Without spots, the star emits F0. When the spots are visible, each spot contributes less flux than the surrounding area. So the observed flux would be F = F0 - (number of spots * flux loss per spot).

Wait, but maybe it's better to calculate the fractional change in flux.

The flux from a spot is F_spot = sigma * T_spot^4 * area_spot.

The flux from the surrounding area (non-spot) is F_non_spot = sigma * T_non_spot^4 * area_non_spot.

So the difference per unit area is (T_non^4 - T_spot^4) * sigma.

But the filling factor is f = 0.2, so the area covered by spots is 0.2 * area of the hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps the fractional change in flux when the spots are on the front is:

delta_F = (F_non - F_spot) / F_total.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the average brightness when the spots are present.

The star's total flux when a hemisphere is spotted is:

F = (1 - f) * F_non + f * F_spot,

where f is the filling factor (0.2), and F_non is the flux per unit area of the non-spotted regions, and F_spot is the flux per unit area of the spots.

But wait, actually, when the spots are on the near side, the area of the star's disk that is spotted is the same as the filling factor times the area of the hemisphere. Wait, perhaps I need to model this differently.

Let me approach it step by step.

The star has radius R. The total surface area of the star is 4πR².

One hemisphere is spotted, with 20% of that hemisphere covered in spots. So the area of spots on the front side is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

The flux from the star when the spots are on the near side is:

Flux = (Area_non_spotted * F_non) + (Area_spotted * F_spot).

Area_non_spotted on the front is (2π R²) - 0.4 π R² = 1.6 π R².

F_non is sigma * T_eff^4.

F_spot is sigma * (T_eff - delta T)^4, but wait the problem says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. So if the star's Teff is 6000K, then the spots are either 5000K or 7000K. Since starspots are cooler, I'll assume 5000K.

So F_non = sigma * (6000)^4.

F_spot = sigma * (5000)^4.

Now, when the spots are on the front, the total flux is:

F_spotty = [1.6 π R² * sigma (6000)^4] + [0.4 π R² * sigma (5000)^4].

The total flux without any spots (assuming the entire star emits at 6000 K) would be:

F_full = 4 π R² * sigma (6000)^4.

Wait, but in reality, the unspotted star's total flux is F0 = 4 π R² sigma Teff^4. But when the spots are on the front, the flux is F_spotty.

So the fractional change in flux is (F_spotty - F_full) / F_full.

Wait, but wait, actually, when the spots are on the back, the flux would be same as if the star had no spots. Because the spots are on the far side and don't contribute. Wait, no—no, the spots are only on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots move from the back to the front and then to the back again.

Wait, but when the spots are on the front, the flux is lower than when they're on the back.

So the flux variation would be the difference between F_spotty and F_full.

Wait, no. Wait, the maximum flux occurs when no spots are visible (i.e., all the front is normal). The minimum occurs when the maximum amount of spotted area is on the front.

Wait, no. Wait, when the spots are on the near side, their lower flux causes the total flux to be less than F_full.

Wait, but the star's total flux without any spots is F0 = 4 π R² sigma Teff^4.

Wait, but the star with spots on one hemisphere—when the spots are on the front, the flux is:

F_visible = F_non_spotted_area * F_non + F_spotted_area * F_spot.

Because the front is partially spotted.

But the spotted area is 0.2 of the front hemisphere, which is 0.2*(2 π R²) = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but the total surface area is 4 π R².

So when the spots are on the front, the flux is:

F_visible = [ (2 π R² - 0.4 π R²) * sigma (6000)^4 ] + [ 0.4 π R² * sigma (5000)^4 ]

= [1.6 π R² * sigma (6000)^4 ] + [0.4 π R² sigma (5000)^4 ]

= sigma π R² [ 1.6 * (6000)^4 + 0.4 * (5000)^4 ]

Divide by F0 which is sigma 4 π R² (6000)^4.

So the ratio is [1.6*(6000^4) +0.4*(5000^4)] / [4*(6000^4)].

Let me compute that.

Compute numerator:

1.6*(6e3)^4 = 1.6 * (6^4)*1e12 = 1.6 *1296 * 1e12 = 2073.6e12.

0.4*(5e3)^4 = 0.4*(625e12) = 250e12.

So numerator is 2073.6e12 + 250e12 = 2323.6e12.

Denominator is 4*(6e3)^4 = 4 * 1296e12 = 5184e12.

So the ratio is 2323.6 / 5184 ≈ 0.4476.

Wait, but that's the ratio of F_visible to F0 when the spots are on the front. So the flux when the spots are visible is 44.76% of F0. Wait, that can't be right because the star's brightness can't drop that much. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express it.

Wait, (6000)^4 is 6^4 * 10^12 = 1296e12.

(5000)^4 is 5^4 *10^12 = 625e12.

So 1.6 * 1296e12 = 2073.6e12.

0.4 * 625e12 = 250e12.

Total: 2073.6e12 +250e12 = 2323.6e12.

Denominator: 4 * 1296e12 = 5184e12.

So ratio is 2323.6 / 5184 ≈ 0.4476. Wait, that's 44.76% of the original flux. That seems way too low. Wait, that would mean a very deep dip, but the problem says the star's brightness variation is similar to that of an exoplanet transit.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait, maybe I forgot that the star's radius is same as Sun, so R is the same. But wait, the calculation actually cancels R, since both F_visible and F0 have R².

Wait, but let me compute the ratio again numerically.

Compute 6000^4 = 6^4 *1e3^4 = 1296 *1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So 1.6 *1.296e15 = 2.0736e15.

0.4 *6.25e14 = 2.5e14.

Total numerator: 2.0736e15 +2.5e14 = 2.3236e15.

Denominator: 4 *1.296e15 = 5.184e15.

So 2.3236e15 /5.184e15 = approx 0.4476, which is about 44.76% of F0.

So when the spots are on the front, the flux is 44.76% of F0. When the spots are on the back, the flux is F0. So the change in flux is F0 - F_visible = F0 (1 - 0.4476) = F0 * 0.5524.

Wait, that's a drop of about 55%? That seems huge. Wait, that can't be right because starspots usually cause a smaller dip. Maybe I made a mistake in how I'm calculating the flux.

Wait, alternative approach: Compute the fractional change in flux when spots are on the front.

The fraction of the star's surface that is spotty when the spots are on the front is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) / (total area). Wait, the hemisphere area is 2πR², so 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². The total area is 4π R². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots when they're on the front is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.4/4 = 0.1. So 10% of the total surface is covered by spots when they're on the front.

Ah! So the filling factor in the entire star is 10%. Because only one hemisphere is covered 20%, so when the spots are on the front, 10% of the star's surface is spots. When they're on the back, 0% is visible.

So the fractional change in flux when the spots are on the front would be:

delta_F = [ (F_non * (1 - f)) + (F_spot * f) ] / F_non - 1.

Wait, no, F_non is the flux per unit area of non-spots, F_spot is the flux per unit area of spots. So the total flux is:

F_visible = (1 - f) * F_non + f * F_spot.

The original flux is F_non * 1 (since all areas are non-spots when the spots are on the back).

So the fractional change is [F_visible / F_original] = [(1 - f) + f (F_spot / F_non)].

Because F_visible is (1-f) F_non + f F_spot, and F_original is F_non.

So delta = [(1 - f) + f (F_spot / F_non)] - 1.

Which simplifies to f (F_spot / F_non - 1).

Wait, let me write it more clearly:

delta = (F_visible / F_original) - 1 = ( (1-f) + f (F_spot / F_non) ) - 1.

So delta = -f (1 - (F_spot / F_non)).

Because F_spot < F_non, delta will be negative, indicating a drop in flux.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the fractional change as (F_visible - F_original)/F_original.

So F_visible = (1 - f) F_non + f F_spot.

F_original = F_non.

So (F_visible - F_original)/F_original = [ (1-f) F_non + f F_spot - F_non ] / F_non.

= [ -f F_non + f F_spot ] / F_non.

= f (F_spot / F_non - 1).

So fractional change is f ( (F_spot / F_non) - 1 ).

Now, F_spot is sigma T_spot^4, F_non is sigma T_non^4.

So F_spot / F_non = (T_spot / T_non)^4.

So the fractional change is f ( (T_spot / T_non)^4 - 1 ).

Wait, but since T_spot < T_non, this will be negative, meaning a decrease in flux.

So the fractional change is f [ (T_spot^4 / T_non^4 ) - 1 ].

Which is f [ (T_spot / T_non )^4 -1 ].

In our case, T_spot is 5000 K (since Teff is 6000), so T_spot = 5000, T_non =6000.

f is 0.1 (because when the spots are on the front, 10% of the star is spotted).

So delta = 0.1 * ( (5000/6000)^4 - 1 )

Compute 5/6 is approximately 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So delta = 0.1 * (0.48225 - 1) = 0.1 * (-0.51775) ≈ -0.051775.

So the fractional change is approximately -5.1775% which is about a 5.18% decrease in flux when the spots are on the front.

Wait, but the question says that this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is similar to that caused by an exoplanet.

The amplitude of the exoplanet transit is (Rp/Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is (Rp/Rstar)^2 times the star's area.

So we want (Rp/Rstar)^2 = delta.

Wait, but delta is the fractional change in flux. So setting (Rp/Rstar)^2 = |delta|, since the planet causes a dip of delta in flux.

Wait, the fractional dip due to the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So in this problem, the dip due to the spots is approximately 5.18%, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have 0.2277. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, none of these match 0.2277. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of f. Let me double-check.

Wait, the filling factor is 0.2 on one hemisphere. So when the star is viewed such that the hemisphere with spots is facing us, the area of spots visible is 0.2*(2π R²) = 0.4 π R².

The total area is 4π R², so the fraction is (0.4 π R²)/(4 π R²) )= 0.4/4 = 0.1. So f is 0.1, correct.

Hmm. So the fractional dip is about 5.18%, so Rp^2/Rstar^2=0.0518 → Rp/Rstar≈0.228.

But none of the options are close to 0.23. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractional change.

Wait.

Compute (5000/6000)^4:

5000 is 5/6 of 6000.

(5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So 0.482253.

So fractional change is f*(0.482253 -1 ) = 0.1*(-0.517747) ≈-0.0517747.

So 5.177% dip.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2276.

Approx 0.23. But the options don't include that. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the way the spots are arranged affects the dip. Maybe because the spots are on a hemisphere, the maximum area visible is 0.2 of the hemisphere, which is 0.1 of the total area.

Alternatively, perhaps the brightness variation is not just the fractional dip but the amplitude of the modulation.

Wait, when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So the maximum dip is when the maximum area of the spots is on the front. So perhaps the dip is 5.18%, but the amplitude is the difference between when the spots are on the front and when they are not.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's said that the star is being observed over time, and the brightness variations are due to rotational modulation. So the amplitude of the brightness variation (the peak-to-peak) is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux observed.

Wait, no, the amplitude is usually the semi-amplitude, the change from the mean. So if the star's flux varies from F0 to F0*(1 - f*(1 - (T_spot/T_non)^4 ) ), then the amplitude is 0.05177 F0, which is about 5.18% of F0.

So the dip is about 5.18% of F0, which is the same as the dip caused by a planet. So the planet's dip would be (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.228.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the spots cause a variation in the brightness that's a bit different.

Wait, another approach: The maximum brightness is when no spots are visible (so F = F0). The minimum brightness is when the maximum amount of spots is visible. In this case, the spots cover 10% of the surface. So the flux during minimum is F_min = F0 * ( (1 - 0.1) * (Teff^4) + 0.1 * (T_spot^4) ) / (Teff^4) )

Wait, let me compute F_min.

F_min = [ (1 - 0.1) * (6000^4) + 0.1 * (5000^4) ] / (6000^4) * F0.

Which is [0.9 * 6000^4 + 0.1 *5000^4 ] /6000^4.

So 0.9 + 0.1*(5000^4/6000^4) = 0.9 + 0.1*( (5/6)^4 ) = 0.9 + 0.1* (625/1296) ≈ 0.9 + 0.1*(0.482253) ≈ 0.9 + 0.0482253 ≈ 0.9482253.

So F_min = 0.9482253 F0.

So the dip is F0 - F_min = 0.0517747 F0, which is about 5.18% as before.

So the semi-amplitude is 5.18%.

So the planet would cause a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518, so Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star is covered in spots on one hemisphere, so when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F0. When the spots are on the front, the flux is F_min. So the brightness variation is F0 - F_min, which is 0.05177 F0, so the amplitude is 0.05177 F0.

Wait, but perhaps the way the model is set up, the brightness variation due to the spots is the same as the variation due to the planet. So the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177, giving Rp/Rstar ≈0.228.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of spots.

Wait, another thought: The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So when the star is viewed edge-on, the entire hemisphere's spots are visible. But when viewed face-on, no spots are visible.

Wait, but in the problem, the situation is that the star is observed from a certain inclination, but the way the spots are arranged, the maximum coverage when the spots are facing us is 20% of one hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps I should model it differently. The star has a single hemisphere with 20% of its area covered in spots. So when the star is viewed edge-on, the spots would be on the limb and might not contribute as much to the flux. Hmm, but this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum brightness dip occurs when as much of the spots as possible are on the front. So with 20% of the hemisphere covered, when the star is viewed face-on, the full 20% of the hemisphere is visible, meaning 10% of the star's surface is spots.

But perhaps when the star is viewed edge-on, the spots are only seen as a small portion. But I think for the purposes of this problem, we're considering the worst-case scenario where the maximum number of spots is visible, so the dip is as calculated.

Hmm. But since none of the options match, perhaps the approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness variation is more complex. The star is rotating, so the spots are moving in and out of view, causing a modulation in brightness. The amplitude of this modulation is what's compared to the planet's transit.

Wait, but the problem states that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the brightness variation amplitude is similar to that of a planet transit.

So, to find the radius of the planet that would cause the same amplitude.

Wait, let me re-express the problem: the observed light curve of the spotted star has a variation amplitude A, which is the same as the variation caused by an exoplanet of radius Rp. So we need to find Rp/Rstar such that (Rp/Rstar)^2 = A.

So what is A in this case?

When the star is observed, the maximum and minimum fluxes are F_max and F_min, so the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/2, perhaps? Or is it the difference between F_max and F_min?

Wait, no, in a transit, the light curve goes from F0 to F0 - delta, so the amplitude is delta.

In the case of spots, the flux varies between F0 (when no spots are visible) and F_min (when the spots are fully visible). So the amplitude is F0 - F_min = 0.05177 F0.

Alternatively, the amplitude could be the peak-to-peak variation, which is F0 - F_min, so the same as the dip.

So the amplitude A is 0.05177.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made an error in considering the area of the spots.

Wait, another approach: The problem states that the star has a radius equal to that of the Sun. So R_star = R_sun.

The spots have a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere) = 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

The area of the star is 4 pi R^2, so the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4 pi R^2) / (4 pi R^2) ) = 0.1, as before.

So the earlier calculation is correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractional change.

Wait, another way: the fractional change in flux when the spots are on the front is:

delta_F = [sum of all areas' fluxes] / F0.

Which is ( (1-f) * F_non + f * F_spot ) / F_non.

= (1-f) + f * (F_spot / F_non).

= 1 - f (1 - (F_spot / F_non)).

Wait, so the fractional change is (1 - f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_non^4 )) )

Wait, but that can't be right because if F_spot is less than F_non, (F_spot / F_non) <1, so 1 - (F_spot/F_non) is positive. So f multiplied by that would be positive, making the fractional change 1 - positive number, which is lower than 1, which matches the dip.

Wait, but the dip is (1 - [ (1-f) + f (F_spot / F_non) ]) ?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe an alternative approach is better.

Let me compute the exact numbers:

T_non = 6000 K.

T_spot = 5000 K.

f = 0.1.

Compute (T_spot / T_non)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4.

(0.8333)^2 is approximately 0.6944.

(0.6944)^2 ≈ 0.48225.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So F_spot = sigma * T_spot^4 = sigma * (5e3)^4 = sigma * 625e12.

F_non = sigma * (6e3)^4 = sigma * 1296e12.

So F_spot = (625/1296) F_non ≈ 0.48225 F_non.

So when f=0.1, the flux is F_visible = 0.9 F_non + 0.1 * 0.48225 F_non = (0.9 + 0.048225) F_non = 0.948225 F_non.

So the flux is 94.8225% of F_non, leading to a dip of 5.1775%.

So the amplitude is 0.051775.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2276.

Again, this is approximately 0.23, but the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the spots as bright regions, but that doesn't make sense because starspots are dark. Alternatively, perhaps the spots are hotter regions, but that's not usual.

Alternatively, perhaps the temperature of the spots is 7000 K, which would make the spots brighter than the surrounding photosphere. But that would be unusual, as starspots are cooler. But let's try that scenario.

If T_spot = 7000 K.

Then (7000/6000)^4 = (7/6)^4 ≈ (1.1667)^4 ≈ 1.1667^2=1.361, then squared is ≈ 1.853.

So F_spot/F_non = 1.853.

Then delta = f * (F_spot/F_non -1 ) = 0.1*(1.853 -1) = 0.1*(0.853) = 0.0853.

So a fractional increase of 8.53%, which is a much larger dip. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0853 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.292.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which is close but not exact.

But this doesn't make sense because starspots are cooler, so their F_spot should be less than F_non. So perhaps the initial approach was correct.

Wait, another possibility: the filling factor is 20% on the entire star, not just one hemisphere. But the problem states that one hemisphere is covered 20% in spots.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should consider that when the star is viewed edge-on, the spots on the other hemisphere may contribute to the brightness variation, but I think the problem assumes that only one hemisphere is spotty.

Alternatively, perhaps I have to compute the maximum possible dip, considering that the star's rotation can spin the spots into a position that's more optimal. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the fractional change.

Another approach: The area of the spots is A = 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

The total area of the star is 4 π R², so the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1 or 10%.

The flux when the spots are visible is F = F0 * (1 - 0.1) * (Teff^4) + 0.1 * (T_spot^4).

But F0 is the flux when the entire star is at Teff.

So F = F0 * [ 0.9 (Teff^4 / Teff^4) + 0.1 (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ) ]

= F0 [ 0.9 + 0.1 (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ]

So the dip is F0 - F = F0 [ 1 - 0.9 - 0.1 (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ) ]

= F0 [ 0.1 (1 - T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ]

So the dip is 0.1 (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

Which is the same as earlier.

So for T_spot =5000 K, dip is 0.1*(1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.1*(1 - 625/1296) = 0.1*( (1296-625)/1296 ) = 0.1*(671/1296) ≈ 0.1*0.51775 = 0.051775, as before.

So the dip is about 5.18%.

So the dip from the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that the spots are on both hemispheres, but the question says only one is spotty. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's rotation period causes the spots to be viewed as a single spot, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the duration of the dip. No, the problem states that the amplitude is the same.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip, and the correct value is about 5.18%, leading to Rp/Rstar≈0.228.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-calculate the dip with more precise numbers.

Let me compute (5/6)^4 more accurately.

5/6 = 0.833333333.

0.833333^4:

Compute 0.833333^2 = 0.694444.

0.694444^2 = (approx) 0.482253.

So (5/6)^4 = 0.482253.

So the dip is 0.1*(1 - 0.482253) = 0.1*0.517747 = 0.0517747.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517747.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517747) ≈ 0.2275.

Again, 0.2275.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: ~0.11, but that's 0.11, which is about half of 0.2275. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I have to compute the spot's effect as an average over the rotation period. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the star's brightness variation is not just a single dip but a sinusoidal variation due to the spots moving across the disk. The amplitude of this variation would be related to the size and temperature difference of the spots.

But for the purposes of this problem, I think the approach is correct, leading to Rp/Rstar ≈0.2275.

Since none of the options match this, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's spots are on the entire visible area when the hemisphere is face-on. So when the hemisphere is viewed face-on, 20% of the hemisphere is covered. So the fraction of the star's surface covered is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 20%*(2π R²)/(4π R²) = 0.2 * (2/4) = 0.1, which is 10%.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the hemisphere, but the entire star. So the filling factor is 20% on the entire star. If that's the case, f=0.2.

Then the dip would be 0.2*(1 - (5/6)^4) = 0.2*(1 - 0.482253) = 0.2*(0.517747) = 0.103549.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.103549 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.103549) ≈ 0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, matching option D.

Wait, that's an option. So perhaps the mistake was in considering that the filling factor is 20% for the entire star, not just one hemisphere. But the question says one hemisphere is covered with 20% spots. So f=0.1.

But if the problem intended that the entire star has 20% spots, then f=0.2, leading to a planet radius of ~0.32, which is option D.

But the question says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% on the hemisphere, not the entire star.

So in that case, the correct calculation leads to Rp/Rstar ≈0.2275, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The problem says that the star's brightness variation resembles an exoplanet. So the maximum dip is when the entire spot area is on the front. So the dip is 5.18%, as calculated.

So the planet's dip would be (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rstar ≈0.2275.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the amplitude as the peak-to-peak variation, which would be twice the dip.

So the amplitude would be 2 * 0.05177 ≈ 0.10354.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10354 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10354) ≈ 0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, option D.

Ah! That makes sense. Because the peak-to-peak variation is twice the dip. So the amplitude of the light curve would be twice the semi-amplitude.

Wait, no, the amplitude is usually the semi-amplitude. But perhaps in this case, the problem expects the peak-to-peak variation.

Wait, but in the case of the planet, the light curve goes from F0 to F0 - delta, so the amplitude is delta. For the spotted star, the flux varies between F0 and F_min. So the amplitude is F0 - F_min, which is delta.

Wait, but perhaps the situation is more complicated. When the spots are on the star, the brightness varies as the spots rotate into and out of view, leading to a periodic brightness change with a certain amplitude.

In the case of the planet, the brightness change is a sharp dip when the planet transits. The amplitude is delta.

In the case of the star with spots, the brightness variation is a sinusoidal-like change as the spots rotate into and out of view, with a certain amplitude.

The maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible (front), and the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible (back). So the amplitude of the brightness change is the difference between F0 and F_min, which is delta.

But wait, perhaps the brightness variation is more of a sine wave, with a certain amplitude that depends on the spot size and temperature.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness variation as a function of the spot's position.

As the star rotates, the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots visible to us changes. The flux as a function of rotation angle theta (0° when spot is centered, 180° when spot is on the back) is:

F(theta) = F0 [1 - f * ( (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_non^4 )) * ( (1 + cos(theta)) / 2 ) ) ]

Wait, perhaps that's a way to model it, but it's getting complicated.

Alternatively, the change in flux can be approximated as a sinusoidal function with an amplitude A, which is the semi-amplitude.

But perhaps the maximum dip is delta, and the semi-amplitude is delta/2.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

The problem states that the brightness variation due to the spots is periodic and resembles an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation (the peak-to-peak change) should be the same as that caused by the planet.

In the case of the planet, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2, a single dip each orbit.

In the case of the star, the brightness varies with the rotation period, but the maximum dip is the same as the planet's.

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip in the star's brightness is when the maximum area of the spots is visible. So the dip is delta = 5.18%, as before.

So the planet's dip is also 5.18%, leading to Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But again, no option matches. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the spots to have a filling factor of 20% on the entire star. Let's recalculate with f=0.2.

delta = 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10354.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10354 → Rp/Rstar ≈0.3218, which is option D.

So perhaps the intended answer is D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star that would produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve as the observed brightness variation caused by the spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun.
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor of 20%**.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The spots cause a periodic brightness dip due to rotational modulation.
   - The amplitude of this dip is determined by the fractional change in flux when the spots are visible.

3. **Exoplanet Signal**:
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation caused by an exoplanet is proportional to \( (R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 \), where \( R_{\text{pl}} \) is the planet's radius and \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the star's radius.

### Analysis:
1. **Fraction of Star Covered by Spots**:
   - The filling factor of 20% applies to one hemisphere. The area of one hemisphere is \( 2\pi R^2 \), so the area covered by spots is \( 0.2 \times 2\pi R^2 = 0.4\pi R^2 \).
   - The total surface area of the star is \( 4\pi R^2 \), so the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is:
     \[
     f = \frac{0.4\pi R^2}{4\pi R^2} = 0.1 \, \text{(10%)}.
     \]

2. **Fractional Change in Flux**:
   - The flux from a spot is proportional to \( T_{\text{spot}}^4 \), and the flux from the surrounding photosphere is proportional to \( T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).
   - The fractional change in flux when the spots are visible is:
     \[
     \Delta F = f \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} - 1 \right).
     \]
   - Substituting \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225.
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.1 \left( 0.48225 - 1 \right) = 0.1 \times (-0.51775) \approx -0.051775.
     \]
   - The flux decreases by approximately \( 5.18\% \) when the spots are fully visible.

3. **Exoplanet Signal**:
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the exoplanet is given by:
     \[
     (R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 = |\Delta F| = 0.051775.
     \]
   - Solving for \( R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \):
     \[
     R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.2276.
     \]

4. **Matching the Options**:
   - The calculated value \( R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.2276 \) does not match any of the provided options directly.
   - However, if the problem intended the filling factor to apply to the entire star (i.e., \( f = 0.2 \) instead of \( f = 0.1 \)), the fractional change in flux would be:
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.2 \left( 0.48225 - 1 \right) = 0.2 \times (-0.51775) \approx -0.10355.
     \]
   - In this case:
     \[
     (R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 = 0.10355 \implies R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218.
     \]
   - This matches **Option D (~0.32)**.

### Conclusion:
The most reasonable interpretation of the problem, given the provided options, is that the filling factor applies to the entire star. Thus, the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.32 \).
