Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

So the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Wait, rest mass energy is E=mc², right? So M would be 300 GeV / c², but maybe I don't need to get into that right away. 

Then a spontaneous fission happens, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. So let's say the masses are M1 and M2. Given that M1 = 2*M2. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Wait, so M1 + M2 = 0.99 M. 

Let me check: since M1 is twice M2, that means M1 = 2*M2. So substituting into the sum equation: 2*M2 + M2 = 3*M2 = 0.99 M. So M2 = (0.99 M)/3. Which is 0.33 M. Then M1 is 0.66 M. 

Wait, but the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. So after fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momentum so that their momenta cancel out. So their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. 

Let me think about their velocities. Since one is more massive, the lighter one will have a higher speed. But wait, since it's a nuclear reaction, maybe relativistic effects are important. But the question is about the kinetic energy difference between the correct relativistic calculation and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. So I need to compute both and find their difference.

The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total energy before fission is just its rest energy, 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies of the two fragments. So, energy conservation says:

Initial energy = Final energy
300 GeV = M1*c² + M2*c² + T1 + T2

But wait, the rest masses of the fragments sum to 0.99 M, so M1 + M2 = 0.99
