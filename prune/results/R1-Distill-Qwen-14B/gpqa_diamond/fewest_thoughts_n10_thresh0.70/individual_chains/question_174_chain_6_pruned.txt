Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. 

Alright, the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using a classical approximation.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest, which means the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. 

First, let me find the masses of the two fragments. Let's call the less massive one m, so the other is 2m. The sum of their masses is m + 2m = 3m. But the problem says this sum is 99% of M, so 3m = 0.99 M. Therefore, m = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. So the less massive fragment has mass 0.33 M, and the more massive is 0.66 M. 

Wait, but wait. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial M. But the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. Hmm, but if the nucleus splits, the sum of the rest masses would typically be less than the original because some mass is converted into kinetic energy. But in this case, it's given that the sum is 99% of M. So that means 3m = 0.99 M, so m is 0.33 M as I thought.

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments' momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So if the velocities are v and V, their momenta p1 = gamma1 m v and p2 = gamma2 (2m) V must satisfy p1 = -p2. Wait, no, since they're moving in opposite directions, their magnitudes would be equal but opposite. So |
