Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy involving a charge and a conducting sphere. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

Alright, the setup is a charge q placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different formulas.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges, the conductor's properties are important. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, electrons can move freely, and any excess charge on it would reside on the surface. Oh right, but if it's grounded, it's at zero potential, so any charge induced on it would adjust accordingly.

The charge q is placed near the sphere. I think the induced charges on the sphere will affect the potential energy. Also, the potential energy usually involves the work done to bring charges together.

But wait, the sphere is grounded, so it can draw electrons from the ground or push them away. So placing a positive charge q near it would induce negative charges on the near side and positive on the far side, but since the sphere is conducting, the induced charges will redistribute. But because it's grounded, the potential of the sphere is zero, so any induced charge would adjust to keep the potential at zero. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the sphere's potential is the same as the ground, which is zero.

So when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere, the sphere's surface will have induced charges. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the induced charges
