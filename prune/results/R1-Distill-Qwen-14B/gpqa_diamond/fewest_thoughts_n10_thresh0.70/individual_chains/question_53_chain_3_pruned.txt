Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully and figure it out step by step.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The given data includes FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, the FTIR shows absorption peaks for an ester group. Esters typically have a strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹ due to the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Also, esters have absorption from the O-C-O stretching around 1250-1050 cm⁻¹. So the compound has an ester functional group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. There are six signals:

1. Two aromatic protons signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substitution pattern affects the splitting. For a para substitution, each aromatic proton might be equivalent, but if it's ortho or meta, they could be different. Wait, but the question says two signals for aromatic H. So maybe it's a 1,2-disubstitution (ortho) or 1,4 (para), but in either case, the aromatic protons would split into two sets. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ring where each substituent leads to two distinct sets of aromatic protons. Hmm, not sure yet.

2. Two vinyl protons: One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically from a double bond, maybe an ester group, as esters often have adjacent vinyl groups. Wait, esters have R-O-C-O-R, but the vinyl part might be part of a substituent attached to the ring.

Wait, let me think: the ester group is O-C-O, but if the ester is part of a substituent on the ring, like a benzyl ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe the substituents on the ring include an ester group attached with a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the compound has a substituent that's an ester with a vinyl group. For example, maybe it's something like a phenyl group attached to an ester, which is attached to a vinyl group. Or perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group.

Alternatively, the aromatic ring is substituted with an ester group and another group, such as a methyl group or another substituent. But let's look more at the NMR.

The NMR has two vinyl H signals. One is a doublet, which suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. The other is a doublet of quartets, which is more complex. Maybe that's from coupling with two different sets of protons.

Also, the NMR shows two signals for -CH3 groups. So two different methyl groups. No signals for -CH2 groups. So the compound doesn't have any methylene groups.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituents on the aromatic ring are groups that contribute to the NMR signals. Let's think about possible structures.

If the molecule is a di-substituted benzene with two ester groups, but wait, ester groups are typically O-linked. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is
