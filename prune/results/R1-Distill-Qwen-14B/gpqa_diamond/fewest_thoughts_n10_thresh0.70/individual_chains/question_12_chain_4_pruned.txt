Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. 

The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. The pion is stationary, which probably means it's not moving initially. The rest masses are given: the pion has 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but what about the neutrino? Oh, right, neutrinos are super light, almost massless. So for this problem, maybe we can consider the neutrino's mass as zero. That would simplify things a lot.

So, the pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Since the pion isn't moving, the total momentum before decay is zero, so the total after must also be zero. So, the muon and neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with momenta that cancel each other out.

Wait, but how does that help me find the kinetic energy? Hmm. I remember that in such decay processes, the energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. 

The decay products are the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so it's treated as zero. 

So, the total energy after decay should equal the total energy before decay. So, the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino must equal 139.6 MeV.

But wait, the pion's rest energy is all the energy available, right? Because it's at rest, so no kinetic energy. So, the muon and neutrino share this energy.

But how do I distribute the energy between them? Oh, right, because momentum is conserved. So, their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p, then the neutrino's momentum is -p. But since the neutrino's mass is zero, its energy is just the magnitude of its momentum times c squared, but in particle physics, units are often set where c=1, so energy is just p for the neutrino.

Wait, but for the muon, its energy is sqrt(p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4) / c^2? Hmm, maybe I should think in units where c=1 to make calculations easier. So, energy of muon is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), and energy of neutrino is p (since m_nu is zero).

So, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi. 

And the total momentum is p_mu + p_nu. Since p_mu is p in one direction, and p_nu is p in the opposite, adding them gives zero. So, momentum is conserved.

So, the equation to solve is:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Wait, but let me plug in the numbers correctly. So, m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c², and m_pi is 139.6 MeV/c². But in units where c=1, it's just 105.7 and 139.6 MeV.

Hmm, so let me write the equation again:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for p. Let me call the equation as:

sqrt(p² + a²) + p = b, where a is 105.7 and b is 139.6.

Let me
