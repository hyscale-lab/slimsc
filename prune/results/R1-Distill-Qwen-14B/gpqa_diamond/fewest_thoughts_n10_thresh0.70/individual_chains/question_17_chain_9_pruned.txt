Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question says that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions. 

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, tells us how strong the complex is. A high K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much. 

So the formula I think is K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Oh right, the complex is Ca-EDTA, so when it dissociates, it gives Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. 

But in this problem, we're only given the concentration of the complex. The solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So initially, I suppose that the concentration of CaEDTA is 0.02 M. But some of it will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA. 

But wait, if the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, and assuming that the EDTA is in excess, then the free EDTA concentration is much higher than the free calcium. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe the problem assumes that the EDTA is in excess, so that the concentration of free EDTA is approximately equal to the initial concentration minus
