Okay, so I'm looking at this chemistry problem, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, the question gives me a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Wait, let me think. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed through a reaction where EDTA (which is usually in the H4Y form) binds Ca²+ ions to form the complex.

So the reaction would be something like: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The formation constant, K, is given by K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but EDTA has multiple protons, right? Its form depends on the pH. Oh, but the question says the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that. Maybe the problem assumes that all the EDTA is in the form that can form the complex, so I don't need to consider different species of EDTA like HEDTA or Y^4-.

Wait, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me think about the dissociation of this complex. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So the initial concentration is 0.02 M for the complex. Let's say x is the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, assuming the dissociation is x. Because each mole of complex gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

So the formation constant K is 5e10 = (0.02 - x)/(x^2) approximately, because at such a high K, the dissociation x would be very small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So substituting
