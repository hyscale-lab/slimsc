Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let me read through it again.

The question says we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We're diluting it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different pH values. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down into steps. First, I think I need to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Then, when titrated with NaOH, I'll need to calculate the pH at 25% of the equivalence point and at the equivalence point itself.

So, step one: dilution. The initial volume is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the concentration after dilution is (M1V1)/(V2) = (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L. Let me compute that. 0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001, divided by 0.04 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when it's diluted, it dissociates more, but for initial calculations, the concentration after dilution is correct as 0.025 M. Because the dilution doesn't affect the dissociation until we consider it in the buffer solution later.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So, the NaOH will convert some of the acetic acid into its conjugate base, acetate ion.

We need to find the pH at 25% titration. That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So, first, let's find out how much acetic acid is present initially after dilution.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: M = 0.025 M, volume 0.04 L. Moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

25% titrated means 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added. So, the moles of CH3COOH that have reacted is 0.00025 mol. Therefore, the moles of CH3COOH remaining are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 mol.

Since the volume changes during titration, though. Wait, but at 25% titration, how much volume has been added? Hmm, maybe I can compute the volume of NaOH added, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of moles and then calculate the concentrations in the new solution.

Wait, when you add V mL of NaOH, the total volume is the initial solution (40 mL) plus the added NaOH volume. But I might need to
