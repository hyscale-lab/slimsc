Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? So I think Grubbs is a type of transition metal catalyst, maybe Ruthenium-based.

The question says it's racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. So the molecule has a chiral center, and it's all the possible combinations. But when it undergoes a reaction, does the stereochemistry matter? Or does it not because the reaction might not involve the chiral center?

So the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene: let's draw that. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at the first carbon. So it's CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH₃)₂? Wait, no. Wait, pent has five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂? No, wait, no. Wait, the formula is CH₂=CH–CH(CH₂CH₂?) Wait, perhaps I should better think about the structure.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₃. But 3-methyl would add a methyl group on carbon 3. So, the structure is CH₂=CH–C(CH3)H–CH₂CH3? No, wait. Let me count: the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then C3 has a methyl group. So structure is CH₂=CH–CH(CH3)–CH₂CH3? Wait, but that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene.

So the molecule is CH₂=CH–CH(CH3)–CH₂CH3. Wait, wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons. If it's 3-methyl, then the substituent is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH–CH(CH3)–CH₂ something. Wait, perhaps it's CH₂=CH–CH(CH3)–CH2–, but that's four carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.
