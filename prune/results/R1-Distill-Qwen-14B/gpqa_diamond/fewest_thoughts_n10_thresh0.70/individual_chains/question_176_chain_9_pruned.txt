Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again carefully.

The problem states that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector, does it? Because in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented by unit vectors. Let me check the magnitude. The components are -1, 2, and 1. The square of the magnitude would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the magnitude is sqrt(6). But wait, for a state vector, it's supposed to have a magnitude of 1. So perhaps the state is given as a vector, and I should normalize it first. So the normalized state would be ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T. I should keep that in mind.

Next, the operators for two observables, P and Q, are given. Operator P's matrix is:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Wait, that's a 3x3 matrix. Operator Q's matrix is:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1.

So Q is a diagonal matrix, with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. Hmm, because the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues for each basis vector.

The question is: If someone measures Q just after measuring P, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q?

Wait, no, no, the wording is: "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So the measurements are done in the order P first, then Q. Or wait, noâ€”wait, the order is "just after the measurement of P", so I think the
