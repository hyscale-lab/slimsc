Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and its proper lifetime is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution needed in the Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy of the particles in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are A to D, each with different resolutions.

Wait, right. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber's frame) would be longer due to time dilation. So the observed lifetime τ is gamma times τ₀, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

But wait, the question is about the minimum resolution needed. I think that refers to the time resolution. Because to observe the decay, the experiment needs to measure the time difference between the particle's production and its decay. But if the decay happens too quickly, the detector might not catch it unless it's got a good enough time resolution.

Wait no, maybe it's the spatial resolution. Oh, wait, no, because the problem is about the Bubble Chamber, which is a detector that can track the path of charged particles. So perhaps the resolution refers to the ability to distinguish the decay point from the production point. If the particle moves a small distance before decaying, the chamber must have a good spatial resolution to see that.

But how does that relate to the lifetime? Oh right, the particle's lifetime determines how far it travels before decaying. The distance it travels is velocity multiplied by the lifetime. So the proper lifetime is τ₀, but in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so the distance is larger.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Oh, so perhaps we need to find the distance the particle travels before decaying in the lab frame, and the resolution must be such that it can detect this distance with a certain efficiency.

Wait, what's the formula here. I think the number of particles that decay within a certain time is given by the decay law. The probability P that a particle decays before time t is 1 - exp(-t/τ). So if τ is the mean lifetime, then t needs to be at least such that P is 30% (0.3).

Wait, but wait, the time observed in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime. So the mean lifetime in the lab is τ = gamma * τ₀. So the average distance a particle would travel before decaying is L = v * τ.

Wait, but the speed v of the particle can be determined from its energy. Because the particle is moving at high energy, we can calculate gamma from its energy.

The energy E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be E / m, assuming that the particle is moving relativistically and that its energy is much larger than its rest mass (which is the case here, since 27 is much bigger than 3.41). Wait, but wait, actually, the total energy E is gamma * m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But since we're working in units where c is 1 (like GeV and GeV/c²), gamma would just be E/m.

So gamma = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.9179 (approx 7.918). So the mean lab frame lifetime τ is gamma * τ₀. So τ = 7.918 * 8e-16 s ≈ 6.3344e-15 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the proper lifetime is τ₀, which is the mean lifetime in the rest frame. So the lab frame lifetime is γτ₀. So the average lifetime is longer by gamma.

So the average distance L that the particle travels before decaying is v multiplied by τ. But v is approximately c for high-energy particles. So L ≈ c * τ = c * γ τ₀.

Calculating that. Let's compute c * gamma * tau_0.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

gamma is about 7.918 as above.

tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L ≈ 3e8 m/s * 7.918 * 8e-16 s.

Let me compute that step by step.

3e8 * 8e-16 = 24e-8.

Multiply by 7.918: 24e-8 * 7.918 ≈ 190e-8 meters. Wait, 24 *7.918 is about 190, so 190e-8 m is 1.9e-6 meters, right? Because 190e-8 is 1.9e-6 m.

Wait, wait. Let me compute 3e8 * 8e-16:

3e8 = 3 * 1e8.

8e-16 = 8 * 1e-16.

So 3 *8 =24, and 1e8 *1e-16 =1e-8. So 24e-8.

Then 24e-8 * 7.918 → 24 *7.918 = approximately 190. So 190e-8 m.

190e-8 meters is 1.9e-6 meters. Because 190e-8 = 1.9e-6 (since 1e-6 is 1 microsecond, but here it's meters).

So the average decay length is about 1.9e-6 meters. But the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.

Wait, the number of decays observed depends on whether the decay is detected within the resolution. So the decay length is the average distance, but to detect 30% of the decays, we need a resolution that captures a certain fraction.

Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution refers to the distance over which the decay can be observed. So if the distance is too small, the chamber's resolution must be good enough to detect it.

Wait, but another approach: the decay length L is the average distance, but the actual distance can vary. The probability that a decay occurs within a certain distance x is 1 - exp(-x/(c τ₀ gamma)).

Wait, no: time t is gamma tau_0 times (1/gamma) since the lab frame sees tau_lab = gamma tau_0. So the decay probability is 1 - exp(-t/(tau_lab)).

Wait, but the distance is x = v t. Since t = x/(v). Tau_lab is gamma tau_0.

So the probability that the decay occurs before time t is P = 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau_0)).

But t = x / v, and v ≈ c.

So P = 1 - exp(-x/(c gamma tau_0)).

We want P to be 0.3, so 0.3 = 1 - exp(-x/(c gamma tau_0)).

Which implies that exp(-x/(c gamma tau_0)) = 0.7.

Take natural log: -x/(c gamma tau_0) = ln(0.7).

So x = - c gamma tau_0 * ln(0.7).

Compute ln(0.7): approximately ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667.

So x ≈ c gamma tau_0 * 0.35667.

Compute c * gamma * tau_0: as before, 3e8 m/s * 7.918 * 8e-16 s.

Wait, that's the same as before.

Wait, 3e8 *8e-16 = 24e-8.

24e-8 *7.918 = 190e-8 m.

So x ≈ 190e-8 m * 0.35667 ≈ around 67.76e-8 m.

Wait, 190e-8 is 1.9e-6 m. 1.9e-6 * 0.35667 ≈ approx 6.776e-7 m, which is 6.776e-7 m.

But wait, the question is about the minimum resolution. Hmm. Wait, the resolution is the ability to distinguish the decay point, so perhaps it's the distance that the particle travels, and the resolution needs to be less than that to capture a certain fraction.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The average decay length is about 1.9e-6 m. But to have 30% of the decays observed, the minimum resolution needed would be the length corresponding to when 30% of the particles have decayed. So that would correspond to the x where P=0.3.

Wait, as I calculated before, x is roughly 6.776e-7 m, about 0.6776e-6 m. But none of the options match that. Wait, the options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D) 2.08e-3 m.

Hmm, my calculation gives about 6.7e-7 m, which is 0.67e-6 m, but the options have 2.08e-6 m as option A. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me redo the calculation.

First, compute gamma: E = 27 GeV, mass m =3.41 GeV.

Gamma = E / m = 27 /3.41 ≈ let's compute that precisely.

3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 3.41*8=27.28. So 27 is between 7 and 8 times 3.41. Let's compute 27 /3.41.

3.41 *7.917 = approx 27.

Compute 3.41 *7.917:

3 *7.917 = 23.751

0.41 *7.917 ≈ approx 3.245.

Total is 23.751 +3.245 = 26.996 ≈27. So gamma is about 7.917.

Then, tau_lab = gamma tau_0 =7.917 *8e-16= 63.336e-16 s.

c is about 3e8 m/s.

So the distance x is c * tau_lab.

x=3e8 m/s *63.336e-16 s.

Calculate that: 3e8 *63.336e-16 = (3 *63.336) *1e8 *1e-16.

3*63.336 is about 190.008.

So 190.008e-8 m. 190e-8 m is 1.9e-6 m.

So x is about 1.9e-6 meters.

Wait, but that's the average distance. So for 30% of the particles, the distance should be shorter than x_30% where P=0.3.

Earlier, I found that x_30% = c gamma tau_0 * (-ln(1-0.3)).

Wait, no. Let me get the formula right.

The probability that a decay happens before time t is:

P = 1 - exp( -t / tau_lab )

But tau_lab = gamma tau_0.

t is the time, so x = v t. v ≈c, so t =x/c.

So P = 1 - exp( -x/(c tau_lab) )

= 1 - exp(-x/(c gamma tau_0)).

We set P=0.3:

0.3 = 1 - exp( -x/(c gamma tau_0) )

=> exp( -x/(c gamma tau_0) ) = 0.7

Take natural logarithm:

-x/(c gamma tau_0) = ln(0.7) ≈-0.35667.

So x= c gamma tau_0 * 0.35667.

c gamma tau_0 =3e8 m/s *7.917 *8e-16 s.

Wait, 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8.

24e-8 *7.917 ≈ 190e-8 m.

So x = 190e-8 m *0.35667 ≈ 67.76e-8 m =6.776e-7 m.

Hmm, which is about 6.78e-7 m, or 0.678e-6 m.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option A:2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the proper lifetime is tau_0, so the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0. The average distance is c * gamma tau_0. But that's the mean. So 30% corresponds to a certain multiple of the mean?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the minimum distance that the chamber can resolve such that at least 30% of the decays are within that distance. So the minimum x such that P(x) >=0.3.

So the x we calculated earlier, 6.78e-7 m, is the distance where 30% of the particles have decayed. So the resolution needs to be at least that for 30% to be captured. But the options are all multiples of 2.08e-6, etc.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is using beta gamma tau_0 c, which is the same as x= beta gamma c tau_0.

Wait, but beta is v/c. Since gamma is much larger than 1, beta is approximately 1. So x ~ gamma c tau_0.

Which is what I computed before.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me recalculate gamma.

Gamma = E/(m c²) = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV) = 27 /3.41.

Wait, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 3.41*7.9= 3.41*7=23.87 + 3.41*0.9=3.069 → 26.939.

3.41 *7.917= (3.41 *7.9)=26.939 +3.41*0.017= approx 0.05797 → 26.939+0.05797=26.99697, which is about 27. So gamma is approximately 7.917.

Now, tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 =7.917 *8e-16=63.336e-16 seconds.

The average distance is x_avg = c * tau_lab.

c is 3e8 m/s.

x_avg =3e8 *63.336e-16 = (3 *63.336) *1e8 *1e-16.

3 *63.336=190.008.

So 190.008e-8 m = 1.90008e-6 m.

So x_avg is about 1.9e-6 m.

But the question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So the distance where 30% of the decays have occurred is less than the average. Because the average is 70% (since 1-e^(-1)=0.632, wait no, wait, no, the average is when P=0.632 at x=x_avg.

Wait, let me think. The average decay length is x_avg = c * gamma tau_0.

At x= x_avg, the probability P is 1 - exp(-x_avg/(c gamma tau_0 )) → 1 - exp(-1)≈ 0.632. So 63.2% of the particles have decayed before traveling x_avg.

So to capture at least 30% of decays, we don't need to wait until 63.2% have decayed. We can have a lower x where P=0.3.

So according to the earlier calculation, x_30%≈0.677e-6 m. But the options have 2.08e-6 m as option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the calculation again.

x_30% = c gamma tau_0 * ln(1/(1-0.3)).

Wait, since P=1 - exp(-x/(c gamma tau_0 )) =0.3 → exp(-x/(c gamma tau_0 )) =0.7 → x= (c gamma tau_0) * (- ln(0.7)).

ln(0.7)=approx -0.35667.

So x = c gamma tau_0 * 0.35667.

Compute c gamma tau_0:

c=3e8 m/s.

gamma tau_0= 7.917 *8e-16 s=63.336e-16 s.

So c gamma tau_0=3e8 *63.336e-16=1.90008e-6 m.

Multiply by 0.35667: 1.90008e-6 *0.35667 ≈6.776e-7 m=0.6776e-6 m.

But none of the options match this. The options are 2.08e-6, 2.08e-9, etc.

Wait, maybe I messed up a calculation. Let me compute 27 /3.41 exactly.

27 divided by 3.41:

3.41 goes into 27 how many times?

3.41 *7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.41 goes into 3.13 about 0.917 times (since 3.41 *0.9=3.069, 3.41*0.017=0.05797; 3.069+0.05797=3.12697).

So 7.917 is correct.

Now, c gamma tau_0 =3e8 m/s *7.917 *8e-16 s.

3e8 =3*1e8.

8e-16=8*1e-16.

Multiply 3*8=24, and 1e8 *1e-16 = 1e-8.

So 24e-8 =2.4e-7.

Multiply by 7.917: 2.4e-7 *7.917 ≈1.900e-6 m.

So x_30% ≈1.9e-6 *0.35667 ≈6.776e-7 m.

Hmm, that's about 6.78e-7 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the time resolution but the spatial resolution. Wait, but the Bubble Chamber's resolution is about detecting the decay vertex, so it's a spatial resolution.

Wait, but the decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. So if the chamber can't resolve distances smaller than a certain value, it won't see the decay. The minimum resolution needed would be the maximum distance that the particle travels before decaying, such that at least 30% of the particles are detected.

Wait, but no, to detect 30% of the decays, you need to have a resolution good enough to see when they decay. So the minimum resolution R should be such that the probability of the decay occurring within R is at least 30%.

So R is the distance where P(R)=0.3.

From our earlier calculation, R is about 6.7e-7 m. But none of the options are near that.

Wait, looking at the options, the closest is A)2.08e-6 m. But 2e-6 is about 3 times larger than our value.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should compute x as c * tau_0 * gamma * (1 - e^{-something})?

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity beta gamma tau_0 c.

Wait, the velocity beta is v/c, and for high gamma, beta is approx 1.

So x = beta gamma c tau_0.

But beta is v/c, and gamma = (1 - beta²)⁻½.

Wait, but for high energies, beta ≈1, so gamma is E/(m c²) =27 /3.41 ≈7.917.

So x= beta gamma c tau_0 ≈ c gamma tau_0.

Which brings us back to the same value.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the speed and the time.

Wait, the lifetime is tau_0=8e-16 s. The particle's speed is v= beta c, where beta is v/c.

The time experienced in the lab frame is longer by gamma, so t=gamma tau_0.

The distance it travels is v t= beta c gamma tau_0.

But in our earlier calculation, beta is approx 1, so that's same as c gamma tau_0.

So that's the same as before.

Wait, maybe an alternative approach: the mean lifetime in the lab is gamma tau_0, so the mean path is c gamma tau_0.

To get at least 30% of the decays, the minimum path is when the decay probability is 30%, which as we saw is about 0.35667 times the mean path.

So R =0.35667 * mean path.

Mean path is 1.9e-6 m.

So R=0.35667 *1.9e-6= approx 6.776e-7 m.

But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, wait. Let me check the calculation for gamma again.

Gamma is E/(m c²) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV) =27/3.41=7.9179.

Ok.

Then, tau_lab=gamma tau_0=7.9179 *8e-16=63.343e-16 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So the mean path is 3e8 m/s *63.343e-16 s= approx 1.9003e-6 m.

So this is the mean decay length. Now, 30% of the decays would have a shorter path.

We found that x_30%≈(1.9e-6 m) *0.35667≈6.77e-7 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is actually about the minimum path length such that 30% of the particles decay beyond that length. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking what is the minimum possible path length that would allow us to see at least 30% of the decays.

Wait, perhaps the question is the other way around: we can only see the decay if the path length is longer than a certain value, beyond which we can't resolve the decay. So the minimum resolution needed is the path length where 30% of decays are beyond that. But that seems opposite.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the options.

Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers.

Our calculation for the mean path is about 1.9e-6 m. So 2.08 is about 10% longer than that.

Wait, how does that relate to 30% of the decays?

Wait, maybe the minimum resolution required is the mean decay length, because you can't resolve decays that are shorter than that. But our calculation is 1.9e-6 m, so the closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

But why 2.08e-6? Let me compute 2.08e-6 m in terms of the variables.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute c gamma tau_0 again.

c gamma tau_0=3e8 m/s *7.917 *8e-16 s.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8.

24e-8 *7.917= 24 *7.917 = 190.008 → 190.008e-8 m=1.90008e-6 m.

Hmm, 1.9e-6 m is 1.9 micrometers.

Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers.

Hmm, perhaps a miscalculation in gamma.

Wait, wait. Let me compute gamma again.

E =27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

Gamma = E/(m c²) =27/(3.41) → let me compute 27 divided by 3.41 with more precision.

3.41 ×7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.41 ×0.9=3.069 → 3.41×0.91=3.069 +0.0341=3.1031.

So 7.91 gives 27-3.1031=23.8969.

Wait, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I should compute 27/3.41.

Method: 3.41 ×7.917=?

7 ×3.41=23.87.

0.917 ×3.41= let's compute 0.9 ×3.41=3.069; 0.017 ×3.41=0.05797.

So 3.069 +0.05797=3.12697.

Total gamma=7.917 ×3.41=23.87 +3.12697=26.99697, which is approximately 27. So gamma= approx7.917.

Alternative approach: 27/3.41= approximately 7.9179.

So gamma=7.9179.

Then, tau_lab=7.9179 *8e-16=63.3432e-16 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

x= c tau_lab=3e8 *63.3432e-16= (3e8)(6.33432e-15) = (3 *6.33432) *1e-7.

3*6.33432=18.99996.

So x=18.99996e-7=1.899996e-6 m, which is 1.9e-6 m.

So x is about 1.9e-6 m.

Wait, but the options have 2.08e-6 m as option A. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the distance using beta instead of c. Because beta is v/c, and maybe I shouldn't have approximated beta as 1.

Wait, but for a particle with gamma=7.917, what is beta?

Beta can be found from gamma =1/sqrt(1-beta²).

Gamma squared is (7.917)^2≈62.68.

So 1/(1-beta²)=62.68 → 1-beta²=1/62.68≈0.01595.

So beta²=1-0.01595=0.98405 → beta=sqrt(0.98405)=approx 0.992.

So beta is about 0.992.

So x=beta gamma c tau_0.

Wait, wait, no. Because tau_lab=gamma tau_0, and x= beta c tau_lab.

So x=beta c gamma tau_0.

= beta * 3e8 m/s *7.917 *8e-16 s.

Compute that:

beta=0.992.

Compute 3e8 *7.917 *8e-16 *0.992.

First, 3e8 *8e-16=24e-8.

24e-8 *7.917=190.008e-8.

190.008e-8 *0.992 ≈189.6e-8 m.

Which is 1.896e-6 m, which is about 1.9e-6 m again.

So no difference in this case.

Hmm, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the options don't have 1.9e-6. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m, which is about 10% larger than our calculated value.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum time resolution needed to measure the decay, which would be the time it takes for the particle to decay in the lab frame. Because the time resolution must be good enough to measure the decay within a certain time.

Wait, but the problem says 'minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays'. So perhaps it's the time resolution, not spatial.

Wait, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0 =63.336e-16 s.

The time resolution delta_t must be such that the probability of the decay being observed is at least 30%.

So, the probability that the decay occurs within delta_t is P=1 - exp(-delta_t/(gamma tau_0)).

Set P=0.3.

1 - exp(-delta_t/(gamma tau_0))=0.3 → exp(-delta_t/(gamma tau_0))=0.7 → delta_t/(gamma tau_0) = -ln(0.7) ≈0.35667.

So delta_t=0.35667 * gamma tau_0.

Gamma tau_0=63.336e-16 s.

delta_t=63.336e-16 *0.35667 ≈22.6e-16 s.

But the question is about the spatial resolution, which is the distance. Wait, but the question states 'minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays', and it's in the context of the Bubble Chamber. So the spatial resolution refers to the ability to detect the decay point, which depends on the decay length.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the decay length in micrometers. Because 1.9e-6 m is 1.9 micrometers. Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps the question expects us to compute using the mean lifetime and then find 30% of that. But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to compute the decay length as gamma * c * tau_0, which is 7.917 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Wait, let me compute that:

7.917 *3e8 =2.3751e9.

2.3751e9 *8e-16 =1.9e-6 m.

Same as before.

So perhaps the intended answer is A)2.08e-6 m.

Wait, where does 2.08 come from? Let me compute 27 /3.41.

Wait, 3.41 *7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41= approx 0.917.

So gamma=7.917.

But perhaps the exact value is 7.917.

Wait, 7.917 *8e-16=63.336e-16 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

x=3e8 *63.336e-16 =1.90008e-6 m.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question intended to use 30% as the mean, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the formula.

Wait, another formula approach: the number of particles that decay within a certain time is N= N0 (1-e^{-t/tau}).

We want to find t such that N=0.3 N0.

So t= tau * ln(1/(1-0.3))=tau * ln(1/0.7)=tau * 0.35667.

tau is gamma tau_0.

So t=gamma tau_0 *0.35667.

The spatial resolution needed is x= c t.

So x= c * gamma tau_0 *0.35667.

Which is the same as before.

So x=3e8 m/s *7.917 *8e-16 s *0.35667.

Compute step by step.

3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8.

24e-8 *7.917=190.008e-8.

190.008e-8 *0.35667= approx 67.76e-8 m=6.776e-7 m.

Hmm, same as before.

So perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the energy is 27 GeV per particle, but I used the total energy. But if the decay products are each 27 GeV, that might change things, but that doesn't make sense because X⁰ would have higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to compute the speed beta as (gamma^2 -1)^½ / gamma.

Wait, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Gamma=7.917.

1/gamma²=1/(62.68)= approx 0.01595.

So beta= sqrt(1-0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405)= approx 0.992.

Which is what I calculated before.

So beta is 0.992.

So x=beta * gamma *c tau_0.

Wait, beta *gamma =0.992 *7.917≈7.837.

So x=7.837 * c tau_0.

c tau_0=3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.4e-7 m.

x=7.837 *2.4e-7=1.88e-6 m.

Hmm, same as before.

I'm really not seeing where 2.08e-6 comes from.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is in terms of the mean path for 30% of the particles. Let me compute 30% of 1.9e-6 m.

30% is 0.57e-6 m, which is 5.7e-7 m. Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, maybe the calculation is about the minimum number of particles detected, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the minimum number of particles that decay within a certain distance, but the resolution is about the ability to distinguish the decay point. So perhaps the minimum detectable distance is the one where the decay is 30% probable. So the resolution must be at least that.

But then again, that brings us back to 6.7e-7 m, which isn't an option.

Wait, wait. Let me compute 2.08e-6.

What is 2.08e-6 m in terms of our variables?

2.08e-6 m =2.08 micrometers.

So in terms of x= c gamma tau_0 * factor.

What factor would give us 2.08e-6.

We have:

2.08e-6 = (3e8 m/s *7.917 *8e-16 s) * factor.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8.

24e-8 *7.917=190.008e-8=1.90008e-6.

So 2.08e-6=1.90008e-6 * factor.

Factor=2.08e-6 /1.90008e-6≈1.0947.

So factor is about 1.0947.

So what's the significance of 1.0947 in the formula?

Earlier, we had x= c gamma tau_0 *0.35667.

If x=1.0947 * mean x, then 0.35667 *1.0947=0.3905.

So P=1 - exp(-x/(c gamma tau_0 ))=1 - exp(-0.3905)=1 -0.675=0.325. So about 32.5% of decays.

But our target was 30%, so perhaps the factor is slightly less.

Hmm, but this doesn't help much.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the speed beta, then find the decay length.

But I've tried that already.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Wait, no, because the problem states 'the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV', which I assume is the total energy.

But if it's the kinetic energy, then the total energy would be E_kinetic=K=27 GeV, so E_total=K + m c²=27 +3.41=30.41 GeV.

Then gamma would be E_total/m=30.41/3.41≈8.906.

Then, gamma tau_0=8.906 *8e-16=7.1248e-15 s.

x= c * gamma tau_0=3e8 *7.1248e-15=2.1374e-6 m=2.1374e-6 m.

Which is approximately 2.14e-6 m, which is close to option A)2.08e-6 m.

Ah! This must be it. So perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Oh, I think I made that mistake earlier.

So, the initial assumption was that the energy E is the total energy, but perhaps it's the kinetic energy.

Let me re-calculate with E= K=27 GeV.

So E_total= K + m c²=27 +3.41=30.41 GeV.

Gamma =E_total /m c²=30.41/3.41≈8.906.

Then, tau_lab= gamma tau_0=8.906 *8e-16=7.1248e-15 s.

x= c tau_lab=3e8 m/s *7.1248e-15 s=2.13744e-6 m=2.1374e-6 m.

Which is approximately 2.14e-6 m.

Which is very close to option A)2.08e-6 m.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

In that case, the answer would be approximately 2.14e-6 m, but the option is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation would give 2.08e-6.

Wait, let's compute gamma more accurately.

E_total=27 +3.41=30.41 GeV.

Gamma=30.41 /3.41= let's compute 30.41 /3.41.

3.41 ×8=27.28.

30.41-27.28=3.13.

3.13 /3.41= approx 0.917.

So gamma=8.917.

So tau_lab=8.917 *8e-16=7.1336e-15 s.

x=3e8 *7.1336e-15=2.14008e-6 m.

Hmm, so 2.14e-6 m.

But option A is 2.08e-6.

Wait, perhaps the question intended the energy to be the kinetic. So the correct answer would be around 2.14e-6 m, but the option is 2.08e-6.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the energy as total energy, but with a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption was correct, and the intended answer is A)2.08e-6, which is approximately the mean decay length when E is the total energy.

Wait, earlier, when considering E as the total energy, the mean decay length is 1.9e-6 m. So 2.08e-6 is about 10% longer. Why?

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the speed of light as 3e8 m/s, but perhaps a more precise value is 2.998e8 m/s. But that would only change the result by about 0.6%, which is not enough to account for the difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as using the velocity as (gamma^2-1)^(1/2)/gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta correctly.

Beta= sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

With gamma=7.917,

beta= sqrt(1 - (1/(7.917)^2 )) = sqrt(1 - 1/62.68) = sqrt(61.68/62.68)= sqrt(0.9839)=0.99195.

So beta=0.99195.

Then x= beta * c * tau_lab =0.99195 *3e8 *63.336e-16.

Compute 3e8 *63.336e-16=1.90008e-6.

Multiply by 0.99195: 1.90008e-6 *0.99195≈1.885e-6 m.

Still, the same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic relation for the lifetime as tau_lab=gamma tau_0, but then the distance is beta c tau_lab.

Wait, that's the same as beta gamma c tau_0.

Which we've computed as approximately 1.9e-6 m.

So I'm back to the same point.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the minimum time resolution, not the spatial resolution. But the question states 'minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays', and it's about the Bubble Chamber, which is a spatial detector.

So, I'm confident that the correct calculation leads to 1.9e-6 m, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, I think I see a possible miscalculation earlier. Let me re-express the problem.

Given:

tau_0=8e-16 s.

E=27 GeV.

m=3.41 GeV.

Assuming E is the kinetic energy.

So,

E_total = K + m c² =27 +3.41 =30.41 GeV.

Gamma = E_total/(m c²) =30.41 /3.41=8.917.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2))=sqrt(1 -1/(8.917^2))=sqrt(1-1/79.5)=sqrt(78.5/79.5)=sqrt(0.987)=0.9935.

So beta=0.9935.

Tau_lab=gamma tau_0=8.917 *8e-16=7.1336e-15 s.

x=beta c tau_lab =0.9935 *3e8 *7.1336e-15.

Compute:

3e8 *7.1336e-15 =2.14008e-6.

Multiply by 0.9935: 2.14008e-6 *0.9935≈2.126e-6 m.

Which is about 2.126e-6 m, which is close to 2.13e-6 m.

But the option is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation without considering the exact value of beta, perhaps using beta≈1.

So with beta=1, then x=gamma c tau_0=8.917 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute:

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8.

24e-8 *8.917=214e-8=2.14e-6 m.

Which is 2.14e-6 m, close to option A.

But the option is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using relativistic time dilation and length contraction.

Wait, no, because length contraction applies to the proper frame. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the proper time for the calculation, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the intended answer is option A)2.08e-6 m, and perhaps the calculation expects us to compute gamma as 7.917 without considering the possibility that the energy is kinetic. So my initial approach leads to 1.9e-6 m, but the option isn't present. So perhaps I made a mistake, and the correct approach is to consider the energy as kinetic, leading to option A.

But why does the calculation give 2.14e-6 m, but the option is 2.08e-6 m? Maybe I should recompute with exact values.

Let me compute gamma when E is the kinetic energy.

E_total=27 +3.41=30.41 GeV.

Gamma=30.41/3.41=8.917.

Tau_lab=8.917 *8e-16=7.1336e-15 s.

x=beta c tau_lab.

Beta= sqrt(1-(1/gamma^2))=sqrt(1-1/(8.917)^2)=sqrt(1-1/79.5)=sqrt(78.5/79.5)=sqrt(0.987)=approx0.99345.

So x=0.99345 *3e8 *7.1336e-15.

Compute:

3e8 *7.1336e-15=2.14008e-6 m.

Multiply by 0.99345: 2.14008e-6 *0.99345≈2.13e-6 m.

So 2.13e-6 m.

Hmm, but the option is 2.08e-6 m. Perhaps the correct approach is to take gamma as 7.918 and beta as 0.992, which gives x=1.9e-6 m.

But I'm not seeing how to get 2.08e-6.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the speed of light as 3e8 m/s, but actually c is 2.9979e8 m/s. So perhaps using a more precise c would change the result.

Let me compute with c=2.9979e8 m/s.

With gamma=7.917, then x= beta gamma c tau_0.

beta=0.992.

So x=0.992 *7.917 *2.9979e8 *8e-16.

Compute:

7.917 *2.9979e8= approx 23.72e8.

23.72e8 *8e-16=1.8976e-7.

Multiply by 0.992: 1.8976e-7 *0.992≈1.883e-7 m=1.883e-7 m=0.1883e-6 m, which is 0.1883 micrometers.

Wait, that can't be right. Because earlier calculations with c=3e8 gave 1.9e-6 m. Using a more precise c would lower the result, not raise it.

Wait, perhaps I have a miscalculation again.

Wait,

x= beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

gamma=7.917, beta=0.992.

c=2.9979e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So x=0.992 *7.917 *2.9979e8 *8e-16.

Compute step by step:

7.917 *2.9979e8= approx 7.917 *3e8=2.3751e9.

2.3751e9 *8e-16=1.9e-6.

0.992 *1.9e-6=1.8848e-6 m.

So 1.8848e-6 m, which is 1.88e-6 m.

Still not matching option A.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. I think I've spent enough time trying to figure this out. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be around 1.9e-6 m, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is A)2.08e-6 m, which could be a result of using more precise values or considering the energy as kinetic.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the decay length as gamma * c * tau_0, without considering beta, which would give 7.917 *3e8 *8e-16=1.9e-6 m.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process \( X^0 \rightarrow Y^+ Z^- \) with a proper lifetime \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \). The energy of the particle in the Bubble Chamber is \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \). The resolution refers to the spatial resolution required to detect the decay vertex, which depends on the decay length.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:  
   The lifetime in the lab frame is extended due to time dilation:
   \[
   \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau_0,
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \). Substituting \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.917.
   \]
   Thus, the lab-frame lifetime is:
   \[
   \tau_{\text{lab}} = 7.917 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Decay Length**:  
   The average distance traveled by the particle before decaying is:
   \[
   L = v \tau_{\text{lab}} \approx c \tau_{\text{lab}},
   \]
   where \( v \approx c \) for high-energy particles. Using \( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:
   \[
   L = 3 \times 10^8 \times 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \approx 1.9 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
   \]

3. **30% Decay Probability**:  
   To observe at least 30% of the decays, the distance \( x \) where the decay occurs must satisfy:
   \[
   P = 1 - e^{-x / (c \tau_{\text{lab}})} = 0.3.
   \]
   Solving for \( x \), we find:
   \[
   x = c \tau_{\text{lab}} \cdot (-\ln(1 - 0.3)) \approx c \tau_{\text{lab}} \cdot 0.35667.
   \]
   Substituting \( c \tau_{\text{lab}} \approx 1.9 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \), we get:
   \[
   x \approx 1.9 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 0.35667 \approx 6.78 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated decay length for 30% of decays is \( x \approx 6.78 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \), which is not directly listed in the options. However, the closest option is \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \) (Option A). This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup, such as considering the energy as kinetic rather than total energy.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the given options, the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is best matched by **Option A: \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)**.

Answer: A
