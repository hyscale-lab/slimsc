Okay, so I need to figure out the structure of product 4 given the series of reactions. Let me start by breaking down each step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize this. So the cyclohexanone ring has a hydroxymethyl group at position 3 and a propargyl (or allyl?) group at position 5. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(CH2)-? No, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-C... No, wait, en is double bond. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C=CH2? No, wait the numbering might be different. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2... Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So it's CH2-CH(CH2... wait, maybe it's better to draw it.

So, the starting molecule is a cyclohexanone with a hydroxymethyl (–CH2OH) group at C3 and a propenyl group (CH2–C=CH2) at C5. Let me make sure: prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2–C(CH2?) Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2–CH–CH2, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So structure is CH2=CH–CH2–? No, wait. The substituent is on C2. Maybe it's CH2–C(CH2–)=CH2? Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of the substituent as CH2–CH2– something, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's move on.

First reaction: treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide to form product 1. Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used as a deprotonating agent. Benzyl bromide is a good alkylating agent. So probably, a substitution or alkylation occurs.
