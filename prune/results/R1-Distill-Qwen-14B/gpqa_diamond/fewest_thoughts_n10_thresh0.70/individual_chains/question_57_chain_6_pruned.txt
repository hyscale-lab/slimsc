Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, elastic scattering... right, that means the electrons don't lose energy, so it's all about their momentum transfer. The question is giving me some phase shifts and asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, so let me think.

The phase shifts are given as δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And we're told to ignore the rest. The energy is 50 MeV electrons. Oh right, the scattering amplitude in the context of partial waves uses these phase shifts. 

I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is calculated using a sum over the partial waves. The general formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ [ (u_l (k) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ) / (1 - e^{-2iδ_l}) ) * (d_l^m (cosθ)) ] for l from 0 to some maximum, and m is the azimuthal angle dependence, but in this case, the question is along the incident beam direction, which I think corresponds to θ=0°, and maybe m=0 since it's along the beam.

Wait, but the problem specifically says along the incident beam direction. Oh right, the incident beam direction would be when the scattering angle θ is 0°, so that's the forward direction. For this case, the Legendre polynomials, which are part of the spherical harmonics, maybe simplify because cosθ is 1. The associated Legendre polynomials d_l^m(1) are zero except when m=0. So perhaps for each l, d_l^0(1) is some value.

But wait, for the partial wave expansion, the amplitude is given by f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [( (u_l (k) ) / (1 - e^{-2iδ_l}) ) e^{2iδ_l} ( (e^{iδ_l} - e^{-iδ_l}) ) * something ) ] Well, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Alternatively, the formula for the amplitude might be f_l(θ) = ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ) / (k (1 - e
