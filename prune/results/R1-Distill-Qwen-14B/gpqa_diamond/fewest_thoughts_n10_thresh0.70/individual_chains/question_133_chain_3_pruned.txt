Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I think is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water. The temperature is 25°C, which probably affects the Kw or Ka values, but I don't think it's necessary here since the K values are provided.

The problem gives the Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 for H3PO4 as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12, respectively. So H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, and it dissociates stepwise.

I remember that the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? No, wait. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but in solution, it can take various forms depending on the pH. The species present would depend on the pKa values.

Wait, but the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So these are the acid and its conjugate base. So KH2PO4 is H2PO4^-, which is the dihydrogen phosphate ion. And Na2HPO4 is Na2(HPO4^2-), so the hydrogen phosphate ion. So this is a buffer solution because we have a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). So the pH of the solution is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation based on the pKa2 of H3PO4.

Wait, what's H3PO4's dissociation? The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1=7.5e-3). The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2=6.2e-
