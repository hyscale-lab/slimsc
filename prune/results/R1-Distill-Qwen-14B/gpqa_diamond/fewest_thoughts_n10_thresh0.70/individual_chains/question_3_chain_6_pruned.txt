Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let's read it again. The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle in a given state. The state is a linear combination of the spin-up and spin-down states, which are eigenstates of σz. The operator given is 10σz +5σx. I need to find the expectation value of this operator.

Wait, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the inner product of the state with the operator acting on the state. So, <ψ|O|ψ>, where O is the operator.

The state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. First, I should check if this state is normalized. Let me see: the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Squaring them: (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. Adding them gives 1, so yes, the state is normalized. Good.

Now, the operator is 10σz +5σx. Since expectation values are linear, I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I just need to find the expectation values of σz and σx separately.

Starting with σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value is straightforward. The matrix form of σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Alternatively, since these are eigenstates, the expectation value is just the coefficient squared times the eigenvalue for each component.

So ψ is a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩. Then, ⟨σz⟩ = |a|^2 * 1 + |b|^2 * (-1). Let me compute that. a is 0.5, so |a|^2 is 0.25. b is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|^2 is 3/4. So 0.25*(1) + (3/4)*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5. Then 10 * ⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Next, find ⟨σx⟩. Oh, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Hmm. The expectation value of σx for a state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩ is a* b* + a b? Wait, no. Let me think. Alternatively, I can compute it as ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

In terms of components, σx swaps the basis states. So, σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩. So, let me compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (
