Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down step by step.

Alright, so the question is about some mixtures and reactions. Let me try to parse each part.

First, there's a mixture X which is equimolar and consists of two liquids. These liquids decolorize bromine water. Hmm, decolorizing bromine usually indicates the presence of double or triple bonds, like alkenes or alkynes, because they can undergo addition reactions with bromine. So the components in X probably have unsaturated bonds.

Next, when X is treated with platinum and heated, a mixture Y is formed. Y is equimolar and made of two other liquids. Importantly, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. That's interesting because if Y doesn't react with bromine, maybe the unsaturation was removed—like hydrogenated. But wait, the question says that Y is formed via disproportionation. Oh, right, so it's a disproportionation reaction. That means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. So for example, something like the decomposition of H2O2 into H2O and O2, but in organic terms, maybe a similar process.

Then, when both X and Y undergo hydrogenation with platinum under severe conditions, they give only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon, and it's a constituent of Y. Also, Z is widely used as a solvent, which makes me think maybe it's something like toluene or something else. Oh wait, but Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so Z must be a saturated compound—so no double or triple bonds anymore.

The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let me calculate that. The mass fraction is (mass of H)/(mass of Z) = 14.28% which is 0.1428. Let me think: for a hydrocarbon with formula CnHm, the fraction is (m * 1)/(12n + m) = 0.1428.

Hmm, let's see. Let's express it as:

(m) / (12n + m) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by denominator:

m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)

Multiply both sides by 10000 to eliminate decimals:

10000m = 1428*(12n +m)
10000m = 1428*12n +1428 m
10000m -1428m = 17136n
8572 m = 17136 n
Dividing both sides by 4: 2143 m = 4284 n

Hmm, maybe I should approximate. Let me think about possible m and n. Or perhaps I can think of 14.28% as 1/7. Because 1/7 is approximately 0.142857. So if the mass fraction is 1/7, then:

m / (12n + m) = 1/7

Cross-multiplying: 7m = 12n + m → 6m =12n → m=2n

So m = 2n. That's a 1:2 ratio between H and C. Let's check for some common hydrocarbons.

If m=2n, then the formula is CnH2n. That looks like an alkene (since alkenes have 2n H), but wait, but Z doesn't react with hydrogen, so it's already saturated. Wait, that can't be. Oh wait no, Z is the product of hydrogenation, so maybe X and Y had unsaturated bonds, and Z is a fully saturated molecule.

Wait, no. Because Z is a constituent of Y, which is the product after X was treated with Pt and heated, leading to a disproportionation. So Y has some compounds, but upon hydrogenation, everything becomes Z. So maybe Z is a more
