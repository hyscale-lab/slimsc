Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again. 

The question is about a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. The options are A to D, each with different expressions involving gamma, B, and square roots.

Hmm, okay. I remember that spin-1/2 particles have properties related to quantum mechanics, and their magnetic moments interact with magnetic fields. When the magnetic field changes direction, this should affect the energy levels and the Hamiltonian of the system.

So, the initial state is when the magnetic field is along +Z. The particle's spin is aligned with the field because that's the lowest energy state. The spin-up state in the z-direction, I think. So the spin state is |+z> before anything happens.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off. So, the field along Z disappears. But then, another field is turned on along Y. So now the magnetic field is in the +Y direction, same magnitude as before.

I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The magnetic moment mu interacts with the magnetic field B through the dot product, mu · B. So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to mu · B. Wait, but mu is given as gamma*S_z. So the initial Hamiltonian is H_initial = gamma * B * S_z.

But when the field switches to Y, the new Hamiltonian should be H_final = gamma * B * S_y. Because now the magnetic field is along Y, so the magnetic moment interaction is in the y-direction.

Wait, but wait. How does the spin state evolve when the Hamiltonian changes suddenly? Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, when the Hamiltonian changes abruptly (like in a measurement or a sudden switch), the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously. Instead, the state remains the same, but now evolves under the new Hamiltonian.

So initially, the system is in an eigenstate of H_initial, which is |+z>. When the field changes, the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. So the state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. That means the system will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values, like the average z-component of the moment.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment. So I need to find the time dependence of <mu_z>, which is gamma times <S_z>, since mu = gamma S_z.

So, the average <S_z> will oscillate over time. The frequency of this oscillation is what we're looking for.

I think the approach here is to model the time evolution of the spin state under the new Hamiltonian. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z. The new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, which doesn't commute with S_z. So the state will evolve in a way that leads to oscillations in expectation values.

Let me try to model this. The time evolution of the state is given by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation: |ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |ψ(0)>, where |ψ(0)> is the initial state.

Wait, but wait, what's the value of ħ here? Sometimes, in these problems, units are chosen such that ħ = 1. I'll have to keep that in mind.

The Hamiltonian H is (gamma B) S_y. Let me write that as H = (gamma B) (ħ/2) sigma_y, since S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y, where sigma_y is the Pauli matrix.

So H = (gamma B ħ / 2) sigma_y.

The initial state is |+z>, which in the computational basis is (1, 0)^T. Alternatively, written in terms of spin matrices, S_z |+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>.

So, the initial state is |+z> = (1, 0)^T.

Now, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). Substituting H:

U(t) = exp( -i (gamma B ħ / 2 sigma_y) t / ħ )
Simplify the denominator: (gamma B ħ t)/(2 ħ) ) * sigma_y → (gamma B t / 2) sigma_y.

So U(t) = exp( -i (gamma B t / 2) sigma_y )

Now, to find |ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z>.

Hmm, but what is the exponential of sigma_y? I remember that for Pauli matrices, e^{i theta sigma} can be expressed using trigonometric functions and the identity matrix. Let me recall the expansion.

The exponential of a Pauli matrix times an angle can be written using sine and cosine. For any Pauli matrix sigma and angle theta,

exp( i theta sigma ) = I cos(theta) + i sigma sin(theta).

Wait, but the argument in our exponential is negative i (gamma B t / 2) sigma_y. Let me factor that out.

Let me denote omega = gamma B. So, H = (omega ħ / 2) sigma_y.

So, U(t) = exp( -i (omega ħ / 2) sigma_y t / ħ )

Simplify: omega t / 2 sigma_y.

So, U(t) = exp( -i (omega t / 2) sigma_y )

Let me write this as exp( -i theta sigma_y ), where theta = omega t / 2.

Using the formula for the exponential, this becomes:

exp( -i theta sigma_y ) = I cos(theta) - i sigma_y sin(theta).

Because when the exponent is -i theta sigma, the expansion becomes:

I cos(theta) - i sigma sin(theta), because the i and the sigma multiply together.

So, U(t) = cos(theta) I - i sigma_y sin(theta), where theta = (gamma B t)/2.

Now, to find the state |psi(t)> = U(t) |+z>.

|+z> is (1, 0)^T. Let's compute U(t) |+z>:

U(t) is a 2x2 matrix:

[ cos(theta)   -sin(theta) ]   Wait, no. Let me think. Sigma_y is:

sigma_y = [[0, -i
