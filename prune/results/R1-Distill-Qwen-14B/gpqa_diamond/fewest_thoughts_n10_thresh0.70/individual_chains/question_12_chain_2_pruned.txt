Okay, so I have this physics problem here. It's about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think this through.

The problem says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) plus a neutrino, right? So the reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV/c² and mu is 105.7 MeV/c². We need to find the kinetic energies of the products, mu+ and the neutrino. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving two numbers which I assume are the KEs of the muon and neutrino respectively.

Wait, wait a second. Neutrinos are tricky because they have such tiny (almost zero) rest mass. So, their energy is almost all kinetic, right? But wait, the problem states the rest mass of the neutrino. Wait, no, the neutrino is a lepton, and its rest mass is negligible compared to the other particles here. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I should assume it's zero? Or perhaps I should consider the given masses. Hmm, but the rest mass of the neutrino isn't provided, so perhaps in this problem, we treat it as zero. Because without that, we can't proceed. So I'll proceed under the assumption that the neutrino’s rest mass is zero.

Wait, but the question gives the rest mass of Pi and mu, but not the neutrino. So, yeah, I think we have to treat the neutrino as massless, so its energy is all kinetic. Because otherwise, we can't find the answer.

So, the initial particle, Pi, is at rest, so its momentum is zero. After decay, the total momentum must be zero because of conservation of momentum. So, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me denote the muon's momentum as p, and the neutrino's as p', but since they're opposite, p' = -p. Wait, but in magnitude, their momenta are the same, so |p| = |p'|.

Wait, but the muon has mass, so its energy is sqrt(p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4) / c², and the neutrino
