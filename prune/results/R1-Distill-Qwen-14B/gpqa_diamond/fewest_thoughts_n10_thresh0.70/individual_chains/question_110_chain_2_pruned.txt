Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for things like measuring stellar velocities and chemical compositions. The question gives me five stars, each with different properties, and I need to figure out which ones are observable by both instruments.

First, I need to understand the observing capabilities of each spectrograph. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait, it's stars brighter than 17 mag? Or wait, I think I need to check: the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, but wait a minute, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star with V=17 is fainter than V=16. So if a spectrograph can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means it can see stars with V up to 17, because anything brighter (lower magnitude) is okay. Wait, no, wait. If a telescope can observe stars with apparent magnitude brighter than 17, that means it can observe stars with V â‰¤ 17 because higher magnitude is fainter. So ESPRESSO can observe stars up to V=17 mag. Because anything brighter than that (like V=16, 15, etc.) is okay, but anything fainter (like V=18, 19) is too dim.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So HIRES can observe stars down to V=16.0, because stars brighter than that (V <16) are okay, but V=16.1 would be too faint.

Wait, no: the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." So,ESPRESSO's limit is V <=17 (since brighter is lower mag), and HIRES's limit is V <=16.

So the star must have V apparent magnitude <=17 for ESPRESSO, and <=16 for HIRES. So the star must have V <=16 to be detected by both. Because if it's V=17, HIRES can't detect it, only ESPRESSO can. So, the stars that can be observed by both must have V <=16.

Wait, no, wait the question says "can be detected with both." So the star must be observable by both. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be <=17 (since ESPRESSO can go up to 17) and also <=16 (since HIRES can only go up to 16). So the star's apparent V must be <=16. Because if a star is at V=16.5, ESPRESSO can see it (since 16.5 <17) but HIRES can't (as 16.5 >16). So only stars with V <=16 can be seen by both.

Wait, but wait, the question says "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO. Oh, wait, the wording is a bit tricky. The question states, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So that means m_V < 17. Because brighter means lower magnitude. So for a star to be seen by ESPRESSO, m_V must be <17. Similarly, for HIRES, m_V must be <16.

So for a star to be seen by both, it's m_V must be <16. Because that's the lower limit of the two.

So the task is to find which stars have apparent V magnitudes less than 16.

Looking at each star:

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So, since absolute magnitude M is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc, Star1's apparent magnitude m = M + distance modulus. The distance modulus is 5 log10(d/10 pc). Here d=10 pc, so log(1)=0, distance modulus is 0. So m = 15.5. So m=15.5, which is <16. So Star1 can be observed by both spectrographs.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. So m=
