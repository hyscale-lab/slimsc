Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Hmm, I remember that both these instruments are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, but their detection limits differ.

First, I need to understand the brightness requirements for each spectrograph. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, meaning it can detect stars up to 17 mag. On the other hand, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, a star needs to have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16 to be detected by HIRES and less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, actually, waitâ€”no, wait. The question says "brighter than 17 mag" can be observed with ESPRESSO. Oh wait, magnitude scale is a bit counterintuitive. Lower magnitudes are brighter. So, the apparent magnitude cutoff is such that if a star's apparent V magnitude is brighter (lower number) than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, for HIRES, apparent V magnitude needs to be brighter than 16.

So, for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=16 (since HIRES can't see brighter than 16. Wait, no. Wait, the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes
