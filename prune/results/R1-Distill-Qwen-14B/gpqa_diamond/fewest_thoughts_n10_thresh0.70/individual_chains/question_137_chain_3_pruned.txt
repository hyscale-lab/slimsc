Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I need to figure out how many revolutions a proton makes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

First, I remember that a cyclotron accelerates particles using a magnetic field and an alternating electric field. Synchrocyclotron is a type of cyclotron, so similar principles apply. The key here is probably the relationship between the frequency of the applied voltage and the particle's motion.

The problem says that a proton is injected with negligible kinetic energy at t=0, so initial energy is almost zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? Or maybe it's two steps in the process? Or perhaps each acceleration refers to each time it goes through a particular region in the cyclotron? Not sure yet.

The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α) t + Φ0]. And the given data are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

I think the frequency ν here is the frequency of the electric field, and it's related to the cyclotron frequency. But wait, in a cyclotron, the particles move in a magnetic field, and their cyclotron frequency is ω = (qB)/(m), where q is charge, B is magnetic field, and m is mass. But in a synchrocyclotron, I think the frequency of the applied voltage must match the cyclotron frequency for effective acceleration each time the particle passes through the gap.

Wait, but in a cyclotron, as the particles gain energy, their radius increases, right? Because kinetic energy increases, so velocity increases, and radius is proportional to mv/(qB), so r increases with velocity. So the frequency of their orbit is related to the magnetic field strength and their momentum.

But here, the problem is about how many revolutions the proton makes as it goes from T=0 (negligible) to T1=950 MeV.

I think each time the proton goes through one acceleration, it gains some energy. The number of revolutions would correspond to how many times it goes around the path before reaching the target energy.

Wait, but the question says it undergoes two accelerations. Wait, no, the problem states: the proton undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to
