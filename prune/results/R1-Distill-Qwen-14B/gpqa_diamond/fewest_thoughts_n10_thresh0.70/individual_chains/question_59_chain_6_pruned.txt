Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see. It says we need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. 

Wait, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I think I should first calculate the moles of H+ ions from the acids and the moles of OH- ions from the base. Then subtract them to see if there's excess H+ or OH- left, and determine the pH based on that.

Let me break it down step by step. 

First, find the moles for each component. 

Starting with CH3COOH, which is acetic acid. It's a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. But wait, wait. No, actually, the problem is about mixing acids and a base. But wait, the HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate, releasing H+ ions. The Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions.

Wait, but wait, the problem mixes all three solutions. So when you mix, the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2. Oh, but wait, acetic acid is weak. But since it's an acid, maybe the H+ from it will also react with the OH- from the base. Hmm, but the problem is that H+ from weak acids may not fully dissociate. Do I need to consider the dissociation of acetic acid?

Hmm. Wait, when you mix all the solutions, the total volume will be 500 +400 +300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 liters. 

So, let me calculate the moles of each component.

For CH3COOH: volume is 0.5 L, concentration 0.1 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.1 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it won't completely dissociate, so the H+ it contributes
