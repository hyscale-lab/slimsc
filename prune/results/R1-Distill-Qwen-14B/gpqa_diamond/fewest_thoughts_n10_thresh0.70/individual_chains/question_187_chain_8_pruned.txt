Okay, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars it can detect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, the question says a star is detectable if it achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So, I need to figure out for each star whether the S/N is >=10.

I remember that the S/N ratio depends on a few factors: the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, and the instrument's efficiency. Also, the distance to the star affects its apparent brightness. Oh right, the apparent magnitude is how bright the star appears from Earth, which is what matters for detection.

ESPRESSO is an instrument on the VLT, and I think it's used for high-resolution spectroscopy. I'm not exactly sure about its specific capabilities, but perhaps I can find some general info. Wait, the link is provided, but since I can't access it, I'll have to rely on what I know.

ESPRESSO's sensitivity is probably determined by its collecting area, the telescope's, the spectrograph's efficiency, and the exposure time. I think the VLT has 8-meter mirrors, so each telescope has a large collecting area. But ESPRESSO's specific performance might matter.

I remember that for a spectrograph, the S/N depends on the photon flux. The photon flux is proportional to the star's brightness, so more photons mean higher S/N.

Apparent magnitude (m) is related to flux. The formula for flux is F = F0 * 10^(-0.4*m), where F0 is a reference flux. But without exact numbers, maybe I can reason about the magnitudes.

Wait, each star has an absolute magnitude (Mv) of 15. Absolute magnitude is how bright the star would appear at 10 pc. So, the actual apparent magnitude (mv) depends on the distance. The formula is mv = Mv + 5 + 5 log10(d), where d is distance in parsecs.

So for each option, I can compute mv.

Let's compute each star's apparent magnitude:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a very bright star. From memory, it's about magnitude 0.7. So that's
