Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when a charge is moving, it's not just electric fields we have to consider; there's also the magnetic field. But wait, how do potentials come into play here?

The question is asking for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r and time t. The setup is that the charge q is moving with some trajectory s(t), and the field is observed at point r. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So, d is like the distance vector at the retarded time.

I think I remember that the potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations. For a moving charge, the potentials can be expressed in terms of the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time. Oh, right, the retarded time. Because the fields and potentials depend on the state of the charge in the past, not the present.

Let me try to recall the expressions. The scalar potential V is usually something like q/(4πε0 r), but wait, when the charge is moving, does that change? Or maybe it's modified by some factor involving the velocity. Oh, right, in the case of a moving charge, there's a term that comes from the time delay, which involves the vector d and the velocity.

Wait, the vector d is from the retarded position (where the field was generated) to the current observation point r. So d = r - r retarded. Or maybe it's r retarded vector? Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the vector d's definition. Oh, the problem says d is the vector from the field generating point (at time tr) to the observation point r. So d = r - r_tr, where r_tr is the position of the charge at tr.

So, for the scalar potential, the standard Coulomb potential is V = q/(4πε0 r), but when considering retarded time effects, maybe it's divided by (d c - d·v), scaled by some constants. Wait, no, I think the denominator might involve (d c - (d · v)). Or maybe it's (c^2 t' - (r - r'))·v). Wait, perhaps I should
