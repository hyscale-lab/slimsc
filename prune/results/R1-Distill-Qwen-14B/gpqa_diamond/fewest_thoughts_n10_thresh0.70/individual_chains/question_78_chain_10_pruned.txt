Okay, so I've got this electromagnetism problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember the concepts.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain point in space and time, given a moving point charge. The charge has a trajectory s(t), and we're considering the fields at a position r, with d being the vector from where the field was generated to the observation point r.

Hmm, I recall that the potentials are related to the electromagnetic fields via Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential contributes to the magnetic field.

So, the setup is that at time t, the observation is made, and the charge was at a position that generated the field at an earlier time tr. So, I think this is a retarded time scenario because the fields are based on where the charge was earlier, not where it is now.

Wait, the scalar potential for a point charge at rest in Coulomb's law is V = q/(4πε₀ r), right? But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated. Because the charge's velocity affects the potentials.

I remember that the vector potential A is generally given by something involving the velocity of the charge. Oh right, for a charge moving with velocity v, the vector potential A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) multiplied by something, but I'm not exactly sure about the terms.

Wait, let me think. The scalar potential V is the static Coulomb potential, but when the charge is moving, there might be some corrections. But wait, in the context of retarded potentials, the expressions for V and A involve the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time.

The retarded time tr is given by tr = t - d/(c), where d is the distance from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. So, d is |r - s(tr)|. But in the options, I see terms like dc - d·v. Hmm, wait, perhaps that's the denominator in the potentials.

Wait, the denominator in option C is dc minus d·v. So, let me think about the expressions for the potentials in terms of retarded time. The scalar potential V is typically (q
