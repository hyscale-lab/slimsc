Okay, so I've got this physics question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of particle physics. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I might need to parse that. Wait, perhaps it's more about the interaction term. The Lagrangian term suggests that the boson X couples to fermion ψ_f with a coupling strength λ. The fermion is written as ψ_f, but I'm not entirely sure which fermions are involved here. Oh wait, right, the question is about what X can decay into, so perhaps I need to think about the possible fermion pairs.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So when considering decay products, the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because of conservation of energy, right? So each decay product's mass must be less than half of X's mass since the boson is decaying into two particles.

Wait, but wait. The decay is X → fermion-antifermion pair, I think. Because the Lagrangian term looks like it's a Yukawa coupling. The general form for
