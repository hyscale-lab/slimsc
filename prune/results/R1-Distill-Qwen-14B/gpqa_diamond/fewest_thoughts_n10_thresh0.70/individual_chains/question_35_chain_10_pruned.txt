Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that Ay is a 2x2 matrix and is equal to c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h divided by 4π. Right, c = h/(4π). And S is given as a 2x2 matrix. The first row is 0 and -i, the second row is i and 0. So S looks like this:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

Wait, I think S is similar to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli Y matrix is indeed [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so S must be the Pauli Y matrix, σy.

So Ay = c * σy = (h/(4π)) * σy. But wait, the spin operators usually are S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Oh right, ħ is h/(2π), so S = (ħ/2) σ. Let me compute that.

Wait, the spin matrices for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon are Sx, Sy, Sz, each of which is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So Sy would be (ħ/2) σy. But in this problem, Ay is c multiplied by S, and c is h/(4π). Let me compute this.

Wait, ħ is h/(2π), so h/(4π) is ħ/2. So c = h/(4π) = ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) * σy. Which is exactly the same as the spin operator Sy for a spin-1/2 particle. Because Sy = (ħ/2) σy.

So the operator Ay is actually the spin Y-component operator. So the eigenvalues of Ay should be the eigenvalues of Sy.

Hmm, what are the eigenvalues of the spin Y operator? Well, for spin-1/2 particles, the possible eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. Because Sy can have eigenvalues of ± (ħ/2). So the eigenvalues of Ay would be ± (h/(4π)) multiplied
