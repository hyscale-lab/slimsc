Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator Ay is given as c times S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). 

Wait, so first, I should probably write down what Ay looks like. Since Ay = c * S, and c is h/(4π), then each element of S is multiplied by c. So S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So Ay would be:

[ 0     -i * (h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0 ]

But wait, maybe I should just keep it as c times S for calculation purposes, since that might simplify things. 

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Hmm, eigenvalues. So the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector.

Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, I can find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me construct the matrix (Ay - a I):

[ (-a)      -i c      ]
[ i c       (-a)    ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (i c)(i c) = a² - (i^2 c²). Wait, i squared is -1, so (i c)^2 is (-1) c². So determinant is a² - (-1 c²) → a² + c².

Set this equal to zero: a² + c² = 0 → a² = -c². Hmm, so a will be imaginary? Because square of a is negative. So a would be ± i c.

Wait, no: a² = - c² → a = ± i c. Because c is h/(4π), which is real. So the eigenvalues are imaginary numbers: i c and -i c. 

Wait, but the options given don't seem to have purely imaginary eigenvalues. Let me check the options again. 

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, and real part ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because if the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, their real parts are zero. So option A can't be right.

Option B's eigenvalues have real and imaginary parts, but our calculation suggests the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So B's options don't fit either.

Option C talks about eigenfunctions being eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Hmm, well, not sure yet, but let me think. The square of the angular momentum operator would give the eigenvalues as a², which are real. So if Ay's eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A², that makes sense because they would share eigenvectors if Ay and A² commute. But what about Az? Since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenvectors might not be the same. So C could be correct, but I'm not certain yet.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Wait, the basis functions are typically the eigenfunctions, so I think that's correct. But I'm not sure. Because any operator's eigenfunctions form a basis if they are complete and orthogonal.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So let's reevaluate.

Wait, the eigenvalues we found are purely imaginary: ±i c. But c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are ±i (h/(4π)).

So their real parts are zero, and the imaginary parts are ± h/(4π). So none of the options A or B match this. Looking back at the options:

Option A says imaginary parts are ±2πh, which is much larger. Option B's imaginary parts are ±1/2, which don't match either. So neither A nor B are correct about the eigenvalues.

So that leaves options C and D.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Let's think about this. The square of the angular momentum operator (A²) commutes with any component, like Ax, Ay, Az. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it must also be an eigenstate of A². Because [Ay, A²] = 0. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². However, for the z-component Az, [Ay, Az] is not zero. The commutator [Ay, Az] would be iħ A something else, so the eigenfunctions of Ay won't generally be eigenfunctions of Az. So option C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the eigenfunctions of any operator form a basis if they are complete. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, it's a finite-dimensional space, so it's possible. But does that statement make sense? The basis functions of Ay would be the eigenvectors (since it's a 2x2 matrix, the space is two-dimensional), so the eigenfunctions would form a basis. So D's statement is correct as well.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during calculation. So I'm a bit confused now. Let me look at the options again.

Option C says the eigenfunctions
