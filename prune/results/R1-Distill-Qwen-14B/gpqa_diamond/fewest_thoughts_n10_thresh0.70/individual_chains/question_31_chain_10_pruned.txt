Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product 3. Let me start by breaking down each step of the reaction and see what each product looks like.

First, the question says toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I remember that nitric acid (HNO3) in the presence of H2SO4 usually acts as a nitrating agent. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene, which is a good activating group. So when nitration occurs, the nitro group (-NO2) will substitute into the ring. Where does it go? Well, the methyl group is ortho/para-directing, so the nitro group should go either at the ortho, meta, or para position. But since nitration is a meta-directing nitration? Wait, no, nitration is an electrophilic substitution, and the methyl directs incoming groups to ortho and para positions. So the major product is para-nitrotoluene, I think. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene.

Next, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent, especially under acidic conditions. I recall that when nitrotoluenes are oxidized, the nitro group can lead to oxidation of the ring. Wait, in the case of para-nitrotoluene, the methyl group is in the para position relative to the nitro. So when oxidized, the methyl group (which is a CH3) would be oxidized. Let me think: oxidation of a methyl group attached to benzene with a nitro group. Since nitro is a deactivating group, it might influence the oxidation. Wait, the methyl is in the para position, so oxidation of the methyl group. 

MnO2 in H2SO4 is a typical condition for the oxidation of toluene derivatives. The CH3 group attached to benzene can be oxidized to a COOH group. So para-nitrotoluene would become para-nitrobenzoic acid. Wait, no. Wait, para-nitrotoluene is methyl attached to benzene, which has a nitro para. So oxidation would turn CH3 into COOH. So product 2 would be 4-nitrobenzoic acid. Or wait, no, if the nitro is para to the methyl, after oxidation, the COOH is
