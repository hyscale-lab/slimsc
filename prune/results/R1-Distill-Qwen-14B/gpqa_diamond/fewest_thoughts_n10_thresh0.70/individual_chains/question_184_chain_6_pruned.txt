Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to visualize the structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. The substituents are ethoxy (OEt) at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro (NO2) at position 3. Wait, actually, numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me think about the numbering. The substituents are on positions 1, 2, and 3 in a row. So the substituents are in the 1, 2, 3 positions. So, if we imagine the benzene ring, substituents are at adjacent positions.

So the substituents are ethoxy (OEt) at position 1, nitro at position 3, and tert-butyl at position 2. Wait, no, because the name is 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. So, numbering like 1, 2, 3 would place them in a way that 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, and 3 is nitro. So looking at the ring, positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent, so the substituents are adjacent to each other. That would mean the ring has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro in a row.

But wait, in benzene rings, when there are multiple substituents, the numbering is chosen to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So, the substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. So their positions are 1, 2, and 3, making a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Now, the synthesis starts with benzene. I need to add these substituents in a way that allows for high yields. Each substituent will be introduced via electrophilic substitution, and the order matters because each group can direct the next substitution.

Let me think about the substituent directing effects. Ethoxy
