Alright, so I've got this science question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I'll think through it.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. At shorter wavelengths than 790 nm, the flux drops a lot. I remember that when we observe objects with redshift, their emitted light can be shifted. So maybe this peak is due to some emission line that's been redshifted.

Wait, what's the typical wavelength of emission lines in quasars? Oh right, the Lyman-alpha line is around 121 nm in the ultraviolet. But in the quasar's spectrum, if it's observed at 790 nm, that's much longer. So that suggests a redshift.

Redshift z is calculated by (observed wavelength / emitted wavelength) - 1. So z = (790 / 121) - 1. Let me compute that. 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.528. So z ≈ 5.528. Oh, that's a high redshift object!

Now, the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth. The comoving distance depends on the cosmological parameters given. The parameters are Hubble constant H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ω_m=0.3, dark energy Ω_Λ=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ω_k=0).
