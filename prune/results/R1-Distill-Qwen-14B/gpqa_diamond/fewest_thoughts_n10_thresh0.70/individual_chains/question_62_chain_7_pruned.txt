Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis questions. Let's see what the question is asking.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, the main structure is a cyclohexane ring. Attached to it is a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a formyl (carbaldehyde) group. Wait, no, looking again. The formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane has three substituents at position 1? Or maybe it's attached differently.

Wait, wait. Let me structure it. The molecule is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means there's a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group attached. Then, the substituent is at the 1-position, which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, the substituent is a methyl group attached to cyclohexane, which also has a hydroxyl group. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a CH2CHO group attached (the carbaldehyde), and another CH2 group that's connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Or maybe it's a branching point.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it. So, the main ring is cyclohexane. At position 1, which is across from the carbaldehyde, perhaps, there's a substituent. The substituent is a methyl group that's attached to a cyclohexane ring and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is -CH2-Cyclohexyl-OH? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, it's a methyl group with both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group attached. So, the substituent is -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So, the main ring is cyclohexane with a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached at position 1, and
