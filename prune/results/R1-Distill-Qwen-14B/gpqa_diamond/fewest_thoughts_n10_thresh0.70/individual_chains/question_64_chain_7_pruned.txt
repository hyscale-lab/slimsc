Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B that weigh 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through three tubes: the first is anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second is a Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third has red-hot copper. 

The results are:
- Tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) gains 3.60 g.
- Tube 3 (copper) gains 0.80 g, forming CuO.
- Tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution) doesn't change.
- Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C are left at standard temperature and pressure.

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm. Alright, I'm going to break this down. Let me think about each part.

First, heating salts A and B to 200°C without air. So probably a decomposition reaction. The gases produced are passed through these tubes, which suggests they are reacting with them.

Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a drying agent. It's anhydrous, so it probably absorbs water. So the gas here might be water vapor. If the weight increased by 3.60g, that's the mass of water absorbed. So that would be H2O.

Then, tube 3 is red-hot copper. If the gas is something that reacts with copper, maybe CO2? Because CO2 can react with copper at high temperatures. But wait, CO would also react. Alternatively, maybe it's hydrogen, but I think CO2 is more likely. Let's think: when CO2 reacts with copper, it would form CuO and carbon. The gain in tube 3 is 0.80g, which is the mass of CuO formed. So how much CuO is that?

The molar mass of CuO is 63.55 + 16 = 79.55 g/mol. Let me calculate the moles: 0.80g / 79.55g/mol ≈ 0.01 mol. So about 0.01 moles of CuO, meaning 0.01 moles of O2 came from CO2? Wait, no, because the reaction between CO2 and copper is:

2 Cu + CO2 → 2 CuO + C (when heated)

So for every mole of CO2, one mole of CuO is formed. So if 0.80g is CuO, that's 0.01 mol (approx). So that suggests 0.01 mol of CO2 passed through.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it accurately. CuO is 63.546 (Cu) + 16 (O) = 79.546 g/mol.

0.80 g / 79.546 g/mol ≈ 0.01 mol. So yes, about 0.01 mol of CuO, which would mean 0.01 mol of CO2 reacted.

So that suggests that CO2 is one of the gases.

Then, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas doesn't react with it, what could that be? Well, if the gas is CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. But the weight of tube 2 didn't change, meaning no reaction. So the gas that passed through tube 2 must be something that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2. What gases don't react with Ca(OH)2 solution? Maybe nitrogen, oxygen, or hydrogen? But considering the context of heating salts, perhaps it's H2 or another gas.

Wait, but let me think. Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant. If it gained 3.6g, that's water. So the first gas is H2O. But wait, in the setup, the gases are a mixture. So, the gases would have passed through each tube in some order. Oh, but wait, the gas is passed successively through the tubes. So the first tube is Mg(ClO4)2, which traps water. So any water vapor in the gas would be absorbed here.

Then, the next gas would be the dry gases. Then, they pass through Ca(OH)2 solution. If the next gas doesn't react, then it's something that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2. Then, the third tube is red-hot copper
