Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I'll read the question carefully. The task is to determine which stars can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. The key information given is the magnitude limits for each spectrograph. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, meaning it can see stars up to 17 mag. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so it can go a bit fainter than ESPRESSO.

So any star that's brighter than both 17 and 16 mag (because both instruments need to detect it) will be the candidate. Wait, no, because HIRES can go to 16 mag, which is fainter than ESPRESSO's 17. Wait, no: the brighter the star (lower magnitude), the easier it is to detect. So for a star to be observable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16 mag because HIRES can't see beyond 16, so it's the limiting factor. Because if a star is, say, 17 mag, HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. So the star must have apparent V magnitude <=16 for both to detect it.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says: with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So ESPRESSO can see down to 17 mag. Similarly, HIRES can see down to 16 mag. So for a star to be observed by both, it must be brighter than both limits. But wait, no, because if a star is brighter than the fainter limit (the more restrictive one), then it can be seen by both. Because if a star is 15 mag, both can see it. If a star is 17 mag, only ESPRESSO can see it. But a star at 16.5 mag would be too faint for HIRES (since it's brighter than 16 mag, right? Wait, the problem states HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. Wait, no. Wait, the way it's worded: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So stars with V <17 mag can be seen by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V <16.

Wait, no. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star has V=15, it's brighter than V=16, which is brighter than V=17. So, for a star to be observed by both, it needs to be brighter than both 17 and 16. Wait, that's not possible unless it's brighter than 16. Because 16 is brighter than 17 (16 is lower magnitude). So any star with apparent V magnitude ≤16 would be observable by both. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, and HIRES up to 16.

Wait, no. Because HIRES can't see past 16. So a star must be brighter than 16 (so V mag <16) to be seen by both. Or wait, the exact wording is: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed", which means V <17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V <16. So for a star to be seen by both, it must have V <16. Because if V is 17, HIRES can't see it, and if V is 16.5, HIRES can't. So only stars with V ≤16 mag can be detected by both.

Wait, no, because the limits are: ESPRESSO observes stars brighter than 17 mag. So
