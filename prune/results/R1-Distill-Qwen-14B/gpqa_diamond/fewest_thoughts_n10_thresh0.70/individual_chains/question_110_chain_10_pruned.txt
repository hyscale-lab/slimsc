Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these instruments have different brightness limits, so I need to figure out which stars are bright enough for both.

The question gives me five stars, each with their own properties. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I should understand the brightness requirements for each spectrograph. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V magnitude. Wait, no, brighter than 17 would mean magnitude less than 17, because lower magnitudes are brighter. So ESPRESSO observes stars with V mag ≤17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so magnitude ≤16. So any star that's ≤16 mag can be seen by HIRES, but ESPRESSO goes a bit fainter, up to 17 mag.

So the star needs to be bright enough for both. That means the star's apparent V magnitude should be ≤16 for both instruments, I think. Because HIRES can't go beyond 16, so anything brighter than 16 (i.e., mag ≤16) can be observed by HIRES. But ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so any star brighter than 17 (mag ≤17) can be observed by ESPRESSO. So the overlapping condition is apparent V mag ≤16. Because if a star is ≤16, both can see it. If it's between 16 and 17, only ESPRESSO can see it. But wait, the question is which stars can be detected by both. So the star's apparent magnitude needs to be ≤16 for both to detect.

Wait, but for each star, I might need to calculate their apparent V magnitude based on their absolute magnitude and distance. Or maybe some have extinction (like E(B-V)) which affects their apparent magnitude.

Let me look at each star:

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent V is M + 5 log
