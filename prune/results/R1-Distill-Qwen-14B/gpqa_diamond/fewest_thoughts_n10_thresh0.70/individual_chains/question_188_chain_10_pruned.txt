Okay, I'm trying to solve this crystallography problem. Let me see what I remember. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal's (111) plane. 

So, first, what's a rhombohedral crystal structure? I recall that in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are of equal length, a, and all the angles between the edges are the same, which are given here as 30 degrees each. So it's a special case where the lattice is cubic but with all angles equal but not 90 degrees. So it's like a cube that's been skewed, but all the sides are the same length.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance in a crystal usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice vectors. So in a cubic system, that would be the edge length 'a'. But in a rhombohedral system, the edges are a, and the angles are different. Hmm, but since all angles are equal here, it's called a rhombohedral or trigonal system.

The interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. For a cubic system, we have the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But wait, that's for a cubic system, right? Here, the system is rhombohedral, so the formula must be different.

I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c, and angles α, β, γ is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) - (2hk cosβγ)/(a b) - (2hl cosαγ)/(a c) - (2kl cosαβ)/(b c) ) )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and all angles are equal, α=β=γ=θ. So maybe there's a simplified formula for that case.

Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral lattice, the formula for d_{hkl} is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cosθ - 2hl cosθ - 2kl cosθ )

Wait, but
