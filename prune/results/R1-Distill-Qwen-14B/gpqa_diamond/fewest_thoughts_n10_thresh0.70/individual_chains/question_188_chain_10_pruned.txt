Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral structure has all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So, the lattice constants a, b, c are the same, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all the same too. In this case, they've given me that each angle is 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, which I think is the lattice constant a. So a = 10 Angstroms.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I recall that the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the structure factor. Oh right, the formula is 1/d² = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - 2(hk cos gamma)/(a b) - 2(h l cos beta)/(a c) - 2(k l cos alpha)/(b c). But wait, because in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, right? So all the a, b, c are the same, which is 10 Angstroms in this case. And all the angles are 30 degrees.

So substituting a = b = c = a, and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, the formula simplifies. Let's plug in the (111) plane, so h=1, k=1, l=1.

Let me write this out. Since a = b = c, the formula becomes:

1/d² = (1/a²)(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos gamma - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos alpha)

But since all angles are the same, cos gamma = cos beta = cos alpha = cos(30°). So cos(30°) is sqrt(3)/2, approximately 0.8660.

So substituting h=k=l=1:

1/d² = (1/a²)[1 + 1 + 1 - 2*(1)*(1)*0.866 - 2*(
