Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that when atoms are in a photosphere, their excitation states can tell us something about the temperature of the star. Oh right, this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution, I think. 

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, does that mean the number of atoms in a higher energy state is twice as much? Or is it the other way around? I think the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are "twice as excited," so perhaps the population of the excited state is twice that of star_2. But I'm not entirely sure. 

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, that's a familiar number. 1.38 is the Boltzmann constant, right? Wait, the Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, but the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k times temperature? Because E = k*T. Or wait, no, E is the energy per particle. So maybe E = k*T multiplied by some factor. 

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states is (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). Here, g is the degeneracy, but if the problem says "specific energy level", perhaps the degeneracy factors are the same for both stars, so they cancel out. 

So the ratio of the populations N2/N1 would be proportional to exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ). Oh wait, wait, because ΔE is E2 - E1. So if the higher energy level is E2 and lower is E1, then if the star_1 has more excited atoms (N2), then the ratio N2/N1 for star_1 is higher than for star_2.

But in the question, it's stated that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So, for the same energy level transition, the population ratio in star_
