Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me think. I remember that in stars, the excitation levels of atoms are related to the temperature. Oh right, it's something to do with the Boltzmann distribution. 

So the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, wait. The number of excited atoms depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels. The formula I recall is the Boltzmann factor: the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy states is proportional to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature.

Let me write that down. So the ratio n1/n2 = e^(-ΔE/(kT)), where n1 and n2 are the populations of the two energy levels. Wait, but wait. Oh wait, no—actually, the distribution is given by n_i = proportional to e^(-E_i/(kT)). So the ratio between two states would be (n1/n2) = e^(-(E1 - E2)/(kT)).

But in this question, star 1 has twice as excited as star 2. So the ratio is (n1)_star1 / (n1)_star2 = 2. Or wait, wait, wait. Let me read again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for the same energy level, the number in star 1 is twice that in star 2. Hmm, but wait, maybe it's the other way around. Or maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state or something else.

Wait, no, the question refers to a specific energy level. So maybe the number of atoms in that level in star 1 is twice that in star 2. But wait, how does that relate to temperature? Because the number of atoms in an energy level depends exponentially on temperature. So the ratio of the populations for each star would be governed by their respective temperatures.

Wait, wait. So for star 1, the population of the energy level is n1, and for star2, it's n2. So n1 = 2n2. But each star's population is given by the Boltzmann factor for their own temperature. So for star 1, n1 = A * e^(-E/(kT1)), and for star2, n2 = A * e^(-E/(kT2)), where A is some constant (like the statistical weight and other factors). So the ratio n1/n2 would be e^(-E/(k T1) + E/(k T2)) ) = e^{E (1/(k T2) - 1/(k T1))}.

Wait, no. Let's compute (n1/n2) = [e^(-E/(k T1))] / [e^(-E/(k T2))] ) = e^{ E (
