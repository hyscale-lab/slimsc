Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, I remember that fission is when a heavy nucleus splits into two or more lighter ones, right? And in this case, it's splitting into two fragments only. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The initial nucleus has a mass M at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The problem says one fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. Oh, wait, but the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So M_initial is 300 GeV, but after fission, the sum of the fragments' masses is 0.99 * M. Interesting. Wait, but in terms of rest mass energy, because E=mcÂ², right? So the initial energy is 300 GeV, but the total rest mass after is 0.99 * 300 GeV? Or is it that the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 of M? I think it's the latter.

Wait, the problem says: "the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M." So, M_initial is M, and m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. But wait, wait, the initial nucleus has rest mass M. When it splits, the total rest mass of the products is less than M because some energy is converted

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me see. I need to find the difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy (T1) of the more massive fragment and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are A to D, with differences ranging from 2 to 20 MeV. 

Alright, let's break this down step by step. 

First, the problem states that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, I need to find the masses of the two fragments.

Wait, M is the initial mass. The two fragments have rest masses m1 and m2. According to the problem, m1 = 2 * m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M. Let me write that:

m1 = 2 m2
m1 + m2 = 0.99 M

Substituting m1 from the first equation into the second, we get 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99 M, so m2 = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M. Then m1 = 2 * 0.33 M = 0.66 M.

Wait, but wait. The initial mass M is the rest mass. So, after fission, the total rest mass is 0.99 M. So the mass converted into kinetic energy is M - 0.99 M = 0.01 M. So, the total kinetic energy (since the initial nucleus is at rest) must account for this 0.01 M, but considering relativistic effects.

But wait, when the nucleus splits, the two fragments move apart. Since the system was at rest before, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me denote the velocity of the lighter fragment as v2, and the heavier one as v1. Since m1 is twice m2, but I think in terms of momentum, m1 v1 = m2 v2 because the total momentum
