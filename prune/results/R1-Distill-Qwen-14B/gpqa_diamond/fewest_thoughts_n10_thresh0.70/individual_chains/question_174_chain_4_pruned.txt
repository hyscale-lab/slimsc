Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, I remember that fission is when a heavy nucleus splits into two or more lighter ones, right? And in this case, it's splitting into two fragments only. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The initial nucleus has a mass M at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The problem says one fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. Oh, wait, but the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So M_initial is 300 GeV, but after fission, the sum of the fragments' masses is 0.99 * M. Interesting. Wait, but in terms of rest mass energy, because E=mcÂ², right? So the initial energy is 300 GeV, but the total rest mass after is 0.99 * 300 GeV? Or is it that the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 of M? I think it's the latter.

Wait, the problem says: "the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M." So, M_initial is M, and m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. But wait, wait, the initial nucleus has rest mass M. When it splits, the total rest mass of the products is less than M because some energy is converted
