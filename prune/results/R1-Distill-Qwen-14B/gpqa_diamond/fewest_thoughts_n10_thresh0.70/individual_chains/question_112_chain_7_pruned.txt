Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So, the problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vector usually has a certain normalization. So first, I probably need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, meaning it's not necessarily normalized yet.

The normalization involves taking the inner product of the state with itself and making sure it equals 1. The state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal eigenstates. So the inner product <alpha|alpha> should be the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients.

Let me write down the coefficients. The coefficient for |up> is (1+i), and for |down> it's (2-i). The absolute square of (1+i) is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2, since |a + ib|^2 = a² + b². Similarly, for (2 - i), the absolute square is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the inner product is 2 +5=7. So the state is 1/sqrt(7) times that vector. So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, no, actually, wait. It's proportional, so the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

But wait, the problem says to calculate probabilities for the eigenstates of another operator. Oh right, the operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. Let me think about the spin operators in the x or y direction.

Wait, for the Pauli matrices, the spin matrices in different directions.
