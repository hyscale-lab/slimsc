Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read through it again and try to understand what it's asking. 

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, meaning it's kind of like a squashed sphere, with its symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and the question is asking two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and what the form of f (the function) is. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they produce electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the type of dipole or higher-order multipole moment. Since the charge distribution is spheroidal, maybe it's a dipole? Or perhaps a quadrupole? But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, thinking about dipole radiation. A dipole's radiation pattern is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the dipole axis (so in the xy-plane here, since the symmetry is along z). The radiation pattern for a dipole in the far field (radiation zone) has a certain dependence on θ. The intensity or power per unit solid angle for a dipole is given by something like (dipole moment squared) times sin²θ divided by some function of θ, but wait, more precisely, the radiation pattern for a dipole is proportional to sin²θ. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, I think it's actually proportional to sin²θ for the intensity. Or was that for a different scenario?

Wait, no. Let me think again. For a dipole, the electric field in the far zone is proportional to (sinθ) / r. The intensity, which is the power per unit area, is proportional to E squared, so (sin²θ)/r². But the power per unit solid angle is the intensity multiplied by the area element, which is r² sinθ dθ dφ. So the power per unit solid angle (which is the same as the intensity per steradian) would be proportional to sin²θ * (r²) * (1/r²) * (sinθ dθ dφ) — wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Wait, the radiated power per unit solid angle (intensity) is given by the Poynting vector, which for a dipole is (p² sin²θ)/(4π c r³). But when considering per unit solid angle, the intensity is (p² sin²θ)/(4π c r³) multiplied by the area element, but perhaps I should approach it differently.

Wait, no. The intensity (power per unit area) is the Poynting vector S. The power per unit solid angle is S multiplied by the area element, but since we are considering per unit solid angle, that's S · dA / dΩ, which is S. So perhaps the power per solid angle is proportional to sin²θ. Because for a dipole, the radiation pattern is maximum at θ = 90 degrees, where sinθ is 1, so it's sin²θ. At θ = 0 or 180 degrees, the radiation would be zero.

So the function f would be proportional to sin²θ. But wait, the options don't have sin²θ. The options for f are in terms of lambda to some power, like lambda^-4, etc. So maybe I'm missing something here. Oh, right, because the problem says f is a function of lambda and theta. So the function f would have some dependence on lambda as well, but for a dipole, the radiation power depends on the square of the dipole moment and inversely on lambda^4, perhaps?

Wait, let me think about the radiation from an oscillating dipole. The power radiated by a dipole is given by P = ( (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴ sin²ωt) )/( 12
