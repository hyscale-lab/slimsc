Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of exoplanets. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star it's orbiting. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where a is the orbital distance. But wait, I might be mixing up the exact formula. Oh right, because the star emits energy, and the planet's temperature is based on the balance between incoming radiation and outgoing. So the formula is T_p = T_s * (R_s / (2a))^(1/2), where T_p is the planet's equilibrium temperature, T_s is the star's temperature, R_s is the star's radius, and a is the planet's semi-major axis.

Wait, but in this question, the planets are in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So the periods are 1, 2, 2.5, 3.5, 5 units. Since they're in resonance, I think their orbital periods are in a ratio that's a ratio of integers, but the exact ratios given are already in the problem statement.

But the question is about the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So I need to find T4 / T2.

But wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period, assuming all else is equal. Because the period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law.
