Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I remember from my electromagnetism classes that oscillating charges can radiate energy, and the pattern of this radiation depends on the setup.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. So, it's symmetric around the z-axis. When it oscillates, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. We're considering the radiation zone, which I think is far away from the source, so the near-field effects are negligible, and we can apply the radiation formulas.

The problem asks about the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at an angle theta of 30 degrees. Also, it's asking about the form of the function f, which is the radiated power per unit solid angle as a function of lambda and theta.

Wait, right. The power radiated in a particular direction depends on the radiation pattern and the total power. For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is a function of theta. I think it goes like sin^2(theta) or something similar.

Wait, no, for an electric dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field is proportional to (sin theta)^2. So the maximum occurs at theta = 90 degrees, where sin(theta) is 1. At theta=0 (along the axis), the radiation is zero. So in this case, the angle given is 30 degrees. Let's compute the value of sin(30 degrees). Oh, that's 0.5. So sin^2(theta) would be (0.5)^2 = 0.25, which is 1/4. That would imply that the power at 30 degrees is 1/4 of the maximum power. But wait, wait. Is the maximum at 90 degrees, or is there a different maximum somewhere else?

Wait, wait a second. If the charge distribution is a spheroid, it's an
