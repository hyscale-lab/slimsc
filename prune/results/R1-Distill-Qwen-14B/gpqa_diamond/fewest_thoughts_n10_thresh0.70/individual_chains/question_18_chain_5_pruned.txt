Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking. 

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But I think the mass might not directly affect the abundance ratios, unless it's about something like metallicity over time, but the question is about the photospheric composition, so maybe mass isn't a factor here. 

The problem gives me some elemental abundance data using the EW method under LTE. Let's list out the given values:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

Wait, I'm a bit confused about how to interpret these Sun values. Oh right, the notation is 12 + log10(nX/nH) equals a certain number. So for the Sun, for Fe, it's 7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5) = approximately 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log is -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But wait, I might not need the Sun's values for Star_1 and Star_2 because the [X/Y] notation is logarithmic and relative to the Sun's abundance.

Let me think about what each of these abundance ratios means.

The [Si/Fe] for Star_1 is 0.3. That means the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is higher than in the Sun by 10^0.3. Because [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(Si/Fe Star_1) - log(Si/Fe Sun) = 0.3 → log(Si/Fe Star_1) = log(Sun) + 0.3.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. [Fe/H] is log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe/nH)_sun. Since it's 0, that means the number density of Fe relative to H is the same as the Sun's. So Star_1's Fe abundance is same as Sun.

But wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is not given, but the [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So Star_1 has the same Fe/H as the Sun.

But I'm not sure how this connects to Star_2. Let's see.

For Star_2, [Mg/S
