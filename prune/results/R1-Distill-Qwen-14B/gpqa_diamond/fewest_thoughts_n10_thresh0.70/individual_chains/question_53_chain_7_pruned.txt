Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows an ester group, which makes sense because esters typically have a carbonyl group (C=O) which absorbs around 1700 cm⁻¹. So I'm looking for a compound with an ester functional group.

The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals. Let's break down what each part means. The NMR has:
- Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents would cause the aromatic protons to split into different signals. The number of signals can indicate the substitution pattern. For example, para-substituents would split the aromatic protons into two sets (each pair of equivalent protons), but sometimes more depending on the substituents.
- Two signals from vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically adjacent to double bonds, like in an ester group maybe? Wait, esters have a carbonyl and an oxygen, but the vinyl H would more likely be from an allylic position or perhaps from a substituent like a CH₂=CH group attached to the ring.
- Two signals for –CH3 groups. So maybe there are two methyl groups, perhaps as substituents on the ring. And importantly, there are no signals for –CH₂ groups, so no methylene (CH₂) groups are present.

So putting this together, let me imagine the structure. It's a benzene ring with two substituents. One of them is an ester group, because of the IR. The other substituent probably contains a vinyl group and a methyl group, maybe something like a propenoate ester or similar.

Wait, but di-substituted benzene with an ester group. Let me think about the possible structures. Maybe one substituent is an ester, like O-CO-O something, but wait, esters are usually R-O-CO-R. So perhaps one substituent is an ester, like O-CO-OR, and the other is another group.

Wait, or perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group, maybe a vinyl group attached to a methyl.
