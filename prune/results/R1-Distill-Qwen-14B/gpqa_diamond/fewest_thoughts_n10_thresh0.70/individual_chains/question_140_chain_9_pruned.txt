Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and see what I can come up with.

The question talks about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 

Another part says that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Also, substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. The question is asking for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm. Let's break this down. First, I'll try to identify what substance X could be. The reaction with a liquid Y releasing a gas W, which has equal protons and neutrons. That makes me think of a gas like H2O, but wait, H2O's molecule has 2 H and 1 O. Alternatively, another possibility is CO2, but that doesn't fit the equal protons and neutrons. Wait, let me think: if the gas W has same number of protons and neutrons, that suggests it's a molecule where each atom has equal p and n. For example, O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (like in O-16). So if W is O2, each O atom has 8 p and 8 n. So O2 is possible. Alternatively, maybe CH4? But that's 6 p and 6 n per C? No, wait, CH4 has C (6p, 6n if it's C-12), and each H has 1p and 0n. Wait, but the total in the molecule? The question says 'the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.' So for each molecule, sum of protons equals sum of neutrons.
