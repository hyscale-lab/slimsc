Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We're assuming the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The equation is something like n2/n1 = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. Oh right, E2 is higher than E1, so if the energy difference is ΔE = E2 - E1.

In this problem, the excitation level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, the ratio n2/n1 for star_1 is 2, and for star_2, it's 1 (since it's half as excited). Wait, no, actually wait. Let me clarify: it says the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited. Does that mean the population in the higher energy level is twice as much? So, for star_1, n2 is twice n1, but wait, that can't be right because in Boltzmann factor, higher energy levels have lower populations unless temperature is very high.

Wait no, the ratio n_upper / n_lower is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). So if the population in the higher level is twice that in the lower, then n_upper/n_lower = 2.

So for star_1, (n2/n1)_1 = 2. For star_2, (n2/n1)_2 = let's see, the problem says in star_2, the excitation is half as much. Wait, wait. Let me read the question again.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, perhaps the number of atoms in
