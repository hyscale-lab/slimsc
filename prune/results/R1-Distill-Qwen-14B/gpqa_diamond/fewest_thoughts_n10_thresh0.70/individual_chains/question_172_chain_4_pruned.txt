Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere is related to the temperature. The hotter the star, the more excited the atoms are, right? Because higher temperatures provide more energy for electrons to jump to higher energy levels.

They mentioned that the energy difference between the energy levels is about 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait a second, that number looks familiar. 1.38 is approximately the Boltzmann constant, which I think is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the ratio of the excitation levels. So the excitation is higher in star_1. I think this relates to the Boltzmann distribution, which tells us the probability of atoms being in a certain energy state. The formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the populations of the two energy levels.

In this case, the energy difference is given as ΔE = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote the excited state as i and the lower state as j. So for star_1, the ratio of the excited atoms is twice that of star_2. So, let's call the ratio for star_1 as 2x, and for star_2 as x. Or wait, wait. The problem says that in star_1, the excited atoms are twice as excited as those in star_2. So maybe n_i1 / n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2)? Or perhaps the other way around. Wait, actually, I think the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, no, the question states: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the excitation level is proportional to the ratio of excited to ground state atoms. So, for star_1, the ratio (n_i)/(n_j) is twice that of star_2. So, (n_i1/n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2/n_j2).

But according to the Boltzmann equation, that ratio is exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So, let's write that.

For star_1: (n_i1)/(n_j1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: (n_i2)/(n_j2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Given that (n_i1/n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2/n_j2), substituting the expressions:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm. Let's take the natural log of both sides to solve this.

ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) = ln( 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )

Which simplifies to:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, because ln(a*b)=ln(a)+ln(b), and here ln(2)+ln(exp(...))= ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

So moving terms around:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let me recheck that step. Let's see:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, but I can write (1/T2 - 1/T1) as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let me see:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So substituting back:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, ΔE is equal to k multiplied by some temperature, since ΔE = k T, right? Because E = k T when energy is thermalized. Wait, wait, the energy difference ΔE given is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k_B (Boltzmann constant) times 1 K. Because k_B is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE = k_B * 1 K. So ΔE = k.

So substituting ΔE = k:

k/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Simplify (k/k is 1):

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2)

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Looking at the options, option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that should be the correct equation.

Wait, let me
