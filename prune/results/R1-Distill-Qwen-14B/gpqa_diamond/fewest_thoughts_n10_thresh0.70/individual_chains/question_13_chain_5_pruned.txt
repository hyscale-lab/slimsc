Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. It has a structure with a cyclohexene ring and a methyl group attached. I think the structure is something like a six-membered ring with a double bond and a substituent. Oh wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, so maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene.

The first reaction is with Pd/C under hydrogen. That's hydrogenation, right? So Pd/C is a catalyst for hydrogenation. The question says one equivalent of hydrogen is consumed. I think hydrogenation of limonene would add hydrogen across the double bond. Limonene has a double bond in the ring, so hydrogenation would saturate it, turning it into cyclohexane.

But wait, limonene is (R) configuration. So when we hydrogenate it, what happens? The hydrogenation of a double bond can lead to either syn or anti addition, but since it's a ring, the addition would be adding hydrogens across the double bond, making the ring fully saturated. So the product after hydrogenation would be a cyclohexane ring with the substituents as in limonene, but without the double bond.

Wait, limonene's structure is a substituted cyclohexene. So let me think: limonene is (R)-configuration, so when hydrogenated, it becomes a cyclohexane with a methyl group and a couple of other substituents. The hydrogenation would add two hydrogens across the double bond, turning it into a single bond.

So product 1 is that hydrogenated limonene. Let me try to imagine the structure. Limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, but wait, wait, maybe I got that wrong. No, limonene is a monocyclic compound. So it's a cyclohexene ring with a substituent, like a methyl group and perhaps an isopropyl or something else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up limonene's structure. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I remember it's a cyclic monoterpene with a specific configuration. Limonene has a structure where cyclohexene has a
