Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again and then break it down.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The goal is to figure out its chemical formula from the given options.

Alright, the FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. A broad peak here suggests there's an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid group because they have strong hydrogen-bonding. But wait, the presence of a broad peak in FTIR could also be from an -OH group, like in an alcohol or phenol. Since it's broad, maybe it's an alcohol because carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong peak, but maybe in this case, it's not strong enough. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure yet.

Then, there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 region is typically where carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc.) show up. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with some conjugation, like a conjugated carbonyl or a C=C. Wait, another thought: sometimes, aromatic rings don't show up as strong peaks in IR, but maybe if there's conjugation, the peak would be around 1600. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl like an ester or a ketone with some resonance. Or perhaps it's a C=C stretch. The 1700 is probably the main carbonyl.

In the 1H NMR, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So, the compound has an alkene group. That makes me think of something with a double bond, like an ester or a ketone with an alkene nearby.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass. Let me think about what fragments have a mass of 45. One possibility is a methyl group with some oxygen. Wait, 45 is CH3O... wait, no, wait. Wait, molecular weight 45 would be C3H7O (like isopropyl ether?), but wait, another thought: 45 could also be the tropylium ion (C7H7+?), but that's higher. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like (CH2)2O, but that's 44. Hmm, another thought: 45 could be the loss of a methyl group from something. Alternatively, maybe a CH3CO+ ion, but that's 43. Wait, so maybe the fragment is the CH2=CH-O- group? Or perhaps it's a carbonyl group with some loss.

Wait, wait, another approach: the molecular formula options are all C6, so the molecular weight would be 6*12=72 plus H and O. Let me think about each option's molecular weight.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116.

Option B: C6H10O. 72 +10 +16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. 72+10+32=114.

Option D: C6H12O. 72+12+16=100.

In mass spec, the base peak is often the molecular ion. But the question says that the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. So, perhaps the molecular ion is higher, but a fragment breaks off to give 45.

Wait, 45 is a common fragment for a propyl group maybe. Alternatively, think about what the base peak could be. If the molecular formula is C6H12O2, the molecular weight is 116. So, if a fragment loses a group with molecular weight 71 (116-45=71?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a smaller piece.

Wait, another approach: 45 could be the molecular ion of a smaller fragment. For example, someone talking about acetone (propan-2-one) has a molecular ion of 58 (45 +13?), but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene group or something.

Wait, another thought: the peak at 45 could be due to a ketone group. Let's see: if the compound is something like an ester, which has a carbonyl group. For example, ethyl acetate is an ester with formula C4H8O2. But our options are for C6. So, maybe an ester with a longer chain. Suppose the ester group is present, which would have a carbonyl. Then, in mass spec, the ester can fragment in certain ways.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the mass spec. Let's go back to the other data.

The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an -OH group. Then two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is likely a carbonyl, maybe an ester or ketone. 1650 could be another carbonyl or a conjugated double bond. But wait, if there's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1740-1700, so that fits. But then why another peak at 1650? Maybe another carbonyl group, but that's less likely. Alternatively, 1650 could be a C=C stretch. Let me think: in IR, a C=C double bond typically absorbs around 1640-1600 cm-1. So, that would make sense. So, the compound has both a carbonyl group and a double bond (vinyl hydrogens). So, maybe it's an ester with a double bond.

So, looking back, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So, the compound has a double bond, probably between two CH2 groups or something similar.

Putting this together: the compound has an -OH group (from the broad peak), a carbonyl (from 1700), a double bond (from 1650 and NMR), and possibly an ester group if the carbonyl is from there.

Wait, but the presence of an -OH and an ester group would suggest something like a carboxylic acid ester. Or maybe a hemiacetal? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the compound could be an aliphatic ester with an adjacent double bond. For example, something like methyl vinyl ether, but that would have a different formula. Wait, but the options given are all C6, so perhaps it's a cyclic ester or something else.

Wait, another angle: the fragment peak at 45 in the mass spec. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 could correspond to (CH3)2CO (acetone) but that's 58, so that's not right. Alternatively, maybe a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, maybe the fragment is a CH2CH2O group or something. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of C3H7O. Hmm, but perhaps it's an ethyl group with some oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CH2O+ ion? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: Cl might have a fragment at 45, but I don't see Cl in the options. Alternatively, maybe a CH2=CH-O group. Let me calculate the molecular weight of that. CH2=CH-O is C2H3O. Wait, 2 carbons would be 24, H3 is 3, O is 16. Total is 24+3+16=43, which is close to 45 but not exactly. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone group. Suppose the molecule breaks into a ketone and another part. For example, acetone has a molecular weight of 58, which is higher than 45. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options. Let's look at each possible formula and see which one fits the data.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation would be (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, so (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So, one degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond. So, one degree is from the double bond, but in option A, the formula would have one degree, so that would require either a ring or a double bond, but not both. But our compound has a double bond (from NMR) and a carbonyl (so another double bond or ring). Wait, but in option A, the degree is 1, which could be a double bond. But wait, if the compound has both a carbonyl (double bond) and a double bond from the vinyl group, that would require two degrees, which would only be possible if the formula has two degrees. Let me check.

Wait, the degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For option A: 2*6 +2=14. 14-12=2. 2/2=1. So one degree. So, either one ring plus one double bond, but that's two degrees, which would require the calculation to be 2. So, option A only allows one ring or one double bond. But the compound has two double bonds: one from the carbonyl (C=O) and one from the vinyl group (C=C). That would require two degrees of unsaturation. So, if the formula has two degrees, the calculation would be (2*6 +2 - H - X + N)/2 = (14 - H)/2. For two degrees, (14 - H)/2=2 → 14 - H=4 → H=10.

Looking at each option:

Option A: C6H12O2 → H=12 → 14-12=2 → 1 degree.

Option B: C6H10O → 14-10=4 → 2 degrees.

Option C: C6H10O2 → 14-10=4 → 2 degrees.

Option D: C6H12O → 14-12=2 → 1 degree.

Wait, so the compound has a C=C and a C=O, which are two double bonds. So the degree of unsaturation must be 2. So looking at the options, B and C have H=10, giving 2 degrees. So options B and C are possibilities.

So, the compound must have two degrees of unsaturation, so the options are B and C.

Now, back to the data. The IR shows a broad peak at 3000 (likely OH), a strong peak at 1700 (carbonyl), and 1650 (likely another carbonyl or C=C). The NMR shows vinyl H, so we have a C=C. So, maybe it's a di-ester or has another functional group.

Wait, but how does that fit with the formula options? Let's think about each possible option.

Option B: C6H10O. What functional groups can that have? Maybe a ketone and an alcohol, but then the formula would have O, but the molecular weight is 98. Alternatively, an ester would have two oxygens, so option B can't be an ester because it only has one O. So, perhaps option B is a diol with a double bond? But how would that fit the IR data.

Option C: C6H10O2. This allows for two oxygen-containing functional groups. Like an ester (which has two oxygens) and a double bond. Or maybe a ketone and an ester, but that would require more oxygens. Wait, no: an ester has two oxygens, so if the molecule has an ester group and a double bond, that would fit. So, perhaps the compound is an ester with a double bond. For example, something like methyl vinyl something. Wait, but the formula is C6H10O2. Let me think of a structure. Maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Alternatively, an ester with an adjacent double bond.

So, for example, methyl cyclohexene carbonate? Not sure, but the key is that the formula has two oxygens, which fits an ester group.

So, IR shows an OH group (broad peak), which would not be present in an ester. Wait, esters don't have OH groups. Oh wait, wait a minute. If the ester is an ethyl acetate type, it's an ester without an OH group. But in the IR, there's a broad peak at 3000, which is indicative of an OH. So, maybe the compound has both an ester group and an OH group. But that would require more oxygens. Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a carboxylic acid. Then, the IR would show a very broad peak at around 2500-3300, which fits the 3000 region. But carboxylic acids have two O-H groups (but in the case of a monoacid, only one). However, the NMR would show broad peaks for the O-H, but the question says the NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl H. So, maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond. But let's check the options.

If the compound is a carboxylic acid, the formula would have O2 as well. For example, C6H10O2 would fit, which is option C. But let's think about the IR: a carboxylic acid would have a very broad, strong absorption around 2500-3300, which is consistent with the 3000 peak. But then, the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is around 1700, which matches the first peak. The second peak at 1650 could be due to the C-OH stretch in the carboxylic acid, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be from the C=C.

But wait, if the compound is a carboxylic acid ester, but that would have two O's. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which is probably an -OH group. So, the compound is either an alcohol, phenol, or carboxylic acid. Then, the 1700 peak suggests a carbonyl. So, if it's an alcohol with a carbonyl, maybe a ketone. But then, where is the other O?

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with an alcohol group, but that would require more O's. Let's check the options. Option C has two O's. So, if it's an ester (which has two O's), then the O's are accounted for. But then, where is the OH group in the IR? That would mean the compound has both an ester and an OH group, which would require three O's. Because an ester is R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R', which has two O's in the ester group. So, if the compound is an ester plus an OH elsewhere, that would make three O's. But looking at the options, options A and C have two O's, options B and D have one or two.

Wait, no, option C has two O's. So, if the compound has an ester group (two O's) and an OH group, which would require three O's, but the options don't have three. So that can't be. Therefore, the broad peak at 3000 can't come from an -OH in an alcohol if the formula only has two O's. So, perhaps the broad peak is not from an -OH but from something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the broad peak at 3000 is from an -NH group, but then the formula wouldn't have N. Hmm. Or maybe it's from an alkyne C-H stretch, but I don't think alkynes have such broad peaks. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the broad peak could be from an amine, but the formula doesn't have N. So, probably not.

So, perhaps the compound is a carboxylic acid. Let's think about that. A carboxylic acid would have a broad peak in IR around 2500-3300 due to O-H stretching. So, that fits the 3000 peak. The 1700 peak would be the C=O stretch of the carboxylic acid. Then, the 1650 peak could be from a conjugated carbonyl or a C=C.

But then, the formula would be C6H10O2 because a carboxylic acid has formula RCOOH, which is CnH2nO2. For n=6, it would be C6H12O2 (since 2n=12), but wait, that's option A. Wait, but option A is C6H12O2, which would be a 6-carbon carboxylic acid. But a carboxylic acid with 6 carbons would have formula C6H12O2. So, that's option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the degree of unsaturation for option A is 1, but the compound has a double bond (from the NMR) and a carbonyl (from IR), which would require two degrees. So, that's a problem. Because option A has only one degree of unsaturation, but the compound would need two.

So that can't be. Therefore, the compound can't be a carboxylic acid because that would require two degrees (the C=O and the possible double bond), but the formula only allows one. Hmm.

So, perhaps the compound isn't a carboxylic acid. Let's go back.

The IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which could be an -OH, but if the formula only has two O's (like option C), then perhaps it's an alcohol with another functional group that has a carbonyl.

Wait, option C is C6H10O2. So, if it's an alcohol (with one O) and an ester (with another O), but that would require three O's. Wait, no. An ester is O in the carbonyl and O in the ester group. So, an ester has two O's in the group. So, if the compound is an ester and an alcohol, that would require three O's (if the alcohol is -OH), but the formula only has two O's. So, that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the -OH is part of the ester. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the Mass Spec again. The fragment at m/z=45.

Let me think about possible fragments. 45 is 45 g/mol. So, what has a molecular weight of 45? Let's think about common ions.

- CH3COOH (32?), no. Wait, no, molecular weight of acetic acid is 60. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the base peak might be the molecular ion. So, if the molecular weight is around 116 (option A), 114 (option C), 100 (option D), or 98 (option B). The fragment at 45 is a smaller ion, so perhaps it's a neutral loss or a charged fragment.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formula and possible cleavage. For example, if the compound is an ester, perhaps it breaks into the alkoxy part and the acylium part. For instance, if the ester is R-O-CO-R', then perhaps it fragments into R-O and CO-R' parts. Let me think about the mass of each.

But perhaps it's easier to think of some specific structures. For example, if the compound is methyl cyclohexene carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene (CH2=CO), but that's 58. Hmm.

Wait, wait, 45: maybe it's the loss of a propyl group (C3H7) but with some oxygen. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, 45 could be the molecular weight of a vinyl group with some oxygen. For example, CH2=CHO-O-R. Hmm, not quite.

Wait, another thought: 45 could be the acetate ion (CH3COO-), which has a molecular weight of 60. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe (CH3)2CO (acetone) is 58, but 45 is lower.

Hmm, maybe the fragment is a methyl group (15) plus something else, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound has a CH2=CH-O-R group, which could fragment to give a CH2=CH-O- group (mass 45? Let's see: CH2=CH-O would be C2H3O. C=12, H=1, O=16. So 2*12 +3*1 +16 = 24+3+16=43. Close to 45, but not exact. Could it be CH2=CH-OH (which is 45: 2C, 4H, 1O, 1H? Wait, CH2=CH-OH is formaldehyde but not sure. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is the loss of a propyl group (C3H7) which has molecular weight 43, but again, not matching 45. Alternatively, maybe a (CH2)2O group, which is 44. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to an oxygen, but I'm not making progress here.

Let me try to think about the options again. Since the compound must have two degrees of unsaturation (from the earlier analysis), the possible options are B and C.

Option B: C6H10O. So, two degrees could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two degrees could be two double bonds (like a diene and a carbonyl), a ring and a carbonyl, etc.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. The IR shows a carbonyl, which is another double bond. So, that's two degrees, so the formula must have two degrees. So, both B and C are possibilities.

But the IR has a broad peak, which suggests an -OH group. So, in option B, which is C6H10O, the compound would have an -OH group and another functional group with a carbonyl. But option B only has one O, so if there's a carbonyl, that would require another O. So, that's a problem.

Wait, in option B, the formula is C6H10O. So, if the compound has a carbonyl group (like a ketone), which requires an O, but the formula already has one O. So, the rest of the structure would have to account for that. But then, where is the OH group? Because the IR shows a broad peak, which would be the O-H stretch.

So, for option B, the compound would have a ketone (C=O) and an -OH group. That would fit the IR data: broad peak from -OH, and strong peak at 1700 from the ketone. The NMR shows vinyl H, so there's a double bond. Then, the molecular formula would have the degrees of unsaturation:

C6H10O → degrees = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So, two degrees, which would be a double bond (from the vinyl) and the ketone (another double bond). That works.

So, the structure could be something like a cyclohexenol with a ketone. Or maybe a dienone. But wait, the formula is C6H10O, which would have a degree of unsaturation of 2, which could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Alternatively, the structure could be a cyclic ketone with a double bond. For example, something like cyclohexenone. But cyclohexenone would have the formula C6H10O, right? Because cyclohexenone is C6H10O. So, that fits option B.

But then, what about the IR spectrum? Cyclohexenone would have a strong C=O peak around 1700, which fits. But where is the broad peak at 3000? Cyclohexenone doesn't have an -OH group, so the IR shouldn't show a broad peak. Hmm, that's a problem. So, that suggests option B might not be the correct one.

So, perhaps option C is better.

Option C is C6H10O2. So, two oxygens. The structure could be an ester with a double bond. Let's say it's a vinyl ester. For example, something like methyl vinyl benzoate, but let's see the formula.

Wait, methyl vinyl ester would be R-O-CO-OCH2CH2. Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So, for example, methyl vinyl ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH3, but let me check the formula.

Wait, CH2=CHCOOCH3 would be C4H6O2. But our formula is C6H10O2. Hmm, so perhaps a longer chain.

Alternatively, it could be a cyclic ester, like a lactone. For example, a six-membered ring lactone would have a structure like (CH2)4COO, but that would be C6H10O2. So, that fits.

In that case, the IR would have a carbonyl (lactone) around 1700, and perhaps a conjugated C=C (from the ring) around 1650. But wait, lactones are cyclic esters, so their carbonyl peaks are usually around 1750-1700, which fits. The 1650 peak could be from the conjugated double bond in the ring. The broad peak at 3000 cm-1 might not fit because lactones don't have an -OH group. Hmm, that's a problem again.

Wait, maybe the compound is a diester. Or perhaps it's a substituted ester with an -OH group elsewhere. But that would require more oxygens.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a ketone and an ester, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another thought: the compound could be a hemiacetal, which has both an -OH and a carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a beta-keto ester. For example, something like ethyl acetoacetate, which has both a ketone and an ester group. Let's check the formula. Ethyl acetoacetate is CH3C(O)CH2COOCH2CH3. The formula would be C6H10O3. Oh, but that's three oxygens, and our options don't have that. So, it can't be that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to summarize:

- Broad IR peak at 3000 → likely -OH.
- Strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 → likely carbonyl and possibly C=C.
- NMR shows vinyl H → C=C present.
- Mass spec fragment at 45 → maybe a methyl group or similar.

So, from the IR data, the compound has an -OH. So, the formula must have at least one O for the -OH.

Looking at options:

- A: C6H12O2 → two O's. Could have an ester and an -OH, but that would require three O's, which isn't possible. Alternatively, maybe a single O in the -OH and another in a carbonyl, but let's see.

Wait, if the compound is an alcohol with a carbonyl group, like a ketone, then the formula would have O's accounted for. Let's see option D: C6H12O. That's one O.

The degrees of unsaturation for option D: (14-12)/2=1. So, one double bond or ring. But we have a C=C (from NMR) and a carbonyl (from IR), which would require two degrees. So, option D is out.

Option B: C6H10O → two degrees. So, a double bond and another (like a ring or another double bond). But the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe a ketone and a double bond. But then the IR would have a broad peak from an -OH, which would require an -OH group. So, the structure could be something like cyclohexenol with a ketone. Wait, but that would be two O's. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, maybe the compound is a phenol with a carbonyl group. For example, a substituted phenol with a ketone. But phenols have a broad peak around 3000, and the carbonyl would be around 1700. However, the options don't include benzene rings, I think, because the formulas are all C6H... with no indication of aromatic H's in the NMR. Wait, the NMR has vinyl H's, which are alkenes, not aromatic.

Alternatively, the structure could be a dienol with a carbonyl. Not sure.

Maybe I should focus on the mass spec again. The fragment at 45 could come from a CH3CO (acetone is 58, but that's not 45). Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2=CH-O group. Wait, the molecular weight of CH2=CH-O is (12*2)+(1*4)+16 = 24+4+16=44. Close to 45. Could that be it? So, if the compound has a CH2=CH-O group, perhaps as part of an ester or ether.

Wait, if the compound is an ether with a double bond, like CH2=CH-O-R, then the fragment could be the CH2=CH-O group. The mass would be 44, but the peak is at 45. Hmm, perhaps the R group has a methyl, making it CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3? The molecular formula would be C5H10O, but that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to something else. Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the compound is one of the options. Let's calculate the possible mass for each and see which could give a fragment of 45.

Option A: 116. If the molecular ion is at 116, a fragment losing 71 would leave 45. What's 71? That's a group with molecular weight 71. Not sure.

Option B: 98. A fragment of 45 would imply losing 53. Not sure.

Option C: 114. Losing 69 → 45. Not sure.

Option D: 100. Losing 55 →45. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a smaller group within the molecule.

Wait, maybe the fragment corresponds to a CH3COOH group. But that's 60. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the loss of a (CH2)2O group (44), but again, not matching 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH2=CH-OH group, which would have a mass of 45 (C2H4O). Let's calculate: C=12*2=24, H=4, O=16. 24+4+16=44. Close but not 45. Could it be a CH2=CH-O- group (which would be 44) plus a hydrogen? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2=CH2 group (28) plus something else, but not matching.

Hmm, I'm not making progress on the mass spec part. Let me try to think of a different angle.

The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests that the compound has a double bond adjacent to an electronegative group, perhaps. For example, in an ester, the double bond might be next to the ester oxygen, leading to deshielded protons that appear downfield.

So, perhaps the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOO-R. That would have the structure with a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. The IR would show a strong peak at 1700 (carbonyl) and around 1650 (conjugated double bond). The broad peak at 3000 might still be an issue unless the compound has an -OH group.

Wait, let's think of the formula. If the compound is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3 (that's a pentyl group), the formula would be C6H10O2, which matches option C.

So, structure would be CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is a four-carbon chain (but wait, that would be C6H10O2. Let's see: CH2=CHCOO- has 4 carbons, and R is ethyl (C2H5), making the total C=4+2=6. So, the formula would be C6H10O2.

So, in this case, the IR would have a carbonyl at 1700 and the conjugated double bond at 1650. The presence of vinyl H in NMR fits.

The broad peak at 3000 in IR could be from an -OH group. Wait, but in this structure, there's no -OH. So, that's a problem.

Hmm, maybe the ester is part of a cyclic structure that includes an -OH. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a diester, but that would have more O's.

Alternatively, maybe the structure has an -OH and an ester group. But that would require three O's, which the options don't have.

Wait, another possibility: the broad peak at 3000 isn't from an -OH but from an alkyne C-H stretch. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe it's from an amide, but the options don't have N.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let me try to piece it together again.

The data points:

1. IR: Broad peak at 3000 → likely -OH. So, the compound has an -OH group.

2. IR: Peaks at 1700 (carbonyl) and 1650 (possibly C=C or another carbonyl).

3. NMR: Vinyl H → C=C present.

4. Mass spec: fragment at 45.

So, the compound must have:

- An -OH group.

- A carbonyl group.

- A C=C.

So, the formula must have O's to account for these.

Looking at the options, the only options with two O's are A and C.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (14-12)/2=1. But the presence of two double bonds (C=C and C=O) would require two degrees. So, can't be option A.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (14-10)/2=2. So, two degrees, which would fit the two double bonds (C=C and C=O).

So, the structure would have both a C=C and a C=O, and an -OH.

But how? Let me think about possible structures.

One possibility is a substituted cyclohexenone with an -OH group. For example, something like 3-hydroxy-2-penten-4-one. Wait, but the formula would need to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted acrylate with an -OH group. For example, hydroxyethyl acrylate or something like that.

Wait, another idea: the compound could be a β-keto alcohol. For example, something like CH2(CO-O-R)CH2OH. Not sure, but let's check the formula.

If R is a methyl group, then the formula would be C5H8O3, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Another possibility: the compound is a vinyl alcohol ester. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihydroxy compound with a carbonyl, but that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps it's a hemiacetal. Hemiacetals have an -OH and a carbonyl. Let's imagine a structure like that. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but let's think of the formula. C6H10O2: two O's. So, the structure must have an -OH and another O in a carbonyl group.

So, the structure could be something like CH2=CHCO-O-R, but that's an ester and doesn't have an -OH. Alternatively, perhaps it's a glycolic acid derivative. Not sure.

Another approach: the NMR shows vinyl H's, which are usually split into a certain pattern. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Wait, the mass spec: if the compound is C6H10O2, the molecular weight is 114. If the fragment is at 45, perhaps the molecule breaks into a 45 fragment and another part. For example, maybe a (CH2)2COO group (which is 72) and a CH2=CH group (28), but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the loss of a (CH2)2CO group, which would be 58, but again, not matching.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck. Let me try to think again.

The key points are:

- Two degrees of unsaturation → options B and C.

- IR shows OH, carbonyl, and C=C.

Thus, the compound has -OH, C=O, and C=C. So, it must have three functional groups, but the formula can only account for two O's. Wait, that can't be. So, perhaps the OH is part of the same group as the carbonyl.

Wait, no, that's not possible. Because -OH can't be part of a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe the compound is a ketone with an adjacent double bond and an -OH group. For example, something like CH2=C(OH)CO-R. But then, the formula would need to fit.

Let me think about the formula. Suppose the structure is CH2=C(OH)COO-R. That would have three O's, which would require the formula to have three O's, but our options don't have that.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclohexenol with a ketone substituent. For example, cyclohexen-2-one-ol. The formula would be C6H10O2. Because cyclohexenol (C6H10O) plus a ketone (another O) would be C6H10O2.

In that case, the IR would show the broad peak from the -OH, the strong peak at 1700 from the ketone, and a peak at 1650 from the conjugated C=C in the ring. The NMR would show vinyl H's from the double bond. The mass spec fragment at 45 could be from a part of the molecule breaking off, perhaps a CH2=CH-O group, but I'm not certain.

So, if option C is the correct formula, that fits. So, the answer would be C) C6H10O2.


The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on FTIR, $^1$H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Data**:
   - A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm$^{-1}$** suggests the presence of an **-OH group**.
   - Strong peaks at **1700 cm$^{-1}$** and **1650 cm$^{-1}$** indicate the presence of a **carbonyl group** (C=O) and possibly a **conjugated C=C bond**.

2. **$^1$H NMR Data**:
   - Peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** indicate the presence of a **C=C bond**.

3. **Mass Spectrometry Data**:
   - A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests a smaller fragment with a molecular weight of 45.

4. **Chemical Formula Options**:
   - **A) C$_6$H$_{12}$O$_2$**: Molecular weight = 116, degree of unsaturation = 1.
   - **B) C$_6$H$_{10}$O**: Molecular weight = 98, degree of unsaturation = 2.
   - **C) C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$**: Molecular weight = 114, degree of unsaturation = 2.
   - **D) C$_6$H$_{12}$O**: Molecular weight = 100, degree of unsaturation = 1.

### Critical Evaluation:
- The compound must have **two degrees of unsaturation** to account for the **C=C bond** (from NMR) and the **C=O bond** (from IR). This eliminates **A** and **D**, as they only have one degree of unsaturation.
- The broad IR peak at **3000 cm$^{-1}$** indicates the presence of an **-OH group**, which requires at least one oxygen atom. This eliminates **B**, as it only has one oxygen atom, insufficient to account for both the **-OH group** and the **C=O group**.
- The remaining option is **C (C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$)**, which has two oxygen atoms. This allows for both an **-OH group** and a **C=O group**. The two degrees of unsaturation match the observed **C=C bond** and **C=O bond**.

### Structural Consideration:
A plausible structure for **C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$** is a compound with an **-OH group**, a **C=O group**, and a **C=C bond**. This could be a substituted cyclohexenone with an additional hydroxyl group, such as a **cyclohexenol derivative**. The IR spectrum aligns with this structure: the broad peak at 3000 cm$^{-1}$ corresponds to the **-OH group**, the strong peak at 1700 cm$^{-1}$ corresponds to the **C=O group**, and the peak at 1650 cm$^{-1}$ corresponds to the **conjugated C=C bond**.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with the formula **C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$**, corresponding to option **C**.

**Answer: C**
