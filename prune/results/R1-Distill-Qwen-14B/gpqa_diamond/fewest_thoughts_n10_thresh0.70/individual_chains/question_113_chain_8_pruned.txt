Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let me start by looking at the given information. The compound's characterization includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's go through each part one by one.

The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak in that region typically indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, another strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. Oh, that's around the carbonyl region. A peak there usually means a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, there's also a peak at 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, that's a bit lower than the usual 1700 for carbonyl. Could that be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds? Like in a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ester? Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl like in a ketone with some electron-withdrawing groups, which can lower the wavenumber.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones in a double bond, like CH₂=CH. So the structure probably has a double bond. That could be from an alkene, maybe in an ester group or part of a ring.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z=45. I'm trying to remember what fragments correspond to that. 45 is a common mass. Let's think: maybe it's (CH3)2O, which is ether; but more likely, it's the fragment from a carbonyl group. Wait, 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but no, that's higher. Alternatively, maybe a ketene ion or some cleavage product. Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be from an acetyl group, like CH3CO+, which is 43 (but wait, 43 is (CH3)2O+?), no. Alternatively, the fragment could be from a methyl ester or something else. Hmm, maybe I
