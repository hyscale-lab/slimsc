Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. But wait, the problem is about luminosity, so maybe the mass doesn't come into play here directly? Or does it? Hmm, I'll keep that in mind.

The astronomers found that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a star's emission depends on its temperature. Using Wien's Law, which says lambda_max * T = constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because lambda_max is proportional to 1/T, so same lambda_max implies same T. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but why would their temperatures be the same if their masses and radii are different? Oh, maybe because they're main-sequence stars, where more massive stars are hotter and larger. But wait, in this case, their peak wavelengths are the same, so same T. Interesting. So Star_1 and Star_2 have the same temperature.

But how does that affect their luminosity? I remember the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says that the luminosity L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. So L = 4πσR²T⁴. Since both have the same T, the ratio of their luminosities would be (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But since T1 = T2, the T terms cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Wait, but R1 is 1.5 times R2. So R1/R2 is 1.5, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2, which would be option A. But wait, the options don't have 2.25 as one of the higher options. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. So option A is exactly 2.25. But why is that not the answer? Did I miss something?

Wait, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So the question is asking what that factor is. If I used L1 = (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4/T2^4), and since T1=T2, it's just (1.5)^2 = 2.25, so L1 is 2.25 times L2. So option A would be the answer.

But wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect luminosity? Hmm, radial velocity is about the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But wait, how does that influence the calculation of luminosity as a black body?

Wait, no, because when we calculate luminosity using the black body formula, we're considering the intrinsic properties (radius and temperature) of the star. The radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift, but not the intrinsic luminosity. So the observed brightness (apparent brightness) would be affected by distance, but the problem states that the stars are radiating as black bodies, so we're considering their intrinsic luminosity, not apparent brightness. So the radial velocity doesn't directly affect the calculation of luminosity in this scenario. Thus, the radial velocity data might be a red herring or perhaps it's not needed here.

So the conclusion is that the luminosity ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but looking back, the options also have D) ~2.23. Could I have made a mistake in using R^2? Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something about the black body radiation curve. The peak wavelength is given by Wien's law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures are the same. Then, the luminosity is indeed given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, so the ratio is (R1/R2)^2, which is 2.25.

But why are the other options close to that value? Maybe I'm forgetting something else. Wait, the question says "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies." So, that part is correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the same peak wavelength in the same frame. Because the Doppler shift could affect the observed wavelength. Oh, wait! If the star is moving towards us (positive radial velocity), the observed wavelengths are blueshifted. So the observed peak wavelength would be shorter than the intrinsic. Similarly, if moving away, it's redshifted.

In the problem, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its intrinsic. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but which direction? The question says radial velocities are 0 and 700. So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s (assuming positive is away). So its observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted) than its intrinsic.

But the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, so the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same. So for Star_2, the intrinsic lambda_max would be different. Because of the Doppler shift, the observed lambda_max is shifted.

So let me think again. The observed lambda_max for Star_1 is its intrinsic lambda_max, because its radial velocity is zero. For Star_2, the observed lambda_max is longer (redshifted) due to its velocity. But the problem says the observed lambda_max for both is the same. Wait no, the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that's the observed lambda_max. So they have the same observed lambda_max.

So for Star_1, lambda_obs,1 = lambda_1. For Star_2, lambda_obs,2 = lambda_2 = lambda_1. But lambda_obs depends on the intrinsic lambda and the Doppler shift. So we can write lambda_obs = lambda_intrinsic * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity.

Wait, but the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_0 * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is positive if moving away. So for Star_2, which has v_r = +700 km/s, its observed lambda is longer than its intrinsic.

But in the problem, the observed lambda for both stars is the same. So lambda_obs,1 = lambda_obs,2. So Star_1's lambda_intrinsic is equal to lambda_obs,1. Star_2's lambda_obs is longer due to its velocity.

So let's write the equations. For Star_1: lambda_obs1 = lambda1 (since v_r1 = 0). For Star_2: lambda_obs2 = lambda2 * (1 + v_r2 / c).

But the problem states that lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2. So, lambda1 = lambda2 * (1 + v_r2 / c). So lambda1 = lambda2 * (1 + (700e3 m/s)/c). Let me compute that.

Wait, but the speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s, so 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s? Wait, no—wait, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. So c is 3e5 km/s = 3e8 m/s. So 700,000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = approximately 0.002333.

So 1 + v_r2/c ≈ 1 + 0.002333 ≈ 1.002333.

So lambda1 ≈ lambda2 * 1.002333.

So lambda2 ≈ lambda1 / 1.002333 ≈ lambda1 * (1 - 0.002327) approximately, using 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x.

But wait, for Star_1 and Star_2, their intrinsic temperatures are related to their intrinsic lambda_max via Wien's law.

So lambda_max = b / T. So for Star_1, T1 = b / lambda1. For Star_2, T2 = b / lambda2.

So T1 = b / lambda1, T2 = b / lambda2.

But from earlier, lambda2 = lambda1 / 1.002333.

So T2 = b / (lambda1 / 1.002333) ) = (b * 1.002333 ) / lambda1 = 1.002333 * (b/lambda1) ) = 1.002333 * T1.

So T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So the temperature of Star_2 is higher than that of Star_1 by a factor of approximately 1.002333.

Wait, but earlier I thought both stars have the same temperature because they appear brightest at the same wavelength. But now, considering the Doppler effect, their intrinsic temperatures are different.

So now, the luminosity of each star is L = 4π σ R^2 T^4.

So L1 = 4π σ (R1)^2 T1^4.

L2 = 4π σ (R2)^2 T2^4.

We're told that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1 = 1.5 R2 → R2 = (2/3) R1.

So, let's compute the ratio L1 / L2.

L1/L2 = [ (R1^2 T1^4 ) ] / [ (R2^2 T2^4 ) ]

Since R2 = (2/3) R1, then R1 = 1.5 R2 → R2 = R1 / 1.5.

So R2 = (2/3) R1.

So R2 = (2/3) R1 → R2^2 = (4/9) R1^2.

So plugging into L1/L2:

L1/L2 = [ (R1^2 T1^4) ] / [ ( (4/9 R1^2) ) ( T2^4 ) ) ]

= ( R1^2 / (4/9 R1^2) ) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (9/4) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 )

Wait, because R1^2 / ( (4/9) R1^2 ) ) = (1) / (4/9) ) = 9/4.

So L1/L2 = (9/4) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

But we found earlier that T2 = T1 * 1.002333. So T1 = T2 / 1.002333.

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-express T2 in terms of T1.

Earlier, T2 = (b) / lambda2. And lambda2 = lambda1 / 1.002333.

So T2 = (b ) / (lambda1 / 1.002333 ) ) = (b * 1.002333 ) / lambda1 = 1.002333 * (b/lambda1 ) = 1.002333 * T1.

So T2 = 1.002333 T1.

Thus, T1 = T2 / 1.002333.

Wait, but in the ratio L1/L2, we have T1^4 / T2^4.

Which is (T1 / T2)^4 = (1 / 1.002333 )^4.

So, substituting back into L1/L2:

L1/L2 = (9/4) * (1 / (1.002333)^4 )

Compute (1.002333)^4. Let's compute 1.002333^2 first.

1.002333^2 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.002333) + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1.004666 + 0.00000544 ≈ 1.00467144.

Then, square that to get to the 4th power: (1.00467144)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.00467144) + (0.00467144)^2 ≈ 1.00934288 + 0.00002182 ≈ 1.0093647.

So, (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.0093647.

Therefore, 1 / (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 / 1.0093647 ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 ≈ (9/4) * 0.9907.

Wait, 9/4 is 2.25. So 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.2278.

So approximately 2.23. That would round to option D) ~2.23.

Wait, but earlier I thought without considering the Doppler shift, the ratio was 2.25. But now, considering the Doppler shift, it's about 2.23. So the correct answer is D.

But why did the problem mention the radial velocities? Because without considering the Doppler shift, the initial approach would have given 2.25, but the correct approach (accounting for the fact that the observed lambda_max is the same for both stars) requires considering the Doppler effect, which adjusts the temperatures, leading to a slightly lower ratio.

So the correct answer is D) ~2.23.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the problem using the Stefan-Boltzmann law and account for the Doppler shift due to the radial velocities of the stars.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius of Star_1: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
   - Mass of Star_1: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \) (not directly relevant to luminosity)
   - Radial velocity of Star_1: \( v_{r1} = 0 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Radial velocity of Star_2: \( v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Both stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)).

2. **Luminosity Formula**:
   The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
   \[
   L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]
   where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The ratio of luminosities is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]

3. **Temperature Relation**:
   Using Wien's law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
   \]
   Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)), the intrinsic temperatures of the stars are related by the Doppler shift. For Star_2, the observed wavelength is redshifted due to its radial velocity:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{2} \left( 1 + \frac{v_{r2}}{c} \right)
   \]
   Solving for the intrinsic wavelength of Star_2:
   \[
   \lambda_2 = \frac{\lambda_1}{1 + \frac{v_{r2}}{c}}
   \]
   Substituting into Wien's law:
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \left( 1 + \frac{v_{r2}}{c} \right)
   \]
   Using \( v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), we find:
   \[
   \frac{v_{r2}}{c} \approx 0.002333 \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_2 \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333
   \]

4. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = 1.002333 T_1 \) into the luminosity ratio:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(R_1^2 T_1^4)}{(R_2^2 T_2^4)} = \frac{(1.5 R_2)^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \frac{T_1^4}{(1.002333 T_1)^4}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{(1.002333)^4}
   \]
   Compute:
   \[
   (1.5)^2 = 2.25, \quad (1.002333)^4 \approx 1.009365, \quad \frac{1}{(1.002333)^4} \approx 0.9907
   \]
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.2278
   \]

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. This accounts for both the difference in radii and the Doppler shift affecting the observed temperatures.
