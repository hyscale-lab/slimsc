Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy of a single particle is E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number. Oh wait, the problem defines E as pi²ℏ²/(2mL²), so each particle's energy is just n² * E. So E_1 would be 1E, E_2 = 4E, E_3 =9E, and so on.

Now, there are four identical spin-1/2 particles. Wait, spin-1/2 particles are fermions, right? So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. But since they are in a 1D well, each quantum state is determined by the quantum number n and the spin. But wait, in a 1D box, spin doesn't affect the energy levels because the energy only depends on n. So I need to consider how the fermions fill up the energy levels.

Wait, each energy level can have a certain number of particles. For each n, how many distinct spin states are there? Spin-1/2 has two possible states: spin-up and spin-down. So each energy level n can hold 2 particles because each can have a different spin state.

So for four particles, I need to fill up the lowest energy levels, making sure that each level can hold up to 2 particles.

Let me list the possible energy levels and how they get filled:

The ground state is the lowest energy. So start with n=1. Since each n can have 2 particles, putting two particles here. Then n=2 can hold two more. But wait, we have four particles, so let's see:

n=1: 2 particles
n=2: 2 particles
Total: 4, so all four are placed in n=1 and n=2.

But wait, wait a second. Wait, no, because n can be 1,2,3, etc. Let me think about the filling order.

Wait, each level can have 2 particles, so the first level (n=1) holds 2, then the next (n=2) holds 2, and that's all four. So in the ground state, the particles are in n=1 and n=2, two each. So the ground state configuration would have two particles in n=1, two in n=2.

Wait, but wait, no, wait. No, no—each n can have two particles (due to spin). So the first energy level (n=1) can have two particles. The second level (n=2) can have two. So for four particles, yes, n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two, and that's all.

Wait, but when you have four particles, the ground state would have two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the
