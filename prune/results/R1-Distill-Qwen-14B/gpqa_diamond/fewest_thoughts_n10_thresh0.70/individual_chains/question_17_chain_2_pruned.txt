Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The problem gives me a concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex and the formation constant, so I should probably use that.

Wait, the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, stoichiometric means that the ratio is 1:1, right? So each mole of Ca-EDTA complex has one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4- or something like that.

The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. Formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formula for the formation constant is Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So when the complex dissociates, it's going to give Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions. Since the solution is 0.02 M of the complex, but in reality, not all of it might dissociate. But wait, wait. If the complex is present in solution, and the pH is ideal, then perhaps the EDTA is already in the form that can form the complex. Oh, but wait, in this case, the
