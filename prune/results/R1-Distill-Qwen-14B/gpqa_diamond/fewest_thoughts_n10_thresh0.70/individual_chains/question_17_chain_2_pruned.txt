Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. So the Ca-EDTA complex is a stable complex. The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution.

Wait, the formula for the complex is important here. If it's stoichiometric, that means the ratio is 1:1 between Ca²+ and EDTA^4- (or the protonated form, depending on pH, but since pH is ideal, maybe the complex is CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA species).

So, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- or the other form, but the K is given, so I can use that.

The formula for the formation constant K is K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). But wait, another thing: since the complex is formed, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, when it dissociates, it produces some Ca²+ and some EDTA.

But wait, wait. The initial concentration is 0.02 M of CaY²−. So, assuming that the complex dissociates as CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4−. The K here is given as 5e10, which is a very large number, so the dissociation is not much. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low.

But wait, how is the K defined? Because sometimes formation constants can be given for the formation of the complex from the ions. So, K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). So, if the solution starts with 0.02 M CaY²−, and assuming negligible dissociation, the concentration of Ca²+ would be roughly K^-1 times [EDTA], but wait, since the initial is pure complex, it's better to model it.

Let me think. Let's consider the dissociation:

CaY²− ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4−

The initial concentrations are [CaY²−] = 0.02 M, [Ca²+] ≈ 0, [Y^4−] ≈ 0. Let x be the amount that dissociates. Then:

[CaY²−] = 0.02 – x ≈ 0.02 (since K is large, x is very small)
[Ca²+] = x
[Y^4−] = x

So K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−}) = (0.02)/(x^2) ) =5e
