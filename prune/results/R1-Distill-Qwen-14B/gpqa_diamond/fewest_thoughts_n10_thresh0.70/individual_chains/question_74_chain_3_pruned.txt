Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about radioactive decay and probability. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows something called the exponential decay law. Let me think about what I know.

The problem says we have an atom that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So after 100 minutes, 32% of the atoms would have decayed on average. Now, they're saying that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, so that's a total of 200 minutes from the start? Or is it 150 minutes from now?

Wait, no, the question says 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. So the remaining time we're considering is 150 minutes from now. So total time would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But maybe I don't need to think in terms of total time. Maybe the decay process is memoryless, so the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes affects the probability for the next 150.

Wait, I remember that the probability of decay in a given time for an exponential process is P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time. Also, the decay constant λ is related to the half-life. Oh wait, but we don't have half-life here, just a known probability for 100 minutes.

So
