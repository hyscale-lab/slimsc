Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me see. Hmm, the problem is about finding probabilities and the average value of a certain operator. Alright, let me read through the question again carefully.

So, the state is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form an orthonormal basis for the spin-1/2 system.

The operator in question has a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. Oh right, that matrix is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix has 0 on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. So the operator A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x, which is the spin in the x-direction.

So the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are the eigenstates of the x-component of spin. Those eigenstates are superpositions of |up> and |down>. So to find the probabilities, I guess I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

Wait, but the question says to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A. So first, I need to find the eigenstates of A, then find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates, and then the probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, its eigenvalues are ±hbar/2. The eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Let's double-check that. Yes, because sigma_x|up> = |down>, and sigma_x|down> = |up>. So the eigenstates |+x> and |-x> are those superpositions.

So to find the probability of measuring +hbar/2 (from A), I need the projection of |alpha> onto |+x>, and similarly for |-x>.

Wait, but the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I think I should first normalize it. Let's compute
