Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux ratio question. Let me start by understanding the problem. The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops, and how that affects the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands.

Wait, I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. The pp-III branch is one part of this process, right? So, if pp-III stops, what happens to the neutrino production?

I think the pp-III branch produces a certain type of neutrinos. Oh right, the pp chain primarily produces electron neutrinos (ν_e) via the reaction where a boron-8 decays into carbon-14 and emits a neutrino. But I'm not sure if that's all there is to it.

So, the Sun emits a lot of neutrinos, and the flux we detect on Earth is a measure of the number per cm² per second. The question is about the ratio of fluxes between two energy bands: band 1 is 700-800 keV, and band 2 is 800-900 keV.

Hmm. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos in a specific energy range. I think the dominant neutrinos from the Sun are from the pp chain, particularly the ones around a few hundred keV. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the energies. Let's recall: The main neutrinos from the pp chain come from the decay of Beryllium-7 to Lithium-7, which emits a neutrino. I think the energy of these neutrinos is around 0.5 MeV, which is 500 keV. So, the neutrinos are in the 400-800 keV range or so. But wait, I'm not certain about the exact energy spread. Or maybe the higher energy ones come from other processes, like the CNO cycle?

Wait, the question says the pp-III branch stops. What's the pp-III branch? The proton-proton chain has a couple of branches. The main pp-I branch goes through steps leading to carbon-12, while the pp-II and pp-III are alternative paths. The pp-III branch involves the fusion of three protons
