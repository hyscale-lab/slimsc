Okay, so I have this question about the color of light absorbed by a textile dye. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when something absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others, right? Like, the color we see is the complement of the absorbed color. Wait, no, actually, the color we see is the color that's not absorbed. So if a substance absorbs blue, it would appear orange because blue and orange are complements. But wait, the question is about what color is absorbed, not what's emitted or what we see.

The question says the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. Oh, right, when a molecule absorbs light, it gets excited, and then it emits light when it goes back to a lower energy state. So the energy of the emitted light corresponds to the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. But wait, what about absorption? The energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy gap between the ground state and an excited state.

So energy of the photon absorbed is E = hc/λ. But wait, in this case, the dye is emitting light at 2.3393 eV. So maybe the energy gap is 2.3393 eV, which would mean that the absorbed photon has that energy. But wait, that can't be right because when the molecule absorbs a photon, that photon's energy is equal to the energy gap. Then when it emits, it might emit a lower energy photon if there are other transitions. Hmm, maybe I should think about the relation between the absorbed and emitted light.

Wait, no. The energy of the emitted photon (the fluorescence or phosphorescence) is less than or equal to the absorbed photon's energy. Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes to a higher energy state, which can then drop to another state, emitting a photon with lower energy. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted one.

So if the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed must be higher. Oh wait, but the problem states that the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. So the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state is higher than that, because perhaps the molecule goes from a higher excited state to a lower one when emitting.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again. The molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs, which causes an electronic transition from a lower energy state (ground) to a higher state. Then, it might emit a photon when it drops to a lower excited state. So the energy of the emitted photon, E_emit, is less than or equal to E_abs.

So if E_emit is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed photon must have higher energy. But the question is asking what color is absorbed, so I need to find the wavelength corresponding to 2.3393 eV and then determine the color. Wait, no, wait. Because the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted one. So the absorbed energy is higher, so the wavelength is shorter.

Wait, but wait. The energy and wavelength are inversely related via E = hc/λ. So higher energy means shorter wavelength. The visible light spectrum has violet (~400 nm) to red (~700 nm). So if the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, what's the wavelength? Let me calculate that.

The energy E is 2.3393 eV. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. But since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, maybe I can compute the wavelength λ using E = hc/λ → λ = hc/(E*1.602e-19).

Wait, E is in eV, so E in J is E * 1.602e-19.

So λ = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (2.3393 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV)

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.746e-19 J

So λ ≈ 1.9878e-25 / 3.746e-19 ≈ 5.3e-7 meters. That's 530 nm. Oh, which is green.

Wait, but wait. The emitted light is 2.3393 eV, which is about 530 nm (green), but the absorbed photon has higher energy. So the absorbed photon must be at a shorter wavelength (blue or violet). Because when a molecule absorbs, it's the higher energy photon.

So the color absorbed is the one with a higher energy, which would correspond to a wavelength shorter than 530 nm. So the absorbed photon is blue or violet, but which one?

Wait, 530 nm is green. So the absorbed photon must be higher energy (shorter wavelength) than that. So let's see, the options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, if the emitted photon is green (530 nm), the absorbed photon is higher energy. So it would be blue or violet. Let me think: which color has higher energy than green? Violet is higher than blue, which is higher than green. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed is higher. So the absorbed photon is in the lower wavelength (higher energy) range.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question is, what color is absorbed? So if the dye emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, which is probably blue or violet.

Wait, but how do you relate the emitted photon's energy to the absorbed. Let's think about the energy levels. The molecule absorbs a photon with energy E_abs to jump from ground state to an excited state. Then, it can emit a photon with energy E_emit when it transitions to a lower excited state or back to the ground state.

Wait, but the energy emitted is equal to the difference between the two states. So E_emit = E_abs - E_other_energy_loss. So E_abs is higher than E_emit.

So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than 2.3393 eV.

So to find the wavelength of the absorbed photon, we can compute λ_abs = hc/(E_abs * e), but wait, we don't have E_abs, we have E_emit. Hmm, perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is: the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Since the molecule can only emit a photon when it drops to a lower energy state, the energy of the emitted photon must be less than the energy of the absorbed photon. So the absorbed photon has a higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

So the absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter than that of the emitted photon. So emitted is 2.3393 eV, which is around 530 nm (green), so the absorbed photon has a shorter wavelength, so higher energy. What color is that?

The visible spectrum goes from violet (400 nm) to red (700 nm). So shorter than 530 nm would be blue, green, or violet. Wait, 530 is green. So the absorbed photon is higher energy, so 400 to 530 nm. So possible colors are violet, blue, or green. But the question gives options: A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So the absorbed photon is in the violet or blue range. So which one?

Wait, let's compute the exact wavelength for 2.3393 eV. Let me do that calculation again.

E = 2.3393 eV.

E in J: 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.746e-19 J.

λ = hc/E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.746e-19) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (3.746e-19) ≈ 5.3e-7 m → 530 nm. So that's green.

So the emitted light is green. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy, which is shorter wavelength. So what is the color of the absorbed photon?

If E_abs > E_emit, then λ_abs < λ_emit.

So for E_abs, let's calculate the wavelength.

Wait, but without knowing E_abs, maybe I can think inversely. The emission is in the green, which is in the middle of the visible spectrum. So the absorbed photon is either blue or violet.

But wait, the options are B) Violet and C) Blue. So the question is, which color is the absorbed light?

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the energy gap between two states is 2.3393 eV. No, wait. No, the energy of the emitted photon is the difference between two states. So when the molecule goes from state 2 to state 1, it emits a photon of energy E = E2 - E1 = 2.3393 eV. So the energy difference is 2.3393 eV. So the molecule absorbed a photon of energy E_abs which is higher.

Wait, no. No, the absorbed photon's energy must be equal to the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state. So E_abs = E_excited - E_ground = (E_ground + E_emit) )? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Let's say the molecule is in the ground state, E_ground. It absorbs a photon of energy E_abs, which takes it to an excited state, E_excited. So E_excited = E_ground + E_abs.

Then, from E_excited, the molecule can drop to another state, say E_second, emitting a photon of energy E_emit = E_excited - E_second.

So E_abs = (E_ground + E_abs) - E_ground. Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, E_abs is the energy of the photon absorbed, which is the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state. Then, the molecule can emit a photon when it transitions to a lower state, which would have E_emit = E_excited - E_second. So the E_abs is the initial excitation, and E_emit is a smaller energy.

But the question states that the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. So E_emit is 2.3393 eV. So E_abs must be higher than that.

So to find the color of the absorbed photon, I need to calculate its wavelength. But since E_abs is higher than 2.3393 eV, the wavelength λ_abs is less than 530 nm (green). So the absorbed photon is in the violet or blue range.

But which one? Let me compute the energy. Let's get the wavelength for 2.3393 eV is 530 nm (green), so the absorbed photon must be higher than that, say, in the blue (around 450-495 nm) or violet (400-450 nm) range.

Wait, but without knowing the exact E_abs, perhaps I can think in terms of the relation between E_abs and E_emit.

Wait, but the question is what color is absorbed. The options are A) Red (long wavelength, lower energy), B) Violet (short), C) Blue (shorter than green), D) Yellow (longer than green). Since the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted (green), it's either blue or violet. So the options B and C are possible.

But the question asks, what color is absorbed. So the dye would absorb a higher energy (shorter wavelength) photon, so the color absorbed is either blue or violet.

Wait, but how do I decide between B and C?

Alternatively, maybe I can think about complementary colors. The emitted color is green. The absorbed color would be the one that's not emitted. Wait, no, that's not the case. Because when a dye emits green, it's because it absorbed a higher energy photon, but the color we see is the emitted color if it's fluorescent, but the question is about absorption.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the energy levels. The molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs, which is higher than the energy E_emit. So E_abs = E_ground to E_excited, and E_emit is from E_excited to another state E_lower.

So the E_abs is the difference between E_ground and E_excited. The E_emit is E_excited to E_lower. So E_abs > E_emit.

So the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed photon is higher than this. So the absorbed photon is in the violet or blue regions.

But without knowing E_abs, I can't be certain whether it's blue or violet.

Wait, let me compute what energy corresponds to each color to see which one is higher than 2.3393 eV.

Let's calculate the energy for violet (around 400 nm) and blue (450 nm).

Energy E = 1240 eV·nm / λ (in nm).

So for violet, λ=400 nm:

E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV.

For blue, λ=450 nm:

E≈1240/450≈2.756 eV.

E_emit is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. So if the absorbed photon is blue, E_abs=2.756 eV. That's higher than 2.3393 eV. Similarly, violet is 3.1 eV, which is higher.

So the absorbed photon could be blue (E=2.756 eV) or violet (3.1 eV).

But the question is, which of the options is the correct one? The options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

Wait, but how can I determine whether the absorbed photon is blue or violet?

Hmm. Another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the energy difference between the ground state and the lower excited state is 2.3393 eV. Therefore, the energy of the absorbed photon is E_abs = E_ground to E_excited, which is higher than E_ground to E_second (assuming E_second is the state from which the emission occurs).

Wait, perhaps the energy gap E_abs is larger than E_emit. So E_abs = E_ground to E_excited.

E_emit = E_excited - E_second.

So E_abs = E_ground + (E_emit + E_second - E_ground). Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is E1 (emission). The energy of the absorbed photon is E2 (absorption), which is higher. So E2 is higher than E1.

So which color is E2? The options are blue or violet. So which one of those is higher in energy than 2.3393 eV.

Blues are around 2.75 eV (as calculated earlier), violet is about 3.1 eV. So both are higher. So how to choose between B and C.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. But that can't be because the absorption would require a higher energy. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the states.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs, and then emits a photon of E_emit. So the energy of E_emit is less than E_abs.

So, for the energy of E_emit, which is 2.3393 eV, we can compute E_abs is higher, which would correspond to a shorter wavelength, so either blue or violet.

But since the options are B) Violet and C) Blue, which is correct?

Wait, looking at the energy levels again. Let's compute E_abs for each color.

Violet: 400 nm → E=1240/400 ≈ 3.1 eV.

Blue: 450 nm→ E=2.756 eV.

So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (530 nm), the absorbed photon could be either blue or violet. But which one is more likely?

Wait, perhaps the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs, which is higher than E_emit. So E_abs could be blue or violet. But without more information, perhaps the answer is violet. Or maybe the question is implying that the emission corresponds to the energy gap, and the absorption is the same energy. Wait, no, because emission is from a lower excited state.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about another approach. I think the question is a bit tricky. The key is that the color absorbed is the one with higher energy than the emitted light. So between blue and violet, violet has higher energy. So if the emitted light is green (530 nm), the absorbed must have higher energy, which would be blue or violet.

But the answer options are B) Violet, C) Blue, etc. So which one is correct?

Wait, let me think of common dyes. Fluorescent dyes like GFP emit green when excited by blue light. So the absorbed light is blue, and emitted is green. So in that case, the absorbed photon is blue, and the emitted is green.

So in this case, the emitted is green (2.3393 eV), so the absorbed is blue (around 2.75 eV). So the answer would be C) Blue.

Wait, but wait. If the emitted is green, the absorbed is blue, then the answer is C) Blue. Or, alternatively, if the dye absorbs violet, which has a higher energy than blue, then emitted could be green.

But without knowing the exact energy, perhaps the correct approach is to compare which photon has higher energy. The question states that the dye emits light of energy 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy.

So among the options, B is violet (3.1 eV) and C is blue (2.75 eV). Both are higher than 2.3393 eV (green). So both are possible, but the question expects one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the energy of the emitted photon as the energy of the absorbed photon. Oh wait, that can't be because absorption and emission are different processes.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of complementary colors. The color emitted is green; the color absorbed would be magenta, but that's not an option. Hmm, but the options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm (green). The energy of the absorbed photon is higher, so the wavelength is shorter. So it must be either blue or violet.

If the question gives options B) Violet and C) Blue, then the correct answer is B) Violet if the absorbed photon is at a higher energy. But wait, wait, no. Because the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted, so the wavelength is shorter. So the absorbed photon could be either blue or violet.

But without knowing the exact energy, perhaps the question expects me to know that the energy is in the blue range. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation of 2.3393 eV gives a wavelength that's in the green, so the absorbed is blue.

Wait, let me think. What is the energy of blue light?

As calculated earlier, blue is about 2.756 eV. The emitted is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed is blue, which is higher. So the answer would be C) Blue.

But wait, another way: emitted light's energy is 2.3393 eV. So the energy gap (E) is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than that, perhaps.

Wait, but if E_abs is 2.3393 eV, then the emitted photon's energy would be less than that. But the question says the dye emits at 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed must be higher.

So the possible colors for the absorbed photon are violet (3.1 eV) or blue (2.756 eV).

But without knowing the exact E_abs, it's hard to choose between B and C. But perhaps the question is trying to get me to recognize that if the emission is 2.3393 eV, the absorption must be in the blue or violet, and the answer is B) Violet.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted photon's energy is the energy difference between the ground state and a lower excited state, while the absorbed photon's energy is the difference between the ground state and a higher excited state.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy of the absorbed photon. But that can't be because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes to a higher state, then emits a lower energy photon when it goes to a lower state.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which implies that the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than that. So among the options, violet and blue are higher. Since blue is 2.756 eV and violet is 3.1 eV, both are higher than 2.3393 eV.

But the question is, which color is the one absorbed? So which of these (blue or violet) is the correct answer. The options are B and C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet because it's higher in energy. But wait, in the example with GFP, the absorbed light is blue and emits green. So the absorbed is higher than emitted. So in that case, blue is the absorbed, which is higher than green.

So if the emitted is green (2.3393 eV), the absorbed is blue (2.756 eV), which is higher. So the answer would be C) Blue.

But wait, let me think again. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm (green). The energy of the absorbed photon is higher (shorter wavelength), so it could be blue (450 nm, 2.756 eV) or violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV). But the question is giving blue and violet as options.

So which one is correct? Without more data, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet because it's the higher energy than blue.

Wait, but no, because blue is higher than green but lower than violet. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed must be higher, which could be either blue or violet.

Since the options are B and C, and I can't find a way to choose between them, perhaps I should think about the possible calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the wavelength of 2.3393 eV and then see which color is absorbed. Let me compute that again.

E = 2.3393 eV.

Wavelength λ = hc/(E * e) → 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm (green). So the emitted photon is green.

The absorbed photon must be higher energy. So the possible options are B) Violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV) and C) Blue (450 nm, 2.756 eV).

So the absorbed photon has a higher energy than 2.3393 eV. So if the question is asking which color is absorbed, the correct answer would be either B or C. But the options are given, and we have to choose between them.

In common fluorescence, blue light is absorbed and green emitted. So in that scenario, the absorbed is blue, so the answer is C) Blue.

But wait, another thought: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is lower than the absorbed photon. So the absorbed photon is blue (2.756 eV), which is higher than 2.3393 eV.

So the answer is C) Blue.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the emitted and absorbed photons. The energy of the emitted photon is given as **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately **530 nm** (green light). Since the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted photon (as the absorbed photon excites the molecule to a higher energy state, and the emitted photon results from a transition to a lower energy state), the absorbed photon must have a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than green light.

The visible spectrum ranges from violet (400 nm, ~3.1 eV) to red (700 nm, ~1.7 eV). Among the options provided:

- **Red (700 nm)**: Lower energy than green, so it cannot be the absorbed photon.
- **Violet (400 nm)**: Higher energy than green, corresponding to **3.1 eV**.
- **Blue (450 nm)**: Higher energy than green, corresponding to **2.756 eV**.
- **Yellow (570 nm)**: Lower energy than green, so it cannot be the absorbed photon.

Both violet and blue have higher energy than green, but blue (2.756 eV) is closer in energy to the emitted photon (2.3393 eV) than violet (3.1 eV). In common fluorescence processes, blue light is often absorbed and emitted as green light, supporting the conclusion that the absorbed photon is **blue**.

Thus, the color of light absorbed by the organic compound is **blue**.

Answer: C
