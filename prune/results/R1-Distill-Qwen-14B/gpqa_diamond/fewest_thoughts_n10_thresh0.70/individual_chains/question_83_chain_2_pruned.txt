Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. 

Alright, let's break down the problem step by step. First, the initial solution is 20.00 cm³ (which I think is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution will be 40 cm³ or 0.040 liters.

Wait, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So I should calculate the new concentration after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume, so 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding equal volume, the volume doubles, so the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh, okay, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, during the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. I'm trying to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Wait, what's 25% titration mean? I think it means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So I'll need to calculate how much NaOH is added at that point.

First, let's find the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. Earlier, I calculated it as 0.001 moles. So at equivalence point, all of that would be neutralized. Equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

So for equivalence point: moles of NaOH = 0.001. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. 

But wait, the question is about 25% titration. So that's 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So the volume of NaOH added would be 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³. 

Now, let's tackle the pH at 25% titration. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So in the solution, we'll have a mixture of acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate. That sounds like a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

But wait, what are the amounts of acetic acid and acetate at 25% titration?

The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH. So the moles of acetic acid left are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of acetate formed are 0.00025 moles.

The total volume of the solution at that point is initial solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³). So 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations would be [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M, and [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). The pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is about 4.73 (since log(1.85) is approx 0.267, so 5 -0.267=4.733).

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me compute that ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log of 0.333 is about -0.477. So pH is 4.73 -0.477 ≈ 4.253. So approximately 4.25.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, not matching exactly, but let me check my calculations again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the molarity after adding NaOH. Let me recalculate the
