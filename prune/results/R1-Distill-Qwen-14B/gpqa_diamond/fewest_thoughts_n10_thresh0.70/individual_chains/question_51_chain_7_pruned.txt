Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy between a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor will induce charges on its surface. But since the sphere is grounded, the charges can flow to the ground, right?

Wait, the sphere is grounded, so any induced charges would adjust accordingly. If the charge q is placed near the sphere, it would induce a charge on the sphere. But because the sphere is grounded, the induced charge would actually cause some electrons to leave the sphere, making it have an induced charge opposite to q. Or wait, no, I think since the conductor is neutral, the induced charges on the sphere would be opposite to q. But since it's grounded, maybe the net induced charge is zero? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no. No, wait. The conducting sphere is initially neutral. When you bring a charge q near it, the charges in the conductor redistribute. The side closer to q will have induced charges opposite to q, and the far side will have induced charges same as q. But because the sphere is conducting and grounded, the excess induced charges can leave the sphere. So the sphere ends up with an induced charge induced by q, but since it's connected to ground, the sphere remains neutral overall. That can't be right.

Wait, that might not be correct. Because if the sphere is grounded, any induced charges on it can flow into the ground. So the sphere itself remains uncharged. Oh wait, no. Let me think again. The conducting sphere is neutral initially. When a charge q
