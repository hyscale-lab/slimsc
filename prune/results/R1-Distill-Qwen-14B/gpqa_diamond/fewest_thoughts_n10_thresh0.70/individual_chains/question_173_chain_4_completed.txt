Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The problem is about the uncertainty principle, right? I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The question gives me the uncertainty in the electron's position and its speed, and I'm supposed to find the minimum uncertainty in energy.

Let me jot down what I know. The position uncertainty Δx is 0.1 nanometers. Oh wait, nanometers are 10^-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters. The speed v is 2e8 m/s. Hmm, that's pretty fast, almost a significant fraction of the speed of light. But since the problem is about uncertainty, maybe I don't need to worry about relativistic effects here. I'll proceed with non-relativistic equations.

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. I think ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But wait, sometimes people use the approximate value of 1e-34 for simplicity, especially in problems like this.

So, I can rearrange the equation to find Δp, the uncertainty in momentum. Δp ≈ ħ / (2Δx). Let me plug in the numbers. ħ is about 1e-34, and Δx is 1e-10 meters. So, 2Δx is 2e-10. Then Δp ≈ (1e-34) / (2e-10) = (1/2) * 1e-24 kg·m/s. That would be 0.5e-24, which is 5e-25 kg·m/s. Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that again. 1e-34 divided by 2e-10 is (1e-34) / (2e-10) = (1/2) * 1e-24. Oh wait, 1e-34 / 2e-10 = (1e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) )= (1/2) * 1e-24. So yes, 5e-25.

Wait, maybe I should be more precise. Let me compute it step by step. 1e-34 divided by 2e-10 is (1e-34) / (2e-10) = 1/(2) * 1e-34+10. Because dividing exponents subtracts them. Wait, no, 1e-34 divided by 1e-10 is 1e-24. So 1e-34 / 2e-10 = (1/2) * 1e-24 = 5e-25 kg·m/s. So Δp is approximately 5e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, momentum p is related to energy. Since the electron is moving in the x-direction, its kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So, the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be the uncertainty in kinetic energy. So, ΔE would be approximately (Δp)^2 / (2m_e). 

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, since ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, maybe I can think in terms of Δp being the uncertainty in momentum, which relates directly to the uncertainty in kinetic energy. Let me think: the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), so the uncertainty in energy would be the derivative of E with respect to p multiplied by Δp. The derivative dE/dp is p/m. But wait, that's not correct. Let me compute it properly.

Actually, E = p²/(2m), so dE/dp = p/m. Therefore, the uncertainty ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp. But wait, that might not be correct because Δp is the uncertainty, not the exact change. Hmm, perhaps the proper way is to use the formula for the uncertainty in a function. For E being a function of p, the uncertainty in E would be approximately the derivative times the uncertainty in p. So, ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp.

Yes, that makes sense. So, dE/dp is (p/m), so ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

Wait, but I don't know the exact value of p, only Δp. Hmm. Maybe I should express E in terms of p, but I have p being around mv. Oh, because the electron is moving at speed v, so p = m_e * v. So, p = m_e v, which is a known value.

Wait, m_e is the mass of the electron, which is about 9.109e-31 kg. So, v is given as 2e8 m/s. So p = m_e * v = 9.109e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = 1.8218e-22 kg·m/s.

Now, using this p, let's compute dE/dp. dE/dp = p/m_e = (1.8218e-22) / (9.109e-31) ) ≈ 2e8 m/s. Wait, that's just the velocity, which makes sense because E is (p²)/(2m), so the derivative is p/m, which is v.

So, dE/dp = v. Therefore, ΔE ≈ v * Δp.

We already have Δp ≈5e-25 kg·m/s. So, ΔE ≈ (2e8 m/s) * (5e-25 kg·m/s) ) = 1e-16 J. Wait, 2e8 times 5e-25 is 1e-16? Let me compute: 2 *5 =10, 10e (8-25) =10e-17= 1e-16. Yeah, right.

So, the minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1e-16 J.

Looking at the options, option D is ~1e-16 J. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Did I use the correct formula for ΔE? Because another approach could be to compute the minimum uncertainty in energy using the relation between ΔE and Δp. Alternatively, perhaps using the virial theorem or other principles.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the uncertainty in energy as the kinetic energy itself, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the uncertainty in energy due to the uncertainty in location.

Wait, another approach: Using the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle for energy and time. But I don't think that applies here because the problem gives a spatial uncertainty, not a temporal one. So probably the momentum approach is correct.

Wait, another thought: The kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m). The uncertainty in E would be ΔE = ( (p + Δp)^2 - p^2 ) / (2m) ). Expanding that, it's [ p² + 2p Δp + (Δp)^2 - p^2 ] / (2m) ) = [2p Δp + (Δp)^2 ]/(2m). Since Δp is much smaller than p, the (Δp)^2 term is negligible. So, ΔE ≈ (2p Δp)/(2m) ) = (p Δp) / m.

Wait, but earlier I thought ΔE ≈ v Δp. Let me check. Because p = m v, so (p Δp)/(m) = v Δp. So, yeah, same result.

So, either way, I get ΔE ≈ v Δp. Which gives 2e8 m/s * 5e-25 kg·m/s = 1e-16 J.

So the answer should be option D: ~1e-16 J.


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron traveling with speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) along the x-direction, given the uncertainty in its position \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between energy and momentum.

### Step 1: Uncertainty in momentum
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states:
\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]
where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant, approximately \( 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Rearranging for \( \Delta p \):
\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
\]
Substituting \( \hbar \approx 1 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( \Delta x = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \):
\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{1 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} = 5 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Relating momentum uncertainty to energy uncertainty
The kinetic energy of the electron is given by:
\[
E = \frac{p^2}{2m},
\]
where \( m \) is the mass of the electron (\( m_e \approx 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)). The uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) can be approximated as:
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\Delta p \cdot p}{m}.
\]
Since \( p = m \cdot v \), we have \( p = (9.109 \times 10^{-31}) \cdot (2 \times 10^8) = 1.8218 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{kg·m/s} \). Substituting \( \Delta p = 5 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \) and \( p = 1.8218 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{kg·m/s} \):
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(5 \times 10^{-25}) \cdot (1.8218 \times 10^{-22})}{9.109 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]

### Step 3: Simplifying the calculation
First, calculate the numerator:
\[
(5 \times 10^{-25}) \cdot (1.8218 \times 10^{-22}) = 9.109 \times 10^{-47}.
\]
Now divide by \( 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \):
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{9.109 \times 10^{-47}}{9.109 \times 10^{-31}} = 1 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Final Answer
The minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron is approximately \( 1 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option **D**.
