Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about a dicarboxylic acid that's been dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products—a major and a minor. Both have the molecular formula C13H16O3. The key here is the NOESY NMR data, which shows a cross-peak in the major product but not in the minor. That cross-peak connects two specific resonances, and the options give different possibilities.

First, I need to figure out what the starting anhydride looks like. The question says the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in 1H NMR and two peaks at 137 and 165 ppm in 13C NMR. 

Wait, 13C NMR: 137 is probably an sp² hybridized carbon, like in a double bond or an aromatic ring. 165 ppm is a carbonyl, maybe from the anhydride group. The single peak at 7 ppm suggests that all the protons in the molecule are equivalent. Hmm. What structure would that be?

Oh, right! If the anhydride is a symmetric structure, like cyclic or with equivalent substituents. Wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration would form an anhydride. Wait, more specifically, if the acid has adjacent carboxylic groups and a cis-alkene between them, dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride. But wait, another possibility is that the dehydration forms a maleic anhydride-like structure.

Wait, no. Let me think. The dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene would form an anhydride where the substituents are on adjacent carbons. So, when the acid loses water, the two carboxylic acid groups become an anhydride. The cis-alkene would then form a ring... Wait, maybe it's a five-membered ring? Like maleic an
