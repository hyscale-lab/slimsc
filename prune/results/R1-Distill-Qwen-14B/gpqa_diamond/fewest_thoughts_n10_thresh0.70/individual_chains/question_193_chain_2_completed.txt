Okay, let's try to figure out this astronomy problem. So, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance based on the given relationship between the number of stars and parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, so I need to connect these two.

The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So mathematically, that's N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. Wait, right, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if I substitute that, I can express everything in terms of distance.

Let me write that down. Since plx = 1/d, substituting into the equation gives N ∝ d^5. Because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. Oh, so the number of stars is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. I think that refers to the differential, like the change in number when you move a small distance dr. So I should probably find dN/dr.

But wait, let's think again. N is proportional to d^5, so dN/dr would be proportional to 5 d^4. Hmm, but wait, no, that's if we're considering how many stars are within a certain distance, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is looking for the number density, like stars per unit volume or something. Because the number of stars in a region could depend on the volume, which scales with distance cubed. But the given relationship is with parallax, not volume.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up concepts here. Let's go step by step.

The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting gives N ∝ d^5. So for a given distance d, the number of stars increases with d^5. But the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r, which is the surface area multiplied by some thickness. Or maybe it's about the number per unit distance.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the differential: how does N change as r changes by a small amount dr. So dN/d(r) is the rate at which the number of stars increases with r.

If N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is proportional to 5 r^4. But that would mean the number of stars per unit distance is increasing as r^4. But wait, that can't be the case because when you move further away, each shell should have more stars, but the density might change differently.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the number of stars in a volume. The volume between r and r + dr is 4π r² dr. But according to the question, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5, which is d^5. So N = k d^5, where k is a constant.

But how does that relate to the number of stars in a thin shell? The number of stars in a thin shell would depend on the volume of that shell. The volume of a shell at radius r with thickness dr is 4π r² dr. But the given relationship is that the number of stars is proportional to d^5, not the density. So maybe the number N of stars in a region is N = C * (1/plx)^5 = C * d^5.

Wait, but if the total number N is proportional to d^5, then if you double the distance, you have 32 times as many stars. But how does the number per unit distance change?

Wait, maybe the question is about the number of stars per unit distance, not the total number. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit distance (dN/dr) would be proportional to d^4. But that would be option C, which is r^4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it as the number of stars per unit volume. The volume is (4/3)π r^3, but if N is proportional to d^5, then the number density (stars per unit volume) would be N/V = (d^5) / (r^3) = (d^5)/(d^3) )= d^2. So number density is proportional to d^2.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe it's the surface density (stars per unit area per unit distance). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. The number of stars in the region is given by N = C / (plx)^5. Plx = 1/d, so N = C d^5. So the number of stars increases as d^5. But the question is about how the number changes with distance. So perhaps for a small change in distance, the change in N is dN = 5 C d^4 dr. So the rate of change is proportional to d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So the correct answer would be C.

But wait, another approach. Let's think of the number of stars as a function of distance. If N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, which is d^5, then the number of stars increases rapidly with d. But when considering a small volume between r and r + dr, the number of stars in that volume would be the surface area (4π r²) times the thickness dr, multiplied by the number density.

Wait, perhaps that's complicating it. Another way: the number of stars in a region at a distance r might depend on the area (2π r dr) if it's a thin ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit distance, so the change in N as r increases by dr. Since N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr = 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4, which would match option C.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident because sometimes number counts can depend on volume, which goes as r^3. But the given relationship is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is r^5. So the number of stars is increasing faster than the volume, which seems odd, but perhaps the distribution of stars isn't uniform.

Wait, maybe I should consider the number of stars in a thin spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr. The volume of the shell is 4π r² dr. If the number of stars in this shell is proportional to (r^5), then the number per unit volume would be (r^5)/(4π r² dr) ) = (r^3)/(4π dr). But that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in the shell is proportional to r^5, so the number per unit distance is (r^5)/dr, which would be proportional to r^5, but that doesn't match any option except B, but the options don't have r^5 for the unit range.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me restate the problem: The number of stars varies with 1/(plx)^5. Parallax plx = 1/d, so N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. Now, the question is, how does the number of stars in that region change with distance per unit range. So for each additional distance unit you move, how much does the number change?

If N = k d^5, then dN/dd = 5k d^4. So the rate of change is proportional to d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is increasing as d^4. Therefore, the correct answer would be option C, ~ r^4.


The problem states that the number of stars \( N \) varies with parallax \( \text{plx} \) as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax is related to distance \( d \) by \( \text{plx} = 1/d \), substituting this into the equation gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance \( r \). To determine this, we consider the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is \( dN/dr \). If \( N \propto d^5 \), then \( dN/dr \propto 5d^4 \). This indicates that the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

Thus, the correct answer is that the number of stars in the region changes with distance as \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
