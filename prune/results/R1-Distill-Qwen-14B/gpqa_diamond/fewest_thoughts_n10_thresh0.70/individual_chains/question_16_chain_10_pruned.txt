Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because optical activity can be tricky. Let me try to work through each compound one by one to figure out which ones are chiral and thus exhibit optical activity.

The question is asking how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. I remember that a compound will show optical activity if it has chiral centersâ€”meaning it has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, some compounds without chiral centers can still be optically active if they have internal planes of symmetry or other factors, but I think those are more complicated cases, and the question is probably testing the basic understanding of chiral centers.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   I need to visualize the structure. The formula is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with a Cl and methyl substitution. Wait, the compound is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.

   So the structure is CH2Cl attached to a double bond. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to C1. So C1 has Cl, a double bond to C2, and two other groups. Let me draw it: C1 is Cl, CH2 (since butene is
