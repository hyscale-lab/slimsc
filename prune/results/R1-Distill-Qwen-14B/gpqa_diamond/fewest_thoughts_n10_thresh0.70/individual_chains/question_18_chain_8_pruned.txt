Okay, so I have this problem about stellar abundances and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. Using the EW method (which I think stands for Equivalent Width, a method to determine elemental abundance), they've found some abundance ratios.

The given data is:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So in Star_1, the ratio of silicon to iron is 0.3 dex above solar.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So in Star_2, magnesium to silicon is 0.3 dex above solar.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So Star_1's iron abundance is the same as the Sun's.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. So Star_2's magnesium abundance is solar.

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) = appr 3.16e-5.
- Similarly, for Mg: log(nMg/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5? Wait wait, the Sun's data says 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7. Wait wait, no, the Sun's data is 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7. So log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, wait, let me clarify. For the Sun, nFe/H is given by 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5. Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, but then what is the solar ratio of Mg to Fe? Let me compute that. Solar nMg/nH is 1e-5, nFe/nH is 3.16e-5. So [Mg/Fe]_sun = log((nMg/nH)/(nFe/nH)) )= log( (1e-5)/(3.16e-5) ) = log(1/3.16) ≈ log(0.316) ≈ -0.5. So solar Mg/Fe is about -0.5 dex. Hmm.

But in the problem, Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 =0, which is solar, and [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. So let me think about how to find the ratio of
