Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's see, the compound is C9H11NO2. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different structures. I'm a bit rusty on my spectroscopy, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, let's look at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Breaking that down, the molecular formula suggests it's an organic compound with a benzene ring probably, since the options all have aromatic parts. The formula has 9 carbons. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, X=0, N=1. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees: likely a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds and a ring, that's 4 degrees, plus the amide or ester functional group, which adds another double bond. So that makes sense.

Now, looking at the IR data. IR shows bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are strong to medium. Those are usually from N-H or O-H stretches. But 3420 is in the range of N-H (like amides or amines) stretching. O-H would be broader but maybe in that region. Wait, but if it's a secondary amide, the N-H would show up as two bands, which matches the two peaks here. Or maybe it's an amine. But looking at the options, most have amide or ester groups, so perhaps the IR is from an amide.

The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a key. That's a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For an amide, the carbonyl is around 1680-1720. For an ester, it's similar but might be a bit higher. But 1720 is more ester-like. Wait, no, amides can have higher wavenumbers if they are less conjugated. Let me think: maybe the 1720 is an ester's carbonyl. Or maybe it's a ketone, but the options don't have that. So probably either an amide or ester.

Looking at the NMR data:

The 1H NMR has several signals:
- 1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's likely a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something deshielded. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2.
- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet could be an OCH2 group, but in what context? Maybe an ethoxy group? Wait, ethoxy is usually around 1.2-1.4 ppm for the CH2CH3 and around 4.0 for the OCH2. But wait, in
