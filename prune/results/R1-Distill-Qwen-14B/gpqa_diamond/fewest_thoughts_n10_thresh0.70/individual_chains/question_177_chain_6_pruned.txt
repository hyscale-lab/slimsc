Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. Spectroscopy shows that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Their radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The astronomers assume they radiate as black bodies and calculate the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a certain factor. The options are A to D.

Okay, so the key here is to find the luminosity ratio, L1/L2, using the information given. I remember that luminosity for a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity of a star as a black body is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, the first thing I need is the temperatures of the two stars. But wait, the problem mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. The wavelength of maximum emission for a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.8977719×10^-3 m·K).

Since λ_max is the same for both stars, that implies that their temperatures are the same. Because if λ_max1 = λ_max2, then T1 = T2. Because T is inversely proportional to λ_max. So if λ_max is same, T must be same.

Wait, but wait a second. Is it possible that the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelengths? Because each star's velocity towards or away from us could shift the emission lines. But in this case, the radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Hmm.

Oh, right, the problem says they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. But if a star is moving towards or away from us, its emitted wavelengths are Doppler shifted. So the
