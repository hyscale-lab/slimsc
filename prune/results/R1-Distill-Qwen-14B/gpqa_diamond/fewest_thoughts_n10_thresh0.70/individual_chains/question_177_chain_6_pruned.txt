Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. The problem gives their radii and masses. Oh wait, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And the mass is also 1.5 times larger. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled up by the same factor.

Then, the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a star's emission relates to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature. So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, they must have the same temperature. That's an important point. So T1 = T2.

Next, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us, right? Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but I don't think radial velocity affects the star's intrinsic properties like luminosity directly. Luminosity is an intrinsic property, but maybe velocity affects observed quantities like flux or something else. Hmm, but the question is about their actual luminosities, not the observed flux. So maybe the radial velocity information is a red herring here. Or perhaps it's used in a different way. Not sure yet, but I'll keep it in mind.

The problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. The options are given as A to D, and I need to find which factor is correct.

So, we're told to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. Luminosity for black bodies relates to their radius, temperature, and other factors. The formula I remember is the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since we're comparing two stars, perhaps the constants like σ and π will cancel out.
