Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my black hole thermodynamics, but let's try to think this through.

The question says: The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole at a distance of 10^10 parsecs is θ = 1e-17 degrees. We need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D in powers of 10.

Wait, what do I remember about the entropy of a black hole? Oh right, the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The entropy S is proportional to the area of the event horizon. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area. But wait, I think more accurately, S = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G ℏ), but I might need to double-check the constants. Alternatively, I've heard that S is roughly proportional to the area A, so maybe A is the key here.

So first, I need to find the area of the event horizon. The event horizon is a sphere with radius r_s, the Schwarzschild radius. The radius is r_s = 2 G M / c². Then, the area A is 4 π r_s².

But wait, I don't know the mass of the black hole directly. But the problem gives me the angular size θ as seen from a distance d. So I can probably find the size of the event horizon using some trigonometry.

Angular size θ in radians is approximately equal to (size of the object) / (distance), when θ is small. So θ ≈ (2 r_s) / (d), because the event horizon has a diameter of 2 r_s.

Wait, actually, the angular size is the apparent size, which is the diameter divided by distance. So θ (in radians) is roughly (2 r_s) / d. Let's write that down:

θ ≈ 2 r_s / d.

So let's compute r_s from this. Rearranging, r_s ≈ (θ d) / 2.

Once I have r_s, I can find the area A = 4 π r_s². Then, plug into the entropy formula.

But wait, let's make sure about the units. The distance d is given in parsecs. I need to convert that into meters
