Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times larger than Star_2's. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, the key factors are radius and temperature.

Wait, the problem says both stars have the same wavelength at which they appear brightest. What does that mean? Oh right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody spectrum is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). So if the peaks are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ_max is same, T is same for both stars.

So, both stars have the same temperature. Because they have the same peak emission wavelength.

Wait, but wait a second. Radial velocity is given. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, which probably means it's not moving towards or away from us, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s. How does that affect the observed wavelength?

Because if a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, and if moving away, it's redshifted. But in this case, the observed peak wavelength is the same. But what's the actual emission wavelength? Hmm. Or wait, if the star is moving, the observed wavelength is shifted, but the intrinsic (rest) wavelength is determined by its temperature.

Wait, the question says that they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest to be the same. So, it's the observed wavelength. So, the observed λ_max is same for both stars.

But the stars have different velocities. So, the rest λ_max is different, but due to Doppler shift, the observed λ_max is same.

Oh, right! So, let's think about this. The actual emission (rest) wavelength from each star depends on their temperature. But because of their velocities, the observed wavelength is shifted. So, the observed λ_max for both is the same, but their actual temperatures might be different because of Doppler effect.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if the observed λ_max is same, then the temperatures would be same, but that's only if there is no Doppler shift. But since the stars are moving, their actual temperatures might differ, but the
