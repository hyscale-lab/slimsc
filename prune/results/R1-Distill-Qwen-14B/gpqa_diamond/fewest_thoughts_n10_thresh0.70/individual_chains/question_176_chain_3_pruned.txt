Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I remember that when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probabilities depend on the state vector.

The problem says the system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, quantum states are usually represented as column vectors in a Hilbert space, and they have to be normalized. Oh, wait, the vector has components (-1, 2, 1). Let me check if this is normalized. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh right, so the state vector is not normalized. So I need to normalize it first. So the actual state is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1). Because the norm is sqrt(6), so each component is divided by that.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's written as (-1, 2, 1) as the state. So when they ask for probabilities, I think we have to use this vector, but probably we'll have to normalize it because otherwise the probabilities might not sum to 1. Hmm, maybe the question already assumes the state is normalized? Or perhaps I should proceed with the state as given without normalizing because the options are all fractions that sum to 1, but wait, the state given isn't normalized. So let me think.

Wait, but wait. The state vector must be a unit vector. Otherwise, it's not a valid quantum state. So perhaps the given vector is already normalized? Let me calculate the sum of the squares of the components. (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Sum is 6. So the length is sqrt(6). So the state is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1). So I need to use this normalized vector for all calculations.

So the state is |ψ> = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Now, the operators for P and Q are given. Let's see:

Operator P has the matrix:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).

Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Wait, is that correct? Let me write it out as a matrix:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Hmm, and operator Q is:

Q = [ [1, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, -1] ]

So Q is a diagonal matrix. Its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. So when measuring
