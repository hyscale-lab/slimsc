Okay, I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read through the question again. So, the setup is about some genes in white lupine that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They knocked out three genes, G1, G2, G3, and made double mutants too. The results are about how resistant these mutants are compared to the wild type.

The wild type has 100% resistance, so if a mutant has lower resistance, it's more sensitive. The question is about determining the interaction between these genes, specifically which is a transcription factor and how they interact.

The options are A to D, each giving different conclusions about which gene is a transcription factor and the relationships between them.

Let's look at the data:

- g1: 75% resistance → that's 3/4 of control, so not as resistant as wild type.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible, so knocking out G2 makes them not resistant at all.
- g3: 50% → half resistance.
- g1g3: 10% → very low.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

Hmm, so when G2 is knocked out alone (g2), resistance is 0%. Same when G2 is knocked out in combination with G1 or G3. That suggests that G2 is critical, maybe downstream of the others or perhaps it's a transcription factor regulating others.

Wait, the question says that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream. So, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would prevent the expression of other genes it controls, leading to a complete loss of resistance.

Looking at the g2 mutant, its resistance is 0%, which is the lowest. When you make a double mutant that includes G2 (g1g2, g2g3), they also have 0% resistance. That suggests that G2's function is necessary for the resistance. If G2 is a transcription factor, it might activate other genes necessary for resistance.

Now, looking at the other mutants:

g1 has 75% resistance. That's not as bad as g2, but worse than wild type. So knocking out G1 alone reduces resistance but doesn't eliminate it. So G1 must be involved but perhaps not the only gene.

g3 has 50% resistance, so knocking out G3 reduces it even more. So G3 might be another gene in the pathway.

What about the double mutants? Let's see:

g1g3 (no G1 and G3) has 10% resistance. That's worse than either single mutant. So knocking both G1 and G3 leads to much lower resistance than either alone. That suggests that G1 and G3 have additive or synergistic effects when both are knocked out.

But wait, in g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is 0% each. So any combination that includes G2 knockout leads to 0% resistance, which is the same as g2 alone. So maybe G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3, or perhaps G2 is part of the same pathway as both.

Wait, another angle: if a gene is epistatic to another, it means that the mutation in the second gene masks the effect of the first. So, if G1 is epistatic to G2, then the g1 mutation would show a phenotype even when G2 is present. But in this case, when both G1 and G2 are mutated, it's the same as when G2 is mutated alone (0%). So perhaps G2 is epistatic to G1, meaning that the function of G2 is necessary for G1 to function. Because without G2, G1's function doesn't matter.

Alternatively, if G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3
