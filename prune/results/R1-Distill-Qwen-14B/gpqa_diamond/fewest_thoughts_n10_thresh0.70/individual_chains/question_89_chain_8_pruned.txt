Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break down each step.

First, the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are provided.

Looking at the IR spectrum first: there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, product 1 must have a carbonyl group. When dibromides react with a strong base like KOH, especially in an elimination reaction, they usually form alkenes. Wait, but if we have two bromine atoms adjacent, maybe it's a di-elimination. Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bicyclic compound, so elimination would probably form an alkene.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking of elimination, but another possibility is substitution. But KOH is a strong base, more likely to cause elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? No, epoxides are usually formed from dihalides with a different base or under different conditions.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a carbonyl. Oh wait, no, elimination typically forms alkenes. Unless it's an intramolecular elimination leading to ring formation with a carbonyl. Oh! Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If each Br is on adjacent carbons, maybe when the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, it leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. Because if two adjacent Br atoms are eliminated, but wait, that would require a six-membered transition state maybe. Alternatively, maybe each Br leaves, but in a concerted way with the base forming a double bond. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But then where would the carbonyl come from? Oh wait, maybe the compound is actually undergoing a process called dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but perhaps the structure of adamantane allows for a bridge. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with each bridge having two CH2 groups. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two bridgehead carbons. If KOH is used, maybe it abstracts a β hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But that would form an alkene, but the IR shows a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe instead of elimination, it's a substitution leading to a diol. But that wouldn't give a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an oxidation. Oh, wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But the IR of an epoxide doesn't show
