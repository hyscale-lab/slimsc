Okay, so I need to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down step by step.

The first part is about the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows some specific peaks, and there's an IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, okay. Let's take this step by step.

First, what's 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, a four-fused cyclohexane rings in a chair-like form. So 1,3-dibromo would have Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the structure.

When 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, it's likely to eliminate. Since it's heated with excess KOH, it's probably an E2 elimination. Each Br is on a carbon, so two eliminations could happen, leading to the formation of an alkene.

Wait, but KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, the two Brs are on adjacent carbons. So eliminating two HBr molecules would form a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene or similar? Or maybe it's a ring-opening? Wait, no, adamantane is a very rigid structure. Eliminating two Brs would form a double bond between C1 and C3? Or maybe between adjacent carbons.

Wait, no, the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that the two Brs are on adjacent carbons in the diamondoid structure. When KOH is used, each Br leaves, but since it's a dihalide, elimination would form a double
