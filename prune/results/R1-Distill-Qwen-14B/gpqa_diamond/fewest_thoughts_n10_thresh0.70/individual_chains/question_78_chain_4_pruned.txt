Okay, I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in electromagnetism. Alright, let me think through it step by step. 

So the question is about finding the scalar potential V and vector potential A created by a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they not only produce electric fields but also magnetic fields, and these are related to the potentials.

The setup is that there's a charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and the vector d is from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. The velocity at the generating time is v.

Wait, the problem states that t is greater than tr, so the observation time is after the field was generated. That makes sense because the field takes time to travel from the charge to the point r.

I remember that the scalar potential V and vector potential A are solutions to Maxwell's equations. For a static charge, the scalar potential is straightforward—like Coulomb's law. But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of retarded times and such.

The scalar potential for a moving charge is given by the retarded potential formula. Similarly, the vector potential involves the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.

Let me try to recall the formulas. The scalar potential V at point r and time t due to a charge q moving with velocity v at time tr is something like V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(distance)], but considering the retarded time. Oh right, the distance here isn't just r because the charge was at a different position when it generated the field. So d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So the distance would be |d|, but perhaps there's a term involving the dot product of d and v because of the relative motion.

Alternatively, I think the denominator might involve (d·v + |d| c) or something similar. Because when the charge is moving, the effect propagates at the speed of light, so the terms would involve the velocity and the distance.

Wait, actually, the general expression for the scalar potential from a moving charge is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ (γ) / (|r' - r''|) ) ] 

Wait, no, more precisely, the scalar potential is the retarded potential. So it's V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(|r - r(t-retarded)|)] divided by (1 - (v·r̂)/c²), or something like that. Hmm, I think the denominator includes the term (1 - (v·d)/(c² d)), where d is the vector from the charge's position to r.

Wait, another approach: the potentials can be found using the Lorenz gauge condition, which simplifies things. The potentials satisfy certain wave equations.

Alternatively, for a point charge moving with velocity v, the scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ (1 + (v·r̂)/(c²)) / (r (1 - (v·r̂)/c²)) ) ]

Wait

Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a point r at time t. The charge q is moving along some trajectory s(t), and we're considering the fields at a time t which is greater than tr, the time when the field was generated.

Wait, so the field at time t is due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr. The vector d is from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. So I think that means d is the vector (r - s(tr)), right? Because it's the displacement from where the charge was to where we're observing.

I remember that the scalar potential V is usually given by Coulomb's law kind of expression. Oh wait, in electrostatics, V is (q)/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge. But wait, in this case, since the charge is moving, I think the potentials would involve retarded times. But the options don't seem to have that. Maybe they're assuming the charge isn't moving too fast, or perhaps it's a static situation? Or maybe it's using the instantaneous potentials because the options don't show any time delays.

Wait, no, because the problem says t > tr, so the potentials might involve a term that accounts for the movement since then. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see any terms with (t - tr) or anything like that. So perhaps the problem is using an expression that's considering the motion at the retarded time.

Wait, but I think the general expressions for potentials in electrodynamics involve terms with the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time. For the scalar potential V, it's often given by (q)/(4πε₀ |r - s(tr)|) ), right? And the vector potential A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) times some vector divided by (|d c| - d·v) or similar.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The scalar potential V for a moving charge is indeed (q)/(4πε₀ |r - s(tr)|), but when you have motion, you get terms in the potentials involving the velocity. Oh wait, but wait: Coulomb's law for scalar potential is static, but when you have retarded time, the expressions change. Alternatively, when considering radiation or fields from moving charges, you get into the realm of retarded potentials.

Wait another point: The vector potential A is usually related to the current. The current due to a moving charge is J = q v δ(...), but when you're calculating the potentials using retarded times, the expressions involve the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.

Let me try to recall the formulas. The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(|r - s(tr)| - (v · (r - s(tr)) )/(c²))]^(-1) ? Wait, no, I think I'm mixing terms. Alternatively, the denominator would be |d| c - (d · v), where d is (r - s(tr)). Because when you have a moving charge, the expression for the scalar potential includes a term that accounts for the motion.

Wait, let me get this straight. The scalar potential V for a charge in motion is given by (q)/(4πε₀ (|d| - (d·v)/c² )) where d is the vector from the charge's position at time tr to the field point r. Wait, no, that's not quite right. I think the denominator is |d| multiplied by c minus the dot product of d and v, but all over c squared.

Wait, the exact expression I think is V = (q)/(4πε₀) [1/( |d| - (d·v)/(c²) ) ]? Or perhaps it's (1/( |
