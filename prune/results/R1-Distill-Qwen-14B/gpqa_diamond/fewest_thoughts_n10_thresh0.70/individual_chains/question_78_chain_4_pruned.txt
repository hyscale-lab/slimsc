Okay, I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in electromagnetism. Alright, let me think through it step by step. 

So the question is about finding the scalar potential V and vector potential A created by a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they not only produce electric fields but also magnetic fields, and these are related to the potentials.

The setup is that there's a charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and the vector d is from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. The velocity at the generating time is v.

Wait, the problem states that t is greater than tr, so the observation time is after the field was generated. That makes sense because the field takes time to travel from the charge to the point r.

I remember that the scalar potential V and vector potential A are solutions to Maxwell's equations. For a static charge, the scalar potential is straightforward—like Coulomb's law. But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of retarded times and such.

The scalar potential for a moving charge is given by the retarded potential formula. Similarly, the vector potential involves the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.

Let me try to recall the formulas. The scalar potential V at point r and time t due to a charge q moving with velocity v at time tr is something like V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(distance)], but considering the retarded time. Oh right, the distance here isn't just r because the charge was at a different position when it generated the field. So d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So the distance would be |d|, but perhaps there's a term involving the dot product of d and v because of the relative motion.

Alternatively, I think the denominator might involve (d·v + |d| c) or something similar. Because when the charge is moving, the effect propagates at the speed of light, so the terms would involve the velocity and the distance.

Wait, actually, the general expression for the scalar potential from a moving charge is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ (γ) / (|r' - r''|) ) ] 

Wait, no, more precisely, the scalar potential is the retarded potential. So it's V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(|r - r(t-retarded)|)] divided by (1 - (v·r̂)/c²), or something like that. Hmm, I think the denominator includes the term (1 - (v·d)/(c² d)), where d is the vector from the charge's position to r.

Wait, another approach: the potentials can be found using the Lorenz gauge condition, which simplifies things. The potentials satisfy certain wave equations.

Alternatively, for a point charge moving with velocity v, the scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ (1 + (v·r̂)/(c²)) / (r (1 - (v·r̂)/c²)) ) ]

Wait
