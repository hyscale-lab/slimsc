Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, right, mass dimension of the coupling constants is important for renormalizability. For a theory to be renormalizable, all the interaction terms must have coupling constants with mass dimension ≤ the spacetime dimension. Oh wait, no, more specifically, in 4 dimensions, the coupling constants must have dimension ≤ 4 for the theory to be renormalizable. Because each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 (since the action is dimensionless, and the integral is over four dimensions).

So first, I need to figure out the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian. Let's break it down.

The Lagrangian term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each of these fields has their own mass dimensions. Let's recall:

In 4 dimensions, the Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the action is dimensionless, and the integral is d^4x, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So, kinetic term for ψ is ∂μ ψ̄ γ^μ ψ. The derivative ∂μ has dimension 1. So each ψ must have (4 - 1)/2 = 3/2, since we have two ψs. So [ψ] = 3/2.

What about F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or something similar. The field strength F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So each A has dimension [A] = 1. Because the Maxwell term is like ∂μ Aν ... which has dimension 2 (from each derivative), so the term has dimension 4. So [F] would be [∂][A] = 1 + 1 = 2. So [F^{μν}] = 2.

Now, σ_{μν} is made from the gamma matrices and the commutator. The gamma matrices are dimensionless because they are part of the spinor representation. So σ_{μν} is a product of two gammas and commutator, so it's dimensionless as well. So [σ] = 0.

Putting it all together, [L_int] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F].

Wait, no, each term in the product contributes. So the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ, ψ, F. So the total dimension is [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F^{μν}].

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-do that. The term is κ * ψ̄ * σ * ψ * F. So each factor contributes their dimensions. So:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) +
