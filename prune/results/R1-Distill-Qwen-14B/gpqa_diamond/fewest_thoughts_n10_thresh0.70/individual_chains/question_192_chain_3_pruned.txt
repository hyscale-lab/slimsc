Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again and see what it's about.

So, there's this uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor, which is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The point P is also at a distance l from the center of the cavity, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

I need to find the magnitude of E at point P. The options are A, B, C, D. Hmm, okay.

Alright, let me think about what I know about conductors and electric fields. So, when a conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor is uncharged, so maybe the charges inside the conductor itself are induced.

Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. When you place a charge inside the cavity, that charge will induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the charge is positive, the inner surface will have an induced negative charge. But since the conductor is uncharged overall, the outer surface must have a positive charge to balance it out? Wait, no. Wait, the conductor's total charge is zero because it's uncharged. So the inner surface must have a charge of -q, and the outer surface must have +q? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, let me think again. The cavity has a charge +q. The conductor is neutral. The inner surface (cavity's inner wall) must have a charge of -q because the conductor's charges will rearrange to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q because the inner is -q and the conductor is neutral.

But wait, the conductor is neutral, so the total induced charge on the inner and outer surfaces must sum to zero. So inner surface is -q, outer is +q, so total conductor is 0. Got it.

But, the point P is outside the conductor. So when calculating the electric field at
