Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I remember that NMR can help determine the structure, and the reagents are clues about the reactions happening. 

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H -X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So it's (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. That's (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5 degrees. So five degrees: maybe a ring, double bonds, etc. 

Looking at the NMR data: 

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a high shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually are around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes it's an acidic proton like an -OH, but that would be a broad peak. Hmm, 9.72 is a triplet, so maybe it's an aldehyde. So maybe there's an aldehyde group.

Next, 6.98 ppm doublet (2H), 6.51 ppm doublet (2H). That looks like two pairs of aromatic protons. Maybe two para-substituted aromatic rings. Because each would have two protons as doublets. So perhaps two phenyl groups, each with substituents in the para position.

Then, 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (2H). Broad suggests exchange, like an -OH, but 2H. Wait, OH protons are usually broader and around 1-5 ppm. But wait, could it be something else? Maybe vinyl protons? Or perhaps a conjugated diene?

Then 3.66 ppm, doublet (2H). That's probably a CH2 group attached to something electronegative. Maybe an oxygen, like a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, such as OCH2 or something like that. 

Putting this together, maybe the structure has an aldehyde group, two aromatic rings, some substituents, and an OCH2 group. 

Wait, the starting material has the
