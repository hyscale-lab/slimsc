Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slowly.

The question gives a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. The formula has 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Let me think about what that could mean. Maybe it's a substituted amine or an amide? Or perhaps something else.

The NMR data is provided. Let's look at that. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm. Let's analyze each peak. Starting with the 9.72 ppm peak as a triplet. That's pretty upfield for an aldehyde. Oh wait, no, wait. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet, but this is a triplet. That makes me think maybe it's a carboxylic aldehyde or something else. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's an aromatic ring undergoing coupling? Or could it be an NH proton? But the integration is 1H, so maybe not.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's an aromatic ring with an electron-withdrawing group like nitro, but that's not the case here because the molecular formula doesn't include a nitro group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinylogous aldehyde or some conjugated system.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests two sets of aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. Like two benzene rings, each with substituents. The 6.27 peak is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. That could be some sort of olefinic protons. Or maybe it's a di-substituted double bond where the protons are deshielded. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol proton or something like that.
