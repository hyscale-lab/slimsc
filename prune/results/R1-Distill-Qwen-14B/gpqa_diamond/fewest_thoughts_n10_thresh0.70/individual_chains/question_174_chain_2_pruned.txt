Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

So, the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is initially at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Wait, rest-mass energy is given by E=mcÂ², right? But in this case, they probably just told us the rest mass energy as 300 GeV, so maybe I don't need to calculate M directly. 

Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. So let me think about the masses. Let's denote the masses of the two fragments as m1 and m2. The problem says m1 is 2 times m2. So m1 = 2 m2. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. 

Wait, substituting m1 = 2 m2 into that, we get 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. Then m1 would be 0.66 M. Oh wait, but wait, 0.33 + 0.66 is 0.99, right? Yes. So the two fragments have masses 0.66 M and 0.33 M.

But wait, the initial nucleus has rest mass M, and the sum of the fragments' masses is 0.99 M. That means that 1% of M is lost, probably due to the energy released in the fission, which would be carried away by the kinetic energy of the fragments and any other particles (like neutrons or other products), but the problem says to ignore the electrons and that nothing else is produced. Wait, the problem says "two fragments (and nothing else)", so maybe the mass deficit is converted into kinetic energy?

Wait, I think in reality, when a nucleus fissions, it usually releases neutrons as well, but the problem states that nothing else is produced. So perhaps the mass deficit (1% of M) is the energy carried by the two kinetic fragments. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that
