Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

So, the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is initially at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Wait, rest-mass energy is given by E=mc², right? But in this case, they probably just told us the rest mass energy as 300 GeV, so maybe I don't need to calculate M directly. 

Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. So let me think about the masses. Let's denote the masses of the two fragments as m1 and m2. The problem says m1 is 2 times m2. So m1 = 2 m2. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. 

Wait, substituting m1 = 2 m2 into that, we get 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. Then m1 would be 0.66 M. Oh wait, but wait, 0.33 + 0.66 is 0.99, right? Yes. So the two fragments have masses 0.66 M and 0.33 M.

But wait, the initial nucleus has rest mass M, and the sum of the fragments' masses is 0.99 M. That means that 1% of M is lost, probably due to the energy released in the fission, which would be carried away by the kinetic energy of the fragments and any other particles (like neutrons or other products), but the problem says to ignore the electrons and that nothing else is produced. Wait, the problem says "two fragments (and nothing else)", so maybe the mass deficit is converted into kinetic energy?

Wait, I think in reality, when a nucleus fissions, it usually releases neutrons as well, but the problem states that nothing else is produced. So perhaps the mass deficit (1% of M) is the energy carried by the two kinetic fragments. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Oh wait, I remember that the rest-mass energy is mc², so M must be the rest mass. So the initial energy is all rest mass energy because it's at rest.

Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission and splits into two fragments. The fragments have rest masses such that one is twice as massive as the other. So let's call the masses m1 and m2. Wait, so m1 = 2 * m2? Or is the other way around? The problem says one is twice more massive, so m1 = 2 m2. But wait, I need to check the problem statement again. It says, "one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other". So yes, m1 = 2 m2.

The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Since m1 is 2 m2, substituting gives 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = 0.33 M, and m1 = 0.66 M. Wait no, wait, 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M. Then m1 is 0.66 M. Right.

Now, when the nucleus splits, it's an explosion, so I think they'll move in opposite directions due to conservation of momentum. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after should be zero. So the two fragments' momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let me think about the energies. The initial rest energy is 300 GeV. After the split, each fragment has rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Also, there's probably some energy released as binding energy, but I'm not sure how that plays into this.

Wait, but the problem is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. We need to compare the correct T1 (relativistic) with the classical approximation (non-relativistic). Then find the difference.

So first, let's think about the non-relativistic case. In classical mechanics, when a mass splits into two, the kinetic energies are determined by conservation of momentum and energy.

In non-relativistic, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But since the system is at rest, the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote their velocities as v1 and v2.

So m1 v1 = m2 v2. Since momentum is conserved, and initial momentum is zero.

In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energies would be (1/2) m1 v1² and (1/2) m2 v2².

But wait, since m1 = 2 m2, let me substitute. So m1 = 2m2, so 2m2 v1 = m2 v2
