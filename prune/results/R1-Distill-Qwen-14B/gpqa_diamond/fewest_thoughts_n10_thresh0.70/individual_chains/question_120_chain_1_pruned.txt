Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution based on parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax (plx).

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh yeah, the formula is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. So a higher parallax means a closer star. Got it.

So if stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density of stars in space is constant. Oh, right, the number of stars per unit volume is the same everywhere. So the volume of a sphere increases with the cube of the radius. Because volume is (4/3)πr³. So for a given distance from us, the volume up to that distance is r³.

But wait, how does this relate to parallax? Since plx is 1/d, d is the distance. So if I have a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what does that correspond to in terms of distance?

Let me think. If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So a change in plx, dplx, would correspond to a change in distance. Let's model this.

The number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d + dd would be the volume of that shell times the number density of stars. But since the density is uniform, n (number per volume) is constant.

The volume of a thin shell is approximately the surface area of the sphere times the thickness. So that's 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4πd² dd.

But wait, the question isn't about a thin shell; it's about the number per unit range of parallax. So I need to relate this to parallax.

So, d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that in. So the volume element in terms of parallax plx is:

Number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * d(1/plx) ?

Wait, let's compute d(1/plx). Let me think, since d = 1/plx, dd = -1/(plx^2) dplx. Wait, that's the derivative. So when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by (1/(plx^2)) dplx. So the thin shell's thickness in terms of distance is dd = -dplx/(plx^2). Hmm, but since plx is positive and increasing, maybe I should take absolute values. So the thickness is (dplx)/(plx^2). 

Wait, no, let me write it properly. Since d = 1/plx, the differential distance dd would be -dplx/(plx^2). So the change in d is negative as plx increases. But when calculating the number of stars, I just care about the magnitude, so perhaps I can take the absolute value. So dd = dplx/(plx²).

So the volume of the shell at distance d is 4πd² dd. Substituting d=1/plx, that's 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx)/(plx²) ) = 4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx/plx²) ) 

Wait, that's 4π (dplx) / plx^4. So the number of stars in a thin shell is n * 4π (dplx) / plx^4.

But wait, the question is asking for the number of stars per unit range of plx. So if I take the limit as dplx approaches zero, the number per unit plx would be the derivative term. So the number of stars per unit plx range is n * 4π / plx^4.

So the number density as a function of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx to the fourth power.

Looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4, option B is 1/plx², etc. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: the number of stars in a given range of parallax is related to the solid angle and the distance. Since the distribution is uniform, the number per unit volume is constant. So the number of stars in a shell is proportional to the volume of the shell.

The shell's volume is 4πd² * dd, and since d = 1/plx, and dd is the change in d, which is (d(1/plx)) = -dplx/(plx^2). So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx/(plx^2)) ) = 4π dplx / plx^4. So the
