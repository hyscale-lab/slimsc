Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in terms of parallax. Hmm, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun, right? I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance—so closer stars have larger parallaxes. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx.

The question states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniform distribution usually means that the number density is constant. But wait, how does that translate into the number per unit parallax?

Let me think. Parallax is measured in arcseconds. The formula for distance is distance (in parsecs) = 1 / parallax. So as parallax increases, distance decreases. So for a given range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range?

Wait, distance is d = 1/plx. So if plx goes from plx to plx + dplx, then the distance goes from 1/plx to 1/(plx + dplx). But for small dplx compared to plx, we can approximate the distance change. Let me compute the distance difference.

Let me take it step by step. Let’s say we have a parallax range Δplx, and we want to find the corresponding distance range Δd. For small Δplx, we can approximate using calculus. The distance d = 1/plx. So
