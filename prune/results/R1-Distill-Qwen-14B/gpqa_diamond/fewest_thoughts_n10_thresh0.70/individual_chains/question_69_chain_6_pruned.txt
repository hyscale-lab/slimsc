Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required in the bubble chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, what's the proper lifetime? Oh right, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. So when we observe it in the lab frame, the lifetime would be longer because of time dilation due to special relativity.

Time dilation formula is τ = γτ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. And γ is calculated using the particle's velocity and the speed of light. But wait, how do I find the velocity or the gamma factor?

Alternatively, since we're given the energy and mass of the particle, maybe we can find the gamma factor directly. Because energy E is related to gamma and mass m. The formula is E = γmc². Wait, but actually, E is the total energy, so E = γ m c², but since the units here are GeV, and c is a constant, perhaps we can just use E = γ m.

Wait, let me think. The particle's energy is 27 GeV, and its mass is 3.41 GeV. So E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m c²). But since m and E are given in GeV and c² is in (GeV/c²) * (c²) gives GeV, perhaps the c factors cancel out. Or maybe it's better to think in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics.

So if E = γ m, then γ = E/m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.9178. So γ is approximately 7.92.

So the lifetime τ in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀ = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that: 7.92*8 is about 63.36, so τ ≈ 6.336e-15 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. 7.92 *8e-16 = (7.92 *8) * 1e-16 → 63.36e-16 s = 6.336e-15 s. Right.

Now, the decay length. The particle is moving, and the decay occurs after a certain distance. The decay length L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So L = v * τ, where v is the particle's velocity.

But how to find v? Well, from gamma, since γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Or
