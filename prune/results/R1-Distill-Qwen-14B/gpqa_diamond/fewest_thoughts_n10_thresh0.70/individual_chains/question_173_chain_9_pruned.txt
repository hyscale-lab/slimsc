Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with quantum mechanics concepts, but I'll give it a shot. Let me read it again.

The question is about the uncertainty principle. An electron is moving at a speed v = 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE.

Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainties in position and momentum. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, when they say minimum uncertainty, I think it's when the uncertainty is exactly equal to ħ/2, right? So Δx * Δp = ħ/2.

But how does that relate to energy? Oh, because the uncertainty in energy is related to the uncertainty in momentum. Since energy is related to momentum via the kinetic energy formula, right? The kinetic energy E = p²/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron.

Wait, but wait. The uncertainty in energy ΔE would be the uncertainty in kinetic energy, assuming we're talking about non-relativistic speeds. Since the speed given is 2e8 m/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (which is about 3e8 m/s), I wonder if relativistic effects matter here. Hmm, but electrons have such small mass that even at high speeds, maybe the non-relativistic approximation is still okay.
