Okay, so I've got this question about Feynman diagrams and loop estimates. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a colleague has a new quantum field theory in four-dimensional spacetime. They're looking at the regularization of higher-order loop diagrams. There's a note with an expression: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. And the question is about how many loops the Feynman diagram had.

I remember that in quantum field theory, each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of the coupling constant (like alpha or g) and some factors depending on the number of loops. Also, the number of loops relates to the order in perturbation theory.

Wait, the overall scaling of loop integrals. For a loop diagram with L loops, the integral typically scales as (momentum integral), and each loop brings in a factor of the loop momentum. But when you regularize, especially in dimensional regularization or other methods, you might have factors coming from the integral.

Wait, but another thing I remember is that the superficial degree of divergence for a loop integral in a Feynman diagram can be determined by the formula. In four dimensions, for a diagram with L loops, the superficial degree is D = 4L - 2I + V, where I is the number of internal lines and V the number of vertices. But wait, maybe that's more detailed than I need here.

Alternatively, when looking at the scaling factors, each loop can contribute a factor of (momentum integral) which, after integration, could lead to a logarithmic dependence or something else. But I'm not sure that's directly helpful here.

Another approach: the number of loops relates to the order in the perturbative expansion. For example, a tree-level diagram has 0 loops, first-order (like a single vertex) has 0, but when you have a loop, that's typically a higher-order term.

Looking at the expression given: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

Let me break this down. Alpha is the fine-structure constant, approximately 1/137, which is an electric charge coupling. G is another coupling, perhaps a gauge coupling or something else. The 1/(4pi)^6 factor suggests something to do with
