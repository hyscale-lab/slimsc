Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. Then, each product undergoes a treatment, and I need to find out how many carbon atoms are in the final product, product 3. The options are A)14, B)10, C)12, D)11.

Hmm, I remember that trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a double bond. Let me visualize its structure. Trans-cinnamaldehyde is CH₂=CH-CHO, but wait, no, wait. No, wait: cinnamaldehyde is actually benzaldehyde with a propenyl group. Oh right, it's (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. The structure is benzaldehyde with a propenyl group. So it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, not that. Oh wait, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO? No, wait. Let me think again. Cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde derived from cinnamic acid. So the structure is:

The aldehyde group is at the end of a propenyl chain attached to a benzene ring. So it's:

Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, wait, cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me draw it. The correct structure is benzene ring connected to a CH₂-CH₂-CHO group with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. Wait, no. Wait, prop-2-enal would be CH₂=CH-CHO. So for cinnamaldehyde, it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, that can't be. Wait, wait, prop-2-enal is CH₂=CH-CHO. So cinnamaldehyde would be Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, wait. No, wait, the structure is actually Ph-CH=CH-CHO, but the double bond is between the two CH groups. Oh wait, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylpropenal. So structure is:

O=
