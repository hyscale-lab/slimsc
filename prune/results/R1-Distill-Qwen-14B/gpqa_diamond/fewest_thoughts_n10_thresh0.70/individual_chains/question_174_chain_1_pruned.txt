Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Okay, the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, okay, so first, I should probably break down the given information. So, initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. That's a huge amount, but it's given as rest-mass energy, so E=mc².

When the nucleus splits, it forms two fragments. Let me denote the rest masses as m1 and m2. The problem says one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say m1 = 2 * m2. Or wait, wait, more precisely, one is twice the other. So, maybe m1 is the more massive one, so m1 = 2 m2.

But wait, the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Since m1 = 2 m2, substituting that in: 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99/3) M ≈ 0.33 M. So m1 would be about 0.66 M.

Wait, but the initial rest mass was M, and after fission, the sum is 0.99 M. That suggests that some mass is converted into kinetic energy, which is the case in fission as per Einstein's equation. So the mass defect would be M - 0.99 M = 0.01 M. That 0.01 M would be converted into kinetic energy and any binding energy, but in this case, the problem is only considering the two fragments, so perhaps the kinetic energy comes from that mass defect.

But wait, when the nucleus is at rest, the total momentum should be conserved. Since it's initially at rest, the total momentum of the two fragments
