Okay, so I have this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, I remember that when a heavy nucleus undergoes fission, it splits into two smaller nuclei, and energy is released. But wait, the question is about the difference between the correct kinetic energy (relativistic) and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. Interesting.

Let me read the problem again. The initial nucleus has a rest mass M, rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. It splits into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. So if the other is mass m, the first is 2m. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Oh, right, because in fission, the total mass usually decreases because energy is released, but here the sum is 99% of M, so the rest mass after is less than before. So the initial rest mass is M, and the combined rest mass is 0.99 M.

Wait, but the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So M c² = 300 GeV. Then, the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 0.99 M c². Let me calculate that: 0.99 * 300 GeV is 297 GeV. So the rest mass after is 297 GeV, and the initial was 300 GeV. So the mass difference is 3 GeV, which probably gets converted into kinetic energy and other forms like binding energy, but the problem is about kinetic energies.

The fragments are two: let's say mass 2m and m. So 2m + m = 3m = 0.99 M. So 3m = 0.99 M => m = 0.33 M. So the two masses are 0.66 M and 0.33 M. But wait, the problem says in terms of rest-masses, so their rest masses are 2m_rest and m_rest, right?

Wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so when it splits, the two fragments will move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum after must be zero. So the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2 for the two fragments. Since
