Okay, so I have this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. It says it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we're supposed to find the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees, and also the possible form of f.

I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since it's spheroidal along z, maybe it's something like a dipole or quadrupole radiation?

Wait, for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern in the far field (which is the radiation zone) has a specific angular dependence. For a dipole, the intensity (which relates to power per unit solid angle) falls off as (1/(lambda^2))^2, but wait, let me think again. Oh wait, the power radiated by a dipole is proportional to the square of the acceleration, but the far field intensity for dipole radiation is typically proportional to (1/(r^2)) in the radiation zone, but when considering the power per unit solid angle, the angular dependence comes into play.

I think for a dipole, the radiation is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis of oscillation, so theta=90 degrees. The intensity pattern is something like I proportional to (sin theta)/(1 + cos^2 theta), but wait, I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, another form: for a dipole, the radiation pattern in terms of the intensity (power per unit area) is maximum at theta = 90 degrees, and it drops off as you go towards the poles (theta=0 and theta=180). The exact form might have a dependence on cos(theta) or
