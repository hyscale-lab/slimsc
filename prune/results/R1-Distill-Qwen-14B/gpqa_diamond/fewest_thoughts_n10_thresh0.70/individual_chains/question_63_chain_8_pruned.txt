Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state, and it's supposed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy when it absorbs a photon. I remember that in quantum mechanics, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it transitions between energy states. So, I need to find the momentum of the photon that causes this transition.

Wait, the problem gives me some data: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu, bond length R is 2 angstroms, and angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. I think I need to use these to calculate the momentum of the photon. 

First, let's think about the energy states. The molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. But when it's in the fundamental state, maybe that refers to the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. So the next state would be the next higher energy state. But wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So does that mean the next state in either rotation or vibration, whichever requires less energy?

Wait, no. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the first vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational level (which is J=0 for diatomic molecules in rigid rotor model). So the next possible state would be either the next vibrational level (v=1) or the next rotational level (J=1). But since the question is about the lowest possible energy, the photon should cause the minimal energy transition. So I need to find which transition requires less energy: from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0 or to v=0, J=1.

Wait, but actually, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which might be the lowest possible state, so the next state would be the next higher energy. But how do these transitions work? Because a photon can cause a transition that changes either the vibrational state, the rotational state, or both.

Wait, I think in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. So the total energy is E = E_vibrational + E_rotational.
