Okay, so I have this physics problem about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are given for the photon's momentum.

I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. Oh wait, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, and the next state would be the next vibrational level, maybe with a change in rotation as well? Or is it just a pure vibration?

Wait no, the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is also considering rotational energy. So the molecule's energy is a combination of both rotation and vibration. But the question is about transitioning to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the molecule is in the ground state of both vibration and rotation, and the next state is the first excited vibrational state, keeping rotation at the same or perhaps minimal change.

Hmm, but the fundamental state in vibration is the lowest state (v=0), and the next would be v=1. So the photon would need to supply enough energy to increase the vibrational state.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: the molecule is in a rotational state, and the next state is the next rotational state. But the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy, so perhaps it
