Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem starts with Compound A. It has a proton NMR with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means two neighboring protons, and a quartet means three neighboring.

Looking at the integration: 6H and 4H. So maybe these are from two different groups. 6H might be from two equivalent CH3 groups, since each CH3 has 3H. And 4H could be from two equivalent CH2 groups, each contributing 2H.

Wait, what about a structure where there are two methyl groups and some other structure? Oh, like maybe a diethyl ether or something with two ethyl groups. Wait, diethyl ether would have two CH2CH3 groups. But then, the NMR would show two sets of triplets, perhaps? Let me think.

Wait, the quartet at 1.3 ppm is higher shift than the triplet at 0.9, which is typical for a methyl group attached to something else. Oh wait, wait. For ethyl groups, the CH2 is usually around 1.2-1.4 ppm, and the CH3 is around 0.9-1.0. So in diethyl ether, each CH2 would be a quartet because they're next to the oxygen and the CH3. Or wait, maybe in an ethyl group, the CH2 is next to another CH2, so maybe a triplet. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe Compound A is neopentane or something else. No, neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane, and its NMR would have a singlet for all the CH3 groups, I think. So that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative or some kind of branched alkane. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl ether, but wait, diethyl ether's structure is CH2CH2-O-CH2CH3. But each CH2 group would be split by the adjacent CH3. Let me think about the splitting.

Wait, in diethyl ether, each CH2 is attached to an oxygen. The CH2 groups would be split by the adjacent CH3. So the CH2 would be a quartet, and the CH3 would be a triplet. Let me check:

- The CH3 groups in diethyl ether: each is next to a CH2, so each CH3 would be a triplet. But wait, in diethyl ether, each CH3 is on an ethyl group attached to oxygen. So the CH3 would be next to a CH2, which has two neighboring CH2 groups? Wait, no. Each CH3 is attached to a CH2-O. So the CH2 would split into a triplet because each is next to another CH2 group. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the structure isn't an ether. Let's think of another possibility. If Compound A is (CH2CH3)2O, diethyl ether, the NMR would
