Okay, let's try to solve this question. Hmm, so I've got two parts here, A and B. I need to figure out each one.

Starting with part A: Which compound does NOT show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Tautomerism happens when a proton moves from one atom to another, resulting in the same molecule forming different isomers. For that to happen, there must be a hydrogen that can shift between different positions, usually involving the movement across double bonds or in conjugated systems.

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which has two ketone groups connected by a benzene ring. Wait, quinones have two carbonyl groups adjacent to each other. I remember that some quinones can exhibit tautomerism. For example, para-benzoquinone might not have the right structure for tautomerism, but I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can have keto-enol tautomerism because it has two ketone groups. Like, maybe the hydrogen can move somewhere else, causing a structural change.

Wait, no. Wait, tautomerism usually involves a shift that leads to the same molecule, like in enols and keto forms. But for this to happen, the molecule must have a conjugated system that allows the hydrogen to shift. Benzoquinone has two ketones in adjacent positions on a benzene ring. So perhaps it can form enol tautomers? Or maybe it's more about whether there are hydrogens alpha to the carbonyl groups.

Wait, the structure of benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O (but with the two O's on adjacent carbons). So each carbonyl is on a carbon that's attached to another benzene carbon. So each carbonyl is at a position where the adjacent carbon (the one next to the carbonyl) is a benzene ring carbon. So the alpha positions are the ring carbons, which don't have hydrogens. Because in a benzene ring, the carbons are bonded to other carbons and not to H. Wait, no: in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and one H if it's a para-substituted, but benzoquinone's structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups on adjacent carbons. So each of those carbonyl carbons is bonded to the next one, but the adjacent carbons (the ones next to the carbonyl) are part of the ring and are bonded to other ring carbons, which have no H. So, the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to carbonyl) don't have H. Without alpha hydrogens, tautomerism isn't possible because the keto-enol tautomerism requires a hydrogen on the alpha carbon to shift.

So benzoquinone cannot undergo tautomerism because the alpha positions don't have hydrogens. That would mean that if benzoquinone can't show tautomerism, then part A's correct answer would be benzoquinone as the one that doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, but wait. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. Benzoquinone is benzene with two ketone groups on adjacent carbons. Each ketone is O=C-R. The carbonyl group is C=O. The alpha carbon is the one attached to the carbonyl. So in this case, each alpha carbon is part of the benzene ring. So in benzene, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and one H. Wait, no. Benzoquinone's structure is a benzene ring where two opposite carbons have carbonyl groups. Wait, no, actually, benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two double bonds; specifically, it's a cyclohexadienedione, where two of the carbons are double-bonded to oxygen. So the structure is O=C-C6H3-C=O. Wait, more accurately, the structure is a benzene ring where two adjacent carbons have double bonds to O. Let me imagine the structure: it's like O=C-C6H4-C=O, but in a ring structure. So each of these two carbonyl carbons is connected to another carbon in the ring, which is connected to another ring carbon that has no H.

Wait, actually, each of the carbonyl groups is at a position where the alpha carbon (the one next to the carbonyl) is part of the ring. So the alpha carbons are part of the ring, and in the benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other ring carbons and one H. No, wait, in the benzene ring, each carbon has one H if it's a mono-substituted benzene. But in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on adjacent carbons, so the next carbon (alpha) is part of the ring and has two ring bonds. So the alpha position in each case is the ring carbon, which may or may not have a hydrogen.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about it differently. For tautomerism to occur, there must be an alpha hydrogen (H attached to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group). Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. Let's look at each carbonyl: the carbon adjacent to each carbonyl (alpha) is part of the ring. In a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other ring carbons and one H (if it's mono-substituted). But in benzoquinone, the ring is actually a conjugated diene with two ketone groups. So each of the carbonyls is at a position where the adjacent carbons are part of the ring and each has a hydrogen. Or wait, no. In a benzene ring, each carbon has one H if it's a para-substituted. Hmm, perhaps in benzoquinone, the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl groups) are part of the ring and each has one H.

Wait, no, wait. Benzoquinone has two adjacent carbonyl groups on the benzene ring. So the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O, but in a cyclic structure. So each carbonyl group is on a carbon that's adjacent to another carbon in the ring. So each alpha position (the carbon next to the carbonyl) is a benzene ring carbon. In the benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and has one H (since benzene is C6H6). So in benzoquinone, each carbon adjacent to the carbonyl would have one H. So, for example, the structure is:

O=C-C(H)-C6H3-C(H)-C=O

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O, but that's not quite right. Alternatively, it's a cyclohexadienedione: the ring has two double bonds (so four carbons in the ring are part of the double bonds, but wait, in a six-membered ring with two double bonds, that's a conjugated diene, like 1,4-dienes in a six-membered ring. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the correct one that does not show tautomerism. Wait, no, wait. Let's think about the other compound: cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each at positions 1,3,5. So the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C in a ring. Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups on alternate positions of the ring. So each of the three ketones is separated by a single carbon. So each carbonyl is at positions 1,3,5.

But then, each alpha carbon (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl groups) would be the other carbons in the ring. So each alpha carbon is a CH2 group or something similar. Wait, no: the ring would have 6 carbons. Positions 1,3,5 are carbonyls, so each is a ketone. So the ring is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C, but arranged in a ring. So each alpha carbon (the ones next to the carbonyls) would be the carbons at positions 2,4,6. Each of those carbons is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. Wait, no, each is adjacent to one carbonyl group.

Wait, each alpha carbon is the one next to a carbonyl. So in position 1 is a carbonyl, position 2 is a CH2 (since it's between position 1 and 3, which is another carbonyl). Wait, no, position 3 is a carbonyl as well. So position 2 would be between 1 and 3, which are both carbonyls. So position 2 would be a carbon connected to two carbonyl carbons. So position 2 would be a CH2 group? Because each carbon in the ring is connected to two others. So, each alpha carbon (positions 2,4,6) are each connected to a carbonyl group on either side. So, each of these positions would have two adjacent carbonyl groups.

Wait, but in that structure, would there be any alpha hydrogens? Because for tautomerism, you need an alpha H. So each of the positions 2,4,6 are CH2 groups, which means each has two Hs. So each of these carbons have two Hs, which are alpha to the carbonyl groups.

So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha hydrogens, meaning it can undergo tautomerism. So which one does not have alpha hydrogens, thus can't show tautomerism?

Wait, earlier I thought that benzoquinone might not have alpha hydrogens because the alpha carbons are part of the ring without hydrogens. Or do they?

Wait, benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups on adjacent positions in the ring. So the alpha carbons are the ones next to the carbonyl groups, which are part of the benzene ring. So each of these alpha carbons is a benzene ring carbon, which is bonded to two other ring carbons and has one H. So alpha carbons in benzoquinone have Hs. But wait, if they have Hs, then why can't tautomerism occur?

Wait a second, in enol tautomerism, the H moves from the alpha carbon to the oxygen. So if the alpha carbon has a H, then it can lose it, forming a double bond (enol form). So if benzoquinone has alpha Hs, then it can tautomerize.

But wait, let me think about the structure. Benzoquinone is O=C-C6H4-C=O. Wait, in reality, benzoquinone has the structure where two oxygen atoms are double-bonded to adjacent carbons in the benzene ring. So each of those carbons is connected to a benzene ring and a carbonyl group. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of the ring. So each has a H attached.

Wait, so if benzoquinone has alpha Hs, then why wouldn't it show tautomerism? Because for tautomerism, you need the H to move from a position adjacent to the carbonyl to form an enol. So in benzoquinone, the adjacent carbon (alpha) has a H. So, maybe it can indeed form tautomers.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think of another example. For example, cyclohexanone has alpha Hs and can undergo tautomerism. But in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the three carbonyl groups is separated by a CH2 group. So each alpha position is a CH2. So, they have Hs, so they can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but the question says which compound does NOT show tautomerism. So if both compounds have alpha Hs, can tautomerism occur? Then perhaps I messed up.

Wait, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have alpha Hs. Let me think again. Benzoquinone's structure is O=C-C6H3-C=O, but arranged in a ring. So each of the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the benzene ring. Each of those ring carbons is bonded to two other ring carbons and one H.

Wait, but in benzene, each carbon has one H. So in benzoquinone, the alpha carbons (the ones next to carbonyl) are part of the ring and have one H each. So those Hs are alpha, so they can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but another thought. Benzoquinone is a diketone. Diketones can undergo enolization. So probably, it can tautomerize. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe due to the conjugated system, the enol form is not possible. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has all alpha positions without Hs. Wait, no. Because in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each alpha position is a CH2 group, so they have Hs. So that would mean both compounds have alpha Hs and can tautomerize, which can't be the case because the question is which does NOT show tautomerism.

Wait, but maybe I'm mistaken. Let's think: how about the possibility that in benzoquinone, the alpha carbons are part of a conjugated system that doesn't allow enolization. Or maybe the ring's stability is such that it doesn't allow the H shift.

Wait, another approach: looking up which compounds undergo tautomerism. I remember that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a common compound, and I think it does undergo tautomerism. For example, it can form enol tautomers because it has alpha hydrogens. Benzoquinone, on the other hand, is a rigid structure with conjugated carbonyl groups. I'm not too sure, but maybe benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens. Wait, no, because in benzoquinone, the alpha carbons are part of the ring, and each has a H.

Wait, maybe I should think about specific examples. For example, anthraquinone (a similar structure) can show tautomerism. So maybe benzoquinone can. But if both can, then the question has a problem. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the other part to get some clues. Part B: among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Its structure is OMe-O-C-CH2-COOH. Wait, no, the formula is CH3O-C(OH)-CH2-COOH? Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-O-C(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH? Or is it CH3-C(OH)H-COOH? Wait, wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH (but I think it's CH3CH2COOH). So 2-hydroxy would be on the central carbon. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. So the ester would be where the hydroxyl is replaced by OMe. So the structure would be CH3-C(OCH3)-COOH? Wait, no, because esterification replaces the -OH with -OR. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would esterify to form methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate as CH3-O-C(CH2COOH)-? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is (CH3O)C(OH)CH2COOH? No, perhaps it's better to think of it as CH2(COOH)CH(OCH3). Hmm, regardless, the key point is whether the molecule has a chiral center.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the central carbon (the one attached to the hydroxyl group in the acid) would be connected to OCH3, COOH, CH3, and OH (but wait, in the ester, the OH is replaced by OCH3). So the central carbon would have the groups: OCH3, COOCH3, CH3, and the other CH2? Wait, perhaps I'm not getting it right. Let me think again: the structure is OMe-O-C-CH2-COOH. No, more accurately, the structure is:

The ester is formed by replacing the -OH in 2-hydroxypropanoic acid with OMe. So the acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified, it becomes CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OMe-C(OH)-CH2-COOH. But in any case, the central carbon would have four different groups: OCH3, CH2COOH, CH2-, and another group. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

The molecule is CH3-O-C(OH)-CH2-COOH. So the central carbon is connected to OCH3, OH, CH2COOH, and another CH3. No, wait, that's not possible because it's a four-carbon chain. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-O-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, but that would make it a five-carbon molecule. Hmm, perhaps I should look for whether this molecule has a chiral center.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is OMe attached to the oxygen adjacent to the hydroxyl group, which is on the second carbon of propanoic acid. So the structure would have a central carbon with four different groups: OMe, OH (but wait, in ester, the OH is replaced), so perhaps it's CH3-O-C(OH)-CH2-COOH. No, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think: the formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, that's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid's ester. So, the structure would be CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3. But that's not correct because in ester, the -OH is replaced by OMe. So, the hydroxyl group is replaced by OMe, so it becomes CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that would give the central carbon (CH2) connected to OCH3, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups. No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the molecule as being: the central carbon is connected to OMe, COOCH3, CH3, and another group. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Then the central carbon (the one with OH) would have four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH3? No, that would make it symmetric on one side. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is (CH3O)C(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, consider dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid has two double bonds and is a diacid. So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. No, wait, that's not right. Let me think: maleic acid is HO2CCHCHCO2H, but in the trans configuration. So dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no, maleic acid is HO2CCHCHCO2H, so dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, I think the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, that would be a four-carbon chain. Wait, maybe it's (Z) configuration for fumarate, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, fumarate is the trans diastereomer of maleate. So dimethyl fumarate has the structure CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Or perhaps it's CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2-COOCH3? Hmm, perhaps I should think about the double bond. The structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2-COOCH3, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, it's CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3. Wait, that's not correct either. Alternatively, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3? Hmm, no, perhaps it's CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3. But wait, that would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, with each of those carbons attached to a COOCH3 group. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3. No, that's not correct because there are four carbons in butenedioic acid.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think about whether dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry. If the double bond is in the trans configuration, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it unable to have optical isomers. Or, if it's not symmetrical, then it can have optical isomers.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, but that would be five carbons. Wait, but butenedioic acid is four carbons. Wait, butenedioic acid is HO2CCHCHCO2H, but with a double bond between the two middle carbons. So the ester would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, that would be five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3, but that's only four carbons. Wait, that's possible. So, the structure would be CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. But that would make the molecule have a double bond, and the two COOCH3 groups are on adjacent carbons. So the structure is CH2=C(CO-OCH3)-CO-OCH3. So the molecule would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, with carbon 2 having a COOCH3 group, and carbon 3 having another COOCH3 group. So the molecule is CH2=C(CO2Me)CO2Me.

Wait, but this structure would have a plane of symmetry. Because the two COOCH3 groups are on either side of the double bond. So if it's CH2=C(CO2Me)CO2Me, then the molecule is symmetric. So when you look at the molecule, it's mirror symmetric, which means it's not chiral. Thus, it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

On the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if it has a chiral center, then it can exhibit optical isomerism. So if the central carbon is connected to four different groups, then it's chiral.

Wait, the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. When esterified with methanol, the -OH is replaced by OMe. So the structure becomes CH3-C(OCH3)-COOCH3. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would have three substituents on the central carbon. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3. But that would have the central CH2 connected to OCH3, CH2COOCH3, and two more CH2 groups. No, perhaps the correct structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH(OCH3)-CH3. Wait, that makes sense. So the molecule would be CH2-COOCH3 attached to a central carbon which is attached to CH3 and OCH3.

Wait, the structure is:

COOCH3 is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a central carbon. The central carbon is connected to:

- CH2COOCH3,
- CH3,
- OCH3,
- and another CH2 group? No, perhaps:

The structure is:

The central carbon is connected to:

1. CH2COOCH3,

2. CH3,

3. OCH3,

4. And another CH2 group.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The formula for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. When esterified, the OH becomes OMe, so it's CH3-C(OCH3)H-COOH, but then esterified to replace the -OH with OMe, so it becomes CH3-C(OCH3)H-COOCH3.

Wait, but that's not correct because the COOH would become COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-C(OCH3)H-COOCH3.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain? No, propanoic acid has three carbons. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Esterifying the -COOH to COOCH3 gives CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Then, esterifying the OH to OCH3 gives CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2-OCH3 connected to CH2 connected to COOCH3.

Wait, in this structure, the central CH2 is connected to OCH3, CH2COOCH3, and two more CH2 groups. So no, that doesn't have a chiral center. Because the central carbon (the one in the middle) has two CH2 groups attached, making it a CH2 group, not a chiral center.

Ah, wait, no. The structure is CH2-OCH3 - CH2 - COOCH3. So the central carbon is the CH2 in the middle. But that's a CH2 group, so it's not a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would not have a chiral center, so it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I got the structure wrong. Maybe the structure is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Then, when esterified, it becomes HOOC-CH(OCH3)-CH3, but that's when the -OH is replaced by OMe. Wait, but in that case, the structure would be CH3-C(OCH3)-COOH. Then, esterifying the COOH to COOCH3 would make it CH3-C(OCH3)-COOCH3. So the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3,
- OCH3,
- COOCH3,
- and a single bond (but wait, that's three groups; wait, no, wait, the central carbon would have four bonds: CH3, OCH3, COOCH3, and another CH3? No, that would make it a CH2 group. Hmm, I'm getting myself confused again.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. The correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, no, that's only three carbons. Let me think: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the central carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Esterifying the -COOH to COOCH3 gives CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Then, esterifying the -OH to OCH3 gives CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is: CH2-OCH3 connected to CH2 connected to COOCH3.

In this structure, the central CH2 is connected to OCH3, CH2COOCH3, and two more CH2 groups (the adjacent CH2 groups). So the central carbon is CH2, not a chiral center. So this molecule doesn't have a chiral center, meaning it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Alternatively, maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center. Let me count.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the C with OH) would have:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH3? No, that can't be because that would make four substituents but two of them are the same (CH3). So the central carbon would have two CH3 groups, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again about the structure.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2-OCH3 connected to CH2 connected to COOCH3. The central carbon is the CH2 in the middle. So, the central carbon is connected to:

- OCH3,
- CH2COOCH3,
- two CH2 groups.

So it's a CH2 group, not a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but then what about dimethyl fumarate? Earlier I thought it's symmetric, so it doesn't have optical isomers. So both compounds don't exhibit optical isomerism? That can't be right because the question says one does.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake with the structures. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, with the structure HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH. Wait, no, that's maleic acid, but no. Wait, no, maleic acid is HO2C-CHCH-COOH with a double bond between the two middle carbons (cis configuration), while fumaric acid is the trans configuration. So the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, fumarate should have a double bond. Let me think: fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, the structure is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond between the two middle carbons, making the two COOH groups on opposite sides (trans configuration). So the dimethyl ester would be CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, no, that would have a single bond. Wait, no. Wait, the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3. So the double bond is between the first and second carbons, and the second carbon has a COOCH3 group, and the fourth carbon (or third?) has another COOCH3 group. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, that can't be right. Alternatively, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. No, that would have a single bond between CH2 and COOCH3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3. But that would make it a four-carbon molecule with the double bond between C1 and C2, and C2 has a COOCH3 group, while C3 has another COOCH3 group. Wait, that's impossible because that would require five carbons. Hmm, I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3, but in the trans configuration. But that's not possible because of the double bond. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3, with the double bond between C1 and C2, and C2 has a COOCH3 and a CH2COOCH3 group. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. Hmm, but that would have a double bond between C1 and C2, and a single bond between C2 and C3. So the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, if the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3, then the two COOCH3 groups are on C2 and C4, with a single bond between C2 and C3. So the molecule would have the possibility of a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, in the (E) configuration, the two COOCH3 groups would be on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry, which would make it chiral and capable of showing optical isomerism.

Wait, so if dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3, then the molecule is not symmetrical, and thus can exhibit optical isomerism. Whereas methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, as I thought earlier, doesn't have a chiral center, so it can't.

Wait, but earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate's structure is CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3, which doesn't have a chiral center. So, the correct answer would be that dimethyl fumarate exhibits optical isomerism, and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does not.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Maybe it's different. Suppose the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Then, the central carbon (the one with OH) would have four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a hydrogen. But wait, in that case, the central carbon would have four different substituents (CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H), making it a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center and exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the structure is CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3, which doesn't have a chiral center. So I'm confused now.

Let me try to clarify. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. So the structure is:

Carbons: 1 (CH3), 2 (C(OH)H), 3 (COOH).

When we esterify the -OH with methanol, it becomes CH3-C(OCH3)H-COOH. Then, when we esterify the COOH to COOCH3, it becomes CH3-C(OCH3)H-COOCH3.

So the structure is CH3-C(OCH3)H-COOCH3. So the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1),
- OCH3 (from esterification of the -OH),
- COOCH3 (from esterification of COOH),
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, that can't be right because in that case, the central carbon would have four substituents: CH3, OCH3, COOCH3, and H. So that's four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center and exhibit optical isomerism.

So, in that case, part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate is symmetric and doesn't, but perhaps I was wrong. So to recap:

Part A: Which doesn't show tautomerism? I think benzoquinone can't because the alpha carbons don't have Hs, but earlier I thought they do. Alternatively, maybe the alpha carbons in benzoquinone are part of the ring and can't have Hs. So perhaps benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does.

So for part A, the correct answer is benzoquinone, which doesn't show tautomerism.

For part B, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and shows optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate is symmetric (I'm not sure) but perhaps doesn't. Or perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, let me think again about dimethyl fumarate. If its structure is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Because the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, but the molecule could still have a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3, which would be (E) configuration, and thus the molecule would have no plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, if the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3, then the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But the molecule is symmetrical about the double bond axis. So, for example, if the groups on either end are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical. So in this case, both ends have COOCH3 groups, making the molecule symmetrical, thus achiral.

In that case, dimethyl fumarate would not show optical isomerism. So part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Putting it all together:

A: benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

B: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

Looking at the options:

Option D says A is benzoquinone, B is dimethyl fumarate.

Option B says A is benzoquinone, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So the correct answer would be option B or D.

Wait, if I think that dimethyl fumarate is symmetric and doesn't show optical isomerism, then part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it can show optical isomerism. So part B's correct answer would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So looking at options:

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So the correct option is option B, but earlier I thought methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, but now I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the structure. Let me recheck: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate's structure is CH3-C(OCH3)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3 (C1),
- OCH3 (from esterification of -OH),
- COOCH3 (from esterification of COOH),
- and a single bond to another CH3? No, that would make four substituents: CH3, OCH3, COOCH3, and H.

Wait, no, the structure is CH3-C(OCH3)-COOCH3. So the central carbon has CH3, OCH3, COOCH3, and H. That's four different groups, so it's a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate's structure is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3. So that's a four-carbon chain with a double bond between C1 and C2, and COOCH3 groups on C2 and C3. Wait, but that would make the structure CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. So the groups on either side of the double bond are the same (COOCH3), making the molecule symmetrical and thus not chiral.

Alternatively, if the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3, then the molecule would not be symmetrical, leading to optical isomerism. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, both COOCH3 groups are on the same carbon, making the molecule symmetrical. So it's (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)2, which would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, in that case, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, while methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does.

So, part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, combining part A and B:

A = benzoquinone (doesn't show tautomerism),

B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism).

Looking at the options:

Option B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So, the correct option is B.


To solve the question, we analyze the two parts (A and B) systematically:

---

### Part A: Which compound does **not** show tautomerism?

1. **Benzoquinone**:  
   Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two adjacent carbonyl groups. For tautomerism to occur, a molecule must have alpha hydrogens (hydrogens on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups). In benzoquinone, the alpha carbons are part of the benzene ring, which are bonded to other ring carbons and do not have hydrogens. Therefore, benzoquinone **does not have alpha hydrogens** and cannot undergo tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:  
   Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three alternating ketone groups. The alpha carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups) are CH₂ groups, each with two hydrogens. Since it has alpha hydrogens, it can undergo tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part A**: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does.

---

### Part B: Which compound shows **optical isomerism**?

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  
   The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-C(OCH₃)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OCH₃, COOCH₃, and H. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**:  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the (E)-diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂=C(COOCH₃)COOCH₃. The molecule is symmetric due to the identical COOCH₃ groups on either side of the double bond. Symmetry prevents the formation of chiral centers, so dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part B**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate does not.

---

### Final Answer:
- For Part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.  
- For Part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

From the given options, the correct choice is:

**Option B**: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.
