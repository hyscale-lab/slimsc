Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says: I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound that has 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to identify the correct 1H NMR data from the options provided.

Hmm. Let me break this down. So the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Wait, di-substituted means two substituents attached to the benzene. The ring is six-membered, which is typical for benzene. The total number of carbons is 8, so the substituents must add up to 8-6=2 carbons. Or wait, wait. Benzene has 6 carbons. If the substituents add 2 carbons, then the total is 8. So each substituent must be something that adds one carbon each. Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? But that can't be because di-substituted implies two substituents.

Wait, let me think again. The molecule has 8 carbons in total. The benzene ring is 6 carbons. So the substituents contribute 2 carbons. If it's di-substituted, each substituent contributes one carbon each. So each substituent is a one-carbon group, like a methyl or something else.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: one substituent is a carbonyl group, which is O=C-, but that's not adding a carbon, but the other substituent could be a methyl. Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl group. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid, and the other substituent is a halogen, because the IR also shows an aromatic-halogen bond.

Wait, but aromatic halogen substituents like Cl, Br, etc. They are typically attached directly to the ring. So, let's think about possible structures.

So the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, etc.), and the other is a halogen (Cl, Br, etc.). Or wait, perhaps the substituents could be something else. Let
