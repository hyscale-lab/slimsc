Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in various compounds. I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question asks how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. The options are A to D, with the correct number being one of them. I need to figure out which compounds are chiral, meaning they have a non-superimposable mirror image, which is a requirement for optical activity.

Let me list out each compound and analyze them one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: Hmm, this is a chloroalkene. Let's draw the structure. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, wait no. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be CHCl=C(CH3)CH2CH3? Or maybe I got the structure wrong. Let me count the carbons. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would mean Cl is on C1, and a methyl on C2. So the structure is CHCl=C(CH3)CH2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is four carbons: positions 1 to 4. So 1 is the first carbon, which is double bonded to C2. So C1 has Cl and a CH2 group? Or maybe C1 is Cl, double bond to C2, which has a methyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would be Cl on C1, and methyl on C2. So, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So if it's 1-chloro, the Cl is on the first carbon, which is a CH2 group. Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl attached to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CHClCH2CH(CH3)CH2... No, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether this compound is chiral. For a molecule to
