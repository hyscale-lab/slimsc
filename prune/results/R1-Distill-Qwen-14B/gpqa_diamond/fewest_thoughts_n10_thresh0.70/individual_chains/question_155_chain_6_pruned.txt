Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²), where A is the operator. But wait, in this case, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, I think that the expectation value of P_x would be the eigenvalue, which is -ħ. But the question is about P_z, not P_x, so I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in this state.

First, let me write down the given matrices for the operators. So, the operator P_x has the matrix:
Row 1: 0, ħ/√2, 0
Row 2: ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2
Row 3: 0, ħ/√2, 0

P_y has:
Row 1: 0, -iħ/√2, 0
Row 2: iħ/√2, 0, -iħ/√2
Row 3: 0, iħ/√2, 0

And P_z is diagonal:
Row 1: ħ, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, -ħ

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes sense because P_z is diagonal in this basis. So each basis vector corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z, either ħ, 0, or -ħ.

The state of the system is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me denote this vector as |ψ⟩. So, ψ₁ = -1/2, ψ₂ = 1/sqrt(2), ψ₃ = -1/2.

I need to compute ΔP_z, which is the standard deviation. So I'll proceed by calculating ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩, then subtract the square of the expectation value and take the square root.

Wait, but since P_z is diagonal in this basis, calculating ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ should be straightforward. Because for diagonal matrices, the expectation value is just the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the square of their amplitudes.

Let me write down the components of |ψ⟩ again:
ψ₁ = -1/2, ψ₂ = 1/√2, ψ₃ = -1/2.

So, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is ψ₁* * (P_z)₁₁ * ψ₁ + ψ₂* * (P_z)₂₂ * ψ₂ + ψ₃* * (P_z)₃₃ * ψ₃.

Wait, since all ψ are real numbers here? Let me check: the given state is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2), so yes, all real. So ψ₁* = ψ₁, same for others.

So,

⟨P_z⟩ = ( (-1/2) * (ħ) * (-1/2) ) + ( (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) ) + ( (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) )

Wait, let me compute each term:

First term: ( (-1/2) ) * ħ * ( (-1/2)
