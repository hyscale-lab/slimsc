Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me think. I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices, right?

The problem says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a given matrix. Oh wait, the matrix S has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So, let me write that down. Matrix S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And c is h/(4π). So Ay would be (h/4π) multiplied by S. Let me compute Ay:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S = [ [0, -i h/(4π) ], [i h/(4π), 0 ] ]

Wait, but wait, the problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, I can find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

So, the matrix Ay - λ I would be:

[ -λ        -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)   -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ) ] = λ² - [ (-i)(i) (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, what's (-i)*(i)? Let's compute that. (-i)(i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the term becomes (h²/(16 π²)) * 1.

So the determinant equation is λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0. So solving λ² = h²/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4π). Wait, because sqrt(h²/(16 π²)) is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a are plus and minus h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options. Let me check the options. Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. That doesn't match. Option A has imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, but wait, wait a second. Are the eigenvalues purely real? Because in the matrix Ay, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are imaginary. So the matrix is Hermitian? Because if you take the conjugate transpose, it should be the same.

Wait, Ay is c times S. Let me check if S is Hermitian. The matrix S is:

Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

The conjugate transpose would swap the off-diagonal terms and take the complex conjugate. So the (1,2) entry becomes i, and (2,1) becomes -i. But the original S has (2,1) as i and (1,2) as -i. So the conjugate transpose is:

Row 1: 0, i
Row 2: -i, 0

Which is not the same as S. So S is not Hermitian. Wait, but wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Because I thought spin matrices are Hermitian. Oh wait, no. Spin matrices for angular momentum components are proportional to the Pauli matrices, which are Hermitian. Wait, but the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Let me recall: σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So S here looks like σ_y, which is Hermitian because σ_y† = σ_y. Because when you take the conjugate transpose of σ_y, you get [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ]? Wait, no. Wait, σ_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], so its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is not the same as σ_y. Wait, that can't be right because Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me compute σ_y's conjugate transpose. The (1,2) entry is -i, so the (2,1) entry after conjugation is i. So σ_y† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the negative of σ_y. Because σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So σ_y† = -σ_y. So that's anti-Hermitian. Wait, that can't be right. Because I thought all Pauli matrices are Hermitian.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up something. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So σ_y should satisfy σ_y† = σ_y. Hmm, let me recalculate σ_y†.

σ_y is:
0  -i
i   0

Conjugate transpose (swap rows and columns and take conjugate):

0  i
-i 0

Wait, so σ_y† would be:
[ [0, i],
  [-i, 0] ]

Which is the same as σ_y times -1, because the original σ_y is:
0  -i
i   0

So σ_y† = [[0, i], [-i, 0]] = -σ_y. So σ_y is anti-Hermitian. Hmm, that's confusing because I thought Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me double-check the Pauli matrices. No, wait, I think I'm right. Wait, no, wait a second. Let me compute σ_y†. The transpose of σ_y is:

i 0
0 -i

Wait, no, the transpose is swapping rows and columns. Original σ_y:

Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

Transpose (swap rows and columns) would be:

Column 1 becomes Row 1: 0, i
Column 2 becomes Row 2: -i, 0

So transpose is:
Row 1: 0, i
Row 2: -i, 0

Now, the conjugate transpose is the transpose with each element conjugated. So for σ_y:

After transpose, the elements are:
0 → 0
i → i* = -i
- i → (-i)* = i
0 → 0

Wait, wait no. The transpose of σ_y is as I wrote:

Row 1: 0, i
Row 2: -i, 0

So the conjugate transpose is taking the complex conjugate of each element:

Row 1: 0 → 0, i → -i
Row 2: -i → i, 0 →0

So σ_y† is:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

Which is the same as σ_y. Oh! So σ_y is Hermitian. Because σ_y† equals σ_y. So perhaps I made a mistake in my previous calculation.

Wait, okay, so the conjugate of i is -i, and the conjugate of -i is i. So let's recalculate. Original σ_y:

[0   -i]
[i    0]

Transposing gives:

[0   i]
[-i 0]

Taking the conjugate of each element gives:

0 →0
i → -i
-i →i
0 →0

So the conjugate transpose is:

[0   -i]
[i    0 ]

Which is σ_y again. So σ_y is Hermitian. Oh, wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So S is σ_y, which is Hermitian. Therefore, Ay is c times Hermitian, so Ay is Hermitian. So its eigenvalues should be real.

So when I computed the eigenvalues earlier, I got λ = ± h/(4π). But in the options, what do they say about the eigenvalues?

Looking at the options:

Option A: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That can't be right because the eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary parts should be zero.

Option B: Imaginary ±1/2, real ±1. Doesn't match.

Option C: Says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Hmm, that's possible because A² is the square of angular momentum, which commutes with all components, so its eigenfunctions are the same as any component. But Az is a different component, so the eigenfunctions of Ay and Az may not be the same. So if a state is an eigenfunction of Ay and A², it would be an eigenfunction of A², but maybe not of Az. So option C could be correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix Ay. I'm not sure what that means.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me think again about the eigenvalues. Wait, I thought Ay is Hermitian, so eigenvalues are real. But earlier I found λ = ± h/(4π). But let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the matrix S is σ_y, which has eigenvalues ±1. So when multiplied by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues become ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π), which are real. So looking back at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That's incorrect because the eigenvalues are real, so imaginary part is zero.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. So no.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Wait, perhaps I should rederive the eigenvalues.

Ay is (h/4π) * S, and S is σ_y.

The eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1. So the eigenvalues of Ay are c * (±1) = ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real. So the correct eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Looking at the options, none of them directly mention this except perhaps option B and A don't. Wait, no. Let me look again.

Wait, the problem asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps looking for statements about the properties of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

Hmm, since A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with all components, including Ay. So any eigenfunction of Ay would also be an eigenfunction of A². Because the operators A² and Ay commute. So option C is correct because it's possible.

So why? Because for any angular momentum component, the square A² commutes with itself. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it's also an eigenstate of A². But it's not necessarily an eigenstate of Az, the other component, because [Ay, Az] = iħ A something (I think it's [Aj, Ak] = iħ ε_{jkl} A l, but not sure, but the point is they don't commute).

So option C is talking about the eigenfunctions of Ay being eigenfunctions of A², which is correct, but not of Az.

So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. Hmm, not sure what that means. Maybe the matrix is 2x2, so the basis is two-dimensional. The eigenvectors form a basis for the space, but the statement isn't very precise. But option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm, perhaps that's correct because in a 2x2 space, any eigenbasis would form a basis, but I'm not sure if that's what option D is saying.

But let's think about the options. Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A². So that's correct.

So the correct statement is option C.

Alternatively, looking at the options again:

Option D: The eigenfunctions phi of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, perhaps that's not correct because the matrix operator's basis is the standard basis (like the computational basis), but the eigenvectors form a different basis, unless the eigenvectors are aligned with the computational basis.

Wait, what are the eigenvectors of Ay?

Ay = (h/4π) σ_y.

The eigenvectors of σ_y are |+y> and |-y>, which are (1, i)/√2 and (1, -i)/√2, respectively.

So the eigenfunctions are these vectors, which are not the same as the standard basis. So the standard basis is (1,0) and (0,1). The eigenvectors are different. So the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the matrix operator. So option D is incorrect.

So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} S \), the matrix \( A_y - \lambda I \) becomes:

\[
A_y - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix} 
-\lambda & -\frac{h}{4\pi}i \\ 
\frac{h}{4\pi}i & -\lambda 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - \lambda I) = \lambda^2 - \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2.
\]

Setting this equal to zero gives:

\[
\lambda^2 = \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 \implies \lambda = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers. This eliminates options **A** and **B**, as they incorrectly describe the eigenvalues as having imaginary parts.

### Step 2: Eigenvectors of \( A_y \)
The eigenvectors of \( A_y \) correspond to the eigenstates of \( S \), which is proportional to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \). The eigenstates of \( \sigma_y \) are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{bmatrix}, \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -i \end{bmatrix}.
\]

These eigenvectors are not aligned with the standard basis vectors \( (1, 0) \) and \( (0, 1) \), meaning the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) do not form the basis of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This makes option **D** incorrect.

### Step 3: Commutativity and Eigenfunctions
The operator \( A_y \) commutes with \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator), as \( A^2 \) commutes with all components of angular momentum. Therefore, any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) does not commute with \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum), so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This makes option **C** correct.

### Conclusion
The correct statement is that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \).

**Answer: C**
