Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read it again carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, radius same as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When the star rotates, these spots come into view, causing brightness variations, which could mimic an exoplanet transit. The question is, what's the radius of an exoplanet that would create the same brightness variation if it were causing it instead of the spots.

Hmm, I remember that the transit method measures the dip in brightness when a planet passes in front of the star. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. So, if the planet's radius is R_pl and the star's radius is R_star, the area ratio is (R_pl / R_star)^2.

But wait, the spots here are causing a dip too. So I need to calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same variation.

The star's Teff is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere.

Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So each hemisphere is a sphere, right? So one hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface. But the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (0.5 * star's surface area) = 0.1 * star's surface area.

But wait, the star's surface area is 4πR², so the area of spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². No, wait, no. Wait, the star's surface is a sphere, surface area 4πR². One hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that. So spots area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

But when the star rotates, different parts of the hemisphere come into view. But the problem says that the situation can resemble an exoplanet.
