Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about planets transiting and occulting each other. Wait, I remember that a transit event is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, blocking some of the star's light. Occultation, I think, is when one planet passes behind the other relative to the star, so it's when the planet is hidden from view because it's behind the star. Or wait, no, occultation is when a planet passes behind the star, so the planet is blocked by the star. Oh right, like when a satellite is behind the Earth, we lose signalâ€”that's occultation.

So the question is about two planets in the same system. The first planet has Earth's radius, is in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star is 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period is 3 days. We need to find the maximum orbital period of a second planet that's 2.5 Earth radii in size. This second planet must exhibit both transit and occultation events.

Wait, both transit and occultation? So the second planet must pass in front of the star (transit) and also pass behind the star (occultation) as seen from Earth. That must mean that the two planets are in orbits such that they can both transit and occult each other relative to the star. Or wait, is it about the second planet transiting the star and the first planet occulting it, or vice versa?

Wait, no. The problem says the second planet shares the same orbital plane and is in a circular orbit. So both are in the same plane, same orbital parameters except for period and size.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum orbital period of the second planet that allows both transit and occultation events. So what conditions must be met for the second planet to both transit and occult?

Let me think. For a transit to occur, the planet must pass directly in front of the star from our vantage point. The impact parameter is the distance (in units of stellar radii) from the center of the star that the planet's path comes closest. An impact parameter of 0 would
