Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're usually made up of a quark and an antiquark. But the question is about decay distance. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I think I can work through it.

The problem gives me some numbers: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The question is asking for the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters, which makes sense because particles decay pretty quickly.

So, I think the mean decay distance has to do with the particle's lifetime and how fast it's moving. Wait, right, the mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. That depends on its lifetime multiplied by its velocity.

But how do I find the lifetime? Oh, right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I have to be careful with the units here. All the given values are in GeV or MeV, so I'll need to convert them properly.

First, let me note down the constants I might need. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because sometimes ħ is written in units of eV·s, so converting GeV to eV would be 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. Let me think: 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, so 1 GeV·s is 1e9 eV·s. But since ħ is given in GeV·s, I can use it directly.

So Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s, Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = 6.582e-25
