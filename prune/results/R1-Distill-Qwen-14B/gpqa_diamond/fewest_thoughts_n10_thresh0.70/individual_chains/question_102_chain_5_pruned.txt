Okay, so I've got this complex question here about a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. Hmm, I need to figure out why there's no green signal when they look at the mice under the confocal microscope.

Let me read through the question again to make sure I get all the details. So, they used a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. The ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES element. There are stop cassettes in between the ligand and mCherry (loxP-stop-loxP) and between the receptor and eGFP (lox2272-stop-lox2272). They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression via Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, so presumably, the proteins are being expressed.

But when they crossed the mice to SOX10-Cre, which I think is a Cre line that's active in neural crest cells, the offspring didn't show a green signal. So the eGFP wasn't getting expressed, or the receptor wasn't.

Wait, since the receptors are under the IRES, which is a internal ribosome entry site. IRES elements allow for the translation of a second ORF from the same mRNA, right? So the ligand is under a strong promoter (CBA) and the receptor is under the IRES, which is weaker, maybe.

But the vector is bicistronic, so both ligand and receptor are on the same mRNA. The stop cassettes are there, so without Cre, ligand is expressed along with mCherry, and the receptor is not expressed because of the stop. But when Cre is present, it should recombine the lox sites, removing the stop cassettes and allowing both ORFs to be expressed.

Wait, the vector is set up so that the ligand is at 5', followed by mCherry, but with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette in between. So when Cre is added, the loxP sites are recombined, removing the stop, so the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed. Similarly, the receptor is after an IRES, but there's a stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP, which is under lox2272. So, when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but how does the Cre affect the two stop cassettes? Oh, because loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites. So, you can have independent recombination events. So, the Cre is active in neural crest cells, so when the mice are crossed to SOX10-Cre, the Cre is expressed in neural crest-derived cells, which would recombine both cassettes, releasing both the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

But in the Western blot, they saw the proteins, so the expression is happening. So why no green signal
