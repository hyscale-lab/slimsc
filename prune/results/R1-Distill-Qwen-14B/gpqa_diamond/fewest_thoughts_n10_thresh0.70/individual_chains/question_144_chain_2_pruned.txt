Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are different distances in meters, so I guess I need to calculate how far the meson travels before decaying.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its decay width. The formula is τ = ħ / Γ, right? But wait, Γ is the total decay width, so that's correct.

But wait, no, I think that's when the particle is moving relativistically. Oh, right, because the lifetime we usually talk about is the proper lifetime, but when the particle is moving at high speeds, the lifetime we observe is longer due to time dilation. So the mean decay length depends on both the lifetime and the velocity.

So, the steps I think are: first, find the lifetime τ using the width. Then, find the velocity of the meson. Then, multiply the lifetime by the velocity to get the mean decay distance.

Let me write down the steps.

1. Calculate the decay width Γ. Wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV.

Wait, no, the problem says Γ is 320 MeV,
