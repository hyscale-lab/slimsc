Okay, I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies. So, the question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in terms of meters with different exponents, so I need to calculate the mean decay length and see which option matches.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (or mean decay length) depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma times beta, where beta is v/c and gamma is the Lorentz factor. Oh right, the formula is L = c * gamma * beta * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.

But first, I need to find the lifetime tau. I think the width Γ is related to the lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The relation should be Γ = ħ / tau, right? So tau is ħ divided by Γ. Let me get that straight. So tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s or something? I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let's recall the values. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, that's handy because the width is in GeV units.

So, converting Γ from 320 MeV to GeV: 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV. Now, tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ≈ (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me calculate 6.582 divided by 0.32. 6 divided by 0.32 is about 18.75, but wait 6.582 is more precise. Let me compute:

6.582 / 0
