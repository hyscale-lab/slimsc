Okay, so I've got this problem here about vector fields and volume integrals. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. So the question says that there's a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². The field only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R.

Wait, I remember from my electromagnetism class that divergence theorem relates volume integrals to surface integrals. Oh right, the divergence theorem says that the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume is equal to the flux of the vector field through the surface enclosing that volume. So maybe I can use that here.

But wait, I also remember that for fields like electric fields, which have a similar 1/r² dependence, the divergence is zero except at the origin. Oh, because Gauss's law says that the divergence of E is rho/epsilon_0, which is a point charge at the origin. So in this case, if f(r) is similar to an electric field, maybe its divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0.

So the vector field f(r) is radial and has a magnitude of 1/r². Let me think about the divergence in spherical coordinates. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only the radial component (and no theta or phi components) is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f_r). 

Wait, so f_r is the radial component. In this case, f(r) = 1/r², right? So f_r = 1/r². So plug into the divergence formula: (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Simplify inside the derivative: r² * 1/r² is just 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence is (1/r²) * 0 = 0.

Wait, does that mean the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0? Because at r=0, the function isn't defined. So in the volume except the origin, the divergence is zero.

But the integral is over a volume that includes the origin, because the sphere of radius R is centered at the origin. So
