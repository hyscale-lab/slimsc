Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But I'll take it step by step.

The problem says: p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Hmm, right. So, it seems like an annihilation process where a proton and antiproton collide and produce two particles each of charge + and -. Wait, but what are these A particles? Oh, the question says m_A c² is 300 MeV. So each A has a mass of 300 MeV/c².

Wait, but I'm not sure if the charges matter here. Maybe it's a typo, because protons and antiprotons are their own antiparticles, but this reaction probably involves some other particles. Oh well, maybe the charges don't affect the calculation, so I'll proceed.

So the key here is probably conservation of energy and momentum. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe I can approximate that the initial kinetic energy is low compared to the rest mass. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, wait. The antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps its velocity is much less than c. But then, when it annihilates with the proton, the products (the two A particles) would have to conserve both energy and momentum.

Wait, but the problem is about the velocity of A. So maybe I can model this as a collision in the center-of-momentum frame, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial frame is the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly.

Wait, but the proton and antiproton have the same mass, right? So if the antiproton is moving with some velocity, the total initial momentum would be just the momentum of the antiproton before collision.

But the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe I can approximate that the kinetic energy is much less than the rest mass energy. So perhaps the initial energy is dominated by the rest mass energy, and the kinetic energy is negligible.

Wait, but the initial rest mass energy is the sum of the proton and antiproton, each with mass m_p c². Wait, but the mass of a proton is around 938 MeV
