Okay, so I've got this problem about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let's see. So the question is about an alien astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. The spacecraft is going at a huge fraction of the speed of light, like 0.99999987 times c. The astronaut is 22 years old and we need to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective. The options are whether they'll die before getting there, or it'll take about 72, 77, or 81 years.

Wait, I remember that when you're moving at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. So the astronaut's own time (proper time) is shorter compared to the time measured by someone on Earth. But wait, no, wait. Proper time is the shortest time, so from the astronaut's perspective, less time passes. But the question is asking about the time from their point of view, so we need to calculate the proper time.

But wait, first, how far away is the Large Magellanic Cloud from Earth? I think the average distance is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years. Let me think, so the approximate distance. Let's say it's 160,000 light-years, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, no, the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away, right? So, let's take that as the distance D.

So, the spacecraft is moving at v = 0.99999987 * c. So, from Earth's frame, the time taken would be D / v. But from the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted, so the proper length is shorter. So the time experienced by the astronaut is (D * gamma) / v? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the formula for time dilation is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in Earth's frame, and t' is the proper time experienced by the astronaut. So, if I can find t, then I can find t'.

Wait, but actually, the distance D is in Earth's frame. So from Earth's frame, time t = D / v. Then, the astronaut's time is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Alternatively, the astronaut's proper time is also given by t' = D' / v, where D' is the contracted distance. And since D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), then t' = (D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) / v = (D / v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which matches the time dilation formula.

So I'll proceed with the first approach: calculate t from Earth's view, then multiply by sqrt(1 -v²/c²) to get t'.

But first, let's compute the time t from Earth's perspective. D is about 163,000 light-years. v is 0.99999987c. So t = D / v = (163,000 ly) / (0.99999
