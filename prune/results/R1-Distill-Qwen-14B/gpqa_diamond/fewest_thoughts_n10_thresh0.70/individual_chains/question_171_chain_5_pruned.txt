Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident about electrophilic substitution reactions. But I'll try to walk through it step by step.

The question is about the para-substitution yield in six different benzene derivatives when they undergo an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. I need to arrange the substances from least to most para-isomer yield.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the substituents on the benzene ring can activate or deactivate the ring towards electrophilic attack. Activating groups make the ring more reactive, while deactivating groups make it less reactive. Also, substituents can be ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.

The substituents here are:

1) CH3 (methyl)
2) COOEt (ethoxy carbonyl)
3) Cl (chlorine)
4) NO2 (nitro)
5) C2H5 (ethyl)
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

Wait, no, wait. The structures are:

1) C6H5-CH3 → toluene. So the substituent is methyl.
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 → benzoate ester. The substituent is an ester group, OOCR.
3) C6H5-Cl → chlorobenzene.
4) C6H5-NO2 → nitrobenzene.
5) C6H5-C2H5 → ethylbenzene.
6) C6H5-COOH → benzoic acid.

Now, the main idea is that substituents that are strong deactivating groups will lead to less para substitution because they might direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions. Wait, no. Wait, the directing effect determines where the substitution occurs. So the substituent's nature affects the ratio of the para isomer.

Wait, each substituent directs incoming groups to specific positions. The para position is a major site when the substituent is ortho/para directing, especially when the substituent is activating. Deactivating groups may be meta or para directors, depending on their nature.

So, in an electrophilic substitution, the substituent's activating or deactivating nature and their directing effects will determine the major product.

Wait, but bromine is a strong electrophile. So in bromination reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring influence where the bromine adds.

Now, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, the para isomer's yield depends on the substituent's directing effects.

Let me list each substituent and their directing effects:

1) Methyl (CH3): activating, ortho/para director. So in bromination, the para position would be a major site. But wait, for mono-substituted benzene with an activating group, the para isomer may have a higher yield.

Wait, but in bromine excess, the reaction tends to go to completion, but the question specifies only one monobromo derivative is formed. So each substituent directs the bromine to specific positions, but the question is about the para-isomer's yield relative to others.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substitution patterns and which substituents lead to higher para yields.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each compound, when bromine adds, the para position (relative to the substituent) is one possible site, but other sites are possible depending on the substituent's directing.

But wait, some substituents are meta directors, so the para position isn't a main site. For example, nitro is a strong meta director. So in nitrobenzene, bromine would add more in meta positions than para.

But for nitro group, which is meta-directing and deactivating, when the benzene is nitrated, the substituent directs the next group to the meta position. So in the case of nitrobenzene undergoing bromination, the bromine would enter meta to the nitro group, not para. So the para isomer would be less.

Similarly, for substituents that are meta directors, the para isomer's yield is lower.

Now, substituents that are para directors will have higher para yields.

So first, I'll categorize each substituent's directing effect.

1) CH3: activating, ortho/para director. So substituent directs to ortho and para positions. So para will be a major product.

2) COOEt: the ester group. The ester is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) because of the carbonyl. But wait, esters are actually weakly electron-withdrawing due to the electron-withdrawing inductive effect but can have resonance effects. Wait, no, ester groups are ortho/para directors, but deactivating. Because the ester group's oxygen is electron-donating through resonance, but the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, so substituents can be classified as activating or deactivating based on their resonance and inductive effects. Esters (like COOEt) are ortho/para-directing but deactivating because the resonance effect of the ester group is more about electron withdrawal. Because the carbonyl has a higher priority, perhaps. So esters are deactivating, meta directors? Or ortho/para?

Wait, I think I should clarify. Let me think: the ester group, such as OCOEt, is an ortho/para director but deactivating because the carbonyl is more influential. So the ester group is a deactivating group, which directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. So for substitution, the para is a possible site.

Wait, but wait: for nitration, for example, the ester group (like in methyl benzoate) is a meta director in some cases? No, I think it's an ortho/para director but deactivating. Because the oxygen's lone pairs can donate electrons via resonance, activating the ring but the overall effect may be deactivating because the carbonyl is more influential. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: remember that substituents can be classified as activating or deactivating, and ortho/para or meta directors.

Here's a list:

- Strongly activating groups: -OCH3 (methoxy), -NH2, etc. Activating, ortho/para directors.

- Moderately activating: -CH3, -R (alkyl groups). Activating (though less so than OCH3), ortho/para directors.

- Deactivating but ortho/para directors: groups like -COOH, -COOR (ester), -COR (keto). These are EWG, but due to resonance, they can donate some electrons into the ring, making them ortho/para directors but deactivating overall.

- Strongly deactivating, meta directors: -NO2, -SO3H, -COOH (wait, no, wait. Wait, -COOH is deactivating and meta-directing? Or is it ortho/para?)

Wait, wait, no. I think I'm confusing. Let me get this straight.

Wait, the -COOH group is a meta director because it's a strong deactivating group. Because the -COOH is an electron-withdrawing group, it deactivates the ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position.
