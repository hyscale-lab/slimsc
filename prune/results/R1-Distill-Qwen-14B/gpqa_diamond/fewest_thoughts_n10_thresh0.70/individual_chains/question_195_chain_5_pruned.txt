Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about two planets orbiting a star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2 around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. The second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii, and we need to find the maximum orbital period it can have while still exhibiting both transit and occultation events. Both planets are in the same orbital plane, and the second also has a circular orbit.

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to understand what transit and occultation events mean. A transit happens when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet moves behind the star, and we lose the planet's light (if it's bright, like a gas giant) from our view.

For both events to happen, the planet must pass both in front and behind the star. That depends on the orbital distance and the star's size relative to the planet's orbit.

Wait, but how do impact parameters play into this? The impact parameter is the distance (in units of the star's radius) that the planet's path misses the center of the star. A higher impact parameter means the planet transits further from the center.

But for a transit to occur, the planet must pass close enough to the star's disk. If the impact parameter is too large, maybe the planet doesn't transit at all, but in this case, the first planet has an impact parameter of 0.2, which is probably okay.

But for the second planet, which is larger, we need to ensure that its orbit allows both events. So perhaps the key is the orbital distance. The farther the planet is from the star, the longer its orbital period. But if it's too far, maybe the transit and occultation don't happen because the planet's orbit is too large relative to the star's size.

Wait, wait. Wait, no, the star's size is fixed. The star is 1.5 solar radii. So the planet's orbital radius has to be such that during transit, the planet is in front of the star, and during occultation, it's behind. So the orbital plane alignment is such that the planet's orbit allows these events.

Wait, but the first planet has an orbital period of 3 days. Let's think about Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis (but since the orbit is circular, the semi-major axis is the radius). The formula is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³, which can be written as P² = (a³)/(M*), where M* is the mass of the star in solar masses, and a is in astronomical units (AU). Wait, no—that’s when we have units in AU, solar masses, and years. But in this problem, the periods are in days and the star's radius is given, not the mass. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps we can use the fact that both planets are orbiting the same star, so their orbital periods relate to their orbital distances by Kepler's law.

So for the star, the mass M* will affect the orbital period. Let's first find the mass of the star. Wait, but we don't have the mass. The star's radius is given as 1.5 times that of the Sun, but radius doesn't directly tell us the mass unless we know about its density or type. Oh wait, perhaps the mass is the same as the Sun? No, wait, no—the star's radius isn't necessarily the same as the Sun's mass. Wait, but without knowing the mass, how can we calculate the orbital period?

Wait, maybe instead of mass, it's better to use the ratio of the periods based
