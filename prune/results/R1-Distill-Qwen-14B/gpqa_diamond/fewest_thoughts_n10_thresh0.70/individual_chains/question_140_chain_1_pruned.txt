Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what each part is saying.

So, the problem describes a reaction involving Substance X. It says that X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K, which I remember is about 4Â°C. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 atoms of oxygen. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. We're supposed to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes.

Hmm. Let me break this down. Maybe I should start by identifying what Substance X could be. The fact that it reacts violently with a liquid and releases a gas makes me think of metals reacting with acids. For example, metals like sodium or potassium react violently with water or acids to produce hydrogen gas. Wait, but in this case, the gas released has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hydrogen gas is H2. Each H atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So that wouldn't fit because the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Wait, if the gas is something else, let's think.

Alternative, maybe the gas is something like NH3? No, because when metals react with water, they usually produce H2, not NH3. Wait, wait. Let me think again. If the gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons in each molecule, let's calculate. For example, if each molecule has 1 proton and 1 neutron, that would be a molecule like H2O? No, because each molecule would have 10 protons (for O) and 10 neutrons? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons in total. So, for each molecule, the sum of protons in all atoms equals the sum of neutrons in all atoms. Let's consider possible gases. 

Hydrogen gas (H2): Each H has 1 proton, 0
