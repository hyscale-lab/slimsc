Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Additionally, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. We have to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes.

Hmm. Let's break this down. The key here is to identify what X, Y, W, G, and B are. Let's take it piece by piece.

First, the reaction between X and Y produces gas W. The description of W is that its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, same number of neutrons and protons per molecule? Or per atom? Oh, probably per molecule. So, each molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think about gases that do that.

Well, a molecule where each has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. Maybe H2O? No, H and O. Wait, wait. Let me think of isotopes: for example, H2O has H (which has 1 proton and 0 neutrons) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So each H2O molecule has (1+1) protons from H and 8 from O, so 10 protons. Neutrons: each H has 0, O has 8, so 8. But 10 protons vs 8 neutrons. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Looking for a molecule where each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Maybe something like NH3? No, N has 7 protons, H has 1 each. So NH3 would have 7 +3=10 protons. Neutrons in N: 7 (if it's ^14N?), but wait, maybe in a different isotope. Or maybe another gas.

Wait, another thought: O2. O has 8 protons each, so O2 has 16 protons. How about neutrons? If the oxygen is ^16O (which is the most common), each has 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 2 * 8 = 16 neutrons. So 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That fits! So W could be O2. But wait, O2 is a diatomic gas, but when you have O2, each molecule has 16 protons (8*2) and 16 neutrons (8*2). So yes, same number. That fits.

Alternatively, could it
