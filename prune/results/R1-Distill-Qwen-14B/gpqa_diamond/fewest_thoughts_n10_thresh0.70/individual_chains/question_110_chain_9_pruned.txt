Okay, so I've got this question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at the Paranal Observatory and HIRES at the Keck Observatory. I need to figure this out step by step. Let's see.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for different observations. The question gives some V magnitude limits for each. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag in V, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag. So, a star must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed. Brighter means lower magnitude, right? Because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So if a star has a V mag of 16, that's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. For HIRES, stars with V mag brighter than 16 can be observed. So, a star needs to have V mag less than or equal to 16 to be detected by HIRES. So the star must have V mag ≤ 16 to be seen by both spectrographs. Wait wait, no—wait. Because the question is which stars can be detected with both. So the star must be detectable by both. So for that, the star's V magnitude must be bright enough for both. ESPRESSO can take stars up to 17 mag (so 17 or brighter, meaning lower magnitude numbers are better). Wait, wait. No, magnitude scales are tricky. The lower the magnitude, the brighter the object.

Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So brighter than 17 means magnitudes less than 17. So for ESPRESSO, a star's apparent V magnitude must be less than 17. For HIRES, the limit is brighter than 16, so apparent V mag must be less than 16.

Wait, so to
