Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I think I remember that these spectrographs have different capabilities, maybe different limits on the brightness of the stars they can observe. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The question lists five stars, each with different properties. For each star, I need to figure out if it's bright enough to be seen by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. Wait, the problem states that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Oh wait, no, the question says the V magnitude is brighter than 17—wait, no, the way it's phrased is, "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, magnitude is a bit counterintuitive because lower numbers are brighter. So if a star has a V magnitude of 17 or less, it's too faint for ESPRESSO? Or is it the other way around?

Let me read the first part again: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, apparent magnitude (which is what we measure from Earth) less than or equal to 17, because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star's apparent V is ≤17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, for HIRES
