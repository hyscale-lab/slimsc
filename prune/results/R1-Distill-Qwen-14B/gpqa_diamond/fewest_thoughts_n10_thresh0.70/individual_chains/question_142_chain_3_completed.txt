Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about density matrices, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space. The options are vectors with different coordinates, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. The given matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, wait, when I expand that, what does it look like?

Let me write it out. The |0><0| matrix is [[1, 0], [0, 0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives each element as 1/2. So ρ is a 2x2 diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere. So it's a diagonal matrix [[0.5, 0],[0, 0.5]].

I think this is the maximally mixed state for a qubit. Because when a qubit is completely mixed, it's in the completely depolarized state, which has equal probabilities for both states |0> and |1>.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I remember that qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere. For a pure state |ψ> = α|0> + β|1>, the Bloch vector is (x, y, z) where x = Re(β*α), y = Im(β*α), z = |α|² - |β|². But wait, that's for pure states. What about mixed states?

Oh, right, for a mixed state, the density matrix can't be written as a pure state. The Bloch sphere representation for mixed states is a bit different. The density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector r and the identity matrix. The formula is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices. So I can compare the given ρ with this expression to find r.

Let me compute (I + r·σ)/2. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So r·σ is r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz. Each of the Pauli matrices is:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So putting it together, (I + r·σ)/2 = (1/2)[[1, 0], [0, 1]] + (1/2)[[r_z, r_x - i r_y], [r_x + i r_y, -r_z]]

Adding these gives:

[[ (1 + r_z)/2, (r_x - i r_y)/2 ],
 [ (r_x + i r_y)/2, (1 - r_z)/2 ] ]

Comparing this to the given ρ, which is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So the diagonal elements (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 and (1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5. Let's solve for r_z.

(1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 ⇒ 1 + r_z = 1 ⇒ r_z = 0.

Similarly, the (1 - r_z)/2 will be (1 - 0)/2=0.5, which matches. Now the off-diagonal elements:

(r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0. So r_x - i r_y = 0 ⇒ r_x = 0 and r_y = 0.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That's the origin in the Bloch sphere, which makes sense because the state is maximally mixed. The completely mixed state is at the center of the Bloch sphere, as it's the maximally uncertain state.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

Expanding this, we find that it is a diagonal matrix:

\[
\rho = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a qubit, where the system has equal probability of being in either the \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\) state. For mixed states, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r \cdot \sigma \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\sigma = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Substituting this into the expression for \(\rho\) gives:

\[
\rho = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1 + r_z}{2} & \frac{r_x - i r_y}{2} \\
\frac{r_x + i r_y}{2} & \frac{1 - r_z}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \(\rho = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix},
\]

we solve for the components of \(r\). From the diagonal elements:

\[
\frac{1 + r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \implies r_z = 0,
\]
\[
\frac{1 - r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \implies r_z = 0.
\]

From the off-diagonal elements:

\[
\frac{r_x - i r_y}{2} = 0 \implies r_x = 0, \, r_y = 0.
\]

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This is consistent with the maximally mixed state being at the center of the Bloch sphere, representing maximum uncertainty.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
