Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Alright, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the density matrix ρ, which is given as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubit space. The options are four different points, A to D. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that density matrices represent the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. A density matrix for a pure state is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|, but when it's a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture. So in this case, ρ is a mixed state because it's an equal mixture of |0> and |1> states, each with weight 1/2.

Now, thinking about how density matrices relate to the Bloch sphere. Oh right! The Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. For a pure state |ψ>, it's a point on the surface of the unit sphere. The density matrix is then |ψ><ψ|. But when the state is mixed, the Bloch vector is scaled by the purity of the state.

Wait, I think the general form of a single-qubit density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if we can express ρ in that form, we can find r.

Let me write out ρ again. ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|) / 2. Hmm. Let me calculate each term:

|0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1,0 on the diagonal.
|1><1| is diagonal with 0,1.
Adding them gives a diagonal matrix [1,1]. Then multiply by 1/2: [1/2, 1/2 on the diagonal? Wait no, wait: 1/2*(1,0;0,1) + 1/2*(0,0;0,1) → no, wait. Wait no, |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and then multiplied by 1/2 gives [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. So ρ is the identity matrix multiplied by 1/2, since I is [[1,0],[0,1]], and (1/2)I is that.

So, if I write ρ as (I + r·σ)/2, I can set that equal to (I)/2. Because (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2 when r·σ is zero. Because if r is zero, then r·σ is zero, so (I+0)/2 = I/2.

So that implies that the Bloch vector r is zero. Because for ρ to be (I/2), r must be zero vector. So the point is at the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Wait, but the options are given as r coordinates. So option C is (0,0,0), which would be the origin. So the geometrical position is the origin.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the purity. The density matrix ρ has trace 1, which it does since each diagonal is 1/2, sum to 1. The purity is Tr(ρ²). Let's compute that. ρ squared is ((1/2)^2)(|0><0| + |1><1|)^2. Wait, since they are orthogonal projectors, their product is zero. So |0><0| |1><1| = 0, etc. So ρ² is (1/2)^2 ( |0><0|² + |1><1|² + 0 + 0 ) which is (1/4)( |0><0| + |1><1| ). Then Tr(ρ²) is (1/4)(1 + 1) ) = 1/2. So the state is a mixed state with purity 1/2, which makes sense because it's a 50-50 mixture.

In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix is represented by a vector r, where ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. So for our case, ρ is (I)/2, so r must be zero. So r is (0,0,0), which is option C.

I think that's the right approach. So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically a 50-50 mixture of the computational basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For single-qubit states, the density matrix can generally be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we note that \(\rho\) simplifies to \(\frac{I}{2}\), which implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). Therefore, the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must be the zero vector, corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin, which corresponds to the point \((0,0,0)\).
