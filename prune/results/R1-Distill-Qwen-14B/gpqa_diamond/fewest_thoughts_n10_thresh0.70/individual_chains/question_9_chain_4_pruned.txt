Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these molecules has C3H symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3H symmetry is a type of molecular symmetry where the molecule looks the same after a rotation of 120 degrees, and also has a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing that up. Oh right, C3H symmetry is a point group, right? Point groups are about the symmetry elements a molecule has. C3H would mean that the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused with other point groups. Let me think again.

C3H is one of the point groups. The way I remember, point groups are determined by the symmetry elements present. For C3H, the molecule must have a three-fold rotation axis (so rotating it by 120 degrees brings it back to itself) and also a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's the same as the C3v point group? Because C3v has a C3 axis and two vertical mirror planes. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me clarify.

Wait, the point group C3H might not be a standard notation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct point group is D3h, which does have a horizontal mirror plane and a three-fold axis. Or maybe it's C3h, which is a different classification. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on point groups. Let me think about each molecule and their structures.

The options are four molecules:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I need to determine which one has C3H symmetry.

First, let's think about each option.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. Structure-wise, triisopropyl borate has a central boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a CH(CH3)2 group. So the molecule is something like (i-Pr)3B. The structure around the boron is trigonal planar, and each isopropyl group is attached to it. Wait, does this have a plane of symmetry? Each isopropyl is symmetric, so maybe the molecule has a three-fold rotational symmetry. But I'm not sure about the mirror planes. If all three substituents are the same, then it's trigonal symmetry. For point group, the trigonal planar would be D3h, but wait, no, wait. Wait, (i-Pr)3B is a trigonal planar molecule, each substituent being identical, so the point group would be D3h? Because it has a center of inversion? Or perhaps it
