Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a specific compound. 

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. Oh wait, wait. So the ring itself is 6 carbons, and the substituents add up to 2 more carbons because 6 + 2 = 8. So that means each substituent is a single carbon? Or maybe they're a group that has multiple carbons but attached in a way that only adds one or two in total. Hmm.

The FTIR peaks indicate a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Cl, Br, etc.). So the molecule has both a carbonyl group and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring. 

Let me think about possible structures. Di-substituted aromatic rings with a carbonyl and a halogen. So maybe something like a substituted benzaldehyde with a halogen? Or perhaps an aromatic ketone with a halogen substituent.

Wait, the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring. One is a carbonyl group (like a -CO-R group), and the other is a halogen. Or maybe the carbonyl could be part of a substituent that's attached to the ring, like an acyl group.

Wait, the total is 8 carbons. So the ring has 6 carbons. The substituents would add 2 more, so maybe each substituent is a single carbon. Or perhaps one substituent is two carbons, and the other is none? No, because it's di-substituted, so two substituents. So each substituent contributes one carbon each. So 6 (ring) + 2 (substituents) = 8.

So the substituents are each a single carbon. Wait, but a carbonyl group like -CHO (aldehyde) would be a substituent with one carbon (the aldehyde is CHO, so that's one carbon attached to the ring). The other substituent is a halogen, like -Cl or -Br, which is just one atom. Oh wait, but a halogen is a substituent without adding a carbon. So maybe that's not correct because that would only add one substituent. Hmm, maybe I'm m
