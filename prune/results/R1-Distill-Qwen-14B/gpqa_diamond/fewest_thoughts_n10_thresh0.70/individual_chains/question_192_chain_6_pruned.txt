Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor; it's shifted by some distance s.

Then, we're told that a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the center of the cavity is l. Both L and l are larger than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

The options given are A to D, each with different expressions for E.

Hmm. So I need to find the electric field at point P. Let me recall what I know about conductors and their electric fields.

First, the conductor is uncharged. But there's a charge inside the cavity. Wait, but I remember that when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when you put a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's interior must adjust.

Wait, no, the conductor is uncharged but it has a cavity with a charge. So how does that affect the electric fields inside and outside the conductor?

I think the key concept here is the method of image charges or the superposition of electric fields in conductors. Or perhaps the shielding effect? But I'm not sure.

Wait, for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor (the material part, not the cavity) is zero. So the charges on the conductor's surface will rearrange to cancel any internal fields.

But this is a conductor with a cavity. So there's a charge inside the cavity, which is +q. The conductor itself is neutral. So what happens? I remember that the charges in the conductor will redistribute such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero.

Wait, but the conductor has a cavity. So when the charge +q
