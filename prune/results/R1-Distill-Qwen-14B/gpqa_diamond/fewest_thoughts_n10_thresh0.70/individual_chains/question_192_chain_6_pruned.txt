Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. So the cavity is entirely inside the conductor, I guess.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm. So I need to find E at point P. Let me visualize this. There's a big sphere (radius R), and inside it, a smaller sphere (radius r) somewhere off-center. The charge q is inside the cavity. Point P is outside the big sphere, so maybe far away or in some position relative to the setup.

I remember that when charges are inside a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. So when we add a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's charges will respond.

Wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges would move freely. Since it's initially neutral, placing a positive charge in the cavity would induce negative charges on the inner surface of the conductor, right? But since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must then have a positive charge to balance.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is uncharged. So when you place a +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q to keep the total charge zero. Because the conductor can't have a net charge, right? Wait, no, the conductor's initial charge is zero. So placing +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity side
