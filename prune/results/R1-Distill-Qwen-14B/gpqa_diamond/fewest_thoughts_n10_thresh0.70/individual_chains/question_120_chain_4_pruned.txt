Okay, so I have this astronomy question to tackle. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax when stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (p) is the reciprocal of distance (d) in parsecs, so p = 1/d. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with parallax. 

I think this involves some sort of density or distribution. Uniformly distributed means stars are spread out equally in all directions. So, if I imagine a sphere around the Earth with radius d, the number of stars within that sphere should depend on the volume, right? Because volume increases with the cube of the radius, so more volume would mean more stars if they're uniformly distributed. 

Wait, let's think in terms of distance. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell between d and d+dd would be proportional to the surface area of the shell multiplied by the thickness and the local density. But since the density is uniform, the number would be proportional to d^2 * dd. Because the surface area of a sphere is 4πd², and multiplying by the thin shell thickness (dd) gives the volume. So the number of stars per distance interval increases with d squared. 

But the question is about parallax, which is p = 1/d. So if d increases, p decreases. Let me express the number of stars in terms of parallax. Since d = 1/p, substituting that in, the number of stars per distance interval (dd) would be proportional to (1/p^2) * (dp) because d^2 * dd = (1/p^2) * ( - dp^2/p² )? Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up here. Let me think again.

The number of stars between parallax p and p + dp (which corresponds to distance d and d + dd) would be proportional to d² * dd. Since dd = - (1/p²) dp, substituting d = 1/p into that, the number becomes (1/p^2) * (-1/p²) dp) → but since we're looking for the absolute number, the negative sign doesn't matter. So the number is proportional to (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 1/p^4 * dp. 

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me approach it
