Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution based on parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth when we look at it from two opposite points in our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that the distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax: d = 1/plx. So, a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, which is really close, right?

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So, I'm thinking it's about the density of stars at different distances. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density is the same in all directions. But the way we observe them depends on how their distances are spread out.

If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number per unit volume is constant. But when we look at them from Earth, their distribution in terms of parallax isn't uniform because of the way distance relates to parallax.

Wait, let's think about this. The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd would be 4πd² dd. Because for a sphere, the volume is 4/3 π r³, so the difference between r = d and r = d + dd is approximately 4πd² dd. So, number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

Since d = 1/plx, I can write d in terms of parallax. So, d = 1/plx. Let me compute dd in terms of plx. Let's see, dd = derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx. So, derivative of 1/x is -1/x². So, dd = (-1/plx²) * d plx. Wait, but since plx increases as d decreases, maybe I should think about it in terms of plx itself.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of plx. Let me try substituting d
