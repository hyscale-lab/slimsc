Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis pathways can get tricky. Let me take a deep breath and try to break it down step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. And I've got four options, each with a sequence of reactions. Hmm. I need to figure out which sequence leads to the desired product with high yield.

Let me look at the target molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So on the benzene ring, substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Specifically, position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (t-Bu), and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2). Wait, actually, waitâ€”when numbering, the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So maybe I should clarify their positions.

Wait, the numbering might be such that the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, in the structure:

Position 1: ethoxy (OEt)
Position 2: t-Bu
Position 3: nitro (NO2)

So, the substituents are in a meta arrangement relative to each other? Or maybe ortho and meta. Let me think about how the substituents would be added.

In aromatic substitution, the order of adding groups matters because each step can direct the next substitution. Benzene is usually activated towards electrophilic substitution. But once groups are added, especially meta directors, they can influence where the next substituent goes.

Let me think about the directing effects. Nitro groups are meta directors. Ethoxy groups are ortho/para directors. Tert-butyl is a bulky group and an alkyl group, so it's a para/ortho director (though bulky might make it more para favored due to steric hindrance).

Wait, but the substituents here are t-Bu, OEt, and NO2. The nitro group is a strong meta director. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. The t-Bu is a bulky, weakly activating (since it's alkyl) group, which is ortho/
