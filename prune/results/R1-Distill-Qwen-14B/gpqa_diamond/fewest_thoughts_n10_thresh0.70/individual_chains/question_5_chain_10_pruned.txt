Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that eigenvalues and eigenvectors are important in quantum mechanics because they represent the possible outcomes of measurements and the corresponding states.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, these look familiar. I think these are the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. The Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz are usually used for spin-1/2 systems, like electrons. Since this is a muon, which is also a spin-1/2 particle, the same formalism applies.

So the components are:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

The operator P itself isn't given directly, but I suppose it's the vector operator, so P = n · (Px, Py, Pz), where n is the direction vector. Since n is in the x-z plane, it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane implies that φ is 0 or π, but the direction is purely in the x and z. So θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

So P would be n_x Px + n_z Pz.

Wait, let's calculate that. Let's substitute n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ.

So P = (sinθ)(Px) + (cosθ)(Pz).

Substituting the matrices:

P = (sinθ)*(ħ/2)*[[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ)*(ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute each term:

First term (from Px scaled by sinθ):

(ħ/2) * sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]]

Which is [[0, (ħ/2) sinθ], [(ħ/2) sinθ, 0]]

Second term (from Pz scaled by cosθ):

(ħ/2) * cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Which is [[ (ħ/2) cosθ, 0 ], [0, -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

Adding these together, the matrix P becomes:

Top-left: (ħ/2) cosθ
Top-right: (ħ/2) sinθ
Bottom-left: (ħ/2) sinθ
Bottom-right: -(ħ/2) cosθ

So the matrix P is:

[[ (ħ/2) cosθ, (ħ/
