Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

The operator is P, and it's for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The components of P (P_x, P_y, P_z) are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2 each.

Wait, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenstates are often aligned along a particular direction. Since the direction here is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, the eigenvector should have components depending on the angles theta and phi. But wait, since it's in the x-z plane, maybe phi is 0 or something? Or maybe not, because the direction is arbitrary but in x-z. Hmm, maybe phi is zero because it's in the x-z plane, so the direction is along a certain angle theta from the z-axis.

Wait, the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the eigenvector should be in the direction of n. So the eigenvector would be along the direction (x and z components). But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

The operator P is a vector operator, so I think P = (P_x, P_y, P_z). But wait, in quantum mechanics, the total angular momentum operator is usually J = J_x + J_y + J_z, but in this case, P is the operator. So to find the eigenvector of P along n, which is in the x-z plane, I think I need to construct the component of P along n. Because the eigenvalue equation is (P · n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>.

Oh wait, because the operator along direction n would be P_n = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). So the eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ> 

But since n is in the x-z plane, n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). Because any direction in x-z plane has y-component zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z), and it's a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Each component P_x, P_y, P_z are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down the matrices:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0 1], [1 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0 -i], [i 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1 0], [0 -1]]

So, substituting into P_n: 

P_n = n_x * (ħ/2) [[0 1], [1 0]] + n_z * (ħ/2) [[1 0], [0 -1]]

Which simplifies to (ħ/2) [
