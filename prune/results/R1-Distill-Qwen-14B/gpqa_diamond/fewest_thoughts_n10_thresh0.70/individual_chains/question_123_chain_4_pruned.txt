Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Hmm, let me read it again.

So, there's a supernova that happened in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, right. So the problem is about relative motion between two inertial frames. I remember that in such a case, velocities add up according to special relativity, but wait, does that apply here? Oh wait, maybe I should think about how time dilation works between the frames.

So, each frame measures their own time. The time experienced in one frame is different from the other because of time dilation, especially if the frames are moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, first, what's the given data? From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the relative speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s. Wait, but that's a pretty high speed, so relativistic effects might be important.

Wait, but the problem says to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm.

Let me break this
