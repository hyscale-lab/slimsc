Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Hmm, let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and a reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with NaCN, I think that's a nucleophilic substitution. Oh wait, no, wait. But wait, NaCN is a good nucleophile. Or wait, but in a ketone, the carbonyl is an electrophilic center. So maybe it's a nucleophilic addition?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. For the first reaction, butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN and some reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure of the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the ketone group (C=O) is being converted into a nitrile (CN) and a hydroxyl group? Or wait, no. Wait, the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
