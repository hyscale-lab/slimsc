Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The first part of the reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part is another reaction involving 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile with reagent B and water to form a butanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that ketones reacting with CN- typically undergo nucleophilic substitution or addition. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when a ketone reacts with something like NaCN, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but wait, no, NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which are nucleophiles. Oh right, in the presence of an acid catalyst, perhaps? Because I recall that CN- can add to ketones in a nucleophilic addition, especially under certain conditions.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the ketone (butan-2-one is (CH3)2C=O) has the CN added where? Oh, wait, the ketone group is at position 2. So adding CN would probably be
