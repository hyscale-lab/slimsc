Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The setup is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. When they collide, new particles are produced. These particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities. The Lorentz factor given is around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead.

The detector's radius is 30 meters. Hmm, so the radius is the distance from the center to the wall. Since it's a sphere, the maximum distance a particle would have to travel is the radius.

Wait, okay, so the problem must have to do with the lifetime of these particles and how much distance they can cover before decaying. Because if they're fast-decaying, their lifetime is short, so whether they reach the detector walls depends on their speed and how long they live.

I remember that in relativity, time dilation affects the lifetime of particles. The proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) is multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma to get the dilated lifetime in the lab frame. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime, tau.

So the distance a particle can travel before decaying is velocity multiplied by time. But velocity at ultra-relativistic speeds is approximately the speed of light, c. So the distance is approximately (beta * c) * (gamma * tau), where beta is v/c.

Wait, beta is v/c, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So when beta is close to 1, gamma is large.

So the distance D the particle travels before decaying is D ≈ c * tau * beta * gamma.

But wait, beta is v/c, so beta * gamma would be (v/c) * gamma. Since gamma is 1/sqrt(1-beta²), let's see: beta * gamma = beta / sqrt(1 - beta²) = beta / sqrt( (1-beta)(1+beta) )).

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it in terms of gamma and beta together. Because for ultra-relativistic speeds, beta is approximately 1, so beta ≈
