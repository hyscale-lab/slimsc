Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and break it down. The question is about binary star systems and their masses based on observations. Hmm, I remember that binary stars orbit a common center of mass, and their radial velocities can help determine their masses.

So, there are two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with different periods. System_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has 1 year. The radial velocity (RV) variations are sinusoidal, and each system has two stars with given amplitudes.

In system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 and 10. I think the RV amplitudes relate to the masses of the stars. Since the more massive star would have a smaller velocity, right? Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star, so it doesn't move as much.

So, the formula I need to remember is probably Kepler's third law for binary systems. The period relates the masses and the separation. But wait, I also recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitude is related to the mass of the companion. Let me think. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v * sin i) / (1 + mass_ratio), where v is the orbital speed of the star around the center of mass.

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of mass function. The mass function relates the RV semi-amplitude, the orbital period, and the mass ratio. The mass function is f(m) = (K^3 * P) / (2π G), but I'm not sure how exactly it applies here.

Alternatively, I remember that for a binary system, the ratio of the masses is inversely proportional to the ratio of their velocities. So, mass1/mass2 = velocity2/velocity1. Because m1*v1 = m2*v2 (due to conservation of momentum, so they orbit the center of mass). 

So in system_1: velocities are 10 and 5. So the masses should be in a 1:2 ratio. Let me check: if m1*v1 = m2*v2, so m1*10 = m2*5 → m1/m2 = 5/10 → 1/2. So the mass of the first star is half that of the second. So the total mass of system_1 is m1 + m2 = m2/2 + m2 = 3m2/2.

In system_2: velocities are 15 and 10. So m1/m2 = 10/15 = 2/3. So total mass is m1 + m2 = (2m2/3) + m2 = (5m2/3).

Wait, but wait. I think the masses are inversely proportional to their velocities. So higher velocity means lower mass. So for system_1: the star's velocity is 10 and 5. So their masses are in the ratio of 5:10 or 1:2. So the more massive star has the lower velocity.

So the total mass of system_1 is (1 + 2
