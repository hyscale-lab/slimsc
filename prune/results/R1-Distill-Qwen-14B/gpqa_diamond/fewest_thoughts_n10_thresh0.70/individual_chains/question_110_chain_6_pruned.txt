Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm. I need to figure this out step by step.

First, let me understand what the question is asking. It says which stars can be detected by both spectrographs. From the information, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning V <17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V<16. So a star that's detected by both must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES. Wait no, wait: the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag (so V less than 17, since lower magnitudes are brighter). Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V less than 16. So a star must have V magnitude less than 16 (brighter than 16) to be seen by both, because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, but HIRES can only go up to 16. So for both, the star's V mag must be less than 16.

Wait, no, wait again. For a star to be detected by both, it needs to be within the observable range of both. ESPRESSO can observe up to V=17, which is fainter (since higher magnitudes are fainter). HIRES can observe up to V=16. So for a star to be detected by both, it must be brighter than 17 mag? No, wait, wait. If a star's V magnitude is less than 17, both can see it? No, because HIRES can only go up to 16. So if a star is brighter than (i.e., V <16), then both can detect it. If it's between 16 and 17, HIRES can't detect it, but ESPRESSO can. So the star must have V <16 to be detected by both.

Wait, but some stars have their apparent magnitude affected by extinction (dust), which is mentioned in the question. So I need to calculate their apparent V magnitudes, considering any extinction, and see if they're below 16.

Let me look
