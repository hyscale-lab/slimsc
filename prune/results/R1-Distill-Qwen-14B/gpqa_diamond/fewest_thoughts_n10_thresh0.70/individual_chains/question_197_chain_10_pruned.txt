Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out what the product is when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let me start by looking at the given data: the IR and NMR spectra. 

First, the IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region usually indicative of O-H or N-H stretches. But since the compound is reacting with HI and red phosphorus, which I remember is a reagent used for the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, especially in the formation of alcohols. Wait, no, wait—red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of esters or maybe in the formation of alcohols from alkyl halides via the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction? Or wait, no, I think red phosphorus with HI is used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids, or maybe for cleaving ethers. Let me think—I think when an ester reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it might undergo hydrolysis. Or perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination situation, but that's more with amines. Alternatively, maybe it's about removing a protecting group.

Looking at the IR peaks: the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to carbonyl groups like esters or ketones. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretching. Also, the 3400–2500 region could be due to O-H from a carboxylic acid, or maybe an alcohol. Wait, but if there's a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester group. Alternatively, if the compound has both a carbonyl and an O-H, perhaps it's an acid?

Looking at the NMR data: the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is a strong indicator of an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm. So that peak suggests a COOH group. Then, the 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm doublets each integrating to 2H—this looks like two sets of aromatic protons. If they are doublets, maybe they are para to each other. Like in a para-substituted benzene ring. So perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with substituents at the para positions.

Looking further, the 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H), 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) likely indicates a methyl group attached to a CH2, like in a ethyl group. The 1.4 as a doublet (3H) suggests a CH(CH3)2 group or maybe a CH2 connected to a branching. The multiplet at 1.7 (2H) and 2.9 (1H) could be from a CH2CH2CH3 chain, like an ethyl group or part of a butyl chain.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is an aromatic ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group (from IR 1720 cm-1) and an ester or acid group. Since the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, that's more consistent with a carboxylic acid, which suggests that maybe the starting compound is an ester that would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid when reacted with something like HI and red phosphorus.

Wait, but wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. The reaction of an ester with HI and red phosphorus typically converts the ester into an acid. For example, an ester R
