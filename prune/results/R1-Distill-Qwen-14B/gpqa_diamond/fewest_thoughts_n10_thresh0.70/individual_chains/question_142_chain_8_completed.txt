Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But this one looks a bit familiar. Wait, isn't this a special case where the qubit is in a completely mixed state?

Right, for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometrical way to represent the state of a qubit. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

The general form of the density matrix for a single qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, yeah, so I can expand that. Let me write it out.

The Pauli matrices are:
σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, the density matrix ρ would be (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2, where r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z), and I is the identity matrix.

Comparing that to the given ρ: ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute |0><0| and |1><1|.

|0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = I/2.

Wait a second, so ρ is I/2. Let me write that out. I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so I/2 is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

Now, putting this into the general form: I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ. Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r·σ. So r·σ must be zero. That implies that r is the zero vector, because σx, σy, σz each have non-zero elements, and their combination would only be zero if all r components are zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. So r·σ is r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz. If r is zero, then r·σ is zero, so ρ becomes I/2, which matches.

So the vector r is (0,0,0), which would be the origin. That makes sense because the completely mixed state is the maximally uncertain state, which is at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options:
Option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer must be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. For a single qubit, the general form of the density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), which implies that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). 

This corresponds to the completely mixed state of a qubit, which is represented as the origin in the Bloch sphere. Among the options provided:

- **A)** \(r = (1,1,0)\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **B)** \(r = (0,0,1)\): Incorrect, as this would represent a pure state along the \(z\)-axis, not the mixed state.
- **C)** \(r = (0,0,0)\): Correct, as this represents the completely mixed state at the origin of the Bloch sphere.
- **D)** \(r = (1,1,1)\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
