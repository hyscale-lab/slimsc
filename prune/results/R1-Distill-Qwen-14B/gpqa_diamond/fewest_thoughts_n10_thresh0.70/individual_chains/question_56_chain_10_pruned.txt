Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is about the transition from the |3,0,0> state to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules.

Wait, dipole transitions follow specific selection rules. For the hydrogen atom, the selection rules are usually Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So, the angular momentum quantum number l can change by one unit, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0 or ±1.

The initial state is |3,0,0>. Since l is 0, which is an s orbital. The final state is |1,0,0>, another s orbital. But wait, if the initial l is 0, then in the first transition, l can only go to 1, because Δl must be ±1. So the first transition must go from l=0 to l=1. So the intermediate state must have l=1.

So the first transition is from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1. Because the electron drops from n=3 to n=2, right? Because after the first transition, it goes to a lower energy level.

Wait, but then from n=2, l=1, how does it get to |1,0,0>? Because the second transition would drop n from 2 to 1. So from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>.

But wait, for the second transition, what are the selection rules? Again, Δl can be ±1. So from l=1, it can go to l=0 or l=2. But the final state is l=0. So that's allowed.

So the intermediate state must be |2,1,m>. Now, what are the possible m values for the intermediate state? The initial state |3,0,0> has m=0. So in the first transition, m can change by 0, ±1. So from m=0, possible m values are -1, 0, +1 for the intermediate state.

So the possible intermediates are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,+1>.

Now, the second transition goes from n=2, l=1, m to n=1, l=0, m=0. Because the final state is |1,0,0>, which has m=0.

So in the second transition, the m must go from whatever it was in the intermediate state to 0. So let's see: from |2,1,m>, m can change by 0 or ±1. So to reach m=0, the intermediate m must be 0, 1, or -1. Wait, because if the intermediate is |2,1,1>, then in the second transition, m can change by -1 (so 1 → 0). Similarly, if the intermediate is |2,1,-1>, then m can change by +1 (so -1 → 0).
