Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that constitutional isomers have different structures, like different connectivity, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements, like enantiomers or diastereomers. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift between different forms, like keto and enol forms, right? And optical isomerism is about compounds having different physical properties towards plane-polarized light, which means they have chiral centers or some kind of asymmetry.

The question is divided into two parts, A and B.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism again? Tautomerism occurs when a proton and a hydrogen bond shift, changing the structure. For example, in ketones and aldehydes, they can form enols. But some structures can't tautomerize because the necessary hydrogen isn't present or the structure is constrained.

Benzoquinone is a quinone with a benzene ring. Quinones are diketones, so they can undergo tautomerism. Wait, but wait. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on the benzene ring. So for tautomerism to happen, the hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl must be available. Oh, but in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to the ring. So the structure is like O=C6H4=O, but each carbonyl is next to a carbon that's part of the ring. So maybe the hydrogen isn't available for tautomerism because it's all conjugated. Or wait, maybe the possibility is there. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize because the structure is already conjugated and doesn't allow for keto-enol tautomerism. Hmm. Or perhaps I'm mixing it up. Let me think again.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So the structure is O=C-(CH2)-O
