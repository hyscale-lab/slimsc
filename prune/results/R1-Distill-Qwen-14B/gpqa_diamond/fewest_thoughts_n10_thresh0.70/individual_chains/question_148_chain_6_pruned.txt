Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack all the information given.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. So, Y is some element that forms multiple fluorides. There are five known, so Y probably has a higher valency since it can form multiple compounds with F.

Let me list the substances mentioned:

- A1: Bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm. Xenon is a noble gas; being oxidized would mean it's acting as a reducing agent. So, A1 is a strong oxidizing agent.

- A3: Obtained by fluorinating Y. So, A3 is probably YF, or maybe YF3 or another fluoride. Also, A3 can interact with xenon.

- A4: A hot concentrated solution of A4 is treated with Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to form A5. So, maybe a reaction where Y reacts with A4's solution to produce A5.

- A5: When A5 is in water, it decomposes into two substances. So, perhaps it's an acidic fluoride or something that hydrolyzes.

Wait, I should think about what Y could be. Since A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 are all fluorides of Y, and they have different properties.

A1 is bright red and decomposes into A2 and fluorine. When a fluoride decomposes into another fluoride and F2, that implies that A1 might be a more highly fluorinated compound breaking down into a less fluorinated one and F2. For example, perhaps A1 is YF5, which decomposes into YF3 and F2. But wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's something like ClF3 decomposing into ClF and F2? No, I'm not sure about that either.

Wait, another thought: The decomposition of A1 gives off F2 gas. So, the reaction would be A1 → A2 + F2. So, for example, if A1 is YF5, maybe it decomposes into YF3 and F2. Let me think about possible reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is YF3, but I'm not sure. Wait, but A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, so it's being oxidized to XeF2 or XeF4 or something like that. So, A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. Which fluorides are strong oxidizers?

Wait, when a fluoride is a strong oxidizing agent, it's probably a fluorine-rich compound. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, but its compounds can vary. For example, ClF3 is a strong oxidizer, but I'm not sure about others.

Alternatively, considering that when A1 decomposes, F2 is released. F2 is a very strong oxidizer. So, perhaps A1 is a diatomic or polyatomic fluoride that upon
