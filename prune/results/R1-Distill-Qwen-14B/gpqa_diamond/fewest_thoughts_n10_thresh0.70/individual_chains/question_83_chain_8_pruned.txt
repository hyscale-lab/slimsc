Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question says that we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

First, let me think about the initial dilution. When you mix equal volumes of two solutions, the concentration halves. So the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.05 M, but after adding 20 cm³ of water (so total volume is 40 cm³), the concentration becomes 0.025 M. Because 0.05 M * (20/40) = 0.025 M. Got that.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, the reaction is between the weak acid (acetic acid, HC₂H₃O₂) and the strong base (NaOH, which dissociates into Na+ and OH-). The neutralization reaction would be HC₂H₃O₂ + OH⁻ → C₂H₃O₂⁻ + H₂O.

At the 25% titration point, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming its conjugate base, acetate ion.

Let me tackle the 25% titration first. So 25% of the acetic acid is converted to acetate. The solution will be a buffer solution because it's a weak acid and its conjugate base are present.

To find the pH, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]). 

But wait, what's the pKa? The Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) which is about 4.74 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733). So approximately 4.74.

Since it's a 25% titration, that means 25% of the acid has been neutralized. So the ratio of [A⁻]/[HA] is (0.25)/(0.75) because if 25% is converted to A⁻, then 75% remains as HA. So 0.25/0.75 = 1/3.

So plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = 4.74 + log(1/3). Log(1/3) is negative. Log(3) is about 0.477, so log(1/3) is -0.477. So pH = 4.74 - 0.477 = about 4.263.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the dilution again. The initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M. Do I need to adjust the concentrations for the buffer calculation? Hmm, in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the ratio of concentrations is what matters, so the actual concentrations (after dilution) will cancel out because both HA and A⁻ are diluted in the same way. So the ratio [A⁻]/[HA] remains the same as the mole ratio, which is 1/3.

So the pH at 25% is approximately 4.26.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. The acetate ion (C₂H₃O₂⁻) will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

The concentration of acetate is important here. Let's calculate the concentration.

First, find the moles of acetic acid initially. Volume is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) at 0.05 M. Moles = 0.02 * 0.05 = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ water, total volume is 40 cm³. So the concentration becomes 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, which matches what I thought earlier.

At equivalence, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid have reacted to form 0.001 moles of acetate. The total volume after titration depends on how much NaOH is added. Wait, no, wait. The equivalence point volume can be calculated.

Wait, the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. The moles of NaOH needed to reach equivalence would be equal to the moles of acetic acid. Moles of acetic acid is 0.001. So moles NaOH = 0.001. Volume NaOH = moles / concentration = 0.00
