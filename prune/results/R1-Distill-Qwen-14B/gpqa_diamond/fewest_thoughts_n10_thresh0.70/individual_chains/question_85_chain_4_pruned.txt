Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's temperature and the planet's distance from it. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

But wait, the question doesn't give me the distances of the planets directly. Oh, but it does mention the radial velocity method and the transit method. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure how that plays into the equilibrium temperature. Oh, wait, the RV method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift, which relates to the planet's mass and the distance (through the star's parameters). The transit method gives the radius of the planet and also the distance, because the depth of the transit depends on the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius.

Wait, but maybe the question doesn't require me to find the exact distances. Because the problem is about the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures. Since both planets orbit the same star, maybe the star's parameters (like Luminosity) are the same for both. So, perhaps I can find the ratio based on their orbital distances.

But how do I find the distances? Let's think. The RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude, which is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the distance. The formula for RV semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) ) * (something else... Wait, maybe I should recall the formula correctly.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude formula is K = ( (2π G) / (P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * sqrt(1 - e²) ) )

But for circular orbits, e=0, so the sqrt term is 1. Also, since the planet masses are much smaller than the star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So, K ≈ ( (2π G) / P )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

But maybe a simpler approach is to consider that for the same star, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet) / (a^(1/2) ), because K = (v) is proportional to (M_p) / (sqrt(a) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (sqrt(1 + M_p/M_s)) ) / (a^(1/2) ), but given that M_p << M_s, it simplifies to K ≈ (M_p sin i) / (a^(1/2) * sqrt(M_s) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. The RV shift (Δλ) is given by the Doppler effect. The formula is Δλ/λ = v_r / c, where v_r is the radial velocity. So, the RV shift is related to the velocity. For the same line, the shift in wavelength would be proportional to the velocity. So, the given shifts (0.03 Å and 0.04 Å) must relate to their velocities.

Wait, the problem states that Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å, and Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å. So, the question is, how does their velocity relate to their orbital parameters.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π))^(1/3)

But assuming circular orbits, e=0, so that term is 1. Also, since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So, K ≈ ( (G * M_planet) / (M_star^(2)) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(a)) )

Wait, alternatively, I think K is given by K = (v) = ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) * sqrt(1 - e²) ) ) * ( (G P/(2π) ) ) )^(1/3 )

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Maybe it's better to think about the relation between K and the semi-major axis a. The semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period P via Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_s + M_p)/(4π²). Since M_p is much smaller than M_s, we can approximate M_s + M_p ≈ M_s.

So, a^3 = G M_s (P²) / (4 π²)

But P is the orbital period, and we don't have that. Hmm. Alternatively, for a star of mass M, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (M_p sin i) / (M_s^(2/3)) ) * ( (G/(4 π² c)) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(a^(1/2) ) )

Wait, maybe I can find the ratio of the velocities (K) of the two planets. Since the shifts are given, and the same line ([OI] at 6300 Å), the Δλ is proportional to K. Because Δλ/λ = v_r / c. So, if λ is the same for both (they're both looking at the same line), then the ratio of the shifts is the same as the ratio of the velocities. So, K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.

So, K1 = (3/4) K2.

But K is proportional to (M_p) / (a^(1/2) ), assuming that the other factors (like star's mass and period) are same for both planets. Wait, let me think: from the RV formula, K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(a) )

Wait, I'm not too confident, but perhaps for the same star and same i (assuming inclination is same, which is probably the case here since both transiting), the ratio of K's would be:

K1/K2 = (M1 / a1^0.5
