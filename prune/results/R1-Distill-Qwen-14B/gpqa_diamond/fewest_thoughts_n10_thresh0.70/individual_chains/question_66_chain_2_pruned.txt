Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question lists four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The options are various combinations of these. I need to figure out which ones all SMEFT operators must preserve.

Wait, wait. Let me start by recalling what SMEFT is. SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the Standard Model's gauge symmetry. So, SMEFT operators are built respecting the SM symmetries, but what about other global or spacetime symmetries?

First, Lorentz symmetry. Well, the Standard Model itself is Lorentz symmetric. So, any operator in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry because the interactions in the SM do. Because SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional terms that are consistent with the SM, Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. So option 1 is correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Hmm, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like momentum conservation). The SMEFT is built in a way that it's a low-energy effective theory, so it should respect Poincare. Because effective theories are built from local terms, they should maintain the spacetime symmetries. So I think 2 is also correct. But wait, waitâ€”some effective theories can break Poincare? No, because effective theories are still local and Lorentz-invariant. So yes, operators must respect Poincare, so option 2 is correct.

Wait, wait a second. Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translations. If a theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So if the question is about which must be respected, and all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, but do they have to respect Poincare? Or is Poincare a broader symmetry?

Wait, but SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all its operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. And since Poincare is a combination (Lorentz plus translations), if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it's implied to be Poincare-invariant as well? Or does SMEFT necessarily include translations?

Wait, in effective field theories
