Okay, I need to answer this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what do I remember about symmetries in effective field theories? SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible operators consistent with the Standard Model (SM) symmetries, right? So any operator you include in SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the SM.

Let me list the symmetries of the SM. The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. Poincaré symmetry is a bit broader—it includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh, wait, so Lorentz is a subset of Poincaré. So if an operator respects Poincaré, it must also respect Lorentz.

But wait, does the SMEFT respect Poincaré symmetry? Because SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it's built in a way that maintains the symmetries of the original theory, which is the SM. So the SM has Poincaré symmetry because it includes special relativity. So SMEFT operators should respect that.

What about CP symmetry? CP is Charge conjugation and Parity. The SM isn't CP symmetric in general. For example, certain processes like kaon decay violate CP. So not all SM operators respect CP. Therefore, SMEFT operators must respect the same CP symmetry as the SM. Wait no, wait. Wait, SMEFT is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators that are compatible with the SM's gauge symmetry. But symmetry-wise, the SM doesn't have CP as a symmetry. So maybe the SMEFT doesn't necessarily have to respect CP either. Wait, but operators in SMEFT could come in sets that include their CP conjugates if the symmetry isn't present. Hmm, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the SM doesn't respect CP, then SMEFT operators don't have to either. So CP isn't a symmetry that must be respected by all SMEFT operators.

Wait, no. Wait a second. The SMEFT is built such that any operator must be invariant under the SM's gauge group but may or may not respect other symmetries like CP. So if the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, then operators in SMEFT can violate CP. So not all operators need to respect CP.

Then what about CPT symmetry? The SM (and any Lorentz-invariant theory) respects CPT symmetry. Because in quantum field theory, Lorentz invariance and unitarity together imply CPT symmetry. So any operator in SMEFT must respect CPT because they are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory.

So putting it all together:

Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely respected. Since Lorentz is part of Poincaré (2), which is also a symmetry of the SM. So all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincaré. Wait, but wait. Wait, the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, they respect Lorentz symmetry. And since Poincaré includes translations, but in SMEFT, you can have operators with higher dimensions which are local, so they should respect Poincaré as well? Or is Poincaré automatically respected because Lorentz is, and the operators are local? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the Poincaré group includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries. So operators in the SMEFT must be local, meaning they're constructed from local fields, so they should respect Poincaré. So both 1 and 2 are required.

CP symmetry (3): Not all operators respect this. So it's not a must.

CPT symmetry (4): As I said, any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT. So yes, CPT is a must.

So now looking
