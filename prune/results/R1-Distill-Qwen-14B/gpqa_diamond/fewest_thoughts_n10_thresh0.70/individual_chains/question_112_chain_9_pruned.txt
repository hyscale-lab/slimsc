Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the problem again to make sure I understand.

We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, the first part is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Then, we also need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, wait. The operator whose matrix is given. Let me think about what that matrix looks like. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because we're dealing with up and down states), the operator A would have elements:

A_12 = A_21 = hbar/2, and the diagonals A_11 and A_22 are 0. So the matrix is:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   0 ]

Wait, but that's a 2x2 matrix where the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2 and the diagonals are 0. That looks familiar. Oh, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yes, this operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

But wait, regardless of what it is, the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So the problem is essentially asking for the probability of measuring the spin in the x-direction (since the operator is proportional to sigma_x) and finding the expectation value of that operator.

Alright, so let's first normalize the given state |alpha>. The state is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let's find the normalization constant.

The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. Let's compute the inner product.

Let me denote the coefficients:

c_up = (1 + i)
c_down = (2 - i)

So the inner product is c_up* c_up + c_down* c_down.

Wait no, more accurately, since the state is (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>, the inner product is (1+i)(1−i) + (2−i)(2+i). Wait, no, because when you take the inner product, you have to take the conjugate of each coefficient. So:

|c_up|^2 = (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2.
Wait, wait, let me compute (1+i) times (1-i) → 1*(1) +1*(-i) + i*(1) + i*(-i) → 1 -i +i -i². The i terms cancel, and -i² is -(-1)=1. So 1 +
