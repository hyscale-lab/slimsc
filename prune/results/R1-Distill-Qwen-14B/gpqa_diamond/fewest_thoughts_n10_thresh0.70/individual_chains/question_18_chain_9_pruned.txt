Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with different masses. But wait, the masses might not be directly relevant here since we're dealing with abundances. The main data points are the elemental abundances measured using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width method. They've given me some [X/Y] values, which are logarithmic abundance ratios relative to the Sun.

I remember that the notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X / n_Y)_sun. Oh wait, no, more accurately, it's [X/Y] = log(n_X / n_Y) - log(n_X / n_Y)_sun. Or is it the logarithm of the ratio of their number densities? So for example, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex. That means in Star_1, the ratio of silicon to iron is higher than in the Sun by a factor of 10^0.3.

Wait, no, wait. The definition is [X/Y] = log10 ( (n_X / n_Y) / (n_X_sun / n_Y_sun) ). So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the star's X/Y to the solar X/Y. So [X/Y] equals log ( (X/Y)_star / (X/Y)_sun ). So, a positive value means the star has more X relative to Y than the Sun does.

So, let's list out the given data:

Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0

Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → which simplifies to log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

So the problem is to find the ratio of silicon atoms ([Si/Star_2] or something?) No, wait: the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, (n_Si, Star_1) / (n_Si, Star_2) = ?

Wait, no. Wait, the question says: "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So, it's (n_Si)_1 / (n_Si)_2.

So, how do I compute that?

I think I need to express each star's silicon abundance in terms that can be compared. Let me see.

First, let's figure out the abundances for each star.

For Star
