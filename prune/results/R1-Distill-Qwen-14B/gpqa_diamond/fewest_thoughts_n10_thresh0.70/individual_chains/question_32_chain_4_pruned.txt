Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the nucleus. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c, and we need to find the energy. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A would be protons plus neutrons. Lithium has 3 protons, so 3 + 3 =6. So X is Li-6, I think. So the nucleus is a lithium-6 ion.

Wait, but wait. In a collider, usually, they're talking about ions which have a charge. So like, a lithium nucleus has a charge of +e, but maybe it's a heavier ion. Or perhaps it's a fully ionized nucleus, like Li^3+ or something else? Hmm, but for the purpose of calculating energy, maybe the charge doesn't matter as much as the mass. Because the energy is related to the rest mass and gamma factor.

So, the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high. So we'll need to use the relativistic formulas.

The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = gamma * m c². So we need to find gamma, then multiply by the rest mass energy of the nucleus.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that first. Since v is 0.96c, v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0
