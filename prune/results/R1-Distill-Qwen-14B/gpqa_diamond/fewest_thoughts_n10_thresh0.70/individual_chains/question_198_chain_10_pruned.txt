Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about the percentage of a particular cobalt complex in solution. 

First, the problem states that we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We're supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, wait. So the complexes are probably Co(SCN)n^2- where n is the number of SCN- ligands. The stability constant β is given for each complex, which I think refers to the formation constant for each step. So β1 would be for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)2, and so on.

But wait, β4 is 16 here. Hmm. So the complexes are Co(SCN)^2- with n=1, 2, 3, 4? Or maybe the β values are for each successive addition. I think the stability constant for each complex is cumulative. So the overall stability constant for Co(SCN)_n would be the product of β1 to βn. Or wait, no, perhaps each β represents the stepwise formation constant. So β1 is for CoSCN^2-: Co²+ + SCN- ↔ CoSCN^2-; K1=β1. Then β2 is for adding another SCN-: CoSCN^2- + SCN- ↔ Co(SCN)₂²-; K2=β2. Similarly, β3 is for Co(SCN)₂²- + SCN- ↔ Co(SCN)3^2−, K3=β3. And β4 is for Co(SCN)3^2− + SCN- ↔ Co(SCN)4^2−, K4=β4. So the overall formation constants would be K1=β1, K2=β1β2, K3=β1β2β3, K4=β1β2β3β4.

Wait, but in some
