Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I've studied a bit of quantum mechanics and classical mechanics, but relativistic mechanics is a bit tricky. Let me try to think through this.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. The speed of light is c. The options are given as A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, so in a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when the potential energy is zero, right? Or is that not the case when we include relativity? Oh wait, no, in the classical harmonic oscillator, maximum speed is when the oscillator passes through the equilibrium point (x=0), where all the energy is kinetic. But wait, wait, in the relativistic case, things are different because of the gamma factor in the equations of motion.

Relativistic harmonic oscillator... Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this. I remember that in special relativity, the equations of motion change because of the gamma factor. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian also change. So the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore; it's (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², but wait, that's the maximum potential energy when x=A. But when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the total energy includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, maybe I should think about energy conservation. The total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. In the relativistic oscillator, the total energy at any point would be the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy.

So, E_total = mc² + (gamma - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx². Wait, no, that doesn't quite make sense. Wait, no, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², but when x is large, relativistic
