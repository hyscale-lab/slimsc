Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed related to its amplitude and the spring constant. But this is relativistic, so I have to consider things like the speed approaching the speed of light, which complicates things.

First, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed v_max is given by sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But since this is relativistic, that formula probably isn't exactly right anymore.

Wait, in relativity, as an object's speed approaches c, the relativistic effects become significant. The oscillator's motion would have to account for the increased mass due to relativistic mass increase. Oh right, the relativistic mass is gamma times the rest mass. Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So as the object speeds up, the effective mass increases.

So the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator must involve the relativistic version of the force. Newton's second law in relativity isn't F=ma but F = d(p)/dt, where p is relativistic momentum. So p = gamma m v. 

But wait, the force here is given by Hooke's law, F = -k x. So, setting up the equation: d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x. Hmm, this looks more complicated because it's a nonlinear equation due to gamma depending on v, which depends on x.

Alternatively, maybe energy considerations would be better. In the relativistic case, the total energy includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)k x². But wait, in relativity, the total energy is gamma m c². So at maximum speed, when the potential energy is zero, the total energy is all kinetic and rest energy.

Wait, no. Wait, the maximum speed would occur when the potential energy is zero? No, wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is maximum at the extremes (x = A), and kinetic energy is zero there. So the maximum kinetic energy occurs when x=0, where the speed is maximum. So at that point, the total energy would be the sum of rest energy and maximum kinetic energy.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. So let me think. The total mechanical energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think the total energy in the system is conserved. So the total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy (mc²) and the kinetic energy. At the point of maximum displacement (x = A), the kinetic energy is zero, so the potential energy is (1/2)k A². So E = mc² + (1/2)k A². But wait, that's the classical approach. But in relativity, the rest mass increases with speed, so maybe the energy expressions are different.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy is (1/2)k x². The total energy E is the sum of the rest energy (gamma m c²) and the kinetic energy (which in relativity is (gamma -1) m c²). Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the total energy E
