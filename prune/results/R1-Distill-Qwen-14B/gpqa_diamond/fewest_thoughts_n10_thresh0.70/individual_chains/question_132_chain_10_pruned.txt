Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through step by step. The problem involves a mixture of two aromatic compounds, each with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm and three singlets around 2.2 ppm with specific ratios. 

First, let's parse the question. The two compounds in the mixture have the formula C10H14. Looking at the options provided, they're all tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, diethyl would add more carbons, but the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me check that. Benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl group is C2H5, so two ethyl groups would be C4H10. So the diethylbenzene would be C6+4=10 carbons, and H would be 6 + 10? No, wait. Each ethyl is -C2H5, so two would be -C4H10. But benzene is C6H6, so if two H are replaced by ethyl groups, then the formula would be C6 + 4 (from two ethyl) = C10, and H: 6 -2 (because each substitution removes one H) + 10 (from ethyls) â†’ 6-2=4, 4+10=14. So diethylbenzene would be C8H14? Wait, wait. Let me think again. Each ethyl group is two carbons, so two ethyl groups add four carbons, making total of 6+4=10, which fits. Hydrogen: benzene has six H. Each substitution with an ethyl group replaces one H, so two substitutions: 6-2=4. Each ethyl has five H (since it's -CH2CH3, which has 2+3=5 H). Two ethyls: 5*2=10. Total H:4+10=14. So 1,4-diethylbenzene is C10H14. So option C includes that, so it's a possible candidate.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The aromatic region has two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each a singlet, in a 1:1 ratio. Then, the aliphatic region has three singlets at ~2.2 ppm, ratio 2:1:1.

Hmm. Let's think about the aromatic region first. Aromatic protons in NMR typically show up between 6.5-8.5 ppm. A singlet in the aromatic region usually means that the protons are equivalent and not split by neighboring protons. So in each compound, the aromatic protons that are present as singlets must be equivalent and not adjacent to any other protons that would cause splitting.

Wait, but the mixture is 1:1, and the two singlets in the NMR correspond to each compound. So each compound contributes one singlet in the aromatic region.

Wait, but
