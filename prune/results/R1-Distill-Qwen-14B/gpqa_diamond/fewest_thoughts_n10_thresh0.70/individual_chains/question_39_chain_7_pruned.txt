Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the value of 'a'. Hmm. Let me think. The problem says each particle's wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. And when they measured the position, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. Oh wait, so the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. That must mean that the wave function is zero outside this region, right? Because if you can't find the particles there, their probability is zero.

Wait, but the wave function provided is just a part where the particles can exist. So maybe the wave function given is only valid between x=1 and x=3. Because outside, the wave function is zero. So the overall wave function is a piecewise function. 

In quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx should be 1.

The given wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a minute, that seems a bit odd. So ψ(x) is a complex function. The general form is a complex number, so when we take the absolute square, it's ψ*ψ. Let me compute that.

The absolute square would be [ (a / sqrt
