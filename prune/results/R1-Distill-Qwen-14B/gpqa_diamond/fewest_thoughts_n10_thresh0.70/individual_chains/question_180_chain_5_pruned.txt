Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

The question is about an isolated system of particles. There are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each is 2 times that. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about that in calculations.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, and I have to pick the right one.

Hmm. I remember that the potential energy in an electric system is related to the configuration of charges. For point charges, the potential energy is usually calculated based on bringing them into their positions one by one. Since the system is isolated, I guess I'm dealing with the electrostatic potential energy.

Wait, but since there are multiple charges around, each charge will contribute to the potential at the point where another charge is placed. But in this case, the 13th is fixed at P, and the others are all at 2 meters away.

So, the setup is that the 13th charge is at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. Each of these 12 charges is 2e as well.

Wait a second, but how does the potential energy come into play here? Because each charge contributes to the potential energy of the others. But since the system is isolated, the potential energy is the sum of the energies needed to assemble all the charges.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, when placing the other 12 charges, each of them will interact with the 13th charge and with each other.

Wait, but the problem says 12 are at 2 m from P, so each of them is 2 m away from the 13th charge. But each of these 12 is also 2 m apart from each other? Or are they all at 2 m from P, but arranged in some way that their mutual distances are different?

Hmm. The problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are all on a sphere of radius 2 m around P
