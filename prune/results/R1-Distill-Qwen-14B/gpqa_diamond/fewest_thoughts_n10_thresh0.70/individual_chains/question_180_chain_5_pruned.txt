Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, the question is about the minimum energy, which I think refers to the potential energy of the system because when they're arranged in a certain way, the potential energy is minimized. Since all the charges are the same sign (they're all 2e, so positive), they repel each other. So, the system's potential energy should be the sum of the potential energies between each pair.

Wait, but the setup is that 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is at P. So, the 13th charge is at the center, and the others are arranged around it. So, each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy with the central charge, and also with each other. But since the 12 are constrained at the same distance from P, perhaps their mutual distances might not be as relevant, but wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think: in a system of charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for each pair of charges, I calculate the potential energy and sum them all. But the problem is symmetric, so maybe I can find a formula for this.

Wait, the system is isolated, so we're considering all the pairwise interactions. So, the system has 13 charges, all 2e. Let me denote the charges as q = 2e. So, the central charge is q, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P (the position of the central charge). So each of the 12 is distance 2m from the central charge.

So first, let's calculate the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 surrounding charges. Each pair (central and one surrounding) contributes (k * q * q) / r, where r is 2 meters.

But then, the surrounding charges themselves are 12 in number. Are they all at the same point? Or arranged in a circle? The problem says they're constrained to stay at 2m from P, which I think means each is at 2m from P, but their mutual distances can vary. Wait, but if they're all at 2m from P, their mutual separation would be at least 4m apart (if they are diametrically opposite), but I don't think the problem specifies their exact arrangement, so perhaps I'm to assume that their mutual distances are such that they don't contribute to the potential energy because they are fixed at their positions and not moving? Or perhaps I should consider that their mutual distances are something else.

Wait, the problem says the 13th
