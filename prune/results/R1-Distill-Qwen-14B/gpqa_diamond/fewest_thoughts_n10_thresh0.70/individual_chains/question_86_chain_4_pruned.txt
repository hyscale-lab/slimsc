Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about a chemist performing two reactions with two different reducing agents on unknown compounds, A and B. The products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. I need to find out which starting materials A and B are from the options given.

Wait, the reactions use different reducing agents. The first one uses LiBH4 and H+, and the second uses BH3 with H+. I remember that reducing agents can affect the stereochemistry of the product, especially in ketone reductions. Oh right, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3, but wait, no, wait. Or is it that BH3 is a milder one? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Or perhaps it's about whether the reaction leads to racemization or not.

Wait, no, more accurately, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent compared to BH3Â·THF (which is a common form). Also, when reducing ketones, both LiBH4 and BH3 can reduce them to secondary alcohols. But wait, in some cases, the reaction conditions matter. Oh, wait, wait. There's something about the stereochemistry in the reduction of ketones. Wait, when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration depends on the starting material if there's a chiral center nearby.

Wait, but wait, the product is a ketone, so the starting material must have been something that upon reduction gives a ketone. Wait, no, let me think again. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a cyclic ketone. How do you get that from a starting material? Maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or something that upon oxidation forms a ketone. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something that upon hydrolysis forms a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the compounds A and B are ketals. Because when a ketone reacts with an alcohol, it forms a ketal, which
