Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit shaky on some concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons, so I think that's Li-6 because lithium typically has 3 protons and adding 3 neutrons would make it 6 nucleons in total.

Wait, actually, wait. Lithium has atomic number 3, so if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that's 3 + 3 = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which is a beryllium isotope? No, wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Lithium has 3 protons, so 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. Yeah, okay, so the isotope is Li-6. So the mass number A is 6.

So the problem is about finding the energy of the RHIC when the nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm. I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the relativistic energy equations.

First, I think I need to find the relativistic energy of the nucleus. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), right? Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can compute gamma first.

So let me calculate gamma. v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². Let's compute that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Then sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, right? Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, yes. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857. Maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me see: 0.28 times 3.5714 is 1. So gamma is about 3.5714.

But wait, I think I should compute it exactly. Let me do that. Let's compute the denominator first: 1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2 = 1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Now, the next thing I need is the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The formula for the rest energy is m c², but I think in particle physics, the mass is given in atomic mass units (u), and then converted to energy using the conversion factor. Alternatively, sometimes the mass is given in GeV/c², but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I can find the mass of Li-6.

Wait, lithium-6 has a
