Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so the nucleus here is probably a heavy one. The problem states that the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, the mass number A is protons plus neutrons. So Li has 3 protons, so 3+3=6; so it's Li-6. 

Wait, but what's the question again? Oh right, the energy of the RHIC when the speed is 0.96c. So I need to find the kinetic energy or the total energy? Hmm, in particle accelerators, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy each particle is given. But wait, sometimes in relativity, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. So maybe I should compute gamma first.

The speed v is given as 0.96c. So I should calculate the gamma factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c². So 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28, right? Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So 1 / 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714.

But wait, I should be precise because the options are given to four decimal places. Maybe I should calculate more accurately. Let me calculate 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96. Let's compute 96 * 96: 9216, so 0.96² is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 = 0.07
