Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what's going on. 

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Alright, let's go through each piece of data one by one and see what clues they give.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, waitâ€”carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H peak. But the question says "very broad" and I think in this context, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alcohol or maybe a phenol.

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a classic carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe a conjugated double bond, like an aromatic ring with substituents. Wait, alkenes have C=C stretches around 1650-1600 cm^-1. So maybe the 1650 peak is for that. So the compound might have a carbonyl group and a double bond.

Next, the 1H NMR shows several peaks, including some vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has a double bond somewhere. 

So putting that together: we have a carbonyl group (from 1700) and a double bond (from 1650 and NMR). Also, the O-H from the IR.

Wait, but wait. If there's a carbonyl and a double bond, perhaps it's an ester or a ketone
