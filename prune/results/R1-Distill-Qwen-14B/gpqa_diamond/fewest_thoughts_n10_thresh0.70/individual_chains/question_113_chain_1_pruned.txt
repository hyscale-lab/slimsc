Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one matches all the given data.

The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each piece of information.

First, the FTIR spectrum: a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The broadness suggests it's not a simple O-H stretch, maybe something more acidic like a carboxylic acid. But wait, another possibility is an alcohol, but the broadness could be due to hydrogen bonding. So, maybe either.

Then, there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe conjugated or an aromatic ring with substituents. Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with adjacent double bonds, or possibly an aromatic ring with substituents that have a carbonyl. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an aromatic C=C stretch.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has at least one double bond, maybe in a ring or as an isolated double bond.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, what fragment would that be? Let me think about possible fragments. M/z 45 is a common fragment for, say, a ketone group or an ester. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3O or maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe a (CH3)2O group? Wait, CH3O would have a molecular weight of 31. Hmm, no. Or perhaps the fragment is a carbonyl group plus something else. Alternatively, 45 could correspond to a fragment like
