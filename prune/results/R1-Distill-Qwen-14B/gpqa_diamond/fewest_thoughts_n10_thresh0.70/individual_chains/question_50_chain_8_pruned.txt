Alright, so I've got this question about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, okay. I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but let's think this through.

The question says my colleague has a Feynman diagram and a note with some terms. The note is "alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2." I need to figure out how many loops the diagram has based on this expression.

Wait, I remember that in Feynman diagrams, the number of loops is related to the topology of the diagram. Each loop contributes a certain factor to the amplitude. Also, the overall scaling of the amplitude with energy or masses can give hints about the loop count.

The terms in the expression: alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e^2/(4pi epsilon_0) or something like that. But in QFT, alpha is often treated as a coupling constant, which comes from the vertex factors. g might be another coupling constant, perhaps from a non-Abelian gauge theory like SU(2) or SU(3). 

The term (Q/M)^2 looks like a ratio of some charge Q to a mass scale M. Since Q is squared, perhaps it's a dimensionless quantity. In dimensional analysis, when you have terms like (momentum)^something, but I'm not sure how that plays in here. Wait, in loop integrals, the integral often depends on the energy scale or mass parameters. So the (Q/M)^2 might be giving a measure of that.

Now, looking at the factors in the expression. The denominator has (4pi)^6. I remember that loop integrals in 4D spacetime typically involve factors of 4pi from each loop. Each loop contributes a 4pi factor from the integration in d^4k, but when you regularize it, say in dimensional regularization, you might get a factor depending on the dimension. Wait, but in other regularizations like cutoff, maybe that's different. Alternatively, in loop integrals, each loop might contribute a 4pi factor, so the number of loops could be related to the exponent of (4pi).

Wait, let's think about the general structure of a loop integral. For a Feynman diagram with L loops, the integral typically has a 1/(4pi)^{2L} factor because each loop's integral in 4D gives a 4pi from the
