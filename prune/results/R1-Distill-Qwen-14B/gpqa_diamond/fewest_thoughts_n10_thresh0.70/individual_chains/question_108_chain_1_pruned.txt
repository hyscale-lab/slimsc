Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me think about what I know. Alright, the question is about determining whether the paramagnetic coupling term is much larger, much smaller, or similar in magnitude to the transition energy ΔE.

So, the setup is a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and m is small. Wait, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh right, m can have values from -l to +l, but the problem says small values, so maybe m is like 0 or ±1.

The problem gives B as 1 Tesla. I remember that 1 Tesla is a pretty strong magnetic field, but not extremely so. For comparison, Earth's magnetic field is about 25 to 65 microtesla, so 1 Tesla is much stronger.

The transition energy is given with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. That rings a bell. Oh, right, 0.486 micrometers is about the wavelength of the Balmer-alpha emission line, which corresponds to the transition from n=2 to n=1 in hydrogen. So the energy difference ΔE would be the energy of that photon.

I think I should calculate both the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy ΔE to compare them.

First, let me compute ΔE. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s.

Wait, the wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861 x 10^-6 meters. Plugging the numbers in:

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m)

Let me compute that. The numerator is 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 = approximately 4.089e-19 J.

Wait, but I remember that in hydrogen, the energy levels are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². For n=2 to n=1, the transition is from E2 = -13.6/4 = -3.4 eV to E1 = -13.6 eV. So the energy difference is 10.2 eV. Let me convert that to joules to check.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 10.2 eV is 10.2 * 1.602e-19 = ~1.634e-18 J. Hmm, that's a bit higher than my previous calculation. Oh wait, wait—wait, I think I might have miscalculated the first part
