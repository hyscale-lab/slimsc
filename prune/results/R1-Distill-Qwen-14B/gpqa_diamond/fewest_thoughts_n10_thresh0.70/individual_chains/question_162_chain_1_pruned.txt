Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? And the metric given looks a bit familiar, but I'm not entirely sure. 

Let me see the metric again: ds² is equal to (32)/(4 - x² - y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). Wait, that denominator 4 - x² - y²... that looks like a circle equation. If x² + y² <4, then the denominator is positive. So this metric is defined where x² + y² <4. 

I think this is a two-dimensional metric, so it's probably describing some kind of space, maybe a sphere or a hyperbolic space. The function in front of dx² and dy² is the line element, which depends on x and y here. 

I remember that in such cases, the area element in two dimensions is sqrt(g_xy) dx dy, where g_xy is the determinant of the metric tensor. Wait, no, actually, the area element is the square root of the determinant of the metric times dx dy. But wait, since this is a 2D metric, the determinant would be the product of the coefficients for dx² and dy² because it's diagonal. 

So the metric tensor g has components g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²) and g_yy = same as g_xx. So the determinant g is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So the area element dA would be sqrt(g) dx dy, which is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy. 

Wait, 32 is 16*2, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. So the area would be the integral of dA over the region where x² + y² <4. Because the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which is like 4 - r², where r is the radial coordinate. 

Wait, maybe it's easier to switch to polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then x² + y² = r². So the denominator becomes (4 - r²). 

So the area element becomes [32/(4 - r²)] * (dr² + r² dθ²) ? No, wait, no. Wait, the area element in polar coordinates is r
