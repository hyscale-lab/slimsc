Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me think through this.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a conformally flat metric. Because it's multiplied by a function, so it's conformally related to the flat metric in two dimensions. Right, conformal metrics are of the form ds² = f(x,y) (dx² + dy²), so this fits that pattern.

Now, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere—oh right, that's a surface of constant negative curvature. So in 2D, a pseudosphere is like a hyperbolic plane. But here, I'm dealing with the metric given, so maybe this metric describes a pseudosphere? Or part of it.

Wait, but what's the area of a pseudosphere? Normally, a sphere has finite area, but a pseudosphere (which is a model of hyperbolic space) has infinite area. Because hyperbolic space is non-Euclidean and expands infinitely, so any "pseudosphere" or surface like that would have infinite area. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, the metric given might be a specific example. Let me analyze the metric. Let's write it as ds² = (32 / (4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). The denominator is
