Alright, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the order of the substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer when they undergo electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

So, the question lists six substances, all substituted benzene rings. Each is going to react with excess bromine, and we're looking at the para isomer's yield. I remember that the activating or deactivating nature of the substituents affects where the substitution happens—ortho, meta, or para.

First, I need to identify each substituent and determine whether they are activating or deactivating, and if they are ortho/para directors or meta directors. Because the regiochemistry will determine the distribution of the substitution products.

Let me list the substituents:

1) CH3 (methyl)
2) COOEt (ethoxycarbonyl)
3) Cl (chlorine)
4) NO2 (nitro)
5) C2H5 (ethyl)
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

Wait, number 5 is C6H5-C2H5, so that's ethyl group attached to benzene.

Now, substituents can be either activating or deactivating. Activating groups (like -OH, -NH2, -O-) make the ring more reactive, so the reaction is faster. Deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH) make the ring less reactive, slowing the reaction.

Also, activating groups are usually ortho/para directors because they help stabilize the developing charge during the transition state. Deactivating groups, especially meta directors, direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.

Let me go through each substituent:

1) CH3 (methyl): This is an activating group because alkyl groups are electron-donating via the inductive effect. They are ortho/para directors. So in substitution, the para isomer would be a major product, but since there are two positions (ortho and para), the proportion between them depends on steric factors. Methyl is small, so para is more favored.

2) COOEt (ethoxycarbonyl): This group is a deactivating group. The carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. Also, the ester group is an electron-withdrawing group through the carbonyl. So it's a meta director. Wait, wait—no, wait. Esters are deactivating but ortho/para directors if they are activating, but wait no. Wait, esters have an electron-withdrawing group (the carbonyl), so they are deactivating. So, the substituent is a meta director. Wait, but wait: nitro groups are strong deactivating and meta directors. What about esters—like COOR groups? For example, acetate groups are deactivating (since the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing), so they are meta directors. Wait, or are they ortho/para? Hmm. Wait, no, I think ester groups are deactivating (they are not as strong as nitro, but still deactivating) and are meta directors. Because the electron-withdrawing nature directs via the meta position.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, groups with lone pairs can be ortho directors even if deactivating, but in the case of nitro groups, the strong electron-withdrawing effect makes them meta directors. Esters, like COOR, are also meta directors because the carbonyl is pulling electrons away, making the ring less reactive, and directing the substitution to the meta positions.

3) Cl (chlorine): Chlorine is a substituent attached to benzene. It's an interesting case. Chlorine is more electronegative, so it's slightly deactivating. But wait, chlorine has lone pairs which can donate electrons through resonance, making it an ortho/para director, but the inductive effect is stronger. So overall, Cl is a deactivating group but ortho/para director because the lone pairs can help stabilize the transition state. So in substitution, Cl directs to ortho and para positions, but since it's deactivating, the ring is less reactive than benzene.

4) NO2 (nitro): Strongly deactivating and meta-directing. Nitro groups are meta directors because they withdraw electrons through resonance and inductive effects, making the ring less reactive and directing substitution to the meta positions.

5) C2H5 (ethyl): Similar to methyl. It's an activating group (alkyl, electron-donating) and ortho/para director. The ethyl group is a larger substituent than methyl, so steric hindrance might influence the substitution. Therefore, perhaps the para isomer is more favored compared to ortho.

6) COOH (carboxylic acid): This is a strong deactivating group. The -COOH group is electron-withdrawing because of the two carbonyl groups. So it's a meta director. Also, since it's a strong deactivating group, the ring is less reactive, but the substituent directs the incoming electrophile to the meta position.

Wait, let me double-check each substituent:

1) CH3: activating, ortho/para. So para will be a major product.

2) COOEt: deactivating, meta. So substitution occurs mostly at meta.

3) Cl: deactivating but ortho/para director. So substitution occurs at ortho and para, but para may be more favored because of steric factors (Cl is a bulky substituent? Or not so much? Wait, Cl is a small substituent. Hmm. So for Cl, ortho and para are possible. Since Cl is deactivating, the ring is less reactive, but directing at ortho and para.

4) NO2: deactivating, meta. So substitution occurs mainly at meta.

5) C2H5: activating, ortho/para. Since it's a larger group, maybe para is more favored.

6) COOH: deactivating, meta. So substitution occurs at meta.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, how much para product is formed?

Let's think about each:

1) CH3: since it's activating and ortho/para, the para isomer will be major. But, for example, in toluene bromination, the para isomer is more than ortho because of steric hindrance. So the major product is para, followed by ortho.

So for 1, the para isomer is a large fraction.

2) COOEt: deactivating, meta director. So substitution occurs at meta. So para is not a major product. So the para isomer would be low.

3)
