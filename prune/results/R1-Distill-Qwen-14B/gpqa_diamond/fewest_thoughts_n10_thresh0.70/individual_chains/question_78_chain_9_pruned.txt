Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about the potentials in electromagnetism, specifically the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that a point charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and the displacement vector d is from where the field was generated at time tr to the observation point r. The velocity at the generation time is v. I need to find the expressions for V and A at time t, where t is greater than tr.

Wait, so t is after the charge generated the field at tr. That makes sense because electromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, so the field at r is due to the charge's state at an earlier time.

I remember that scalar potential is usually associated with the charge, and the vector potential with the motion of the charge. The potentials are part of the Lorenz gauge formulation, which leads to the wave equations for electromagnetic fields.

But wait, the problem isn't necessarily using the Lorenz gauge; it's just asking about the potentials. The potentials for a moving charge can be found using the Liénard equations or by considering retarded time.

Right, retarded time. So the fields at time t are due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, where tr = t - r/c. Because the field propagates at speed c.

But in this question, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So, d = r - s(tr). So the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point is d.

The scalar potential V is given by the Coulomb potential but with a correction due to the motion of the charge. Wait, or is it? Oh wait, no. The scalar potential for a moving charge is actually the static potential plus a term involving the time derivative of the vector potential. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the scalar potential V is usually (q/(4πε0 r)), but when the charge is moving, there's a term involving the velocity. No, wait. For the static case, when the charge isn't moving, V is just Coulomb's law. When it's moving, the scalar potential might be modified,
