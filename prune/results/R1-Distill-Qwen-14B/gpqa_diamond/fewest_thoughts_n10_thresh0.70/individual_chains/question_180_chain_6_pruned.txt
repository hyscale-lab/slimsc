Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

So, the question is about an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible, which probably means we don't have to consider kinetic energy or something like that. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, and I have to choose the right one.

Hmm, so I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. The energy stored in a system of charges due to their configurations. Since all charges are the same and some are fixed, I probably need to calculate the potential energy between each pair of charges and sum them all up.

But wait, the system is isolated, so energy is conserved, but here we're looking for the minimum energy. So maybe I should think about whether the charges would naturally arrange themselves to minimize the potential energy. But since 12 are fixed at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P, perhaps we can't change the positions of the 12, but only the position of the 13th? Or no, wait, noâ€”the 13th is fixed, so all the 12 are at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P. So the system is fixed in this configuration.

Wait, but the problem says "minimum energy," which might suggest that the charges arrange themselves in a certain way. But in this case, since 12 are constrained at 2 meters and the 13th is fixed, perhaps the setup is fixed, and energy is just calculated based on this arrangement.

So the energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. Since all charges are 2e, each pair contributes a term.

But wait, there are 13 charges. Let me think: the 13th is at P, and the other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2m away from the 13th charge. Also, each of the 12 charges is 2m
