Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e, and negligible mass. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and choose the right option from A to D.

Hmm, so all the charges are 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each is 3.2e-19 C.

Wait, the setup is that 12 charges are at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th is fixed, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So the fixed charge is at point P.

The question is about the minimum energy of the system. Energy in an electrostatic system usually refers to the electric potential energy. So the system's potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges, I think.

But wait, since all the charges are fixed except the one at P? Or no, wait, the 13th is fixed, but the others are constrained at 2m. So their positions are fixed as well? So the system is
