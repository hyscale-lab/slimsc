Okay, so I've got this physics problem about light moving through a glass that itself is moving. Hmm, I need to figure out the speed of the light beam relative to the lab frame. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. So, the glass is moving towards me at speed v, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. Wait, wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is going in the same direction as the beam. Wait, maybe that's a confusing way to phrase it. Let me parse that again.

Oh, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So, the beam is going in the same direction as the glass's motion, which is towards the observer. Wait, that seems conflicting. Because if the glass is moving towards the observer, then the beam would be moving towards the observer as well? Or is the beam moving in the same direction as the glass's movement, which is towards the observer.

Wait, maybe I should visualize this. Imagine the lab frame where everything is stationary except the glass. The glass is moving towards the observer at speed v. The light beam is inside the glass, moving in the same direction that the glass is moving. So, the beam is moving towards the observer as well, but slower because it's in the glass.

But wait, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving towards us at v, and the light is moving through the glass. How does that affect the speed of light as observed in the lab?

I remember that when dealing with velocities in different frames, especially involving light, special relativity comes into play. But wait, the question says the speed of light in vacuum is c=1, so perhaps they're using units where c=1. But the glass is moving at velocity v, which is presumably much less than c, but I'm not sure. The problem doesn't specify, so I have to consider relativistic effects.

Wait, but if the glass is moving at v, then the light's speed relative to the glass is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, but here c is 1, so the speed of light in glass is 1/n. But from the lab frame, moving with velocity v, how do we calculate the observed speed of the light?

Ah, right, because the glass is moving, the light's speed relative to the lab is not just 1/n. We have to account for the relative motion using the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Wait, but is that correct? Because the light is within the glass, which is moving. So the frame of the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at v_light = 1/n. So we need to find the velocity of the light in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass.

Wait, no, the glass is moving at v relative to the lab. So the lab is the stationary frame, and the glass is moving at v. So the light's speed in the glass's frame is 1/n in the direction of the glass's motion, I think. Because the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction, perhaps.

Wait, no, the direction needs to be clear. The glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. The light beam is in the glass and is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, so towards the observer.

Wait, but in the glass's frame, the light is moving at 1/n towards the observer. So the lab frame sees the glass moving at v towards the observer, and the light is moving at 1/n towards the observer in the glass's frame. So what's the lab frame's observation of the light's speed?

Ah, right, to find the lab frame's speed, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The general formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²), where u is the velocity in the moving frame (glass's frame), and u' is the velocity in the lab frame.

Wait, let me confirm the direction. In the glass frame, the light is moving at u = 1/n towards the observer. And the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer in the lab frame. So to get u', which is the light's speed in the lab, we add the velocities.

Wait, no. The glass's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the light's velocity in the lab frame is given by u' = [u + v] / [1 + (u v)/(c²)]. But since c is 1 in this scenario, the equation becomes (u + v)/(1 + u v).

Wait, but wait: in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u = 1/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. So when the glass is moving towards the observer (so v is positive in that direction), the light's speed in the lab is u' = (u + v) / (1 + u v).

Since u is 1/n, substituting gives (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)*v) = (1 + n v)/(n (1 + v/n)) ) Hmm, wait, no. Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: (1/n) + v.

Denominator: 1 + (1/n)*v.

So, the numerator can be written as (1 + n v)/n. And the denominator is (n + v)/n. So the entire expression is [(1 + n v)/n ] / [(n + v)/n] ] which simplifies to (1 + n v)/(n + v).

So the speed of the light as observed in the lab is (1 + n v)/(n + v). Wait, but I thought the velocity addition formula was (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c²), which with c=1 is (u + v)/(1 + u v). So that's correct.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (1 +n v)/(n + v) → which is the same as what I have.

Option B: 1 → No, that's only if the light's speed always c=1, but in glass it's 1/n, and with the glass moving, it's different.

Option C: (1 +n v)/(n - v) → denominator is (n - v), which would be the case if the glass was moving in the opposite direction, perhaps. Wait, if the glass was moving opposite to the light's direction, then u and v would be opposite signs. But in our case, both are in the same direction, so v is positive, and the formula uses (u + v) as the numerator.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the signs. Let me think again.

The glass is moving towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the lab frame, both the glass and the light are moving towards the observer. So the speed of light in the lab would be higher than in the glass's frame, because the glass is moving towards the observer, which effectively makes the light approach even faster.

Wait, but wait. When the medium is moving in the same direction as the light, the speed of light in the lab frame would be higher. For example, if the medium is moving with velocity v, and light in the medium has speed u, then the lab frame would measure u' = (u + v)/(1 + u v).

In our case, u is 1/n, so the expression is ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) v ).

Which simplifies to (1 + n v)/(n (1 + v/n)) ) → Hmm, let me compute it again.

Wait, (1/n + v) is the same as (1 + n v)/n.

The denominator is 1 + (v)/(n) = (n + v)/n.

So when you divide the two, it becomes [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] ) → the n's cancel, leaving (1 + n v)/(n + v).

So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v). Which matches.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass is moving at velocity \( v \) toward the observer, and the light beam is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion. In the glass's frame, the speed of light is \( \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass.

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

where \( u \) is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame, \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab, and \( c = 1 \) (in units where the speed of light in a vacuum is normalized to 1). Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \), the formula becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplifying the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}}
\]

The \( n \) terms cancel, leaving:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) — This matches the derived result.
- **Option B**: \( 1 \) — Incorrect, as the speed of light in the glass is not always \( 1 \) due to the refractive index \( n \).
- **Option C**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \) — Incorrect, as this would apply if the glass were moving in the opposite direction of the light.
- **Option D**: \( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \) — Incorrect, as it introduces an unphysical negative numerator.

The correct answer is **Option A**.
