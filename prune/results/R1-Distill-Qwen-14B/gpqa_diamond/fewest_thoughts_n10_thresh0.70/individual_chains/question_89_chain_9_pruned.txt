Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first reaction is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to form product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's ¹H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? So 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. Heating this with KOH in excess—I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with KOH, they undergo elimination to form an alkene via the E2 mechanism. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide; the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. So elimination would need dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but 1,3-dibromo is not adjacent, so maybe they're not on adjacent carbons. Let me visualize adamantane. Adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane ring structure. The positions 1 and 3 might be on adjacent rings but not directly next to each other. So the dihalide is 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

Wait, so when KOH is used, perhaps a double elimination occurs. Since KOH is a strong base, maybe it's an elimination reaction. But wait, dibromide to form something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is hydrolysis—like forming a diol. But 1,3-dibromo would have two bromide groups. Wait, no—hydrolysis of a dihalide with KOH would
