Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'll need to figure out the structures of each product, especially product 3, and then determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in its NMR spectrum.

First, let's break down the initial reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH. Hmm, I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably E2, forming an alkene. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, 1,3-dibromo would have bromines on adjacent carbons. Heating would promote elimination, so product 1 is likely to be an adamantene derivative with a double bond.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: The 1H NMR shows 4.79 ppm as a doublet integrating for 2H. That's probably the protons on the carbons adjacent to the double bond, like vinylic protons. The 2.41-2.23 ppm region is a multiplet for 10H, which fits the adamantane structure, which has a lot of equivalent CH groups. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be the bridgehead protons or another set in the structure. The IR absorption at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, but wait, wait. Wait, elimination would form an alkene, not a carbonyl. Oh, maybe the IR is from another part, but wait, wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Wait, maybe I'm thinking wrong. Wait, if it's KOH and heating, another possibility is dehydrohalogenation forming an alkene, but the IR here is 1720, which is a carbonyl. Hmm, but KOH is a strong base, but maybe it's a different reaction. Oh, wait, wait, I might be missing something. Oh! Wait, wait. If we have 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH, perhaps it's a substitution reaction? But with excess KOH, maybe it's more likely elimination, but then why is there a carbonyl in the IR?

Wait, maybe the product is not an alkene but an ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide? No, because epoxide formation usually requires peracids or other conditions. Or maybe it's a diol? Wait, but diols wouldn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the IR. 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl, probably an ester or ketone. So if elimination forms an alkene, why would there be a carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene (so product 1 is a diene?), but then perhaps
