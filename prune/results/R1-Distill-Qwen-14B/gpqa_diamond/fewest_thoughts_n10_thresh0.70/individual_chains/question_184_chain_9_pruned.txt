Okay, so I have to figure out which reaction sequence produces 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I think about the target molecule. It has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro. Wait, no, wait. Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering matters. The actual positions might be 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro. So they are at positions 1, 2, and 3, which would mean they are adjacent to each other in a meta arrangement? Wait, no. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Let me imagine the structure. So, 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro. So positions 1,2,3 are all adjacent. So the substituents are in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern.

Wait, but that's a bit tricky because when you do electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents direct incoming groups to specific positions.

I remember that substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they can be ortho/para directors or meta directors. Let me think about each substituent:
