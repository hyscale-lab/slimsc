Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubits space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. But wait, what's the geometrical position in the qubit space? Oh right, qubits are two-level systems, so the state space is two-dimensional. But how does the density matrix translate into a geometric point?

I think each qubit state can be represented in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of a qubit state. For a pure state |ψ>, it's a vector on the surface of the sphere, described by angles θ and φ. But density matrices can represent mixed states as well. How does that work?

A density matrix ρ must satisfy certain properties: it's Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and has a trace of 1. For a single qubit, the general density matrix can be written as:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where I is the identity matrix, σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (like a point in 3D space) with magnitude ≤1. This r vector corresponds to the Bloch vector, which gives the position of the state on the Bloch sphere. If the magnitude of r is 1, it's a pure state; less than 1, it's a mixed state.

So, let's compute ρ for the given problem. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write that out:

|0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So when I multiply by 1/2, I get ρ = (I)/2.

Wait, that's interesting. So ρ = (I + 0·σ)/2, which implies that the vector r is (0,0,0). Because in the general form, the coefficients of the Pauli matrices (σx, σy, σz) determine the components of r. Here, each coefficient is zero.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That would place the state at the origin of the Bloch sphere. But wait, the origin in the Bloch sphere represents a completely mixed state, right? Because a pure state is on the surface, and the center is the maximally mixed state. Since this density matrix is (I/2), it's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. So yes, it sits at r=(0,0,0).

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, let me double-check. The density matrix ρ is diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. The Bloch vector is found from the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The formula for r is r = 2 Re[⟨σ⟩], but more accurately, the components are <σ_x>, <σ_y>, <σ_z> multiplied by 2. For ρ = I/2, each ⟨σ_i⟩ is Tr(ρ σ_i). Let's compute that.

Take σ_z, which is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Tr(ρ σ_z) = (1/2)(1*1 + 1*(-1)) = (1/2)(1 -1) = 0. Same for σ_x and σ_y, since they're traceless. So each component of r is zero. So r is (0,0,0). Yep, that's correct.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This simplifies to 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. For a single qubit, the general form of a density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is a vector in three-dimensional space. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), it is evident that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), as there are no contributions from the Pauli matrices.

The vector \(\mathbf{r}\) corresponds to the Bloch vector, which determines the position of the quantum state in the Bloch sphere. A Bloch vector of \((0, 0, 0)\) represents the maximally mixed state, which is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This matches the description of the given density matrix, which is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
