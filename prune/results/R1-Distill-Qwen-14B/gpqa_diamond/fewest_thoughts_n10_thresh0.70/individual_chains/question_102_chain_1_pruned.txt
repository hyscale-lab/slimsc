Okay, so I'm faced with this pretty complicated question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. The experiment involves using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, I remember that bicistronic vectors have two coding sequences in one construct, which is probably the ligand and receptor here.

The setup: the ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. The receptor has an IRES upstream, which I believe allows internal ribosome entry, so it can be expressed in a different way, maybe allowing both proteins to be made from the same mRNA.

There are stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272. Wait, loxP is a recombination site for Cre, right? So the ligand has a stop in a loxP cassette, and the receptor has a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is present, which recognizes loxP sites, it would delete those stop cassettes. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on how this works in bicistronic vectors. 

So the idea is, in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent the expression of the downstream genes. For the ligand, the stop is between the ORF and mCherry. So without Cre, the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor would have a stop before eGFP. But when Cre is present, it would recombine the loxP sites, removing the stop cassettes, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but the ligand is under the CBA promoter. So the ligand would be expressed first, then the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed. So, perhaps in the presence of Cre, both the ligand and receptor would be expressed, along with their respective fluorescent tags.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested them via Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin, meaning the loading is correct. So presumably, the proteins are being expressed.

Then they breed a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they cross these mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre would be expressed under SOX10's control, activating in neural crest cells. The offspring should have the Cre active in neural crest cells, allowing the lox sites to be cut, thereby removing the stop cassettes and allowing expression of the ligand and receptor with their tags.

But when they look under the confocal microscope, there's no green signal. The green is from eGFP, which is on the receptor. So why isn't the eGFP being expressed?

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are in a parac
