Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me read the question carefully and go through it step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions leading from compound A to compound E, and I need to identify what E is from the given options. The problem also provides some hints, which I should definitely consider.

First, let's break down the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are:
a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

Hmm. I remember that IR peaks around 1750-1700 usually indicate carbonyl groups (C=O). But wait, the peak for compound A is higher, 1750, which is a bit higher than a typical ketone. Maybe that's a clue.

Let me think about each step. 

Step 1: A + HCN â†’ B. So A must have a carbonyl group because HCN adds to carbonyls. When a carbonyl reacts with HCN, it typically forms a cyanohydrin. That is, the carbonyl becomes a CH(OH)CN group. Or wait, maybe if A is a ketone, adding HCN would add the CN to the carbonyl, producing a secondary alcohol with a cyanide substituent.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that A is an ester or an aldehyde. But the product from HCN addition would depend on the structure. For example, if A is a ketone, say cyclohexanone, adding HCN would give cyclohexane cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a CN group attached.

Then, step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. So that's hydrogenation. What functional groups are present in B? From the first step, B would have an alcohol (from the OH of the cyanohydrin) and a nitrile group (CN). Wait, no, the cyanohydrin addition would add -OH and CN to the same carbon. So after reduction, what happens? The nitrile group (CN) would be reduced. Let me think: nitriles (R-CN) upon hydrogenation (H2, Pd) become amines. Wait, no, that's with LiAlH4 or something else. Alternatively, if you hydrogenate a nitrile, it becomes a primary amine, right? Because the triple bond becomes a single bond with NH2. Or wait, maybe under certain conditions, hydrogenation stops at the imine or something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the OH group is
