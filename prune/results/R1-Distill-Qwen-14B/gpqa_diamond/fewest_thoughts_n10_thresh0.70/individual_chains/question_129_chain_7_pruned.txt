Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says to identify compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There's also some hints provided, so I should pay attention to those.

First, let me break down the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Hmm, and the hints are:

a) When compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and compound E has a strong peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are A, B, C, D, each being a cyclic ketone with various substituents.

I think I should start by analyzing the hints and the reaction steps to figure out what's happening in each step.

Starting with hint a: compound A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to give a specific structure. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction, which converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw that structure mentally.

The product has a cyclopentane ring. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is like a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached to the cyclopentane. So the structure would have a double bond from the ylidene group.

Wait, but in the Wittig reaction, the ylide (which is the phosphorus compound) reacts with a carbonyl group (like from an aldehyde or ketone) to form an alkene.

So compound A must have a carbonyl group because it reacts with a Wittig reagent. So A is likely a cyclopentanone or something similar.

Looking at the product of the Wittig reaction, it's 1,2-dimethyl-4-[propan-2-ylidene]cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the ylidene is attached to position 4, and there are methyl groups at 1 and 2. So the initial compound A, after Wittig, forms an alkene at position 4, with substituents at 1 and 2.
