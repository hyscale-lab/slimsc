Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about finding an eigenvector for a muon's operator along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Hmm. Let me start by breaking down what I know.

The operator is P, and it's a vector operator, so it has components Px, Py, and Pz. The question gives me each of these as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The task is to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along a direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. That means n can be expressed as (nx, 0, nz), right?

Wait, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, any component of the Pauli matrices (like Sx, Sy, Sz) multiplied by ħ/2 gives the spin operator. So the operator here is similar, but for momentum? Or maybe it's spin. Either way, the approach is probably the same since it's about eigenvectors.

So the general operator P along direction n would be P · n, which is a combination of Px, Py, and Pz. But wait, since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero. So Py won't appear in the operator. That simplifies things because Pn = nx Px + nz Pz.

I'm supposed to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is (n · P) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>. Or wait, no, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So (P · n) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

But wait, each component of P is given by matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So maybe I should express P · n as (ħ/2)(n_x Sx + n_z Sz), where Sx and Sz are Pauli matrices. Because Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0 1],[1 0]], which is Sx. Similarly for Sz, which is [[1 0],[0 -1]].

So the operator P · n is (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz), where σx and σz are Pauli matrices.

The eigenvalue equation is then (
