Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of an operator P along some direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables like momentum are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states with definite values. So the operator P here must be a vector operator, right? So P is made up of components P_x, P_y, P_z.

Wait, the question says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right, because any direction in the x-z plane can be described using an angle θ from the z-axis. So the direction vector n would have components like (sin θ, 0, cos θ) because it's in the x-z plane. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of spherical coordinates. Let me get that right. The direction vector n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component would be zero. So φ is either 0 or π, but since it's arbitrary, I guess φ can be any angle but the y-component is zero. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

But wait, the operator P is along n, so the operator P would be P · n, which is P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Because P_y is zero since n has no y-component. So the total operator is P = sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z.

The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>. Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the eigenvector is the state whose component in the direction n has this eigenvalue.

I need to construct this operator P. Let me write out each component matrix.

P_x is given as (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So P_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]] which is σ_y multiplied by (ħ/2), and P_z is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]] which is σ_z times (ħ/2).

So the operator P along n is:

P = (sinθ) (ħ/2 σ_x) + (cosθ) (ħ/2 σ_z)
= (ħ/2) [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ]

The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting:

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]
= (ħ/2) [ [[sinθ, 0], [0, -sinθ]] + [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]] ] Wait, no, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, the matrices for σ_x and σ_z are each 2x2. So when I add sinθ σ_x and cosθ σ_z, I get a matrix M where:

M = [[ cosθ, sinθ ],
     [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ].

Wait, let me compute each element:

The (1,1) element is cosθ (from σ_z) at (1,1) and 0 from σ_x. So yes, cosθ.

The (1,2) element is sinθ from σ_x, so M[0][1] = sinθ.

The (2,1) element is sin
