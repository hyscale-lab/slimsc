Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels through emission or absorption of photons, and dipole transitions involve changes in the angular momentum.

Wait, dipole transitions have specific selection rules. Oh right, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So for the state 3,0,0, which has n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0. It can only transition to states where l changes by ±1. Since l was 0, the next possible is l=1 or l=-1, but l can't be negative, so l=1. So the possible intermediate states should have l=1.

So the initial state is 3,0,0. The decay is happening in two steps. Each step must follow the selection rules. The first transition would change the principal quantum number, n, and l. Let's see, from 3,0,0 to something. The next n could be 2 or 4, but since we're going from n=3 to n=1 in two steps, probably n=3 → n=2, then n=2 → n=1.

So first transition: n=3 → n=2. And l changes from 0 to 1 (since Δl=+1). So the first state would be 2,1, m. What about m? The selection rule says Δm = 0, ±1. So m can change by 0, +1, or -1. In the initial state, m is 0. So possible m values for the first transition will be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but hydrogen states are labeled as |n, l, m>, and for l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So the possible states after first transition are |2,1, -1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,1>.

Now, from the second transition, n=2 → n=1. Again, l must change by ±1. From l=1 (since the intermediate state has l=1), the next l should be 0 (because l can't go to 2 as that would require Δl=+1 which would require l=2 in n=1, but n=1 has l=0 only. Wait, n=1 can have l=0 only, so the second transition must go from l=1 to l=0.

So for the second step, from |2,1,m'> to |1,0, m''.

What about m transitions? Again, Δm can be 0, ±1. So m' can go to m'' = m' ±0, ±1.

Now, the problem is about possible transition routes. The options given are:

Option A: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 →1,0,0 and probability 1/3.

Option B: 3,0,0 →2,1,1 →1,0,0 and 1/4.

Option C: same as B but m=-1, and same probability.

Option D: 3,0,0 →2,1,0 →1,0,0 and probability 2/3.

Wait, but the question says the transition happens via two dipole transitions. So each step is a dipole transition.

Now, the probability. How is the probability determined here? I think it's about the possible transitions and their allowedness and the number of possible paths.

Wait, in the first transition, from 3,0,0 to 2,1, m, m can be -1,0, +1. So there are three possible intermediate states. For each, then a transition to 1,0,0.

But wait, each of these paths may have
