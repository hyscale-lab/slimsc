Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants are involved in determining the formation of complexes. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, but what does each β represent? Oh right, βn is the stability constant for the complex with n thiocyanate ions attached. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]²+, and so on up to β4, which is [Co(SCN)₄]^4+ or something like that.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. Wait, dithiocyanato means two thiocyanate ions, right? So we're looking for the concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ as a percentage of the total cobalt.

I think the approach here is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and then sum them up, then find the percentage for the second one. But how do I do that?

I remember that the fraction of each complex can be found using the formula:

f_n = (β_n [Co^{2+}] [SCN^-]^n) / (total)

But wait, the total is the sum of all possible complexes plus the free Co²+ ions. Hmm, but since the concentration of free Co²+ might be negligible compared to the complexes, maybe in this case, we can consider that all the Co is in the form of complexes. Or maybe not? I'm not sure.

Let me think about the general approach. The stability constants are given, so each βn is the formation constant for the nth complex. The fraction of each complex (fn) can be calculated using the formula:

fn = (βn [Co] [SCN^-]^n) / (sum of all βk [Co] [SCN^-]^k for k=0 to 4 + [Co²+]))

Wait, that might be complicated. Alternatively, since the total cobalt concentration c is
