Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, which is SMEFT for short. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but let me think through what I remember.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

First, let's recall what each symmetry means. Lorentz symmetry is about how the theory looks the same under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time, so it's a bigger symmetry group. CP symmetry is the combination of Charge conjugation (C) and Parity (P), meaning the theory should be invariant under flipping charges and reflecting spatial coordinates. CPT symmetry is Charge, Parity, and Time reversalâ€”this is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, especially when considering the Standard Model.

Now, SMEFT is an effective theory constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model. The key point is that when building these operators, certain symmetries must be preserved. I remember that the SMEFT is built respecting the same gauge symmetry as the Standard Model, but other symmetries might or might not be preserved.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, which of these symmetries are required for all operators in SMEFT.

I think Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. Because effective field theories are usually Lorentz-invariant; otherwise, things get messy with non-covariant terms. So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes translations, so momentum conservation. But wait, in effective field theories, you can have operators that break translation symmetry, but wait, in SMEFT, operators are local and written in terms of the Standard Model fields. So I think SMEFT operators are Poincare-invariant because they're part of a local effective theory. So Poincare symmetry (option 2) must be respected.

CP symmetry is another matter. I remember that not all operators in SMEFT necessarily respect CP. For example, some operators can violate CP, like those that contribute to processes with CP asymmetry. But wait, the question is about which symmetry must be respected by all operators. So if any operator violates CP,
