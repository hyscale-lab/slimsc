Okay, so I have this problem where I need to identify a compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. The formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let's see. I'll start by looking at the data provided step by step.

First, the IR data: there are medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are pretty high, so I'm thinking those might be N-H stretches. Oh wait, but wait, if they're medium to strong, maybe they aren't amines. Because amines usually have broad N-H stretches around 3300-3500 cm-1, but if the intensity is medium, maybe it's not an amine. Alternatively, they could be O-H stretches, but O-H is usually a broader peak, sometimes around 3200-3600. Or maybe they're from an amide or something else.

Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak in the carbonyl region. So that's probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, amide, or maybe an acid. But since the compound has an NO2, wait, no, the formula is C9H11NO2. Oh wait, the formula is C9H11NO2, which has one N and two O's besides the others. So possible functional groups could be ester, amide, maybe a nitro group? Wait, but I don't think nitro groups have absorption in that region. The 1720 cm-1 is more likely an ester (about 1740-1700 usually), amide (around 1680-1700), or maybe a ketone or aldehyde.

Moving on to the 1H NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet with three hydrogens. Usually, that's a methyl group adjacent to a CH2. So maybe a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something. The triplet suggests coupling with two equivalent protons, so like a CH2CH3 where the CH2 is next to another group.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet with two hydrogens. Broad signals can be from exchange, like NH, or maybe something else deshielded. Maybe it's an NH group, but wait, the integration is 2H. Hmm, but if it's amines, they usually show as broad signals. But wait, if the compound is an amide, the NH would be around here but maybe as a broad peak. Alternatively, if it's a methylene (CH2) group adjacent to an electronegative atom, but then why is it broad? Maybe it's an -OCH2- group, but that would typically be a triplet or something else. Not sure yet.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet with two hydrogens. A quartet suggests coupling with three equivalent protons. Wait, but 2H
