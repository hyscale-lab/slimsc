Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read through it carefully and figure out what's going on. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectral data and then determining the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of certain functional groups, maybe something like an ester or a nitrile? Or wait, wait, I think it's more related to the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's about the hydrolysis of a halogenated compound, like in the case of a Grignard reagent. But let me think step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the structure of Compound X is, using the given IR and NMR data. Once I know that, I can predict what will happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1. That broad region might suggest O-H stretching, like in an acid or an alcohol, or maybe an alkyne's C-H stretch. But the peak around 1720 cm-1 is a strong indicator. That's a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For example, ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions could be aromatic C=C stretches. So, the compound likely has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet around 10 ppm, which usually indicates an aldehyde proton. But wait, no, maybe an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids are usually broad around 10-12 ppm. Alternatively, an aromatic proton might be in that region if it's highly deshielded, but in this case, it's a singlet, so maybe it's an aldehyde. Hmm, but wait, the 1720 cm-1 in IR could be an ester or ketone. But let me think again. If it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would show a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000 cm-1, which is present in the data. Wait, but in the IR data, the 3400–2500 region is a broad region, which might encompass O-H. Oh wait, but the 1720 cm-1 is probably another carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's an ester. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone with an ester group?

Wait, maybe the compound is a benzene ring with substituents. Let's look at the NMR shifts:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (
