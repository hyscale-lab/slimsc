Okay, let's try to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is about identifying the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, and I have the IR and NMR data for Compound X.

First, I need to analyze the spectroscopic data to determine what Compound X is. Let's break down the IR and NMR data.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an -OH stretch (maybe an alcohol or carboxylic acid) or an N-H stretch, but given the other peaks, I think it's more likely an -OH group. There's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Then, peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 suggest aromatic rings, maybe with some substitution. Those are typical for C=C stretching in benzene rings.

Looking at the NMR data: The signals are at 10.5 ppm (a broad singlet, 1H) which might be an -OH proton, but wait, another possibility is an aldehyde proton. But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes deshielded ones can go higher. But the broadness might suggest it's an -OH. Wait, if it's a broad singlet at 10.5, could that be a carboxylic acid proton? Because carboxylic acids have broad peaks around 10-12 ppm. That seems possible.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest coupling between two protons each. So the substituents are on the para positions of the benzene ring. For example, if there's a group in the para position, the aromatic protons would split into doublets. So maybe the structure has a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – that's a multiplet, maybe a CH adjacent to some substituents. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – perhaps a CH2 group next to something. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a CH3 group attached to a CH2, maybe a branch. 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a terminal CH3, probably from an ethyl group or similar.

Putting this together, perhaps the benzene ring has two substituents: one is a methyl group (from the 1.4 d and 0.9 t?), but wait, the 0.9 t is a triplet, which is typical for a CH2CH3 group at the end. So maybe something like an ethyl group attached to another carbon.

Wait, let me think about the substituents on the benzene. The para positions would have two substituents. Say, one is a methyl group (from the 1.4 d, 3H), and the other is a larger group.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 connected to something else. Let's imagine a structure where there's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a chain. For example, maybe a benzene ring with a ketone group (because of the IR carbonyl). Or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, earlier I thought the 10.5 ppm peak could be a carboxylic acid. So if it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit the 1720 cm-1 (a carbonyl) and the broad peak for -OH. So perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

So, structure-wise, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzoic acid. The substituents would be a methyl group and another group.

Wait, let's look at the NMR again. The aromatic protons are 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). The downfield shift (8.0 ppm) suggests that the substituents are electron-withdrawing, like a nitro group or a carbonyl. But if it's a benzoic acid, the COOH group is para to another substituent. Like 4-substituted benzoic acid.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm would be the COOH proton. So in the NMR, the COOH proton is broad, which fits. Then, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, which makes sense for a para-substituted benzene with a substituent in para to the COOH group.

So, let's say the structure is something like 4-(something)benzoic acid.

Now, looking at the other NMR signals. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group next to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be adjacent CH2 groups, and the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH2. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH2CH3.

So putting it together, perhaps the substituent is a chain like CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene ring. Wait, or maybe it's a branching like CH2CH(CH3)2 or something.

Wait,
