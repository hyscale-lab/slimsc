Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions. But I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So the starting material is benzene. It's treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, which I remember is a nitration reaction. Nitration usually adds a nitro group to the benzene ring. Benzene is pretty symmetrical, so the nitration would happen in a specific position. Wait, nitration is a meta-directing group, right? So when benzene reacts with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, product 1 would be nitrobenzene. But wait, wait—no, benzene can't be nitrated without a catalyst, but H2SO4 is the catalyst here. So yes, product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Next step: product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Oh right, iron is used in the presence of Br2 for a substitution reaction. So nitrobenzene is undergoing a bromination. Bromine with Fe as a catalyst—I think that's a substitution reaction, like a Fittig reaction or something else. Wait, no, wait—bromination of nitrobenzene. Nitro groups are meta directors. So the bromine should add in the meta position relative to the nitro group.

Wait, nitrobenzene has a nitro group in the para position if benzene is treated with HNO3? No, wait
