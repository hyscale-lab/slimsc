Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I remember that Gaussian states are things like coherent states or squeezed states, which have certain properties, and non-Gaussian states are like cat states, which are superpositions of coherent states. So the problem is asking me to compute the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Oh, right, where alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase, and N is the normalizing constant. N is given by sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2alpha²)). So first, I need to plug in the given values: phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5.

Let me compute N first. So alpha is 0.5, so alpha squared is 0.25. The exponential part is exp(-2*(0.25))= exp(-0.5). Let me calculate that: exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. Then, sin(2phi) where phi is -pi/4. 2phi is -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi)= -1. So the numerator inside the sqrt becomes 1 + (-1)*0.6065. That's 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935). Let me calculate that: sqrt(0.3935) is about 0.627.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the formula for N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). So plugging in the numbers, I get 1 + [sin(2*(-pi/4)) ] * exp( -2*(0.5)^2 ). So yeah, 2*(-pi/4) is -pi/2, sin(-pi/2) is -1. So 1 + (-1)*exp(-0.5) is 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. Square root of that is about 0.627.

So the state |psi> is [cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5>]/0.627. Let me compute cos(-pi/4) and sin(-pi/4). Cos is even, so cos(pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So substituting, the state becomes [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ] / 0.627. Let's factor out 0.7071, so it's 0.7071 [ |0.5> - |-0.5> ] divided by 0.627. So 0.7071 / 0.627 is approximately 1.128. So the state is approximately 1.128 (|0.5> - |-0.5>).

Wait, but wait again. Because the normalization N is about 0.627, so 0.7071 / 0.627 is about 1.128. So |psi> = [ |0.5> - |-0.5> ] multiplied by 1.128.

But wait, wait. The state |alpha> is a coherent state, right? So coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator, and they're Gaussian states. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, which makes it a non-Gaussian state, which is what a Schrödinger cat state is. So the state is non-Gaussian, which is why we're calculating its non-Gaussianity.

The non-Gaussianity (nG) is calculated using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state (|psi> in this case) and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but how do I compute this relative entropy? I'm a bit rusty on the details
