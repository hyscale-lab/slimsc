Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. Oh wait, m is the magnetic quantum number for orbital angular momentum, right? So it can take values from -l to +l, where l is the orbital quantum number. But since m is small, maybe l is small too, like for electrons in the hydrogen atom.

The problem is asking me to compare the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the energy due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The other term is the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Wait, 0.4861 micrometers is about the wavelength for the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line, which corresponds to a transition in the hydrogen atom. So ΔE would be the energy difference between two energy levels in hydrogen.

So I need to find the ratio of the magnetic coupling energy to the transition energy. If that ratio is much less than one, then the magnetic term is much smaller. If it's about the same, or larger, then that's different.

First, let's recall the formula for the paramagnetic coupling term. The energy is given by the Zeeman effect, right? The Hamiltonian for the magnetic interaction is something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For an electron, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, but wait, that's for spin. Oh wait, no, the orbital magnetic moment is μ = (e/(2m)) * L, and L is the orbital angular momentum. Alternatively, the magnetic moment due to orbital motion is μ = (μ_B) * m, where m is the magnetic quantum number, and μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, right, the orbital magnetic moment is μ = μ_B * m, where m is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum, L_z. So the energy due to the magnetic field is H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, the energy is H = -μ_B * m * B.

So the expectation value <H> would be just μ_B * m * B, but with a negative sign. But since we're comparing magnitudes, the sign doesn't matter, so let's just consider the absolute value.

μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which I remember is approximately 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T. Okay, so let me write that down. μ_B ≈ 9.27e-24 J/T.

The magnetic field B is 1 T. So H = μ_B * m * B. But wait, what is m here? The magnetic quantum number. For hydrogen, the possible m values are from -l to +l. But the question says m is small. So maybe l is small, like for the ground state, l=0, but that can't contribute. Wait, but if m is small, maybe l is 1, making m= -1, 0, +1. So the maximum m is 1. So the maximum μ would be μ_B *1.

So the paramagnetic term (the Zeeman term) would be on the order of μ_B * m * B. Since m is small, say m=1, then H = μ_B * B ≈ 9.27e-24 J/T * 1 T = 9.27e-24 J.

Wait, but wait, no—the orbital magnetic moment for hydrogen's energy levels. Let me think again. For the hydrogen atom, the energy levels are given by the Rydberg formula, but when a magnetic field is applied, the Zeeman effect splits the energy levels. The splitting is proportional to m * B. So the energy shift is ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * m * B.

But wait, in our problem
