Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on. The question says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

Wait, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. So initially, at Lorentz factor 20, only one third reach the walls. We need to find a higher Lorentz factor that would make two-thirds reach.

I think this has to do with the time it takes for the particles to reach the walls. Because if the particles are moving faster (higher gamma), they might decay more quickly, but wait, the problem says they're fast-decaying. Oh, right, but their decay affects whether they reach the detector's walls.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the particles' lifetime. The lifetime from the lab frame (detector's frame) would be gamma times the proper lifetime. So if the proper lifetime is tau, then the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.

The particles are produced at the center of the detector and move outward. The time they have to reach the inner wall is the time it takes for them to travel 30 meters at their speed. Let's call that time t.

The speed of the particles is v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)), but since they are ultra-relativistic, gamma is much larger than 1, so v is approximately c. So the time t is approximately 30 meters / c. Let me compute that. 30 meters is 0.03 kilometers. Wait, but let's think in terms of seconds. The speed of light is about 3e8 meters per second. So t = 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds. That's 100 nanoseconds.

But wait, another way: Let me compute it more accurately. Time t = distance / speed. The distance is 30 meters. The speed is v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)). For gamma
