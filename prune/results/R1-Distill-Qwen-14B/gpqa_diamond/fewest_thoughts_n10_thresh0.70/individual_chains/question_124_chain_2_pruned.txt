Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. These particles decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to how much time dilation and length contraction occurs in special relativity. But how does that tie into the particles reaching the detector walls?

Wait, particles are produced at the center of the detector, right? So the maximum distance they can travel before decaying is the radius of the detector, 30 meters. But because they're moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. So the proper lifetime (the lifetime in their rest frame) is shorter.

Oh right, the proper lifetime τ is related to the lab frame lifetime t by t = gamma * τ. So the particles' lifetime appears longer in the lab frame, which allows them to travel further before decaying.

The particles that reach the detector's walls are those that have a lifetime sufficient to travel 30 meters at their speed. So the time it takes for them to reach the wall is t = distance/speed. But since they're moving at speed v ≈ c (ultra-relativistic), we can approximate v as c. So t ≈ 30 m / c.

Wait, let me think about it. The particles are produced at the center, so the maximum distance they can travel is 30 meters. The ones that reach the inner walls have decay times that allow them to cover that distance. So the proper lifetime τ must be such that when multiplied by gamma (time in lab frame), equals the time it takes to travel 30 meters at speed v.

Wait, so t = gamma * tau. And t is also 30 m / v. Since v is approximately c, t ≈ 30 / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds? Let me compute that.

30 m divided by 3e8 m/s is 1e-7 seconds.
