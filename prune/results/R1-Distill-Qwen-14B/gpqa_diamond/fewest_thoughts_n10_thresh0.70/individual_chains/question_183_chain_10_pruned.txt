Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) of the product when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A) 1, B) 3, C)5, D)0.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency tells us about the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or each double bond contributes one to the index. So, I need to first figure out what the structure of the starting material is and then see what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI usually lead to a reaction where carbonyl groups are converted into alkanes, right? Because I think that's the Clemmensen reduction. Oh wait, wait. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, and it's a reduction of ketones to alkanes. What about red phosphorus and HI? Oh right, that's the another method for reducing carbonyl groups, sometimes called the hydroiodide reduction. It's similar but maybe under different conditions. Either way, it reduces ketones or aldehydes to alkanes.

So the starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to draw the structure mentally. 

The parent ring is cyclohexene (so a six-membered ring with a double bond). The substituents are at positions 2 and 5.

Wait, position 3 is the double bond in the cyclohexene. So the double bond is between C3 and C4, perhaps? Because the numbering is cyclohex-3-ene.

At position 2, there's a formyl group. Formyl is -CHO. So that's a carbonyl group attached at C2.

At position 5, there's a vinyl group. Vinyl is -CH₂CH₂
