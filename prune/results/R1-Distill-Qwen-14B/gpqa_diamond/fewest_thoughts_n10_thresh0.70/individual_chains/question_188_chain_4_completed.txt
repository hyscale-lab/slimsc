Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all its edges equal and all angles equal too. Wait, but in this question, the angles are 30 degrees each. So alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Interesting.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I think interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal structure. Oh right, the formula for interplanar distance d is given by the equation involving the reciprocal of the lattice parameter and some trigonometric terms.

Wait, what's the formula again? Oh right, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh)cos\alpha}}}

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's perhaps for a cubic system when angles are 90 degrees. But rhombohedral is a special case where a = b = c, but angles can vary. So the formula might be a bit different.

Wait, another approach. I remember that for a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + kl + lh) \cos\gamma}}}

Wait, but wait, no. Because for a cubic system, the formula is just a/sqrt(h² + k² + l²), right? But in a rhombohedral system, the angles come into play. So I think the formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² + 2hk \cos\alpha + 2hl \cos\beta + 2kl \cos\gamma } }

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are equal, so alpha=beta=gamma. So maybe the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, another way I've heard of is using the Miller indices and the dot product in the lattice vectors, but perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Wait the question gives a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance is the edge length a? Because in a simple cubic structure, the edge length equals the interatomic distance. So for a rhombohedral structure, a would be 10 Angstrom here.

The problem is to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. So h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plugging into the formula. Let me write down the formula again.

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosγ )

Since alpha = beta = gamma =30 degrees.

So substituting the numbers:

h=1, k=1, l=1.

Compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator is a, which is 10.

Denominator: sqrt( 1 + 1 +1 + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)*cos30° )

Wait, let's compute the denominator step by step.

The expression inside the sqrt is:

h² +k² + l² = 1+1+1=3.

The other terms: 2*(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(1+1+1) = 6.

Multiply that by cos30°, which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 = 5.196.

So the total inside the sqrt is 3 +5.196=8.196.

So d= 10 / sqrt(8.196)

What's sqrt(8.196)? Let's calculate.

8.196 is approximately 8.196. Let me think. sqrt(8.196) is about 2.864.

Wait, because 2.864 squared is (2.86)^2=8.1796, which is close. Let me compute 2.864^2:

2.864 * 2.864 = (2.86)^2 + some. 2.86^2 is (2 +0.86)^2= 4 + 2*2*0.86 + 0.86^2. Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 2.86^2:

2.86 * 2.86: 2*2=4, 2*0.86=1.72, 0.86*2=1.72, 0.86*0.86≈0.7396.

Wait, perhaps better to do 2.864 *2.864:

So 2.864 * 2.864.

Let me compute 2.864 * 2.864.

Let me compute 2.864^2:

= (2 + 0.864)^2 = 2^2 + 2*2*0.864 + 0.864^2 =4 + 3.456 + 0.746496.

Adding up: 4 + 3.456=7.456; 7.456 +0.746496≈8.2025. So sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.8626.

Wait, but our calculation inside was 3 +5.196=8.196, so sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.862.

So d =10 / 2.862 ≈3.492 Angstrom? Wait, that can't be right because the options are all around 9-10 Angstrom. Oh wait, did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, wait. Oh no, wait, wait. I think I confused something. Because the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, which would be the length of the edge a. But for a rhombohedral structure, the interplanar distance formula is different. Wait, I'm probably using the wrong formula.

Wait, another approach. The interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos\gamma }}

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes are 30 degrees. Or wait, no, wait, wait. The formula I have might be correct. Let me recheck.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the general formula for the interplanar spacing in a crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ( \frac{1}{a^2} ) - 2(hk \frac{cos\gamma}{a^2} + hl \frac{cos\beta}{a^2} + kl \frac{cos\alpha}{a^2}) )}}}

Wait, no, perhaps another way. Maybe I should use the three-dimensional general formula involving the metric tensor.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula based on the reciprocal vectors. The interplanar distance is the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vectors.

But perhaps that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I remember that in a rhombohedral system, because a=b=c, and angles are alpha=beta=gamma, the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos\alpha } }

Wait, but in this case, alpha is 30 degrees.

Wait, but let me think again. The correct formula for d in a rhombohedral (trigonal) crystal is indeed d= a/(sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos γ )).

So let me plug in the numbers again.

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So the denominator inside the square root is:

1 +1 +1 + 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * cos(30°)

Which is 3 + 2*(3)*(sqrt(3)/2 )

Wait, 2*(3) is 6. Multiply by sqrt(3)/2: 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈2.862.

Therefore, d=10/(2.862) ≈3.49 Angstrom.

Wait, but that's way too small compared to the options given, which are in the 8-10 range. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait. Oh! Oh no, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom, but in a rhombohedral crystal, the interatomic distance 'a' is the length of the edge of the unit cell. So a=10 Angstrom.

But wait, perhaps I should compute this using the relationship between the unit cell and the interplanar distance, but I'm clearly getting a value that's not among the options. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Another idea: maybe the formula for interplanar distance is a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )^{-1/2}.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I forgot that in the formula, the denominator is sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ), but since beta and alpha are 30 degrees as well.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, the three angles are the same, so cos alpha = cos beta = cos gamma = cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So, the denominator becomes:

h² +k² + l² + 2h k cos gamma + 2h l cos beta + 2k l cos alpha.

Which, since all cos terms are the same, it's h² +k² + l² + 2*(hk + hl + kl)* cos gamma.

So that's correct as before.

So with h=k=l=1, the denominator is 3 + 2*(3)*(sqrt(3)/2) )= 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈3+5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.862.

So d = a / (2.862) = 10 /2.862 ≈3.494.

But that's nowhere near the options given. Hmm. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps in the rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is calculated differently. Another approach: the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system can be written using the relation:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Since all angles are 30 degrees, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is actually:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Which is what I used.

So that gives me approximately 3.49 Angstrom. But the options are all around 9-10. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the rhombohedral system is treated as a special case of the hexagonal system. No, that's probably not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, but the interplanar distance formula is the same as for a cubic system but multiplied by a factor involving the angles.

Wait, another approach: the general formula for d-spacing is given by:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) (1/a^2) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)/a^2 } }

Wait, no, that's probably not right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² +k² +l² + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) } }

Wait, in that case, using our numbers:

h=k=l=1, a=10.

gamma=30°, beta=30°, alpha=30°.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 2*(1*1*0.866 + 1*1*0.866 + 1*1*0.866 )

Which is 3 + 2*( 3 * 0.866 ) =3+2*(2.598)=3+5.196=8.196.

Same as before. So d=10 / sqrt(8.196)=3.494.

But options are 8.95, 9.08, etc. So this can't be right. There's a disconnect here.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the formula. Maybe I should use a^2 = (some terms involving d and cos theta).

Alternatively, perhaps I confused the reciprocal. Maybe the formula is (1/d^2) = (h² +k² +l²)/a² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta /a².

Wait, that would make d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta ), which is what I did before.

Hmm. So this leads me back to the same result. So why is the result not matching the options?

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the interatomic distance as the edge length a, but perhaps the interplanar distance is measured differently. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another possibility: the (111) plane in a rhombohedral system may have a different formula. Alternatively, perhaps the angles given are the angles between the planes, which might not be the same as the lattice angles.

Wait, no, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are the angles between the edges of the crystal, not the planes.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal lattice vectors and then find the magnitude.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think if I've heard of any other formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\gamma } }

Which is what I used.

So given that, I'm getting d=3.49 Ang, but the options are higher. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another thought: maybe the formula includes the square of the cos terms, but no, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different for rhombohedral. Let me think. Could it be that the formula for interplanar distance in rhombohedral is (a√(h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ))^{-1} ?

Wait, no, that's the same as what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, which in a simple cubic structure is a, but in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps it's different.

Wait, no, in a simple cubic structure, the edge length a is the same as the interatomic distance. But in a rhombohedral structure, each atom is at the corner, but the angles affect the distances between other atoms as well. But the edge length a is the distance between adjacent atoms along the cube edges, so a is the interatomic distance.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is larger than in a cubic system because of the angles. But according to my calculations, it's smaller. So perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, maybe I should compute using the reciprocal of the denominator. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps in the formula, the denominator is (h² +k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ), but perhaps that's because the angles are the angles between the axes, not the angles between the planes. So perhaps I have the formula correct.

Wait, this is getting frustrating. Let me check the options again. The options are around 9 Angstrom, which is close to the given a=10 Angstrom. So maybe the interplanar distance is a little less than a, like 9.08 or 8.95.

But according to my calculation, it's about 3.49, which is much smaller. So something is wrong here.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the formula. Let me think again. Another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the formula involving the volume of the unit cell.

Wait, what's the volume of a rhombohedral unit cell? It's a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 theta + 2 cos^3 theta ), where theta is the angle (30 degrees here). But I'm not sure how to apply that here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )^{-1} )

Which is the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the denominator again more accurately.

Let me compute the denominator:

h² +k² +l² = 3.

Then, 2*(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(1+1+1) )=6.

Multiply by cos30: 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) )=3*sqrt(3) ≈5.19615.

So denominator inside sqrt: 3 +5.19615=8.19615.

So sqrt(8.19615)= approx 2.862.

Thus, d=10/2.862≈3.494 Angstrom.

But that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Oh wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not a, but some other parameter like the distance between certain atoms in the structure. Maybe in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is different from the edge length a.

Wait, but in a simple cubic structure, the edge length a is the interatomic distance. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the atoms are arranged differently, and the given interatomic distance is along a different direction. So perhaps a is not 10 Angstrom, but something else.

Wait, but the question says "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom", which I thought was a. So I assumed a=10. But maybe that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms, which in a rhombohedral structure, could be along the (1,1,1) direction. Oh, perhaps that's the case. So the interatomic distance is not a, but the distance along the vector (1,1,1). Hmm, but that's stretching it.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest neighbors. In a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbors are along the edges, so a would be the distance between nearest atoms, so a=10 Ang. So that should be correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the Miller indices. (111) plane. What's the relation between the interplanar distance and the reciprocal lattice.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) e1,

b2 = (2π/a) e2 cosθ,

Wait, perhaps it's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system as:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \gamma } }

Which is what I did, leading to d≈3.494 Ang. But since the options don't have this value, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the reciprocal of the interplanar distance squared. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula I'm using is correct for a cubic system, but for rhombohedral, it's different. Let me check another formula.

I found a source that says for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar spacing is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \gamma }}

Which is what I used.

But perhaps the angles in the formula are not the angles between the axes but the angles between the planes. No, that's not correct. The angles in the formula refer to the angles between the lattice vectors, which are given as 30 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses cos(180 - theta), but 30 degrees is acute, so cos(30)= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

Wait, if the angle between the lattice vectors is 30 degrees, then in the formula, it's cos(30) as I used.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I calculated the reciprocal of the denominator correctly, but perhaps the formula is inverted. Wait, no, d is a over the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using more precise values.

Let me compute the denominator more accurately.

Compute 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3).

What's 3*sqrt(3)? sqrt(3)=1.7320508075688772.

3*1.7320508075688772 =5.196152422706632.

So 3 +5.196152422706632=8.196152422706632.

sqrt(8.196152422706632) = let's compute.

We know that 2.862^2=8.192644.

Wait, 2.862^2 = (2.862)*(2.862) = let's calculate:

2 * 2 =4.

2 * 0.862 =1.724.

0.862 *2 =1.724.

0.862 * 0.862 = 0.743044.

So adding up:

(2 + 0.862)^2 = 4 + 2*(2*0.862) + 0.862^2.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, 2.862^2:

= (2.8 + 0.062)^2 = 2.8^2 + 2*(2.8)(0.062) + 0.062^2.

=7.84 + 0.3472 + 0.003844= 7.84 +0.3472=8.1872 +0.003844=8.191044.

But our denominator inside sqrt is 8.1961524, which is a bit higher than 8.191044.

So what is sqrt(8.196152422706632)?

Let me compute 2.862^2=8.191044 as above.

The difference is 8.1961524-8.191044=0.005108.

We can approximate sqrt using linear approximation.

Let f(x)=sqrt(x). f'(x)=1/(2 sqrt(x)).

We know f(8.191044)=2.862.

We want f(8.1961524) = 2.862 + delta.

delta ≈ (8.1961524 - 8.191044) * (1/(2*2.862)).

delta ≈ 0.0051084 * (1/(5.724)) ≈0.0051084 /5.724≈0.000892.

So f(8.1961524)≈2.862 +0.000892=2.862892.

So denominator is approximately 2.862892.

Thus, d=10 /2.862892= approx 3.494 Angstrom.

But again, this is not matching any of the options. So I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a', but the distance between certain atoms, like the body diagonal or something else. For example, perhaps the interatomic distance is along (1,1,1), which would have a distance of √(a² + a² + a² + 2a² (cos30 + cos30 + cos30 )) ?

Wait, no, that's not correct. The distance between two atoms along the (1,1,1) direction would involve vectors. Let me think.

Wait, each lattice vector is a, and the angle between any two vectors is 30 degrees. So the vector sum for (1,1,1) would be a*(e1 + e2 + e3), and the magnitude would be a * sqrt( 3 + 2*(e1·e2 + e1·e3 + e2·e3) ).

Since e1·e2 = cos30, same for others.

So magnitude squared is a² [3 + 2*(3 * cos30) ] = a² [3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) ] =a² [3 +3*sqrt(3)].

Which is a² * (3 +5.196)=a² *8.196.

So magnitude is a* sqrt(8.196)≈ a*2.862.

If the interatomic distance is given as 10 Ang, then 10 = a*2.862 → a=10/2.862≈3.494 Ang.

But then the interplanar distance for (111) would be a/(sqrt(8.196))= (3.494)/2.862 ≈1.221 Ang. Which is even smaller, which doesn't fit the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is given as the distance between nearest neighbors, which in a rhombohedral structure may not be along the a-axis but along another direction. So perhaps the given interatomic distance is sqrt(a² + 2a² cos theta ), where theta is 30 degrees. Let's compute that.

sqrt( a² + 2a² cos30 )= a*sqrt(1 + 2 cos30) = a*sqrt(1 + 2*(0.866))= a*sqrt(1 +1.732)=a*sqrt(2.732)= a*1.652.

If that's the case, and the given interatomic distance is 10 Ang, then a=10/1.652≈6.056 Ang.

Then, the interplanar distance d for (111) would be a/(sqrt(3+3*sqrt(3)) )=6.056 /2.862≈2.116 Ang. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is along a different direction. For example, the nearest neighbor direction is (1,0,0), which would have a distance of a. So that would make a=10.

But then the interplanar distance is 3.49 Ang, as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Either the formula is wrong, or perhaps the question expects a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the (111) plane in a different way, like the (111) planes in a hexagonal close-packed structure, but that's probably not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using a different formula, perhaps involving the unit cell volume or other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are the angles between the planes, not the lattice vectors. But that's not correct; the angles alpha, beta, gamma are the angles between the lattice vectors.

Wait, perhaps I should use the following formula:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma }}

But wait, perhaps I should use the reciprocal:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) (1/a^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) (1/a^2) } }

Which would be:

d = 1 / sqrt( (3 + 2*(3) * cos30 ) /a² )

Which is same as:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6 cos30 )

Which is the same as before. So same result.

I'm really stuck here. All calculations lead to around 3.49 Ang, but the options are around 9 Ang. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the inverse of sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) ) for a cubic system, but I'm not sure. Let me think of a cubic system, where gamma=90 degrees, cos30=0. Cos90=0.

In that case, the denominator becomes sqrt(3), so d= a / sqrt(3) ≈10/1.732≈5.77 Ang. But the options are higher than that.

Wait, but perhaps the given angles are not 30 degrees but 60 degrees. No, the question says 30 degrees.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Let me think about the interplanar distance in terms of the reciprocal space.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) (1, 0, 0),

b2 = (2π/a) (0,1,0),

b3 = (2π/a) (0,0,1).

But wait, that's for a cubic system. For a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal vectors would be more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the magnitude of the reciprocal vector (hkl) is:

|G| = (2π/d) sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )

Thus, d = (2π) / |G|.

Wait, no, perhaps |G|=sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ) * (2π/a).

Thus, d = (2π) / ( |G| ) = (2π a ) / ( sqrt( ... ) * 2π ) )= a / sqrt( ... )

So same as before.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the (111) plane in a rhombohedral system has a different formula. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance (d) can be calculated using the formula:

d = [ a² (h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ) ]^{-1/2}

Wait, no, that would give d = a / sqrt(...), which is the same as before.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should compute the inverse of the denominator. Because in one instance, I thought the denominator was 8.196, so 1/sqrt(8.196) ≈0.349. So d=10 * 0.349≈3.49 Ang. Still the same result.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must be making a wrong assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the (111) planes in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the angles given are the angles between the planes, not between the lattice vectors. No, that can't be right. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are the angles between the lattice vectors (the edges of the unit cell).

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the supplementary angle, 180-30=150 degrees, so cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, that would change things. Let me recalculate.

If cos theta = cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 +6*(-0.866)=3 -5.196= -2.196.

Wait, that's negative, which can't be. So that can't be correct.

Hmm. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate using cos(60 degrees), but the question says 30 degrees.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the angle between the planes, which might be 60 degrees, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, this is getting me nowhere. Let me think about the options again. The options are all around 9 Angstrom, which is close to a=10. So perhaps the interplanar distance is a multiplied by something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )^{-1}.

Which is same as before.

So with h=k=l=1, and cos theta= 0.866, the denominator is 3 +5.196=8.196, so sqrt(8.196)=2.862, inverse is 0.349. So d=10 *0.349=3.49 Ang.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I must have made a mistake somewhere, but I can't figure it out. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the options are perhaps wrong.

But since I have to choose from the options given, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check another source.

Oh wait! I think I found the mistake. I think I used the correct formula but forgot that in a rhombohedral system, the formula for interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos\gamma }}

But wait, I think gamma is the angle between axes, which in this case is 30 degrees. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the angle between the planes is different than the angle between the lattice vectors. But I think the formula uses the angles between the lattice vectors.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 9.54 Ang, but I don't see how that connects. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the unit cell parameters, considering the volume.

The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 gamma + 2 cos^3 gamma).

With a=10, gamma=30 degrees.

Compute cos(30)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660.

So V=10^3 * sqrt(1 -3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3 )

Compute each term:

3*(0.866)^2=3*(0.75)=2.25.

2*(0.866)^3=2*(0.866 *0.866 *0.866 )=2*(0.6495)=1.299.

So inside sqrt: 1 -2.25 +1.299= (1 +1.299) -2.25=2.299 -2.25=0.049.

So sqrt(0.049)=0.2214.

So V=1000 *0.2214=221.4 Ang^3.

But how does this help with the interplanar distance?

Hmm. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance can be calculated using the volume and other factors.

But I'm not making progress. I think I have to conclude that based on the formula I've used, the interplanar distance is about 3.49 Ang, which is not among the options. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, but I can't figure it out right now.

Wait, perhaps the formula is actually d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ), because perhaps the angles are the angles between the planes, not the vectors.

Wait, if I use cos(150 degrees)= -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

Then denominator becomes 3 +6*(-0.866)=3 -5.196= -2.196.

But square root of negative number is impossible, so that can't be correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using 60 degrees instead of 30. Let me try that.

Wait, no, the question says 30 degrees. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ) / (h² +k² +l²).

No, that doesn't make sense.

I think I'm stuck. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, 8.95 Ang, but I can't see how.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for interplanar distance is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma )^{-1}.

Wait, same as before. So with a=10, denominator sqrt=2.862, so d=10/2.862≈3.494 Ang. So again, same result.

In conclusion, perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options, but given the options, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos\gamma } }

Which I've been using. So perhaps the correct answer is approximately 3.49 Ang, which is not present. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But the options are all around 9 Ang.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the (111) planes as the planes in a hexagonal system, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using a different approach, like using the dot product.

Wait, the planes (111) in a rhombohedral system. The normal vector to the (111) plane is (1,1,1). The distance from the origin to the (111) plane is given by d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ))).

Which is same as before.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and must proceed to the conclusion that the correct answer is not among the options, but probably the intended answer is option B) 8.95 Ang, but I can't see how that's calculated.

Wait, perhaps I had a mistake in the calculation of the denominator. Let me check again.

Denominator inside sqrt: 3 + 6 * (sqrt(3)/2 ) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3) = 3 + 5.19615 =8.19615.

sqrt(8.19615)=2.862.

So d=10/2.862=3.494 Ang.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator.

Wait, 1/2.862≈0.349. So 10 *0.349=3.49 Ang.

No, same result.

Wait, perhaps the formula is inverted. Let me compute 10 * sqrt(8.196) =10*2.862=28.62 Ang. But that's way larger than the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt( denominator ), which would be 10 *2.862=28.62. Not possible.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option B) 8.95 Ang. But I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (hk + hl + kl) as 3, but in reality, perhaps it's 3*(h k + h l + k l ), which for (111) is 3*(1*1+1*1+1*1)=9, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / ( ... ), but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / ( sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) + ... ), but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator and multiply by a.

But I'm not getting anywhere.

In conclusion, I think I must have made a mistake in the formula, but I can't figure it out. So perhaps the correct answer is option B) 8.95 Ang, but I'm not sure.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula used is:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos\gamma}}
\]

### Given:
- Interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \)
- Miller indices \( h = 1, k = 1, l = 1 \)
- Crystal angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \)
- \( \cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \)

### Calculation:
1. **Denominator inside the square root**:
   \[
   h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3
   \]
   \[
   2(hk + hl + kl) = 2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) = 2 \cdot 3 = 6
   \]
   \[
   2(hk + hl + kl) \cos\gamma = 6 \cdot 0.866 = 5.196
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total} = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
   \]

2. **Square root of the denominator**:
   \[
   \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.862
   \]

3. **Interplanar distance**:
   \[
   d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{8.196}} = \frac{10}{2.862} \approx 3.494 \, \text{Å}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated interplanar distance \( d \approx 3.494 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all significantly larger (8.95–10.05 Å). This discrepancy suggests either an error in the formula or a misinterpretation of the given parameters. However, since the options do not align with the derived result, the most plausible answer based on the options provided is **B) 8.95 Å**.
