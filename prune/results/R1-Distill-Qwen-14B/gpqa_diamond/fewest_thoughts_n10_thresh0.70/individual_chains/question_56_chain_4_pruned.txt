Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the hydrogen atom. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state through two dipole transitions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions between energy levels are governed by the selection rules. For dipole transitions, the selection rules for the quantum numbers are important. The standard selection rules for the hydrogen atom are Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but for dipole transitions, more specific rules apply.

Wait, no, actually, wait. The selection rules for dipole transitions are more strict. I think for dipole transitions, the change in the angular momentum quantum number l is limited. Oh right, the selection rules for l are Δl = ±1. So, during a transition, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can increase or decrease by 1. But since the initial and final states must have opposite parity for a dipole transition, I think that's another consideration. Hmm.

The initial state is |3,0,0>. Its n is 3, l is 0, m is 0. The final state is |1,0,0>, so n goes from 3 to 1, which is a Δn of -2. But dipole transitions allow Δn up to ±1, right? Wait, no, wait. No, wait. No, wait. I think the dipole selection rules allow Δn to be any as long as it's a dipole-allowed transition, but no, wait, no: no, I think the dipole selection rules are Δl = ±1, and Δn can be any, but wait, that doesn't make sense because for a single photon emission, I think Δn can be 1. Because dipole transitions are associated with the emission or absorption of a single photon. So wait—wait a second, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the initial state is n=3, l=0. The final is n=1, l=0. So n changes by 2. But a single dipole transition (emission of a single photon) would require Δn=1, because the photon's energy corresponds to the energy difference between n=3 and n=2
