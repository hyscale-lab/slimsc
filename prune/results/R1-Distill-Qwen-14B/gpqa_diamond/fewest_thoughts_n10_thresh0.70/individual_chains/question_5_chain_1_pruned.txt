Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I remember that operators in quantum mechanics can be represented as matrices, and eigenvectors correspond to states with definite values when measured.

Wait, the operator P is given for its components: Px, Py, and Pz. Let me jot those down.

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix scaled the same way. Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]], so that's the Pauli Z matrix scaled.

But wait, the operator in question is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, so the direction is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, which means the direction vector n has components (nx, 0, nz), right? So any direction in the x-z plane can be represented using an angle θ from the x-axis, perhaps.

So the operator P for a direction n would be a combination of Px, Py, and Pz. Specifically, since the direction is arbitrary, the operator will be P · n̂. So it should be P = nx P_x + nz P_z, because the y-component of n is zero.

Let me write that out. P = nx * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]. 

Wait, but wait. Another approach: for spin-1/2 systems, the spin operator in direction n is given by S · n, which is ( nx Sx + ny Sy + nz Sz ). Since the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, the eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states along that direction.

So in
