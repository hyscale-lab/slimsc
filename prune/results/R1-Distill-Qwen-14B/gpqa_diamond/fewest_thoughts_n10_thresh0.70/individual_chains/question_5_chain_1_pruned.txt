Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking for. So, the question is about calculating the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

The operator P is a vector operator, so I think I need to consider its components in the x, y, and z directions. The problem gives me each component of P as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, let me break this down. The components are:

Px: (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py: (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz: (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, each component is a Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2. I remember that the Pauli matrices (like σx, σy, σz) are 2x2 and used for spin-1/2 systems, like electrons or muons. Since a muon is also a spin-1/2 particle, this makes sense.

The operator in question is the vector operator P, which I think is the spin operator. So the operator is the Pauli vector multiplied by ħ/2. Because spin operators are often denoted by S, but here it's P. But the structure is similar.

The question is to find the eigenvector of P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction n is in the x-z plane, which means its angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ would be zero because it's in the x-z plane. Or wait, actually, in the x-z plane, the direction would have φ=0 or π, because y is zero. Wait, φ is the angle around the z-axis. So if the direction is in x-z, then φ=0 or π. But the problem states it's an arbitrary direction in x-z, so perhaps the angle θ is variable but φ is zero.

Hmm, but wait, the eigenvector would be along the direction of n, so the state is an eigenstate of the operator P·n, where n is a unit vector in the x-z plane. So we need to find the eigenstate of (P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z) with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but the operator P is a vector operator, so the operator for direction n would be the dot product of P and n. So the operator is (P · n) = nx P_x + ny P_y + nz P_z.

But since n is in the x-z plane, ny = 0. So the operator becomes (n_x P_x + n_z P_z).

And the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So we're looking for the eigenvector of the operator (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) with eigenvalue ħ/2.

Wait, but how do I compute that? I remember that for spin-1/2 systems, the
