Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I remember is the non-rigid rotor model. So it's considering both rotational and vibrational energy states. Wait, but the question specifically talks about the fundamental state and the next lowest energy. Oh wait, waitâ€”fundamental state in vibration is the lowest vibrational state, right? And for rotation, the lowest is the ground state as well. But when they talk about the next state, I'm not sure whether it's a change in vibration or rotation.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, so that's the ground state for both vibration and rotation. The molecule can absorb a photon, and we need to find the momentum of that photon such that the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. So what's the next state? Since the ground state is the lowest, the next would probably be an excited state of either rotation or vibration. But which one has a lower energy requirement?

I think that for diatomic molecules, the vibrational energy levels are usually lower in spacing than the rotational ones. Or wait, no, maybe the vibrational energy spacing is larger. Because the energy levels for vibration are quantized as (n + 1/2) h nu, so each step is h nu. For rotation, the energy levels are quantized as something like B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. So the spacing between rotational states increases with J.

But the question is about the next lowest energy state. So maybe the molecule can absorb a photon that causes a transition to the first excited vibrational state, or a transition to a higher rotational state. Which of these has a lower energy?

Wait, the energy for a vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1 would be h nu. The rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 would be something like [B (1)(2) - B (0)(1)] = 2B - 0 = 2B. So if 2B is lower than h nu, then the rotational transition would require less energy. But I don't know the actual values here.

Wait, the given data includes the angular frequency w, which is 4e14 rad/s. So
