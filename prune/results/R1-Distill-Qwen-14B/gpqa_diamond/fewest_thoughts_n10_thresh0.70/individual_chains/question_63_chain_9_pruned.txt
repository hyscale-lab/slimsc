Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident about the concepts involved. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options given are A to D, each with different momentum values.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, molecules have quantized energy levels for both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state probably refers to the lowest energy state in this model. But wait, when they say 'next state with the lowest possible energy,' I need to figure out what transition that would be.

Wait, the molecule is in its ground state. The next state could be either the next rotational state or the next vibrational state. I think in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational energies. But I'm not exactly sure how the states are ordered in terms of energy.

Wait, I think the fundamental vibrational state is the ground state for vibration, which is n=0. The rotational states are quantized with quantum number J, where J can be 0,1,2,... The energy levels for rotation are given by something like E_rot = B * J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For vibration, the energy is E_vib = (n +
