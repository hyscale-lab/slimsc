Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me the density matrix ρ as 1/2 times (|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed, meaning it's a statistical mixture of pure states rather than a single pure state.

Wait, but what's the geometrical position in qubit space? Oh right, for a single qubit, the state can be represented as a vector in a 3-dimensional space, often called the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector (r) has three components (x, y, z), each corresponding to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices σx, σy, and σz.

I think the general form of a density matrix for a single qubit is something like ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ is the vector of Pauli matrices. So if I can express the given ρ in that form, I can find r.

Let me compute that. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. I know that |0><0| is the outer product of |0> with itself, same for |1>. Let me write them in matrix form.

|0> is [1; 0], so |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = 1/2 * I, since I is the identity matrix here.

Wait a second, so ρ is (I)/2. Let's plug this into the general form. The general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So if I have (I)/2, that would imply that r·σ must be zero. Because (I + 0)/2 = I/2.

So r·σ = 0. That means the vector r must be zero. Because the only vector that when dotted with σ (which is a vector of matrices) gives zero is the zero vector. Because each component (r_x, r_y, r_z) multiplied by σ_x, σ_y, σ_z respectively would sum to zero only if all r components are zero.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That corresponds to the completely mixed state. Because for a single qubit, the completely mixed state is the maximally uncertain state, which is ρ = I/2.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we note that single-qubit states can be represented as vectors on the Bloch sphere. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma},
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given density matrix, we see that \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \), which implies \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \). The only vector \( \mathbf{r} \) that satisfies this is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \). This corresponds to the completely mixed state of a single qubit.

From the options provided, the correct geometrical position is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
