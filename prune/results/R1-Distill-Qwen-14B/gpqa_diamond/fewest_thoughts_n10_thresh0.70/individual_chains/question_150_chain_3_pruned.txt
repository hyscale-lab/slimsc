Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let's break that down. The molecular formula has 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, and 1 oxygen.

The NMR data is provided. Let me look at that:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the structure of the original compound is. Once I have that, I need to determine what happens when it reacts with the given reagents: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O, then aq. KOH and heat.

First, let's interpret the NMR. The peaks can give me clues about the substituents and the structure.

Starting with the 9.72 ppm peak. That's quite a high chemical shift, so it's probably an aldehyde proton. The integration is 1H, so that fits. The splitting is a triplet (t), which suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So, the aldehyde is next to a CH2 group. Or maybe the aldehyde is attached to a CH that's adjacent to another CH2? Hmm, not sure yet.

Next, looking at the aromatic regions. There's a doublet at 6.98 ppm integrating to 2H and another at 6.51 ppm, also a doublet for 2H. These could be from a para-substituted aromatic ring. The 6.98 is more downfield, so maybe there's an electron-withdrawing group like nitro or hydroxyl in the para position. Wait, the molecular formula includes an oxygen, so maybe a hydroxyl group?

Then there's a broad singlet at 6.27 ppm for 2H. Broad usually suggests exchange, like an acidic proton, maybe from a phenol group. But with two protons, perhaps it's a di-substituted ring, but wait, the phenol usually has a single proton. Hmm, maybe it's a vinyl group or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a pair of protons in a conjugated system, like an enol.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet for 2H. That's in the range for a CH2 group, maybe adjacent to an oxygen. Like an OCH2 group? Or perhaps a methylene next to something electron-withdrawing. The splitting as a doublet suggests coupling with another CH2 group. Like maybe a -CH2-CH2- structure.

Putting this together, maybe the compound has an aldehyde group, some aromatic rings, and perhaps an ether or ester group.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

Plugging in: (2*8 + 2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be one ring (from benzene) and four double bonds, but wait, benzene is three double bonds. So, maybe one ring (benzene) and two double bonds elsewhere, but let's see.

Alternatively, another ring or double bond. Maybe the aldehyde is a double bond, so that's another.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about possible structures.
