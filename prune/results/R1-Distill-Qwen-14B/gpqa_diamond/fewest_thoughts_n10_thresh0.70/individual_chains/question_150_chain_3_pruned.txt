Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Breaking it down: each degree of unsaturation is a ring or a double bond. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 8, H is 9, X is 0 (since no halogens are mentioned), N is 1. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (which has 3 double bonds, so 3 degrees), a double bond (another degree), and an aldehyde group (which is a double bond, another degree). Wait, no, wait. Actually, the aldehyde is a carbonyl group, which is one double bond. So if the benzene ring has three, a double bond elsewhere, and the aldehyde, that adds up to 5. So maybe the structure has a benzene ring, an aldehyde group, and another double bond. Or perhaps other combinations.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H) â€“ that might be an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet, but sometimes can be split if there's coupling. Wait, a triplet here. Maybe it's adjacent to another proton. Oh, wait, but aldehydes are usually at the end, maybe adjacent to a CH2 group or something.

Then there's 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), which looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because the two doublets are similar in integration, so likely a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions. Because each doublet has 2H, so maybe two substituents across from each other on a benzene. Or perhaps it's part of a di-substituted ring, but I'm not sure.

Then 6.27 (bs, 2H): broad singlet. Hmm, broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH proton? Or maybe some aromatic protons adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. Or perhaps it's an enol proton? Or maybe part of a conjugated system.

3.66 (d, 2H): this looks like a CH2 group adjacent to something. The doublet suggests two neighboring protons. So maybe a CH2 connected to an oxygen? Or perhaps adjacent to another CH2 group. Like maybe an ethyl group attached to something, but the splitting is a doublet, so perhaps attached to a substituent that's deshielded.

Wait, putting this together.
