Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but let's think it through.

The question is asking which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density. Density is mass divided by volume, right? So I need to figure out each planet's density and compare them.

Let's break down each option.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known. Earth's mass is about 5.97 x 10^24 kg and its radius is about 6,371 km. The density is mass/volume. Volume is (4/3)πr³. Let me compute Earth's density. Oh wait, I remember Earth's average density is roughly 5.5 g/cm³. So option a has the same mass and radius as Earth, so its density is 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, so density is already given as 5.5. So no matter the mass, its density is 5.5. Or wait, no, wait. No, because density is mass/volume. If the density is given as 5.5, that's that. So option b has a density of 5.5. But wait, Earth's is also 5.5. So b's density is same as a's?

Option c: A planet with same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Same composition implies same density as Earth, I think. Because composition affects density—like Earth's layers. If it's same composition, same density. So Earth's density is about 5.5, so option c's density is also 5.5.

Wait, but mass and radius affect density. Let me think. If the composition is the same, then density is the same. Because density depends on the materials. So for same composition, even if mass changes, if radius scales proportionally, the density remains same. But wait, if the mass increases without the radius scaling in a way that affects the density, that could change. So wait, Earth has a certain radius to mass ratio. If I make a planet more massive but same composition, how does the radius change?

Oh, right. For a planet with same composition,
