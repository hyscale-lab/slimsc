Okay, so I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let me read it carefully again.

We've got ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measured the particles' positions, none were found outside x=1 to x=3. So, the probability of finding a particle outside this range is zero. I need to find the value of 'a' from the given options.

Wait, I remember that the wave function must be normalized. Normalization means the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. Since all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3, the integral of the probability density from x=1 to x=3 must be 1.

The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So, for a wave function ψ(x), the probability density is |ψ(x)|².

Given ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me compute |ψ(x)|².

The absolute square of a complex number (a + ib) is a² + b². So,

ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), imaginary part is -0.5.

So, |ψ(x)|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (-0.5)^2 = (a²)/(1+x)
