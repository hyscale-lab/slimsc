Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's take it step by step.

The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, wait, let me make sure I got that right. Oh right, the formula given is 1/plx^5. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax)^5, which I can write as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Wait, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Parallax is defined as 1 over distance, or plx = 1/(distance in parsecs), right? So plx is inversely proportional to distance. So if distance r increases, plx decreases.

Let me write that down. Let's denote distance as r. So plx = 1/r. That means plx is inversely proportional to r.

Now, the problem is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So we need to find how N varies with r.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and since plx = 1/r, substituting that in, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5.

Let me compute that. So 1/( (1/r)^5 ) is the same as r^5, because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, and 1 over that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about how the number of
