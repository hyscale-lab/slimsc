Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Hmm, right, parallax is inversely related to distance. I remember that parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs, so plx = 1/d. Or wait, actually, parallax is defined as the reciprocal of distance, so if distance increases, parallax decreases.

Wait, the formula for distance modulus is distance (d) is 1 over plx. So, d = 1/plx. So, as distance increases, parallax decreases. Got it.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So, given N proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and since plx is 1/d, I can substitute that in.

Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Simplifying that, 1/(1/d)^5 is the same as d^5, because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, and taking reciprocal gives d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance, r. Oh, wait, maybe I misread that. Wait, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx^5) for some constant k. But since plx is 1/d, substituting gives N = k * d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance, per unit range of distance r. Hmm. So per unit distance, like how the number changes as you move a little further out? Or is it the density of stars as a function of distance?

Wait, another approach. Let's model it as a differential. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be N = (number density) × volume of the shell. Volume of a shell is 4πd
