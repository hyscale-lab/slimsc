Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain point r and time t, given a moving point charge q. The charge's trajectory is s(t), and we're considering the time when the field was generated, tr, which is earlier than t. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated (at tr) to the observation point r. The velocity of the charge at that time tr is v.

I remember that when charges are moving, you have to consider both the electric and magnetic fields. But since the question is about potentials, I should focus on how potentials are defined for moving charges.

Wait, the scalar potential usually comes from the electric field, and the vector potential from the magnetic field. Oh right, but for a moving charge, both potentials contribute to the total fields.

So, for a stationary charge, the scalar potential is V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of the motion and possibly special relativity effects, but maybe we can approach this using the classical treatment.

I think the potentials due to a moving charge can be expressed in terms of the velocity. Let me recall the expressions for V and A in such cases.

I remember that the scalar potential for a moving charge might have a term depending on (1/(r - vt)) or something like that, but here the charge isn't necessarily moving directly towards or away. The vector d is from the charge's position at tr to the observation point. So, the distance between them is d. Wait, actually, no, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr (the field generating instant) to r. So, the distance between the charge at tr and the field point is |d|, which is the same as the length of vector d.

Hmm, and the velocity v is the velocity at time tr. So the point is, the charge was at some position at tr, and at that time, the potentials started to propagate towards r.

For the scalar potential, I think it's similar to the static case, but modified by the relative motion. Wait, but in the static case,
