Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ which is equal to 1/2 times (|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this ρ is a density matrix for a qubit.

I think the first step is to write out what this ρ looks like in matrix form. The standard basis states |0> and |1> correspond to the matrices [[1,0],[0,0]] and [[0,0],[0,1]], respectively. So |0><0| would be [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| would be [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, multiplying by 1/2, the density matrix becomes [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. 

Wait a second, so ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. That makes sense because each basis state has an equal probability of 1/2. So this is a completely mixed state, right? Like, it's not a pure state but a statistical mixture of |0> and |1> with equal probabilities.

Now the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit confused about what that means. I remember that for qubits, the state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. But wait, the Bloch sphere is for pure states. How does that work for mixed states?

Oh right, density matrices provide a way to generalize the Bloch sphere representation to mixed states. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components and the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector of components (r_x, r_y, r_z), and σ represents the Pauli matrices.

So if I express the given ρ in this form, I can find the components of
