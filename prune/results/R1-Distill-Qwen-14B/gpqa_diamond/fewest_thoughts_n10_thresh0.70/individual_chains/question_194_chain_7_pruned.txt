Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem states that there are three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the system, each weighted by the Boltzmann factor, which is e^(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So, Z = sum_{all states} exp(-β E).

So first, I need to figure out all possible states of the system. Each spin can be +1 or -1. Since there are three spins, the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. Let me list them out.

The states are all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, I need to calculate the energy E. The energy expression is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's compute each term.

Wait, but maybe a smarter way is to notice that each term S_i S_j is 1 if both are same, -1 if different. So for each pair, their product is +1 or -1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the number of neighboring pairs that are the same or opposite. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to compute each state's E.

Let me compute E for each of the 8 states.

1. State (+1, +1, +1):
S1S2 = 1*1=1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum: 1+1+1=3
E = -J * 3 = -3J.

2. State (+1, +1, -1):
S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1
Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1
E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. State (+1, -1, +1):
S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1
E = J again.

4. State (+1, -1, -1):
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1
E= J.

Wait, wait. Let me check. That's the fourth state: S3 is -1.

So S1 is +1, S2 is -1, S3 is -1.

S1S2: (+1)(-1) = -1

S1S3: (+1)(-1) = -1

S2S3: (-1)(-1) = +1

Sum = (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.

So E = -J*(-1) = J.

So states 2,3,4 all have E=J.

5. State (-1, +1, +1):
S1S2: (-1)(+1) = -1
S1S3: (-1)(+1) = -1
S2S3: (+1)(+1) = +1
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1
E= J.

6. State (-1, +1, -1):
S1S2: (-1)(+1) = -1
S1S3: (-1)(-1) = +1
S2S3: (+1)(-1) = -1
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1
E= J.

7. State (-1, -1, +1):
S1S2: (-1)(-1)=+1
S1S3: (-1)(+1)=-1
S2S3: (-1)(+1)=-1
Sum: +1 -1 -1 = -1
E= J.

8. State (-1, -1, -1):
Each product is 1*1=1.
Sum: 1+1+1=3
E= -3J.

Wait a minute, so looking at all the states:

- The fully aligned state (all +1 or all -1) has E = -3J.
Wait no, wait. Let me recheck state 1: all +1, E = -3J. State 8: all -1, E= -3J as well, since S1S2=1, etc
