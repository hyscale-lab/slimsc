Okay, so I have this question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition is a nucleophilic addition to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Right, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, forming an enolate intermediate. I think the reaction is important in organic chemistry, especially in synthesis.

Looking at the question, there are three different Michael addition reactions, and I need to find the major products for each. The options are given as A, B, C, etc. Let's break them down one by one.

First reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base, so it's probably deprotonating something to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. Its structure is like CH2(CO2Me)2. When deprotonated, the enolate would attack the β position of the other carbonyl.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, the substituent is at the 3 position. So, maybe it's more like CH2-C(O)OCH2CH3 with a p-tolyl group attached to the β position? Wait, no, the compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3. The 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon? Wait, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCO2R, right? So the 3-position is the next carbon, which is the middle one. So E-configuration implies that the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite.

So the structure would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-CO2Me? Or maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me? No, wait, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, C3 has the CO2Me group. Hmm, maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the p-tolyl group is on the third carbon, which would be the same as the COOCH3 group. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, that's an acrylate ester, so the ester group is OCH3 attached to the carbonyl. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH2CH3? No, wait
