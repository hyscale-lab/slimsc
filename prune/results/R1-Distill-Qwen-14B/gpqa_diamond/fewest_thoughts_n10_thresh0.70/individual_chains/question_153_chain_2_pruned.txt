Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The question gives three different reactions and asks about the products. The options are A, B, C, D, each providing possible products for each reaction.

Let's break down each part.

First reaction:
Reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). The product is labeled as A.

I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking a β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, the nucleophile is usually a conjugate base, like an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. The base NaOEt would deprotonate the malonate. The enolate would then attack the β position of the other carbonyl compound.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: I think it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH- group attached to the p-tolyl. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the substituent on the beta position? Or perhaps it's (E)-CH2-C(CO-OCH3)=CH-p-tolyl? Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the third carbon, which is the same as the alpha to the COO group. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, wait,
