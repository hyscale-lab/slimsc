Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D, with some numbers around 9 to 10 Angstroms.

First, I remember that the interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is given by the formula derived from the structure factor, right? The general formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + ... some terms involving the angles ... ). Wait, I think for a cubic system, it's simpler because angles are 90 degrees, but this is a rhombohedral system where all angles are equal and not 90.

Hmm, right, the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral crystal is a bit more complicated. I think the formula involves the unit cell parameters and the Miller indices. Let me try to recall. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a special case where a = b = c (the lattice constants are equal) and all angles are equal (but not 90 degrees). So the interplanar distance formula for any (hkl) plane is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) )

Wait, but wait, I think in rhombohedral systems, the angles are all the same, so α = β = γ. So cos α = cos β = cos γ. That might simplify things.

In this problem, a is the lattice parameter, which I think is given as the interatomic distance. Wait, wait, no. Wait a second. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, but in a crystal, the interatomic distance depends on the structure. For example, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance 'd' is equal to the lattice parameter 'a' because each atom is at the corner and the edge length is the same as the distance between adjacent atoms. But in a rhombohedral
