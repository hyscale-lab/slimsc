Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to identify a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let's see. I remember that IR can tell me about functional groups, and NMR gives info about the structure, like substituents and their positions.

First, looking at the IR data. There are medium to strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. Wait, amide groups have N-H stretches in that area, maybe around 3300-3500. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl group. Could be an amide or an ester or maybe a ketone, but considering the formula, probably something with an amide or ester.

Now the NMR. Let's break it down. The 1H NMR peaks are:
- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's probably a methyl group attached to something, like an ethyl group. The triplet (t) suggests two neighboring protons, so maybe CH2CH3. Like in an ethyl group.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for two protons. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like NH in an amide, or maybe an OCH2 group. But the integration is 2H, so perhaps adjacent to an electronegative atom.
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet. Quadruplet usually comes from being adjacent to a CH2 group. Like in an ethyl ester. For example, OCH2CH2 might split into a quartet if the neighboring group is something like CH2CH3. Wait, but wait, the 4.5 ppm is a quartet, so maybe it's an OCH2 attached to another CH2. Like in an ester group, OCH2CH3. But wait, the ethyl group is at 1.2 ppm as a triplet. So maybe the ethyl is part of an ester or an ether.

Looking at the aromatic protons: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons on each adjacent carbon would each be a doublet. So maybe the ring has substituents in the para positions, leading to two doublets each integrating to 2H. So this suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring.

Now the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation: Each double bond or ring is one. So (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 =10/2=5. So five degrees: probably a benzene ring (3) and an amide group (maybe one more for the carbonyl, and another for the ring). Wait, benzene has three degrees, amide has a carbonyl (another), and the amide NH would be another? Or maybe the carbonyl and the ring. Hmm, maybe.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. But the NMR shows a para-substituted benzene. Because if substituents are in positions 3 and something else, then the aromatic protons wouldn't be two doublets each with 2H. Wait, in 3-ethoxybenzamide, the substituents are at 3 and the amide is at another position? Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Wait, benzamide is typically PhCONH2. So if it's 3-ethoxy, then the substituents would be at positions 3 and 1? Or maybe the ethoxy is at position 3, and the amide at position 1. But that would create a meta substitution, not para. So the aromatic protons wouldn't split into two doublets of 2H. So maybe this option is not correct.

Option B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH-... So structure would be O=CH-NH-O-C2H5 attached to a benzene ring. Wait, no: formamide is HCONHR, so in this case, R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the structure would be HCONH-(4-OCH2CH3)Ph. The
