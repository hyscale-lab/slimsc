Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Grubbs catalyst reactions, but I remember it's used for olefin metathesis. Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal catalyst, usually for breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. Oh wait, olefin metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. So when Grubbs is used, it causes the alkene to break and then recombine in different ways.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, wait. Let me draw the structure. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have a double bond starting at C1. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait no, pent means five carbons. Let me count. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the pent chain is five carbons, with a double bond starting at C1. Then the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. If it's 3-methyl, that means on the third carbon, which is the middle carbon in pent-1-ene, there's a methyl group. So the structure should be CH2=CH-C(CH3)(CH2CH3)? No, wait. Let me see: the formula is C5H10 for pent-1-ene, but wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the formula C6H12? No, wait, no. Wait, the formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, pent-1-ene has five carbons in the chain, with the double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. But 3-methyl would add a
