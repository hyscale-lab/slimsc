Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry.

Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it incorporates all possible interactions that are consistent with the underlying symmetries of the Standard Model. So the operators in SMEFT should respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model, right?

Wait, what do I know about these symmetries?

Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. The Standard Model definitely respects this, so SMEFT operators must too. So option 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh wait, but Poincare symmetry is actually broader than Lorentz. Because Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincare. So if you have Poincare, you have Lorentz. But wait, do SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare? Because the theory is formulated in a way that's invariant under Poincare. But wait, SMEFT is an effective theory where you're considering all possible operators with higher dimension. The theory itself is Lorentz invariant because the Standard Model is, so all the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. But does that mean they must also respect Poincare? I'm not so sure. Because Poincare includes translations, but SMEFT is a theory with a cutoff scale, so maybe they're not considering it as a full translation-invariant theory? Or perhaps Poincare is automatically satisfied if Lorentz and other symmetries are. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Wait, Poincare includes the Poincare group, which includes Lorentz transformations and translations. Since the SM respects Poincare, SMEFT operators must also respect it. Because any operator that doesn't would break the symmetry, which isn't allowed. So both 1 and 2 are correct. But wait, the question is which must be respected by all operators. So maybe I need to think about what each symmetry entails.

Alternatively, maybe SMEFT is constructed under the assumption of Lorentz symmetry, and it's formulated in a Lorentz-invariant framework. So all operators are Lorentz scalars. But I'm not sure about Poincare. Wait, since the SM respects Poincare, and SMEFT is an extension, it should respect it as well. So maybe both 1 and 2 are required.

Wait, but the options are 1,2,4 in option C. But I'm not sure yet about CP and CPT.

CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation and parity. The SM isn't CP-symmetric, because processes like kaon oscillations violate CP. But wait, the question is about what the operators must respect. So in SMEFT, do the operators have to be CP-even? Or can they have terms that break CP?

Wait, the Standard Model doesn't have a CP symmetry that's exact. For example, the CKM matrix has CP violation. So if the SMEFT is an effective theory that includes the SM, then if the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, then SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP. So maybe the operators don't need to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 would not be correct.

CPT symmetry, on the other hand, is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, including the SM. I think all operators in a QFT must respect CPT symmetry. Because CPT is required for the theory to have a consistent S-matrix and unitarity. So SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

So putting it all together: which symmetries must all operators respect?

1. Lorentz Symmetry: yes.

2. Poincare Symmetry: since Lorentz is part of Poincare, and the SM respects Poincare, then SMEFT must also respect it. So 2 is correct.

3. CP symmetry: not necessarily, since the SM already has CP violation, so SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. So 3 is incorrect.

4. CPT symmetry: yes.

So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but earlier I thought about Poincare. I'm trying to remember if Poincare symmetry is automatically respected if Lorentz symmetry is. Because Poincare includes translations. But in an effective theory, are we considering the operators to be invariant under translations? Because operators are local, so they should be. Because translation invariance is part of the Poincare group. So yes, all operators must be Poincare-invariant, which includes Lorentz and translation invariance.

Wait, but the question says which must be respected by all operators. So if an operator doesn't respect Poincare, it's not part of the theory. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the SMEFT doesn't require Poincare, but I think it's a given because the SM respects it.

So the correct answer is options 1,2,4, which is option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory that incorporates all possible interactions consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry involves invariance under Lorentz transformations, such as rotations and boosts. Since the Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, SMEFT operators must also respect it. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry is required.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since the Standard Model respects Poincaré symmetry, SMEFT operators must also respect it. While Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincaré symmetry, the full Poincaré symmetry is required for consistency with the Standard Model. Thus, Poincaré symmetry is also required.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The Standard Model does not respect CP symmetry due to phenomena like kaon oscillations and CP violation in the CKM matrix. Since SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model, it does not require operators to respect CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not necessarily required.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). This symmetry is fundamental in quantum field theory and is required for the consistency of the S-matrix and unitarity. Since SMEFT is a quantum field theory, all operators must respect CPT symmetry. Thus, CPT symmetry is required.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
