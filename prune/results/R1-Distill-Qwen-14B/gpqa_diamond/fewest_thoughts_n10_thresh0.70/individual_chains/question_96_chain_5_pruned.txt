Okay, so I've got this problem about a supermassive black hole and its entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the black hole's entropy.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, and the constants are Planck's h, gravitational constant G, Boltzmann's k, and so on. Maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Oh right, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). But since we're dealing with order of magnitude, perhaps I can use the simpler version where S is proportional to the area of the event horizon.

So first, I need to find the radius of the event horizon, R. The event horizon's radius is given by the Schwarzschild radius, R_s = 2 G M / c^2. But wait, I don't have the mass M yet. Alternatively, since I have the angular size and the distance, maybe I can find R using the small angle approximation.

The small angle approximation says that θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the opposite side over the hypotenuse. So θ ≈ R / d. Oh, because the event horizon is at a distance d, and its size is R, so the angle is R/d in radians.

Wait, but θ is given in degrees. So I need to convert that to radians first. The conversion factor is π radians = 180 degrees. So θ in radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180).

Let me calculate that. θ_deg is 1e-17, so θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * (π/180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So using θ ≈ R/d, R ≈ θ_rad * d.

d is 1e10 parsecs. Hmm, what's a parsec in meters? I think 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 *
