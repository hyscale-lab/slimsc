Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. I need to find the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the reaction: X reacts with liquid Y. Violent reactions often imply something reactive, like a metal reacting with an acid. Maybe Y is water or an acid. Let's think about the products. Gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, for a molecule, the total neutrons and protons must be equal. Wait, let me think. Each molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, for example, hydrogen has one proton and zero neutrons, but that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe it's a molecule of a diatomic gas. Let me think of possible diatomic gases with same n and p per molecule.

Wait, perhaps gas W is H2O? No, because H2O has molecules with 10 protons (each H has 1, O has 8) and 8 neutrons (assuming O is ^16O, which has 8 neutrons). So protons (10) and neutrons (8) are not equal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe W is CH4? No, because that's not a diatomic gas. Alternatively, what about CO2? No, same issue. Alternatively, maybe it's H2. Wait, H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. So not equal. What about O2? O2 has 16 protons (each O has 8, times two). Neutrons: 8 each in ^16O, so 16 total. So 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That works! So W is O2.
