Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll go through it step by step.

So the question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is about 277 K, which is close to 0 degrees Celsius. Wait, no, 277 K is actually around 4 degrees Celsius. I remember that water freezes at 273 K (0Â°C), so 277 is just a bit above that. So B might be something that's solid at that temperature, like maybe ice isn't it? Or perhaps another compound.

The product of a keto acid reacting with Substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms. I'm not entirely sure about that part. Keto acid could be something like acetic acid, which has a carboxylic group and a ketone group. But maybe that's a red herring for now.

The first part is about the reaction. Let's think about the reaction between substance X and liquid Y. They react violently and produce a gas W. The gas has the same number of neutrons and protons in each molecule. That suggests that the molecule is either H2O, NH3, CO2, or something where the total protons and neutrons are equal. Wait
