Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see. It's about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures, masses, and orbital periods. I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the planet's distance from its star and its albedo. Oh wait, the problem says albedo is the same for all three, so that should simplify things a bit.

The question gives me the ratios of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 as 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 as 2.3. Also, the mass ratios are given: Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. I need to find the factor by which Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's.

Wait, so the equilibrium temperature formula is something like T = T_star * (L / (16πσd²))^(1/4). Oh wait, no, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature (Te) is given by the formula Te = T_eff * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^0.25. Oh wait, no, wait, another version: the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis, assuming a circular orbit. So Te is proportional to (L/(16πσd²))^(1/4), but L is the star's luminosity, which I think can be considered constant here since all planets orbit the same star.

Wait, but in this problem, the temperature ratios are given between the planets. So for Planet1 and Planet2, Te1/Te2 = 1.4. Similarly, Te2/Te3 = 2.3. Oh wait, wait, the question says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So I need to be careful about which way the ratio is taken.

Wait, let me think: If Planet1's Te is 1.4 times Planet2's, then Te1 = 1.4 * Te2. Similarly, Te2 is 2.3 times Te3, so Te2 = 2.3 * Te3. So combining these, Te1 = 1.4 * 2.3 * Te3 = 3.22 * Te3. So Te1 is about 3.22 times Te3. Wait, but I'm not sure if I need the individual temperatures, or just the ratios to find the semi-major axes.

Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is (assuming a circular orbit and no greenhouse effects):

Te = ( ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d² ) )^(1/4 )

Where a is the albedo, L is the star's luminosity, d is the semi-major axis (distance from star), and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since L and σ and a are the same for all three planets, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (distance from star). So, Te ∝ 1 / sqrt(d). So the square of the ratio of temperatures would be inversely proportional to the ratio of the distances.

Wait, let me think again. Let's denote d1, d2, d3 as the semi-major axes of Planet1, Planet2, Planet3.

So, Te1 / Te2 = sqrt( d2 / d1 ). Because since Te ∝ 1/sqrt(d), then Te1/Te2 = (d2/d1)^(1/2). Is that right?

Wait, no. Because if Te is proportional to 1/sqrt(d), then Te1/Te2 = (d2/d1)^(1/2). Let me check: if d1 < d2, then Te1 > Te2 because as distance increases, temperature decreases. Yes, that makes sense. So the ratio Te1/Te2 equals sqrt( d2 / d1 ).

Given that Te1/Te2 is 1.4, so 1.4 = sqrt( d2 / d1 ). Squaring both sides, (1.4)^2 = d2/d1. 1.4 squared is 1.96, so d2 = 1.96 * d1.

Similarly, Te2/Te3 is 2.3. So 2.3 = sqrt(d3/d2). Squaring gives (2.3)^2 = d3/d2. 2.3 squared is 5.29, so d3 = 5.29 * d2.

But since d2 = 1.96 * d1, substituting that into d3 gives d3 = 5.29 * 1.96 * d1. Let me compute that: 5.29 * 1.96. Let's see, 5 * 2 is 10, but exact calculation: 5.29 * 1.96. 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 *1.96 is about 0.5684, so total is 9.8 + 0.5684 = 10.3684. So d3 = approx 10.3684 * d1.

So the semi-major axis of Planet3 is about 10.368 times that of Planet1. So the ratio d3/d1 is about 10.368.

But the question asks for the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. For that, I need to use Kepler's third law. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So (P3/P1)^2 = (d3/d1)^3.

So P3/P1 = sqrt( (d3/d1)^3 ). Given d3/d1 is about 10.368, so cube that: 10.368^3.

Wait, let me compute 10^3 is 1000, but 10.368 is a bit more than 10. Let me think: 10.368^3 = (10 + 0.368)^3. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 10.368^3.

Compute 10.368 × 10.368 first. 10 ×10 is 100, 10 ×0.368 is 3.68, 0.368 ×10 is 3.68, and 0.368 ×0.368 is about 0.135424. So adding all these cross terms:

(10 + 0.368)^2 = 10² + 2*10*0.368 + 0.368² = 100 + 7.36 + 0.135424 = 107.495424.

So 10.368^3 = 10.368 × 107.495424. Let me compute that.

10 × 107.495424 = 1074.95424.

0.368 × 107.495424 ≈ 0.3 * 107.495 is ~32.2485, plus 0.068 *107.495 ≈7.293. So total is approx 32.2485 +7.293=39.5415. So total cube is 1074.95424 +39.5415 ≈ 1114.4957.

So P3/P1 = sqrt(1114.4957) ≈ sqrt(1114.5). Let me find the square root of 1114.5.

I know that 33^2 is 1089, 34^2 is 1156. So sqrt(1114.5) is between 33 and 34. Let's compute 33.4^2: 33^2 is 1089, 0.4^2 is 0.16, and 2*33*0.4=26.4. So 33.4^2 = (33 +0.4)^2= 33² + 2*33*0.4 + 0.4² = 1089 + 26.4 +0.16= 1115.56. Hmm, our number is 1114.5, which is very close to 33.4^2=1115.56. So sqrt(1114.5) is approximately 33.38, let's say about 33.38.

So the period ratio P3/P1 is approximately 33.38. So looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So the answer should be D.

Wait a moment—did I account for all the factors correctly? Let me double-check.

We started with the temperature ratios:

Te1/Te2 = 1.4 => sqrt(d2/d1) = 1.4 => d2/d1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96.

Te2/Te3 = 2.3 => sqrt(d3/d2) = 2.3 => d3/d2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29.

So d3 =5.29 * d2 =5.29 *1.96 *d1 ≈10.368*d1.

So P3/P1 = sqrt( (d3/d1)^3 ) = sqrt( (10.368)^3 )= sqrt(1114.495)≈33.38.

Yes, that seems correct.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the given temperature and distance relationships, along with Kepler's third law.

### Step 1: Relating equilibrium temperatures to distances
The equilibrium temperature \( T_e \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis \( d \), i.e., \( T_e \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}} \). This implies:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{d_2}{d_1}}, \quad \frac{T_{e2}}{T_{e3}} = \sqrt{\frac{d_3}{d_2}}.
\]

From the problem:
- \( \frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = 1.4 \), so \( \sqrt{\frac{d_2}{d_1}} = 1.4 \). Squaring gives \( \frac{d_2}{d_1} = 1.96 \), or \( d_2 = 1.96 \, d_1 \).
- \( \frac{T_{e2}}{T_{e3}} = 2.3 \), so \( \sqrt{\frac{d_3}{d_2}} = 2.3 \). Squaring gives \( \frac{d_3}{d_2} = 5.29 \), or \( d_3 = 5.29 \, d_2 \).

Substituting \( d_2 = 1.96 \, d_1 \) into \( d_3 = 5.29 \, d_2 \), we find:

\[
d_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 \, d_1 \approx 10.368 \, d_1.
\]

Thus, the semi-major axis of Planet3 is approximately \( 10.368 \) times that of Planet1.

### Step 2: Using Kepler's third law
Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:

\[
\left(\frac{P_3}{P_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{d_3}{d_1}\right)^3.
\]

Substituting \( \frac{d_3}{d_1} = 10.368 \), we calculate:

\[
\left(\frac{P_3}{P_1}\right)^2 = (10.368)^3.
\]

First, compute \( (10.368)^3 \):
\[
10.368^3 = 10.368 \times 10.368 \times 10.368 \approx 1114.5.
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \sqrt{1114.5} \approx 33.38.
\]

### Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.
