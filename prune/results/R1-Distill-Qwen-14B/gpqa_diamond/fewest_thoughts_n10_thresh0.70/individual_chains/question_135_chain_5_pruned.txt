Alright, so I've got this question about particle physics and decay modes of a boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Okay, the problem states that the interaction Lagrangian is given by L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I think this is similar to the Yukawa interaction term. Typically, Yukawa couplings are between fermions and bosons, like in the Higgs mechanism. So the boson X is interacting with fermions here.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to figure out which fermion pairs X can decay into.

First, kinematically allowed means the energy has to be enough to produce the particles, right? So the mass of X (6 GeV) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion for each decay channel. Because in decay processes, the rest mass of the parent must be equal to or larger than the sum of the rest masses of the decay products (if any).

But wait, do I know the masses of all the fermions? Let me recall:

- Up and down quarks are the lightest. Their masses are around a few MeV. But in particle physics, when considering decay products, we often neglect their masses because they're so light compared to GeV scales. So even though X is 6 GeV, it can decay into uū or dđ because their masses are negligible.

- The strange quark is heavier, around 100 MeV. So X's mass of 6 GeV is way more than 200 MeV, so sŝ decay is allowed.

- The charm quark is about 1.5 GeV. So 2*m_c = 3 GeV. Since 6 GeV > 3 GeV, cđ is allowed.

- Bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. 2*m_b is around 9 GeV. Oh wait, X's mass is 6 GeV, which is less than 9 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar. So any option including b or antibb would be incorrect.

Wait, but wait—do I have to consider the mass of the fermions? Because in the decay X → f f̄, each fermion f must have mass such that 2m_f ≤ m_X. So for each possible fermion, check if 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

Let me list the fermion masses:

- Up quark (u): ~2.2 MeV → negligible
- Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV → negligible
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV → 2m_s ≈ 190 MeV < 6 GeV → allowed
- Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV → 2m_c ≈ 2.54 GeV <6 → allowed
- Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV → 2m_b ~8.2-9.4 GeV >6 → Not allowed
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV. So 2m_t is way over. So X can't decay into t t̄.

Leptons:

- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV → allowed
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV → 2m_mu ≈ 211 MeV <6 → allowed
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV → 2m_tau ≈3.56 GeV <6
