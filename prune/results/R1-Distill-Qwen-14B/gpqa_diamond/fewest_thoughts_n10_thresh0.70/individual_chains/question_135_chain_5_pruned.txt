Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the decay modes of a boson, X, which has a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction is given by this Lagrangian term: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that correctly.

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as -λ f ψ_f (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f (y). So it's a Yukawa-like interaction, I think. The boson X couples to fermions, and the coupling term is proportional to λ times (upsilon + X). But wait, upsilon is usually a constant, like the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the scalar field in the Higgs mechanism. So maybe the term is (v + X) ψ ψ, which would imply that X is a scalar boson, like the Higgs. 

But wait, in the standard model, the Higgs couples to fermions via terms like y ψ ψ h, where h is the Higgs field. So this Lagrangian looks similar. So the interaction term for X is similar to the Higgs coupling. So the decay of X would involve X annihilating into a pair of fermions, like a fermion and its anti-fermion.

So the question is asking about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. Kinematically allowed means that the decay products' rest masses must be less than half the mass of X. Because each fermion and anti-fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to the mass of X.

Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. So for each possible fermion pair, I need to check if 2m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV.

So, which fermions have masses less than 3 GeV? Because 2m_f < 6 GeV → m_f < 3 GeV.

Let me list the known fermion masses. I think:

- Up and down quarks are the lightest. Their
