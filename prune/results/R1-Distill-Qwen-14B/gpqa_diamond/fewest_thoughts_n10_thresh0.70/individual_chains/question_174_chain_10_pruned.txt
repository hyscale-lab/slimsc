Okay, I'm trying to tackle this physics problem. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about atomic nuclei fission and the kinetic energy of the fragments. Hmm, atomic fission, so splitting a nucleus into two parts. I remember that in fission, a heavy nucleus like uranium splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a lot of energy.

The nucleus is initially at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is given as 300 GeV. Wait, 300 GeV is a huge amount of energy. But when it fissions, it splits into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. Oh, right, the more massive one has a rest mass twice the other.

Wait, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. So the initial mass M is 300 GeV/c²? But wait, the rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. So M c² = 300 GeV. Oh, right, in units where c=1, it's 300 GeV, but when dealing with mass, it's M = 300 GeV/c². But perhaps for calculations, we can treat energy and mass as related by E=Mc².

So the total rest mass after fission is 0.99 M. So the sum of the masses of the two fragments is 0.99 M. And the more massive fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let me denote the less massive fragment as m, so the other is 2m. So m + 2m =0.99 M => 3m =0.99 M => m=0.33 M. So the two fragments have masses 0.33 M and 0.66 M. Wait, because 0.33 + 0.66 is 0.99 M.

Wait, but the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum after fission must be zero, because momentum is conserved. So the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

So their kinetic energies plus their rest mass energies should account for the total energy. Before fission, the nucleus had energy M c², which is 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum
