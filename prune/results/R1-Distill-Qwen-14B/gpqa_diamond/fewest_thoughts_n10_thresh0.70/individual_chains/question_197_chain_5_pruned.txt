Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about identifying a compound X and then determining what product it forms when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A, B, C, D, which are all different organic compounds. I'll start by analyzing the given spectroscopic data.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks given are in the regions: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. 

The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 cm-1 suggests the presence of either an -OH group (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid) or an =NH group (for amines). But since the 1720 cm-1 peak is present, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, that makes me think of either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. 

Wait, carboxylic acids have a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm-1, which is a broad peak. So the IR shows a strong O-H? Let me think. The 3400–2500 cm-1 is a broad region, which might include an O-H stretch. Alternatively, another possibility is an alcohol, but the 1720 cm-1 is more likely a carbonyl. But carboxylic acids have their carbonyl around 1700 cm-1, so 1720 might be a bit higher. Maybe it's an ester or a ketone? Hmm.

Wait, 1720 could also be an ester. Alternatively, maybe a ketone, but the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm. That's a strong indicator of an aldehyde proton (RCHO), but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But it's broad, so maybe it's an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid. Because in the case of a carboxylic acid, the -OH is broad and around 10-12 ppm. So that might support the idea of a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but wait. Let's think again. If it were an aldehyde, the NMR would show a singlet around 9-10, but also the IR would have a peak around 2800 for the aldehyde C-H stretch. But the IR here shows a broad peak from 3400 to 2500, which could be O-H. So perhaps it's a car
