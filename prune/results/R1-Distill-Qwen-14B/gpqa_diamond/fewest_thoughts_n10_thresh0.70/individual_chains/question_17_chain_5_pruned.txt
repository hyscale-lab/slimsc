Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a certain concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The solution has 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, so I guess that means we don't have to worry about other factors like hydrolysis or anything. And the temperature is 25°C, which probably is just to remind us that K values are given at that temperature. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct concentration of Ca²+ ions.

Wait, so I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand, the stability constant (K) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formula for the stability constant is usually written as:

M^n+ + L^m- ↔ ML

And the K would be [ML]/([M][L]).

In this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is formed. So the reaction would be:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

Wait, actually, I think EDTA is usually in the form of H4Y, the acid form. But under certain pH conditions, it can lose protons and become Y^4-. So when Ca²+ complexes with EDTA, the reaction is:

Ca²+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY²-

And the stability constant K is given as 5e10, which is a pretty large number, meaning the complex is very stable.

So the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote that as [CaY²-] = 0.02 M. Because it's a 1:1 complex, the stoichiometry is 1 Ca²+ to 1 EDTA^4-.

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and I can assume that the dissociation is minimal because K is so large. But wait, the problem says that the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex, so I think that the [CaY
