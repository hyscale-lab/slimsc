Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. I've heard about these kinds of complexes before, where a metal ion binds with a ligand. 

Right, so the Ca-EDTA complex is formed when calcium ions (Ca²+) bind with EDTA^4- ions. The formation constant, K, tells us how stable the complex is. A higher K means a more stable complex, so the ions are more likely to form the complex rather than stay free in solution.

The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca²+] in the solution. Since the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio, the formula for the complex would be something like CaEDTA^2- or similar. Wait, no, the stoichiometry is 1:1, so each Ca²+ binds with one EDTA^4- to form CaEDTA^2-.

I remember that the formation constant K is given by the formula K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So if we have the concentration of the complex, which is 0.02 M, we can set up the equation.

Wait, but what about the concentrations of Ca
