Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution from my studies. Let me think this through.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Oh wait, I think the excitation here refers to the number of atoms in a specific higher energy level compared to a lower one. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation relates the populations of different energy levels in a gas in thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann distribution formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-(E_i - E_j)/(k*T)). Here, n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j, g is the statistical weights, and E is the energy. Since the problem states the energy difference, I can assume E_i - E_j is the given 1.38e-23 J. Also, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited, so I'm guessing that n_i (excited state) is twice n_j (ground state) for star_1, and perhaps a different ratio for star_2. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify star_2's ratio, only that star_1 is twice excited. Hmm, perhaps I'm supposed to compare the two stars.

Wait, no—the problem states that the energy difference is the same for both stars. Oh no, wait, no, the problem says the energy difference between the considered energy levels is approximately 1.38e-23 J for both stars. So the same ΔE applies to both.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let me denote for each star:

For star 1: n1_i / n1_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-(ΔE)/(k*T1))
For star 2: n2_i / n2_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-(ΔE)/(k*T2))

But the problem says that in star_1, the excited atoms are twice as much as in star_2. Wait no. Let me read again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the ratio is n1_i/n1_j = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j)? Or wait, maybe n1_i = 2 * n2_i? Or is it that the excitation is twice as much as in star_2's atoms. Hmm, perhaps the ratio n_i/n_j for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So I think for star_1, (n_i)/(n_j) is twice star_2's ratio.

Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited." Maybe that means the excitation level is twice, so the population ratio is twice. So for star_1, (n_i)/(n_j) = 2 * (n_i')/(n_j'), where n_i' is for star_2.

But let me clarify. Let's say that in star_2, n_i/n_j is x, then in star
