Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's read it carefully.

So the question involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride has specific NMR spectra. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products (major and minor), both with the molecular formula C13H16O3.

The key point is the NOESY NMR spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't, or has a weak one. I need to figure out which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, the starting material: a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When it dehydrates, it forms an anhydride. The structure of the anhydride is probably a cyclic one since dehydration typically forms cyclic anhydrides.

The anhydride's NMR data:
- 1H NMR: single peak at 7 ppm. That usually suggests a carbonyl group, maybe an aromatic ring, but wait, the 1H NMR is 1H? Wait, no, the 1H spectrum has a single peak (7 ppm). Wait, no, wait, the question says the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. Hmm, maybe it's an aromatic proton. But wait, if the compound is an anhydride, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride. Let's think about the structure.

Wait, a dicarboxylic acid when dehydrated forms an anhydride. For example, if the acid is HOOC-(CH2)n-CH2-COOH, but wait, the acid has a cis-alkene. So maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that would have a single bond. Wait, no, the acid has a cis alkene. So perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, that's all single bonds. Oh wait, the acid is a di-carboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So perhaps it's like
