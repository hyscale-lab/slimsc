Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the mean free path of gas molecules in an electron microscope. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

So the setup is Mike designing a high-res transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. The goal is to minimize gas molecules to improve electron microscopy because fewer gas particles mean less scattering and better image quality.

But even after creating this vacuum, some gas particles are still present, as detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path depends on things like the pressure, temperature, and volume of the compartment. 

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. Instead of being λ1, it's now λ2. But the temperature remained the same, so that shouldn't affect it. The question is, what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1?

The options are A to D. Let's think about what affects the mean free path. The mean free path (λ) is given by the formula λ = 1/(n * π * d²), where n is the number density of the gas molecules, and d is the average diameter of the molecules. Alternatively, another way to write it is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d²*P), but I might be mixing up the exact formula. Wait, maybe it's more accurate to recall that the mean free path can also be expressed in terms of pressure and temperature. Oh right, the formula is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2 * P), but I'm not super confident about that. Alternatively, another formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), where P is the pressure. Or perhaps it's λ = (1)/(n * π * d²), and n is the number density, which is P/(k*T) from the ideal gas law. So combining these, λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d² * P). 

Wait, maybe another approach. The mean free path is inversely proportional to the pressure and proportional to the temperature. Because at higher pressure, there are more molecules per unit volume, so the mean free path is shorter. If temperature increases, molecules move faster, so they have more kinetic energy, which might lead to longer mean free paths because they move further before colliding. But in this case, the temperature is the same as before, so if anything changes, it must be the pressure.

Wait, but in the scenario, Mike's setup has an ultra-high vacuum, and when the electron beam is initiated, what happens? The presence of the electron beam might cause some effects. Oh, like heating the sample perhaps? But the question says the sample compartment temperature remained the same. So if temperature is the same, then any change in the mean free path must be due to another factor.

Wait, the mean free path is λ1 before the electron beam is on. When the beam is on, he measures λ2. So what could change the mean free path? If the pressure changes, that would affect
