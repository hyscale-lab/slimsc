Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2's. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. They found through spectroscopy that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies and asks by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. So I need to find the temperatures of both stars to compute their luminosities.

Wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh! That's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I remember that the peak wavelength is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.8977719×10^-3 m·K).

If both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same, right? Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2. Oh, that's helpful because then when I calculate the luminosity ratio, the T terms will be the same and can be canceled out.

Wait a second, but the question talks about radial velocities. Oh, right! Radial velocity can affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Because Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, its observed wavelength might be different. But wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So does this mean that after considering the Doppler shift, their peak wavelengths are the same?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The peak emission from each star is observed at the same wavelength. So for Star_1 and Star_2, their observed λ_max is the same.

But wait, if a star is moving towards us or away from us (non-zero radial velocity), its emitted wavelengths are shifted. So the actual emitted peak wavelength (λ_emitted) is different from the observed λ_observed. So for Star_1, it's stationary (radial velocity 0), so λ1_emitted = λ_max. For Star_2, it's moving with a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So its observed λ2_observed is same as λ1_emitted, which is the same as λ_max.

Wait, but what's the direction? If Star_2 is moving towards us, its light would be blueshifted; if moving away, redshifted. But since the problem states that
