Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy and redshifts. Hmm, I remember that redshift is related to how much the universe has expanded since the light was emitted. The question is about detecting clouds of neutral hydrogen using optical telescopes, and it involves the Lyman alpha wavelength.

Wait, Lyman alpha is a specific emission line of hydrogen. I think the rest wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. Oh right, because hydrogen's first Balmer series line is in UV. But wait, Lyman alpha is the transition from n=2 to n=1, so it's in the far ultraviolet, right?

So the problem says these clouds absorb light from background quasars at that wavelength. But optical telescopes can't observe UV light from the ground because the atmosphere absorbs it. So if the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is redshifted into the optical range, then the quasar itself must be at a high redshift.

Wait no, the question is about the clouds. The neutral hydrogen clouds absorb the quasar's light. So the quasar emits light, and some of it is absorbed by the hydrogen. The Lyman alpha absorption line would appear at a longer wavelength (redshifted) if the cloud is moving away or if the universe has expanded since the light passed through the cloud.

So for the absorption line to be in the optical range (which is what ground-based telescopes can see), the wavelength must be redshifted into optical. The original Lyman alpha is 1216 Angstroms, which is about 0.1216 micrometers. Optical wavelengths are roughly 0.4 to 0.7 micrometers. So we're looking for how much redshift is needed to bring the Lyman alpha line into the optical.

Let me think about the redshift formula. The observed wavelength lambda_obs is equal to lambda_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. So to find the lower limit on the redshift, we need the Lyman alpha to be at the lower end of optical, maybe around 400 nm (which is 0.4 micrometers) or higher.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the clouds are detected because they absorb quasar light at Lyman alpha. So the quasar must be even more distant than the cloud, right? Or perhaps the cloud is between us and the quasar. So the quasar's light passes through the cloud, and the cloud imprints an absorption line on the quasar's spectrum.

So the quasar's light is redshifted, but the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is at a different redshift. Wait, no, the cloud's hydrogen is causing the absorption, so the absorption line's redshift tells us about the cloud's velocity or distance.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. Suppose the quasar is at redshift z_q. The cloud is at redshift z_c. The light from the quasar passes through the cloud, which is at a lower redshift than the quasar. So the quasar's light has been redshifted more than the cloud's.

So the Lyman alpha absorption line from the cloud would be at a wavelength longer than the quasar's own emission line, but both are in the observed frame.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let's focus on the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption. The cloud's Lyman alpha is at 1216 Angstroms, but when observed, it's shifted. So for it to be in the optical range, lambda_obs must be greater than or equal to about 4000 Angstroms (0.4 micrometers), right?

Wait, no, optical wavelengths are about 4000 Angstroms (violet) up to 7000 Angstroms (red). So if the Lyman alpha line is observed at, say, 4000 Angstroms, that would be a redshift of (4000/1216) -1. Let me calculate that.

4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29. So 3.29 -1 = 2.29. So the redshift would be about 2.3. If the observed wavelength is longer, the redshift is higher.

But wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift such that the object can be detected with optical telescopes. So the lower limit is when the Lyman alpha line is just entering the optical range. So the minimum redshift is when lambda_obs is 4000 Angstroms (or 400 nm).

So z = (4000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29. So approximately 2.3. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is close. Hmm, but wait, why is option D 1.9? Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me compute it precisely.

4000 / 1216 = ?

1216 * 3 = 3648

4000 -3648=352.

So 3 + (352/1216) ≈ 3 + 0.289 ≈ 3.289.

So z = 3.289 -1 = 2.289. So approximately 2.29. So option C is 2.4, which is a bit higher than that. But if the optical range is up to 700 nm, perhaps the lower limit is when lambda_obs is 4000, but perhaps the question allows a bit more. Wait, but the question is about the lower limit, the minimum z that brings the line into the optical.

So the minimum z is when lambda_obs is just 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). So that's about 2.29. The options are C)2.4 and D)1.9. Hmm, 2.29 is between 2 and 2.4.

Wait, maybe I should think about the quasar's emission. Oh wait, the quasar emits light, which is then absorbed by the cloud. So the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud, right? Because the cloud is in front of the quasar from our perspective, so the quasar's light has a higher redshift than the cloud's absorption line.

Wait, but in this case, the question is about the cloud's redshift. So the cloud's own redshift must be such that the Lyman alpha line is observed in optical. So the cloud's redshift is z_c, so the observed wavelength is lambda_c = 1216 * (1 + z_c) Angstroms.

We want lambda_c >= 4000 Angstroms, so 1 + z_c >= 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29 → z_c >= 2.29. So the lower limit is z_c ≈2.29, so about 2.3. So the closest answer is option C)2.4, but 2.29 is closer to 2.3.

Hmm, but the options don't have 2.3, but option C is 2.4. So perhaps my calculation is correct but perhaps I should think if the quasar's own emission affects it.

Wait, another thought: the quasar's light is redshifted as well. So the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So perhaps the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. But for the cloud's Lyman alpha line to be observed in the optical, it's the cloud's redshift that matters, not the quasar's.

So, regardless of the quasar's redshift, the cloud must have a redshift such that 1216*(1 + z_c) >= 4000 Angstroms. So z_c >= (4000/1216 )-1
