Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me think. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab. The options are A to D, and I have to pick the right one.

Wait, I remember that in special relativity, when objects move at high speeds, the speed of light remains constant in all inertial frames. But wait, is that only for vacuum? Or does it apply to different media too? Oh, right, in a medium, the speed of light is c/n, but when the medium itself is moving, does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, the medium's motion shouldn't affect the speed of light as measured in the lab frame. Because according to Einstein's postulate of special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the observer's motion. But what about in a medium? Like, if a medium is moving, does that change the measured speed of light in that medium? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the glass isn't a vacuum. So in the glass, the speed of light is v_glass = c/n. But when the glass is moving, does that affect this speed as observed in the lab? I think I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't simply add up. Oh, right, velocity addition formula. So maybe
