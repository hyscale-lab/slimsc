Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits.

The RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines is periodic and depends on the planet's mass and orbital period.

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes 7 milliangstroms. We're supposed to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I think is something like the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1/(1 - eÂ²))^(1/2). But since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that simplifies part of it.

Wait, but maybe for this problem, there's a simpler relation. I recall that the Doppler shift (or the semi-amplitude K) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Because the same method is used for both stars, and the stars have the same mass, perhaps the ratio of the shifts can be used to find the ratio of periods.

Wait, the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/1) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star) )) ) * (1/( (1 + ... ) )). Wait, maybe this is getting complicated. Let me think again. Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ), but I'm not sure about the exponents.

Wait, the formula for the RV
