Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics and how its properties change when it has dark spots. The main question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels and how this ratio changes when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't.

Hmm, let me jot down the given data:

- Star radius: 1.5 solar radii
- Star mass: 1.1 solar masses
- When no spots, Teff (effective temperature) is 6000 K.
- When 40% of surface is covered by spots, Teff drops to 5500 K.

The question focuses on the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). This ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2, right? Because when the ratio decreases, it means n1/n2 is getting smaller when spots are present. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in two energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is given by:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- g1 and g2 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of levels 1 and 2.
- E2 is the energy of level 2, E1 of level 1.
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

Wait, but in the problem, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. So that's the emission or absorption line we are considering. The energy difference between the two levels can be calculated from this wavelength.

The energy difference ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is speed of light.

But wait, the exact value might not be needed because perhaps it will cancel out in the ratio. Let me think about that.

So, when the star doesn't have spots, T is 6000 K, and when it has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K. But wait, the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So does that mean that the temperature of the photosphere (the region we're looking at) is 5500 K when spots are present?

Wait, maybe I should clarify: when the star has spots, 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots. But the overall effective temperature is 5500 K. So how does that affect the temperature in the photosphere of the unspotted regions?

Wait, perhaps the spots are cooler, so the overall average temperature is lower. But for the photosphere in the unspotted
