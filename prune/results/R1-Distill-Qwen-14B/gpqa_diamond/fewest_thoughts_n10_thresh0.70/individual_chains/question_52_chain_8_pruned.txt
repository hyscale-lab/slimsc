Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again and see what it's about.

So, the question involves a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spot-free compared to when it has spots.

Hmm. So, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. That probably means that when the spots are present, the ratio is lower, so when they're not, the ratio is higher. So the factor would be the ratio of (spot-free ratio)/(ratio with spots) = factor.

And the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Oh, that's in the ultraviolet range, I think. But maybe that's just a red herring unless it's relevant to the calculation.

The problem mentions that the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), which is a standard assumption in stellar atmosphere modeling. So I can use the Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations in two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights and E's are the energies. Alternatively, since E = hc/λ, the energy difference can be written using the wavelength.

Wait, wait. Let me get that right. The energy difference ΔE between the two levels is given by ΔE = hc/λ. So, ΔE = hc/(1448 Å). But wait, 1448 Å is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1.448e-7 meters. Let me compute that but maybe I don't need the exact value.

So the ratio of the populations is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Since when the spots are present, the overall T_eff is lower, the exponent will be larger (because T is smaller, so 1/T is larger), making the exponential term smaller. So n2/n1 would be smaller, which would mean the ratio decreases when T decreases. That's consistent with the problem statement.

But wait, in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So when there are spots, the effective temperature is lower. The question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2. Let me define R as the ratio (n1/n2) or (n2/n1)? The question says the ratio of the number of
