Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer. So I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, in a vacuum, the speed of light is always c, right? But here it's in glass. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n. So in the glass, when it's stationary, the speed is 1/n since c is given as 1.

But wait, the glass is moving. How does that affect the speed measured in the lab? I remember something about relative velocity here. So if the medium is moving, I think it's about adding velocities. But wait, special relativity says that velocities don't just add linearly. Oh wait, but maybe in this case, since the speed is not close to c, we can use the classical addition formula.

Wait, no, because the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, wait—that’s only in a vacuum. Wait, no, that's a confusion. The speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. So relativity says c is the speed limit, but when you're in a medium, the light's speed is different.

Wait, but the problem is about the speed of the light as seen by the observer in the lab. So maybe we have to consider the motion of the glass and how it affects the light's speed.

Let me think in terms of reference frames. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. Inside the glass, the light is moving at 1/n. So in the glass's frame, the light's speed is 1/n. But how does that translate to the lab frame?

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to model it. So in the glass frame, the light is moving at velocity u' = 1/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. Since the glass is moving at v in the lab frame, I need to find the velocity u of the light as observed in the lab.

Using the classical velocity addition formula: u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²). But wait, c is 1 here, so it's u = (u' + v
