Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about the luminosities of two stars. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 * M2. Interesting, same scaling factor for both radius and mass. But wait, the question is about luminosity, so maybe the mass comes into play elsewhere, like if we need to relate it to temperature or something else.

The astronomers found the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a star's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2. Interesting, so both stars are at the same temperature.

Wait, but the mass and radius are different. So perhaps that's a clue for something else, maybe their luminosity? Let me think about luminosity. I remember the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says Luminosity L is proportional to R² * T^4. So L = 4π R² σ T^4. So the luminosity depends on the radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

Since both stars have the same T, the ratio of their luminosities would then be (R1/R2)^2. Because the T terms cancel out (since T1=T2). So R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 would be about 2.25 times L2. But wait, that's only according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, assuming blackbody radiation and same T.

But wait, the problem says that the astronomers calculated the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a certain factor considering that they radiate as blackbodies. So the initial calculation would suggest a factor of ~2.25, which is
