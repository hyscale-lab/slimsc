Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 and Star_2. The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 M2.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength. I remember from my studies that this relates to the star's temperature. The peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So, if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both have the same λ_max, their temperatures are equal. So T1 = T2.

Now the next part: the radial velocities of the stars are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So Star_1 isn't moving towards or away from us (radial velocity zero), while Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. Wait, but how does radial velocity affect the measured wavelength? Oh, that's the Doppler effect. So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted), but wait, the problem states that their λ_max as observed is the same. Hmm, but the question says that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So Star_2's light, due to Doppler shift, would have its peak wavelength changed. But the problem says the observed λ_max is the same for both. So that must imply that the actual emission from Star_2 is shifted. Wait, but the problem says the astronomers found that the wavelengths they appeared brightest are the same. So maybe when they observed Star_2, they accounted for the Doppler shift. Or perhaps the given velocities are the actual velocities, and the observed λ_max is same, so the intrinsic temperatures must have a certain relation. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's see.

Wait, the stars are radiating as black bodies. So using the black body radiation formula, their luminosities depend on their radius, temperature, and other factors. The formula I remember is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where L is luminosity, R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed wavelengths where the stars are brightest are the same. But each star emits its own spectrum, which might have a different λ_max based on their temperature. But when observed, their λ_max
