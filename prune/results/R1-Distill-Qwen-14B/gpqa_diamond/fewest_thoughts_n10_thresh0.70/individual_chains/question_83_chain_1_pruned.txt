Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take my time to think it through.

The problem is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I have to calculate both values and match them with the options.

First, let's read the problem again carefully.

We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH.

I need to find two pH values: at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Let me break this down into parts.

Part 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are Molarity × Volume. So, 0.05 M × 0.020 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume doubles to 40 cm³ (0.040 L). So the new concentration is moles / volume, which is 0.001 / 0.040 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, let me check: 20 cm³ each, so total 40 cm³. Yeah, that seems right. So the concentration halves because the volume doubles. So yes, 0.025 M.

Part 2: Determine what happens during titration.

The titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. NaOH is a strong base, so it will react completely with the acetic acid, which is a weak acid.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of CH3COOH initially present.

But first, let's find out the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.

Moles of CH3COOH initially after dilution: 0.025 M × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, so Volume (L) = moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, the question asks for pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point volume, which is 2.5 cm³ (since 10 × 0.25 = 2.5).

Let me tackle the 25% point first.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added. Let's find the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

Since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, the moles of CH3COOH and CH3COO^- (from sodium acetate) can be determined.

Initially, after dilution, moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 mol.

Moles reacted = 0.00025 mol, so remaining CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- produced = 0.00025 mol.

The total volume of the solution is the initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Now, since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.
