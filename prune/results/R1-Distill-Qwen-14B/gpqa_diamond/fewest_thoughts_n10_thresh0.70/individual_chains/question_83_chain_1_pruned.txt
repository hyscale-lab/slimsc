Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me read what's given. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which we dilute with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay, first, I think I should figure out the dilution of the acetic acid. Since we're mixing equal volumes, the concentration should be halved, right? Because when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes with the ratio of the volumes. So if it's 20 cm³ of 0.05 M and we add 20 cm³ water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (20/40) * 0.05 M, which is 0.025 M. Wait, correct? Yeah, because M1V1 = M2V2, assuming volumes are additive.

So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, the reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base), producing acetate (CH3COO⁻) and water.

The first part is the pH at 25% titration. Wait, 25% of what? Oh, I think it's 25% of the equivalence point. So we need to find how much NaOH is added when 25% of the acetic acid has reacted.

Wait, but to find that, I should calculate the equivalence point volume first. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

So, moles of acetic acid initially: Molarity * Volume (in liters). The diluted solution is 0.025 M and 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M, which is 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. Then we dilute it to 40 cm³, so the moles remain the same, but the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, as I thought earlier.

So, for equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed are same as moles of acetic acid. Moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol. The concentration is 0.1 M. So volume V = moles / conc = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

So 25% of the equivalence point would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Because 25% of 10 is 2.5.

Okay, but wait, how does that help me find the pH at 25% titration? Because at 25% titration, only 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized, so the rest is still in solution.

So, let's model the solution at this point.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol.

At 25% titration, NaOH added is
