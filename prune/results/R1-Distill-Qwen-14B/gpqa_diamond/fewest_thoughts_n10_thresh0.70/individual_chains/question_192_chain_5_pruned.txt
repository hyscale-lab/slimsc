Alright, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Okay, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both L and l are larger than R, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember something about conductors and charges. When a conductor is neutral, any enclosed charge would redistribute in a certain way. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, I think the presence of the charge inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, right. For a conductor enclosing a charge, the inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to the enclosed charge, and the outer surface will have no charge because the conductor as a whole is neutral. Or wait, the conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on the outer surface must be zero. But the inner surface would have an induced charge -q, because the conductor's material must counteract the internal charge.

So, the conductor itself remains neutral overall. The inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance it? No, wait. Wait, if the conductor is initially uncharged, the total induced charges should cancel, but the way it works is that the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q to make the total charge zero. Or wait, no, because the conductor's total charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. Because the conductor as a whole is neutral, so the sum of inner and outer charges must be zero. So outer charge is +q, and inner is -q. So total is zero.

But wait, the conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on the conductor is zero. The cavity has +q, so by Gauss's law, the inner surface must have -q. Then, the outer surface must have +
