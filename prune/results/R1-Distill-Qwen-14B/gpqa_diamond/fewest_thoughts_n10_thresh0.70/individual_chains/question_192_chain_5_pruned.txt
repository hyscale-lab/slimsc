Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields around a conducting sphere with a cavity. Hmm, let's see. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. 

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is offset by a distance s from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone places a small positive charge +q somewhere inside the cavity. 

The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so I'm trying to find E at a point outside the conductor. I remember that the electric field outside a conductor depends on the total enclosed charge. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. Once the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, what happens? Oh right, in a conductor, the charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was neutral, so when a charge is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's charges will adjust.

Wait, but in a spherical cavity inside a conductor, charges on the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity side) will induce a charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. So the inner surface has -q and the outer surface must have +q to balance the total charge (since the conductor was neutral, the total charge is zero, but the cavity has +q, so conductor must have -q and then the outer surface has +q? Or wait, wait, no. Wait, the conductor was uncharged, so when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) must have an induced charge of -q. Then, the conductor as a whole must have +q on the outer surface because the total charge of the conductor is (inner charge) + (outer charge) = (-q) + (outer charge). Since the conductor was neutral,
