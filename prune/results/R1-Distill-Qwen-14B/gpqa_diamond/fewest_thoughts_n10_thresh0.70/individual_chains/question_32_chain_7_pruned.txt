Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The question says the speed is 0.96c, and the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So normally, lithium has 3 protons. If it's Li-6, that's 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 6. Or wait, maybe it's Li with 3 neutrons, so the isotope is Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 6.

The question is about finding the energy of the RHIC. I remember that in particle accelerators, the kinetic energy is important, but sometimes when they talk about the energy, they refer to the total energy, including rest mass. Wait, no, wait. In high-energy physics, particles are often accelerated to relativistic speeds, so their total energy (gamma * m*c²) is what's important. But I'm not totally sure if the question is asking for kinetic energy or total energy. The problem statement says "energy of the RHIC so that the speed..." So, probably, the total energy because that's what accelerators typically specify.

So, the nucleus is moving at v = 0.96c. Let's think about how to find the energy. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute that.

v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Then sqrt(0.0784) is sqrt(0.0784) — wait, what's the square of 0.28? 0.28² is 0.0784. Yes, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me do that calculation more accurately. 0.96^2 is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784: Let me think, 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, so yes, sqrt is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, so its mass is approximately the mass number times the mass of a nucleon. But wait, the exact mass would be the atomic mass, considering binding energy. However,
