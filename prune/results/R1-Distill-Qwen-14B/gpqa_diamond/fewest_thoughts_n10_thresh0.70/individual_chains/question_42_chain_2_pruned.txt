Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were found using the TTV method. The given data includes the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. We need to find by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's, given that all have the same albedo of 0.3.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = [ (L*(1 - a) ) / (16 * π^2 * D^2 * σ) ) ]^(1/4), but wait, maybe a simpler version. Oh right, another way: The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. Because more distance means less flux, so lower temperature.

Wait, the formula I think is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)), where T_star is the star's temperature, R_star its radius, and D the planet's orbital distance. But since the star's T and R are the same for all planets, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures should depend on the inverse square root of their distances.

So, T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). But wait, the problem gives the ratio of T1 to T2 as approximately 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. So 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1), meaning D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 is about 1.96 times D1.

Wait no, if T1 is larger than T2, that would mean D2 is larger than D1, because T ∝ 1/sqrt(D). So if T1 is higher, D1 is smaller. So T1 > T2 → D1 < D2.

But the problem says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. So using the formula, since T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), (T1/T2) = sqrt(D2/D1).
