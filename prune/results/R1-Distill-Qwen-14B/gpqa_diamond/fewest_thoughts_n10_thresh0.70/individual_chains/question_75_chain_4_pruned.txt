Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem, and I need to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The scenario is about creating a transgenic mouse model for the GADD45G protein. The goal is to study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They’re using a plasmid with an inducible overexpression system, inserting a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with the plasmid using Lipofectamine, and selected resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn’t overexpressed as expected.

The problem is about figuring out why the protein isn't being expressed. Looking at the options, they have to do with things like mutations, translation termination, proteolysis, or tRNA availability.

The sequence provided is the plus strand of the construct. Let me analyze the sequence to see if there's an issue.

First, I should check if the reading frame is correct. The HA tag is added at the N-terminus, so the HA coding sequence should be at the beginning. The GADD45G coding sequence should follow.

Let me look for any in-frame stop codons. Remember, stop codons are UAA, UAG, UGA. Since the sequence is given as DNA, I need to look for the complementary sequences.

Wait, the given sequence is the plus strand. So the mRNA would be the same as the coding (non-template) strand. Let me scan through the sequence for any triplet that would code for a stop codon.

Looking through the sequence:

I'll break it down into triplets:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GC... etc.

Wait, the first codon is ATG, which is methionine, start. Next is TAC (tyrosine). Then CCA (proline). Then TAC again (tyrosine). GAT (aspartic acid). GTT (valine). CCA (proline). GAT (aspartic acid). TAC (tyrosine). GCC (alanine). AAA (lysine). Then comes TGA.

Wait a second, TGA is a stop codon. So in the coding sequence, the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA, and then TGA.

So the DNA sequence has TGA at position ... let me see, the 19th, 20th, 21st bases after the start. So for mRNA, it's AUG UAC CCA UAC GAU etc., and then UAA (since TGA on DNA is complementary to mRNA's UAC, wait no, wait: DNA is TGA, so mRNA is UAC, which is the start of the next codon. Wait, no, wait, DNA
