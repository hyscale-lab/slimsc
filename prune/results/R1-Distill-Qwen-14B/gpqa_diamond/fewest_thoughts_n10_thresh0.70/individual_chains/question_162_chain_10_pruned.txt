Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me think through this.

Alright, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's in terms of x and y. I remember that metrics describe the geometry of spacetime, and when we're dealing with surfaces, the area can be found using the metric.

So, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh wait, pseudosphere is a term I've heard before. Isn't it like a surface with constant negative curvature? Right, in hyperbolic geometry. Also, in some contexts, like in the context of the metric given, this might represent a 2-dimensional hyperbolic space.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere is a specific kind of surface, but here, the metric seems to be for a 2-dimensional space embedded in some higher-dimensional space? Or perhaps it's a model of hyperbolic space.

Wait, the metric given looks like it's in 2D, since it's written in terms of dx² + dy². So maybe the space is 2-dimensional hyperbolic space with this metric. So, in that case, the area would be related to the volume of hyperbolic space, but since it's a 2D space, it's the area.

Wait, but the question says pseudosphere. Oh wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, but in 3D, right? Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Or perhaps in 2D, the term is used differently.

Wait, the metric given is for a 2D space. The area element in a metric is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. So for a 2D metric, the area element dA would be sqrt(det g) dx dy.

So the metric here is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the components of the metric tensor g_11 = g_22 = 32/(4 -x² - y²), and the off-diagonal terms g_12 and g_21 are zero. So the determinant would be (g_11 * g_22) since it's diagonal. So determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

So the area element dA would be sqrt(det g) dx dy, which is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. Wait, no, because determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]², so square root is [32/(4 - x² - y²)], right?

So the area would be the integral of dA over all x and y where the metric is defined. So the region where the denominator is positive, because otherwise the metric would be singular or imaginary. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² <4.

Wait, so the domain is all points (x,y) where x² + y^2 <4. That's a circle of radius 2. So integrating over this disk.

So the area A is the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, let me change to polar coordinates because of the circular symmetry. So x² + y² = r², so dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The integral becomes ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the θ integral is straightforward. The 2π comes out. So A = 2π ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the radial integral. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → - (du)/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [32/(u)] * (-du/2). The negative flips the limits, so it becomes ∫ from 0 to4 (32/(u)) (du/2) → 16 ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to4.

Wait, but 1/u from 0 to4 is divergent. Because as u approaches 0, the integral goes to infinity. So that integral would be 16 [ln u] from 0 to4. Ln 4 is finite, ln 0 is -infinity. So 16 (ln 4 - (-infty)) → 16 (finite + infty) → infinity.

Wait, so the area is infinite. Because even though the region is a finite disk of radius 2, the area element blows up at r=2. Because when r approaches 2, 4 -r² approaches zero, so the area element [32/(4 -r²)] r dr dθ becomes very large. So the integral diverges.

So the area is infinite. Looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer should be D.

But wait, the question says 'pseudosphere of radius r=2.' Wait, I thought pseudosphere is a surface with finite area but infinite volume or something, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the metric describes a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. Because the hyperbolic plane is a surface with constant negative curvature and has infinite area.

Wait, yes. In hyperbolic geometry, the hyperbolic plane has infinite area. So if the metric given is for a
