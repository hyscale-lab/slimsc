Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reactions. I need to figure out what the products are for each of the three reactions given. There are three parts: A, B, and C, and each has different reactants. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products for A, B, and C.

First, I should probably start by recalling what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves the attack of a nucleophile (usually an enolate) on an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. So the enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the beta position of the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl, leading to a conjugate addition.

So, looking at the first reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base. In EtOH, which is a protic solvent. So NaOEt would deprotonate the malonate to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH, I think. Its structure is CH2(COOCH3)2. So the enolate would form at the central carbon, which is a good nucleophile.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. That structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent at the end being p-tolyl. Wait, wait. Wait, the acrylate is 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, wait. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(O-OCH3)-p-tolyl. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. So the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the p-tolyl attached to the third carbon? Wait, maybe it's more like CH2=CH-C(O-p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the structure here. Let me draw it mentally: the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the COO is attached to another group. Wait, no. The correct structure would be the acrylate being CH2=CH-C(O-)-OCH3. But where is the p-tol
