Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the diffraction pattern created by a polygonal aperture. Hmm, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern, right? The pattern depends on the shape of the aperture. But wait, in this case, the aperture is a regular N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. 

The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Oh right, when N is very large, the polygon becomes almost like a circle, but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, if all apothems are the same, maybe it's more like a circular aperture? Because as N increases, a regular polygon tends to a circle. But wait, no, a polygon with all apothems the same is a regular polygon, yeah.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot with minima at certain angles. The first minima for a circular aperture occurs at an angle θ given by a formula involving the wavelength λ and the aperture radius a. The formula I remember is sinθ = λ/(π a), which gives θ ≈ λ/(π a) for small angles because sinθ ≈ θ.

But wait, in this problem, the aperture is a regular N-gon, and N is approaching infinity. So maybe in the limit, it behaves similarly to a circular aperture. But wait, maybe not, because the apothems are all length 'a'.
