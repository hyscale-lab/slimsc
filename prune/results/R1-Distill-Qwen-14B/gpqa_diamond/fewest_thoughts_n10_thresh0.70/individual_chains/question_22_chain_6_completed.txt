Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about oxygen acting as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions, both thermodynamically and kinetically. Hmm, I remember that in electrochemistry, the thermodynamic aspect relates to whether a reaction is favorable (spontaneous) or not, while kinetics deals with how fast the reaction occurs.

The question says: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions. The options are about whether it's stronger or weaker, and faster or slower.

Wait, I think I remember something about the strength of oxidizing agents in different solutions. In basic solutions, maybe the concentration of OH- ions affects the activity. Oh right, the standard reduction potential for O2 in basic solution is higher than in acidic. So O2 is a stronger oxidizing agent in basic conditions. Because in basic, the reaction would be O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH-, which has a higher E° than in acidic, where it's O2 + 4H+ +4e- → 2H2O, but the E° is lower because in acidic, the solution is more H+ rich, and maybe the reaction is less favorable. Wait, no, actually, the standard E for O2 in basic is about 0.401 V, and in acidic it's around 1.23 V. Oh wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because in acidic solution, O2 is a stronger oxidizing agent than in basic. Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, no, the standard hydrogen electrode is 0 V. The standard reduction potential for O2 in acidic is higher. Let me think: in acidic solution, the reduction potential is higher, meaning it's a stronger oxidizing agent. So, in acidic, O2 is a stronger oxidant. But wait, the question says, in basic solution, thermodynamically. So if O2 is a stronger oxidant in basic, that would be the first part. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, maybe I should look at the Nernst equation. The thermodynamic favorability depends on the standard potentials. Let me think: in basic solution, the reaction would involve OH- ions. The standard reduction potential for O2 in basic is around 0.401 V, while in acidic solution, it's about 1.23 V. Wait, no, that can't be right because in acidic conditions, the O2 reaction is more favorable. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, here's the thing: the standard reduction potential for O2 to H2O in acidic is higher than in basic. So in acidic, O2 is a stronger oxidizing agent. So thermodynamically, O2 is a stronger oxidant in acidic than in basic. But wait, the question says, thermodynamically, oxygen is a ... oxidant in basic solutions. So perhaps in basic, O2 is a stronger oxidant than in acidic. But that can't be right because the E° in acidic is higher. So maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about the actual reactions. In acidic solution, the O2 reduction is: O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O. The standard E° for this is about 1.23 V. In basic solution, the reaction is O2 + 2H2O +4e- →4OH- , with E° around 0.401 V. So the E° for acidic is higher. So that means in acidic solution, O2 is a stronger oxidizing agent (since higher E° means more tendency to be reduced). Therefore, thermodynamically, O2 is a stronger oxidant in acidic solution than in basic. So if the first part of the question says, in basic solutions, O2 is a stronger oxidant— that would be incorrect. Wait, but the question says, in basic solutions, O2 is a ….. oxidant. So the first blank would be 'weaker' because its E° is lower. So thermodynamically, in basic, O2 is a weaker oxidant than in acidic.

So that would make the first part weaker. But let me think again. Because when comparing oxidizing strength, higher E° means stronger oxidant. So in basic, E° is 0.401 V, in acidic, 1.23 V. So in basic, O2 is a weaker oxidant than in acidic.

So the first part is: thermodynamically, O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions.

Wait, but the question says, 'thermodynamically, oxygen is a ….. oxidant in basic solutions.' So if in basic, O2 is weaker, then the first blank is filled with 'weaker'.

Now, the second part is about kinetics. Kinetically, how does O2 react in acidic solutions? Kinetics relates to the rate of reaction. The rate depends on activation energy and factors like concentration, temperature, and catalysts.

In acidic solution, the reaction of O2 (as an oxidant) would proceed faster if the conditions favor lower activation energy. But I'm not sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction in acidic conditions is more kinetically favorable because of the presence of H+ ions which can act as catalysts or facilitate electron transfer.

Wait, but another angle: the rate of the reaction can be influenced by the pH. In acidic solution, H+ ions are more available. The reaction O2 + 4H+ +4e- → 2H2O has H+ involved. So in acidic solution, the concentration of H+ is higher, which might increase the rate. Or maybe the reaction is more likely to proceed because the necessary ions are present in higher concentration.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction in basic solution is slower because the solution is less likely to have the right ions to facilitate the reaction quickly. Or perhaps the reaction in acidic solution is faster because H+ is a better proton donor, making the reaction proceed more quickly.

Wait, but I remember that the rate of O2 reactions can be influenced by the presence of catalysts or the solution's pH. For example, in acidic solutions, the reaction might proceed faster because the H+ ions can help stabilize intermediates or facilitate electron transfer steps.

So putting it together, the first part is 'weaker' (since E° in basic is lower) and the second part is 'faster' (because in acidic, the reaction occurs kinetically more rapidly).

Wait, but wait. The question says, kinetically, oxygen reacts ... in acidic solutions. So in acidic, does it react faster or slower?

Alternatively, I'm mixing up the terms. If the solution is acidic, perhaps the reaction is kinetically faster. So in acidic solutions, the reaction of O2 is faster than in basic.

So the combination would be: weaker oxidant in basic (so first blank is 'weaker'), and in acidic, reacts faster (so second blank is 'faster').

So looking at the options:

Option C: weaker – faster

Option B: stronger – slower.

Wait, no. Let me see. The first part is about basic solutions. So the first blank is weaker. The second part is about acidic solutions; the second blank is faster.

So the options: looking for weaker and faster.

Looking at the options:

A) stronger – faster → no.

B) stronger – slower → no.

C) weaker – faster → yes.

D) weaker – slower → no.

So the correct option is C) weaker – faster.


The question involves analyzing the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions, both thermodynamically and kinetically. 

1. **Thermodynamic Analysis**:  
   The standard reduction potential for oxygen in acidic solution (O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O) is approximately 1.23 V, while in basic solution (O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻), it is approximately 0.401 V. Since the reduction potential is higher in acidic solution, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions. Therefore, in basic solutions, oxygen is a **weaker oxidant** thermodynamically.

2. **Kinetic Analysis**:  
   Kinetics depends on factors like concentration, activation energy, and the presence of ions that facilitate electron transfer. In acidic solutions, the higher concentration of H⁺ ions can stabilize intermediates and reduce activation energy, making the reaction proceed faster. Thus, oxygen reacts **faster** kinetically in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions.

Combining these observations, the correct combination is **weaker** (thermodynamic behavior in basic solutions) and **faster** (kinetic behavior in acidic solutions). 

The correct answer is:  
Answer: C
