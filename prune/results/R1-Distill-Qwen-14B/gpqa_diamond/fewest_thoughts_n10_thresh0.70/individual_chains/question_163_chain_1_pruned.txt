Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says: We want to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this and also determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D with different pH values and volumes.

Hmm, right. I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide. So when it reacts with an acid, it should undergo a neutralization reaction. The acid is monobasic, which means it donates one H+ ion per molecule. Monobasic strong acids are like hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid isn't because it's dibasic but concentrated as a strong acid, but I think in this case, it's probably a monobasic one like HCl.

So the reaction would be:
Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe³+ + 3 H2O

Wait, let me write that properly. Fe(OH)3 is a trihydroxide, so when it reacts with a strong acid, each OH⁻ will react with H+ to form water. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 will need 3 moles of H+ ions.

First, I'll need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 are in 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is... let's calculate that. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16, and Hydrogen (H) is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). So:

Fe: 55.85 g/mol
Each OH: 16 + 1 =17 g/mol, so 3 OHs is 51 g/mol.
Total molar mass = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let me calculate that more accurately.

0.1 divided by 106.85: 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.00093597 mol. So approximately 0.000936 mol.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ because each OH- gives one H+, and there are 3 OH- per formula unit. So the H+ needed is 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

But wait, the acid is monobasic and strong, so each mole of acid provides one mole of H+. So the moles of acid needed would be 0.002808 mol.

The concentration of the acid is 0.1 M, which means 0.1 moles per liter. Wait, 100 cm³ is 0.1 liters, but the volume is part of the total solution. So we're adding some volume of acid to 100 cm³. Wait, the question is about the minimum volume of acid needed, so perhaps the total volume after adding the acid is considered, but maybe not necessary right now.

So the volume of
