Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think step by step.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking for which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

From what I remember, EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) is a mutagen that primarily causes point mutations, usually substitutions. These can result in missense mutations (changing an amino acid) or nonsense mutations (stop codons). The question is about which mutation in the target gene would eliminate the compound. I'm thinking this would happen if the gene product (the protein) is altered in a way that either disrupts its function or reduces its production.

Looking at the gene sequences provided:

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA.

The mutants have changes in the first exon area. So the first exon is the beginning part of the gene. Exons are the coding regions, so any mutations here could affect the protein product.

Let's look at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA.

Comparing to the intact gene, let's see where the changes are.

Looking at the first part: Intact is ATGTTTCTC... Mutant1 is ATGTTCTAC... So the change is from T to C in the second T, making it TTCTAC instead of TTCTCG. Wait, let me count the letters:

Intact: positions 1-10: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG...

Wait, perhaps a better way is to align the sequences. Let me see:

Intact: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...-3’

Mutant1: 5’-ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA...-3’

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compare each nucleotide:

Looking at the first part:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Wait, maybe it's better to count each position. Let me see:

Looking at the first 20 nucleotides:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC

So comparing:

Intact: positions
