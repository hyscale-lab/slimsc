Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let me see what it's about. Alright, it's about particles moving at ultra-relativistic velocities and reaching the inner walls of a detector. Hmm.

So the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types and decay quickly. They move at a high Lorentz factor, around 20 on average. Now, on average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters. The question is, what Lorentz factor do we need so that about two-thirds reach the walls?

Hmm. Wait, I think I need to relate the Lorentz factor to how far the particles travel before decaying. Oh right! Because the particles are fast-decaying, their lifetime is such that they might not travel far enough to reach the detector walls unless their speed is just right.

I remember that the proper lifetime of a particle is gamma times the lab frame lifetime. Or wait, maybe the other way around. The proper time is the time measured in the particle's rest frame. In the lab frame, time is dilated by gamma. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime.

The distance a particle travels before decaying is v multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame. So distance = v * gamma * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but v is approximately c for ultra-relativistic particles. So we can take v ≈ c. So distance ≈ c * gamma * tau.

But wait, the problem says that on average, one third of the particles reach the detector walls. So when gamma is 20, only 1/3 reach the wall. We need to find a gamma where 2/3 reach the wall.

Wait, but why does the fraction change? I think it has to do with the decay length. The decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So if the decay length is longer than the detector radius, more particles will reach the walls. Or is it the opposite? Wait, no. If the decay length is longer, the particles live longer and are more likely to reach the walls. So for a given detector radius, if the decay length is equal to the radius, some fraction of the particles would reach the wall. If the decay length is shorter than the radius, few would reach, and if longer, more would.

But in the problem, when gamma is 20, one third reach. We need to find a gamma where two-thirds reach. So that suggests we need a higher gamma because higher gamma means longer decay length (since decay length is proportional to gamma). So more particles would reach the walls.

Let me think about the formula again. The decay length L is c multiplied by gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime tau. So L = gamma * c * tau.

Wait, but in the problem, the detector's radius is 30 meters. So when L is equal to the detector's radius R (30 meters), what fraction of particles reach the walls? Hmm. Wait, particles are created at the center, and they move in random directions. The maximum distance any particle can travel in any direction and still reach the wall is R. So if L (the decay length) is much smaller than R, very few particles would reach the wall. If L is about equal to R, then when a particle is moving directly away from the center, towards the wall, it has a higher chance to reach the wall. Whereas if it's moving in another direction, the path is longer. Wait, no, the distance to the wall depends on the angle. The maximum distance a particle can travel in any direction is R. Wait, but the particles are emitted isotropically, I assume. So the decay occurs in any direction, and the probability that a particle reaches the wall depends on whether L is longer than the distance from the center to the wall in that direction.

Hmm, maybe I should model this as a geometric probability. The probability P that a particle reaches the wall is the probability that its decay length L is greater than the distance from the origin to the point where it was emitted, but wait, no. Wait, the particles are created at the center, so the distance to the wall is 30 meters in any direction. So for a particle to reach the wall, it must decay after traveling at least 30 meters. So if L (decay length) is greater than 30 meters, then the particle will reach the wall. If L is less than 30 meters, it won't.

Wait, wait, no, because in reality, particles are emitted in all directions. If the decay length is greater than 30 meters, then particles moving in any direction will have a chance to reach the wall. But wait, the decay length is the average distance traveled before decaying. So if L is greater than R, then the probability that a particle reaches the wall is the probability that it doesn't decay before traveling 30 meters. Since the decay is exponential, the probability that it hasn't decayed after traveling 30 meters is exp(-30 / L).

Wait, so the probability P that a particle hasn't decayed when it would have traveled a distance R is P = exp(-R / L).

But since L is gamma * c * tau, R is 30 meters. So:

P = exp(- R / (gamma c tau)).

Wait, but in the problem statement, when gamma is 20, the average is that one third reach the walls. So for gamma = 20, P = 1/3.

So 1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * tau)).

Wait, but wait, I should write it properly. Let's find R in terms of L.

But perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me think step by step.

Let me denote:

- R = 30 meters (detector radius)
- gamma0 = 20 (initial Lorentz factor)
- P0 = 1/3 (fraction reaching wall at gamma0)
- gamma = ? (new Lorentz factor where P = 2/3)
- L = gamma * c * tau (decay length)
- P = probability of reaching the wall = exp(-R / L) ???

Wait, let's think about the decay process. The decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle has not decayed after traveling a distance x is exp(-x/L). So for x = R =30 m, the probability is exp(-30 / L).

But wait, the problem says that at gamma0=20, the probability is 1/3. So:

1/3 = exp( -30 / (gamma0 * c tau) )

Similarly, for the new gamma, gamma, we have:

2/3 = exp( -30 / (gamma * c tau) )

Wait, but what's the relation between gamma and gamma0? Because gamma0 and gamma are two different Lorentz factors.

Wait, but the proper lifetime tau is the same for both cases. Because tau is the lifetime in the rest frame, and the problem is comparing two different gamma factors.

So for gamma0=20:

1/3 = exp( -30 / (20 * c tau) )

For gamma:

2/3 = exp( -30 / (gamma * c tau) )

Let me take the natural log of both sides.

ln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau) → ln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau)

Similarly, ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma c tau)

Wait, but I can write the ratio between the two.

From first equation:

30/(20 c tau) = - ln(1/3) → 30/(20 c tau) = ln(3) → because ln(1/3) is -ln(3), so taking negative.

So 30/(20 c tau) = ln(3) → c tau = 30/(20 ln(3)) → c tau = (3)/(2 ln(3)).

Similarly, from the second equation:

30/(gamma c tau) = - ln(2/3) → since ln(2/3) is negative, so:

30/(gamma c tau) = ln(3/2)

Wait, ln(2/3) is negative, so -ln(2/3) is ln(3/2).

So 30/(gamma c tau) = ln(3/2) → gamma c tau = 30/( ln(3/2) )

But from the first part, c tau = 3/( 2 ln 3 )

So substituting back:

gamma * [3/(2 ln3)] = 30/( ln(3/2) )

Let me compute:

gamma = [30/( ln(3/2)) ] / [3/(2 ln3) ) ] = [30 * 2 ln3 ] / [ 3 * ln(3/2) ) ]

Simplify:

gamma = (60 ln3) / (3 ln(3/2)) ) → 20 * ( ln3 ) / ( ln(3/2) )

Hmm, let me compute ln(3) and ln(3/2). Let me remember that ln(3/2) = ln3 - ln2 ≈ 1.0986 - 0.6931 ≈ 0.4055.

ln3 is about 1.0986.

So gamma ≈ 20 * (1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ 20 * (2.708) → approx 20 * 2.708 = 54.16.

Wait, that's approximately 54. So looking at the options, option A is 54.

But let me think again. Because the initial setup when gamma is 20, the probability is 1/3, and when gamma increases, the probability increases as well because decay length increases.

Wait, so when gamma is 54, the probability is 2/3. That seems correct.

Wait, let me double-check the equations.

We have:

For gamma0=20: 1/3 = exp(-30/(gamma0 * c tau))

So ln(1/3) = -30/(gamma0 c tau)

So 30/(gamma0 c tau) = ln3 → 30/(20 c tau) = ln3 → c tau = 30/(20 ln3) = 3/(2 ln3). Correct.

Then for gamma:

2/3 = exp(-30/(gamma c tau)) → ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma c tau) → 30/(gamma c tau) = ln(3/2).

So,

gamma = 30/( ln(3/2) ) * (1/c tau) )

But c tau is 3/(2 ln3), so:

gamma = [30/(ln(3/2)) ] * (2 ln3 ) /3.

Simplify:

gamma = (30 * 2 ln3 ) / (3 ln(3/2) )

30/3=10, 2/1=2 → 10 * 2=20.

So 20 * ln3 / ln(3/2).

Compute ln3 ≈1.0986, ln(3/2)=0.4055.

So 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈2.708.

Multiply by 20 → 54.16.

So the correct gamma is approximately 54, which is option A.


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, decay length, and the probability of reaching the walls.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Decay Length and Probability**:  
   The decay length \( L \) is proportional to the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   L = \gamma \cdot c \cdot \tau
   \]  
   where \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle. The probability \( P \) that a particle reaches the detector walls (radius \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \)) is given by:  
   \[
   P = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{L}\right) = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{\gamma \cdot c \cdot \tau}\right)
   \]

2. **Given Information**:  
   - At \( \gamma_0 = 20 \), \( P_0 = \frac{1}{3} \).  
   - We need to find \( \gamma \) such that \( P = \frac{2}{3} \).

3. **Solve for \( \gamma \)**:  
   Using the exponential relationship, we take the natural logarithm of \( P \):  
   \[
   \ln(P) = -\frac{R}{\gamma \cdot c \cdot \tau}
   \]  
   For \( \gamma_0 = 20 \):  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{20 \cdot c \cdot \tau}
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   \frac{30}{20 \cdot c \cdot \tau} = \ln(3)
   \]  
   Thus:  
   \[
   c \cdot \tau = \frac{30}{20 \cdot \ln(3)} = \frac{3}{2 \cdot \ln(3)}
   \]

   For the new \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{\gamma \cdot c \cdot \tau}
   \]  
   Substituting \( c \cdot \tau = \frac{3}{2 \cdot \ln(3)} \):  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{\gamma \cdot \frac{3}{2 \cdot \ln(3)}}
   \]  
   Simplify:  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30 \cdot 2 \cdot \ln(3)}{\gamma \cdot 3}
   \]  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{20 \cdot \ln(3)}{\gamma}
   \]  
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{20 \cdot \ln(3)}{-\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)}
   \]  
   Using \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \) and \( \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx -0.4055 \):  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.16
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The required Lorentz factor is approximately \( \gamma = 54 \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
