Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me see. I remember that electric potential energy is related to the configuration of charges. The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh, right, e is the elementary charge, about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. 

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th is fixed at P. I think I need to find the minimum energy of the system. Wait, what's the setup here?

Oh, right, so the 13th charge is at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So, each of those 12 is at a distance of 2m from P. But wait, are they arranged in some particular way? Like, maybe all on the surface of a sphere around P? Or perhaps each is at a different position, but all at 2m from P. Hmm, but for potential energy, I think the distances between each other matter too. Because if all the 12 are at 2m from P, but maybe they are near each other, that would affect the potential energy.

Wait, but the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So maybe the 12 are fixed on a sphere of radius 2m, each at points on the sphere. But for potential energy, I think we have to consider every pair of charges and calculate the potential energy between each pair, then sum them all up.

Right, the electric potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. And the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

So, in this case, each charge is 2e, so q = 2e. So each pair contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/r. But what's r for each pair?

Wait, the charges are in a system where the 13th is fixed at P. So for the 12 charges, each is 2m from P. But what about the distance between two of the
