Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and I need to identify the final product. The options are A to D, so I need to figure out what Compound X is first and then determine what reaction it undergoes.

Looking at the given data: the IR and NMR spectra. Let's start by analyzing the IR. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since the next peak is at 1720 cm⁻¹, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe it's an ester or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but 1720 is a bit lower than a typical ester (which is around 1740-1725). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone? No, wait, the next peak at 1610 cm⁻¹ suggests conjugated double bonds or aromatic C=C. The 1450 peak could be from aromatic ring stretching.

Now looking at the 1H NMR. The peaks are: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), that's a broad singlet. That could be an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Then 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) are typical of an aromatic ring with two substituents in para positions. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methylene adjacent to an electronegative group, perhaps a CH next to a carbonyl. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be more methylene groups, and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl, like in an ethyl group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a benzoic acid derivative. Because the IR has the O-H (broad around 3400) and a carbonyl at 1720. So perhaps a substituted benzoic acid. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which are downfield, suggesting substituents. The substituent on the benzene could be a side chain.

Looking at the NMR shifts: the 10.5 ppm is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid proton (though alcohols or amines would show up around 1-5 usually, so more likely carboxylic acid). So the compound is a benzoic acid with some substituents.

The other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH2CH2 group attached to the ring. Wait, or maybe
