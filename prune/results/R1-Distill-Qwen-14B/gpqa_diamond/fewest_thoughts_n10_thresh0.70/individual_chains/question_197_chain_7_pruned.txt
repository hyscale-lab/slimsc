Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying Compound X, which reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, and I need to determine which is the product. 

First, let's look at the spectroscopic data provided: the IR and the 1H NMR.

Starting with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which suggests possible O-H or N-H stretches. But since the options are all organic compounds without amines, I think it's more likely an O-H group, maybe a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches around 2500-3300. The strong peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are probably aromatic C=C stretches.

Now the NMR. Let's break it down. The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. But wait, wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But this is a broad signal. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. But a carboxylic acid would be a broad peak, often around 10-12 ppm. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Hmm, but looking further, the other NMR signals might help.

Looking at the aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's a classic pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring. Each doublet implies that the protons are adjacent to substituents. So if the ring has substituents at the para positions, the protons next to them would be deshielded and show as doublets.

Then we have a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), maybe a CH adjacent to something electronegative. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be another set of adjacent CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) sounds like a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH(CH3). And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) suggests a terminal methyl, like a CH2CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together: The aromatic ring has substituents at the para positions. Let's say substituents A and B are at positions 1 and 4 (if we're considering a benzene ring). The substituents could be a carbonyl group and another group. Wait, but looking at the IR, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe one substituent is a ketone or ester or acid group.

But wait, the 10.5 ppm peak
