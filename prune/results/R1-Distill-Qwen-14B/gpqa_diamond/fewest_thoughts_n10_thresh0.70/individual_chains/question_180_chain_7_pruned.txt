Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum energy of this system of charges. Hmm, let's see. The question is about an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Oh wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. That would make each charge about 3.2e-19 C.

Wait, the setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P is where the 13th charge is located, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters away from P.

I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges depends on the arrangement, and for an isolated system, the potential energy is the work required to assemble the charges from infinity. Since the charges are identical and all the same sign, they'll repel each other, so bringing them together requires energy, which increases the potential energy. But wait, the question is about the minimum energy. Hmm, wait, what's the minimum possible potential energy here?

Wait, all the 12 charges are at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th
