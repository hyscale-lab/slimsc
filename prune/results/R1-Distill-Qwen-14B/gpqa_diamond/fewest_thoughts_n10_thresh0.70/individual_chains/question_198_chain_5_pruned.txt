Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, stability constants, right. I remember that β (beta) values indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, the blue ones are the dithiocyanato complexes. So, I think that refers to either the [Co(SCN)_2]²+ or maybe [Co(SCN)_4]^2- or something else. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact complexes, but I think the dithiocyanato complexes have two SCN- ligands. Or maybe four? I'm not sure.

But okay, the key here is that each β corresponds to a different complex. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. Wait no, the stability constants are for each step of complexation. So, for Co²+ + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)²+ (that's the first complex), β1 is 9. Then the next step is Co(SCN)²+ + SCN- ⇌ Co(SCN)_2²+ with β2=40. Wait, no, β2 would be the second complex, but I might have to think about the actual formula.

Alternatively, the complexes could be [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^(?), etc. Wait, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^(2 -n), because each SCN- is -1. So Co²+ plus n SCN- would give [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n+). So for n=1: [CoSCN]^+, n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0, n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^-2, n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but looking at the β values in order. So β1=9 for [CoSCN]^+, β2=40 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0? No, wait, the stability constants are given in a sequence, so each β is the formation constant for each step. So β1 is the formation constant for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

Wait, but in terms of the overall formation, the overall β for the complex with n ligands would be the product of the stepwise βs up to n. So for [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, the overall β would be β1 * β2 * β3 * β4. But wait, the βs given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β
