Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, wait. I think the blue complex refers to the one with two SCN- ligands because I remember that the [Co(SCN)_2]^3+ is blue. So, I'm looking for the fraction of Co that's in the Co(SCN)_2^3+ complex.

Stability constants, or formation constants, are given as β1 to β4. I think βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So β1 is for CoSCN^2+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)₂]^3+, β3 for [Co(SCN)₃]^4+, and β4 would be [Co(SCN)₄]^2-? Or maybe the charges are different, but I think the key is that each β corresponds to the number of SCN- ions attached.

The total cobalt species would
