Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Let me try to work through it step by step.

So the question is about particles colliding and creating new particles that decay quickly. These new particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, with a Lorentz factor around 20. The detector is a sphere with a radius of 30 meters. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls. But the question is asking, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of them reach the inner walls? The options are A to D.

Hmm. I think this has something to do with how the particles' speed and the detector's size relate to how far they travel before decaying. So, the particles are moving at a certain velocity, and their lifetime determines how far they can go before decaying. Wait, right, because particles that decay quickly won't travel far, but ones that last longer can reach the detector walls.

The key here is probably the concept of time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. The distance the particle travels depends on its speed and lifetime. The Lorentz factor gamma comes into play because it affects how much time dilation occurs.

Wait, let me think. The lifetime of the particle from the lab frame (the detector's frame) is gamma times the proper lifetime. So if the proper lifetime is tau, then the observed lifetime is gamma tau. 

But wait, the problem says the particles are ultra-relativistic and have a Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third reach the inner walls. So, maybe the particles that reach the walls are those that have a long enough lifetime (or higher gamma) to make the trip before decaying.

So, let's model this. The particles are produced at the center of the sphere, so the distance they need to travel to reach the wall is equal to the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. 

The time it takes to reach the wall is the distance divided by their speed. But since they're moving at a relativistic speed, I think we have to consider their speed as a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me denote the speed as v. The time taken to reach the wall is t = 30 m / v.

But from the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma * tau, where tau is the
