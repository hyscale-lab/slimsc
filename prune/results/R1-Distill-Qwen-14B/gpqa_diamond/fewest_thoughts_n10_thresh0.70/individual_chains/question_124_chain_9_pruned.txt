Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me read it again.

So, the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, and their Lorentz factor is around 20 on average. Now, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two thirds reach the walls instead.

The detector's radius is 30 meters. Oh wait, I think the radius is the distance from the center to the wall. So particles have to travel 30 meters to reach the wall, but since it's a sphere, maybe it's the straight-line distance from the center, which is just the radius. So yeah, each particle has to go 30 meters to reach the wall.

So, particles are moving at a speed where their Lorentz factor is gamma. The problem says that with gamma ~20, only 1/3 reach the wall. We need to find the gamma when 2/3 reach the wall.

Wait, but why does the Lorentz factor affect whether the particle reaches the wall? Oh, probably because the lifetime of the particles is involved. Because these are fast-decaying particles, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame affects how far they can travel before decaying. So the proper lifetime (proper time) is tau, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.

So the distance a particle travels is v * t, where t is the lab frame lifetime. So the maximum distance is v * gamma tau. But wait, since they're ultra-relativistic, v is approximately c. So distance d = c * gamma tau.

But wait, another way to think about it: the proper lifetime is tau. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. The velocity is beta c, so distance is beta c * gamma tau. So d = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, but beta is approximately 1 for ultra-relativistic particles, so beta ≈ 1. So d ≈ c gamma tau.

So, for a particle to reach the wall, the distance it travels must be equal to the radius of the detector, 30 meters. So 30 m = c gamma tau.

Now, the particles that reach the wall are those that have a proper lifetime tau such that
