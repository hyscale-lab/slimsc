Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, the question is about finding the scalar potential V and vector potential A for a moving point charge. Let me try to think this through.

Alright, the setup is that there's a charge q moving along some trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a point r at time t, where t is after the time tr when the field was generated. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated (at tr) to the observation point r.

I remember that when dealing with moving charges, we have to consider both the electric and magnetic fields. The scalar potential V is usually due to the electric field, while the vector potential A is related to the magnetic field.

Wait, for a stationary charge, the scalar potential is V = q/(4πε0 r). But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of relativity and the need to account for retarded times. Oh right, the retarded time is when the fields at a point are influenced by the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time, tr, such that light has time to travel from tr to the observation point.

So, the general expressions for V and A for a moving charge involve the retarded time. The scalar potential V(r,t) would depend on the charge's position at tr, and A(r,t) would depend on the velocity v at tr as well.

But wait, the options given don't seem to involve the position of the charge directly. Let me see the options again.

Option A: V is q/(4πε0 r), same as the static case. Vector A is v²/c² times V. That seems off because I thought A should involve v, not v squared.

Option B: V is the same static expression. A is (v/c²) V. Hmm, that might make sense dimensionally. Let's check units. V has units of volts, which is J/C. A (vector potential) has units of T·m²/A. Hmm, but when you take v (m/s) and multiply by V (which has 1/C), divided by c squared, which is (m²/s²). Let me see: (m/s) * (J/C) / (m²/s²) → (m/s)*(N·m/C

Okay, so I need to figure out the correct expressions for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r and time t, given a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that there are certain formulas for potentials when charges are moving. Let me think.

The setup is that the charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and the field is observed at point r. The vector d is from where the field was generated at time t_r to the observation point r. So, t is greater than t_r, meaning the events are ordered correctly for retarded potentials.

Wait, right. For moving charges, the potentials aren't just the static case anymore. I think the scalar potential V involves the charge, some distance, and maybe the velocity of the charge. Similarly, the vector potential A relates to the velocity as well.

I recall that the scalar potential for a moving charge is given by something like V = q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge's position at t_r to the point r. But wait, isn't the distance here a bit different because of the motion? Oh right, there's a term that involves the component of the velocity in the direction of the displacement. So, the expression for d is from the charge's position at t_r to r, which is vector d. So the denominator would involve dc minus the dot product of d and v, where c is the speed of light. Or is it plus? Let me think. Oh wait, Lienard's formulas come into play here. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [c/(d c - v·d)].

Wait, that rings a bell. The denominator is (d c - v·d) where d is the vector from the charge's position at t_r to r (or is it the other way around? No, I think d is from t_r to r, so the charge was at s(t_r) and the field is observed at r. So the vector from the charge at t_r to r is d. So, the denominator is (d c - v·d), which can be written as c² (t - t_r) - v·d, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, since the distance is changing, the denominator becomes (d c
