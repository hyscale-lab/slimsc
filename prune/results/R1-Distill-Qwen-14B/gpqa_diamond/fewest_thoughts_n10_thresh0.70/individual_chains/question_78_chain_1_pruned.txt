Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, the question is about finding the scalar potential V and vector potential A for a moving point charge. Let me try to think this through.

Alright, the setup is that there's a charge q moving along some trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a point r at time t, where t is after the time tr when the field was generated. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated (at tr) to the observation point r.

I remember that when dealing with moving charges, we have to consider both the electric and magnetic fields. The scalar potential V is usually due to the electric field, while the vector potential A is related to the magnetic field.

Wait, for a stationary charge, the scalar potential is V = q/(4πε0 r). But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of relativity and the need to account for retarded times. Oh right, the retarded time is when the fields at a point are influenced by the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time, tr, such that light has time to travel from tr to the observation point.

So, the general expressions for V and A for a moving charge involve the retarded time. The scalar potential V(r,t) would depend on the charge's position at tr, and A(r,t) would depend on the velocity v at tr as well.

But wait, the options given don't seem to involve the position of the charge directly. Let me see the options again.

Option A: V is q/(4πε0 r), same as the static case. Vector A is v²/c² times V. That seems off because I thought A should involve v, not v squared.

Option B: V is the same static expression. A is (v/c²) V. Hmm, that might make sense dimensionally. Let's check units. V has units of volts, which is J/C. A (vector potential) has units of T·m²/A. Hmm, but when you take v (m/s) and multiply by V (which has 1/C), divided by c squared, which is (m²/s²). Let me see: (m/s) * (J/C) / (m²/s²) → (m/s)*(N·m/C
