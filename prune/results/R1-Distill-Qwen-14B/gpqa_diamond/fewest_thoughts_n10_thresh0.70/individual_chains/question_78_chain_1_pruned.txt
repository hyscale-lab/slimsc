Okay, so I need to figure out the correct expressions for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r and time t, given a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that there are certain formulas for potentials when charges are moving. Let me think.

The setup is that the charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and the field is observed at point r. The vector d is from where the field was generated at time t_r to the observation point r. So, t is greater than t_r, meaning the events are ordered correctly for retarded potentials.

Wait, right. For moving charges, the potentials aren't just the static case anymore. I think the scalar potential V involves the charge, some distance, and maybe the velocity of the charge. Similarly, the vector potential A relates to the velocity as well.

I recall that the scalar potential for a moving charge is given by something like V = q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge's position at t_r to the point r. But wait, isn't the distance here a bit different because of the motion? Oh right, there's a term that involves the component of the velocity in the direction of the displacement. So, the expression for d is from the charge's position at t_r to r, which is vector d. So the denominator would involve dc minus the dot product of d and v, where c is the speed of light. Or is it plus? Let me think. Oh wait, Lienard's formulas come into play here. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [c/(d c - v·d)].

Wait, that rings a bell. The denominator is (d c - v·d) where d is the vector from the charge's position at t_r to r (or is it the other way around? No, I think d is from t_r to r, so the charge was at s(t_r) and the field is observed at r. So the vector from the charge at t_r to r is d. So, the denominator is (d c - v·d), which can be written as c² (t - t_r) - v·d, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, since the distance is changing, the denominator becomes (d c
