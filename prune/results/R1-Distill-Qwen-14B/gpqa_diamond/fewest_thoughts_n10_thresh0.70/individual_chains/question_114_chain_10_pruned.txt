Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, looking at the first reaction: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. When a ketone reacts with cyanide, I'm thinking about possible reactions. Oh, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but in the product, there's a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. So perhaps it's an addition of CN- followed by some kind of elimination or rearrangement?

Wait, wait. Another thought: maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation typically involves the addition of CN- to a carbonyl group, but I think that usually requires an acid catalyst. Because the cyanide ion is a weak nucleophile without some activation. Oh right, the cyanohydrin reaction usually uses something like H3O+ as a catalyst. So when a ketone reacts with NaCN in acidic conditions, it forms the cyanohydrin. So A would be H3O+.

So the first reaction's reagent A should be H3O+. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, so that's possible.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, so the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. The hydrolysis of nitriles usually requires strong acidic or basic conditions, possibly with heat. For example, in acidic conditions, H2O would protonate the nitrile, and then maybe undergo some addition steps. Alternatively, under basic conditions, maybe using something like aqueous HCl or H2SO4.

Wait, the reagent B is given as H2O. So the reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group. So what re
