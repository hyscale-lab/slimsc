Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light and motion, especially when objects are moving relative to each other, we often have to consider the principles of special relativity. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, so I'll have to think carefully.

The setup is this: a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1, which is a helpful simplification.

So, I need to find the speed of light in the glass as measured by the lab frame. Let me recall some concepts. The index of refraction n is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in the medium. So, normally, the speed of light in the medium (like glass) is v_medium = c/n. But when the medium itself is moving, how does that affect the observed speed of light?

Wait, I think the situation involves both the motion of the medium and the refractive index. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me break it down. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So, in the lab frame, how does this affect the observed speed of the light?

I remember something about Galilean transformations and how velocities add. But wait, Galilean transformations are for non-relativistic speeds. Special relativity uses Lorentz transformations, which are different. However, the problem states that the glass is moving at a constant velocity v, but it doesn't specify whether v is a significant fraction of c. Since the problem gives c=1, maybe we're supposed to consider relativistic effects? Or is it just a trick question where the speed of light remains c in all inertial frames, regardless of the medium?

Wait, no, because the medium is moving. Because the speed of light depends on the medium when it's not a vacuum. Oh wait
