Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, things get a bit tricky because of relativity, but maybe I can handle this without going into too deep of special relativity.

The setup is a light beam propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. The question is asking what the speed of the light is relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, but wait. The speed of light in a medium is generally v = c/n, where c is the vacuum speed of light. But in this case, the medium is moving. So, how does the motion of the medium affect the observed speed of light?

I think I remember something about the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh wait, but that's for when you have two frames moving relative to each other. But in this case, the glass (the medium) is moving. So the light's speed in the medium is v_light = c/n. But because the medium itself is moving, we have to consider the relative velocity.

Wait, so the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, in the same direction as the light beam. So the light beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving.

But how do we combine these velocities? Let me think. The glass is moving at v relative to the lab. The light's speed in the glass is c/n
