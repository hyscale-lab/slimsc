Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read through it carefully.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that stars have their own atmosphere, the photosphere, and when parts of it are cooler (like spots), it can change the overall emission.

So the star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, how does that happen? I think when spots are present, the total luminosity changes. Luminosity is proportional to the surface area times the fourth power of temperature. So maybe the star's luminosity without spots is higher, but when spots are there, the average temperature is lower.

The problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When spots are present, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which the ratio changes when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula for the ratio is (n1)/(n2) = (g1
