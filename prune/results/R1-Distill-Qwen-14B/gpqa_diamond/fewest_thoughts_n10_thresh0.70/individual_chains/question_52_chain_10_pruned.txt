Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what it's asking.

The problem says that there's a star with certain characteristics. Its radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. Without any spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

Now, the main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Titanium (Ti) in two energy levels—level 1 and level 2. It says that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. And it's assumed that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula I recall is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio is (n1/n2), right? Because the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Oh wait, no, the ratio of level 1 to level 2 is decreasing. Or is it n1 over n2? Let me check the problem statement again. It says the "ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)" decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, (n1/n2) is lower. So when spots are present, (n1/n2)_spots is lower than (n1/n2)_no_spots.

Wait, but (n1/n2) would be (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), because the formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So n1/n2 would be the inverse, so (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ).

But wait, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So the energy difference between the two levels would be related to this wavelength. I remember that energy E is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.

So first, I need to calculate the energy difference ΔE between the two levels. Let me get the constants:

h =
