Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully again.

The question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, right, relativistic mechanics. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics; you need to apply special relativity.

So the problem states: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are traveling at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are given, so maybe I can work through each part step by step.

First, let me tackle the relative speed. I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The formula for relative velocity is a bit more complicated. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Here, u is the velocity of the first astronaut from the perspective of the second, or vice versa. Wait, no, wait. Let's think. The relative speed is how fast one is moving from the other's frame of reference.

Wait, both astronauts are moving in the same direction, so from the perspective of one, the other might be moving at a different speed. Let me assign the velocities. Let’s say astronaut A has mass 2m and velocity 0.6c, and astronaut B has mass 3m and velocity 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from B's frame, what is A's velocity?

Wait, actually, no. Because when you're calculating the relative speed, you can't just subtract the velocities. You have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. So the formula for the relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is v_rel = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the first object in the second's frame.

Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me get it right. Suppose I'm in the frame of astronaut B. I want to find the velocity of astronaut A relative to me. So in the lab frame, both are moving in the same direction. So in the lab frame, A is moving at 0.6c,
