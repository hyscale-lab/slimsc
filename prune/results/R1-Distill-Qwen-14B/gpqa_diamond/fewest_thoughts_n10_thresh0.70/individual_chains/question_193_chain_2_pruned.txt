Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this astronomy question, and I'm a bit confused but let's think it through. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, right. Parallax is related to distance, so I need to figure out how the number of stars changes as a function of distance.

Wait, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So if you go further away, the parallax is smaller. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So distance r would be 1/plx. So plx is proportional to 1/r.

The number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. So N ‚àù 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, N is proportional to (r)^5. Wait, because 1/(1/r)^5 is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. That would make the number of stars increase rapidly with distance.

But wait, wait a second. Are they talking about how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance? So like, not the absolute number, but the density? Because if you have more stars in a larger volume as you go further, but the volume increases with r^3, perhaps the relation is different. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the differential.

Alternatively, the question says "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit
