Okay, I need to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let me start by understanding the problem.

So, the setup is that they're trying to overexpress the GADD45G protein in mice by creating a transgenic model. They added a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the protein. They used Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, transfected with the plasmid, and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they checked, the protein wasn't overexpressed.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I need to see what's wrong. The sequence is the plus strand, so the mRNA would be complementary to this, right? Let me write down the beginning of the sequence to see what's going on.

The sequence starts with 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... and so on. Wait, ATG is the start codon, methionine. Then comes TAC, which is tyrosine. But wait, the HA tag is inserted at the N-terminus. So the HA sequence is probably before the ATG.

Wait, no. The question says they introduced the sequence for an influenza HA determinant at the N-terminus. So the HA would come before the ATG start codon for GADD45G. But looking at the given sequence, the start is ATG, so that's the beginning of the GADD45G coding sequence. Hmm. Did they perhaps not include the HA tag correctly? Or is the HA tag causing a problem?

Wait, maybe the HA tag is part of the construct. Let me think about how the construct is built. The HA tag is a short peptide, usually around 11 amino acids. Its DNA sequence would be added before the ATG start codon of GADD45G. But in the given sequence, the very first nucleotides are ATG, which is the start. So maybe the HA wasn't correctly added, leading to a problem.

Wait, no. Looking at the sequence, I see ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... Wait, the first few codons are ATG (Met), TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), GAT (Asp), TAC (Tyr), GCC (Ala), AAA (K), TGA...

Wait, TGA is a stop codon. Oh! So after the start codon, the sequence goes to TGA, which is a stop. So the mRNA would be ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA. So the first codon after ATG is TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), etc., but then it hits TGA, which is a stop. So the protein would be Met followed by a few amino acids and then stop. Wait, that's a problem.

So the construct's coding sequence is only a few codons long before a stop codon. That's not right. They were expecting to overexpress the full-length GADD45G, but the construct is producing a truncated protein that stops after a few amino acids. Why is that happening?

Looking at the sequence, perhaps the initial part is the HA tag, but in the given sequence, the ATG is followed by a stop codon (TGA) just a bit later. So the construct might have inserted the HA incorrectly. Wait, but the HA is supposed to be at the N-terminus. So the HA's coding sequence should come before the ATG of GADD45G.

Wait, perhaps they didn't include the HA correctly, or the construct has another issue. Alternatively, maybe the GADD45G sequence is messed up, leading to a premature stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct has an in-frame stop codon early on. So the first codon is ATG (start), and then TAC, which is fine, then CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), GAT (Asp), TAC (Tyr), GCC (Ala), AAA (K), and then TGA (stop). So the coding sequence is ATG followed by these codons and then TGA, which is a stop.

Wait, so the reading frame is correct. So the problem is that the GADD45G coding sequence includes a stop codon very early. That would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, leading to a small, non-functional protein. But why is that happening?

Ah, perhaps the HA tag wasn't properly inserted, and the reading frame is messed up. Or maybe the original GADD45G coding sequence in the construct has an in-frame TGA early on.

But wait, in the given DNA sequence, the plus strand starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So the mRNA would be ATG, and the protein starts with Met. Then the next codon is TAC (tyrosine), which is fine. But then the next codon is CCA (Pro), then TAC again, etc., and then comes TGA, a stop.

So the issue is that the construct includes a stop codon after just a few codons. So the mRNA would be translated as Met-Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala-Lys, and then stop.

So the problem is that the GADD45G coding sequence in the construct has a premature stop codon. Why would that be? Maybe during the cloning process, the insertion of the HA tag or the original gene caused a frameshift. Or perhaps the construct includes intronic sequences or something else.

Wait, but the given sequence is the plus (coding) strand. So the coding sequence starts at ATG and ends with TGA before the rest of the GADD45G coding sequence. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag wasn't added correctly. Oh wait, the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. So the HA's DNA sequence comes before the ATG. But in the given sequence, the first thing is ATG. So perhaps the HA wasn't added. But the question says the construct was modified to include the HA sequence. So perhaps the construct is wrong in that the HA was inserted but caused a frameshift, leading to the premature stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence was inserted in the wrong frame, leading the start codon to be in a different frame, but that's not the case here because the start is correct.

Wait, the problem is that the ATG is followed by TAC, which is in frame. So the HA tag might have a few codons before the ATG, but in the given sequence, there's no HA. So the HA might not have been correctly included, which would explain why the GADD45G isn't overexpressed. Or perhaps the HA is present but introduces a stop.

Wait, looking again, the given sequence starts with ATG, so the HA must be before that. So the issue must not be about the HA. Then why is the HA causing a problem? Maybe the construct includes the HA in the correct frame, but the HA's sequence includes a stop codon.

Wait, no, the HA is a short peptide, which should be a few codons without any stops. So perhaps the HA wasn't added, and the ATG is just the GADD45G's start. But the given sequence includes a TGA stop codon, which is not present in the wild-type GADD45G.

Wait, perhaps the original construct was wrong. Let me think about the options.

The options are:

A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.
B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.
C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.
D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.

Wait, looking at the construct's sequence, the stop codon is TGA, which is a common stop codon. So when the mRNA is translated, the ribosome would stop at TGA. So the issue is that the construct's coding region includes an early stop codon, which is causing the truncated protein.

But why would that happen? Maybe the GADD45G coding sequence was incorrectly cloned, introducing this stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was added in a way that its sequence caused a stop. But HA is usually a short peptide, like YPYDVPDYD, which is 11 amino acids. Its coding sequence would be a series of codons without any in-frame stops. So that's unlikely.

Wait, in the given sequence, the first codon is ATG (start), then TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTT, CCA, GAT, TAC, GCC, AAA, TGA. So the first 12 nucleotides after ATG are TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA.

Wait, let me write these codons:

1: ATG (Met)
2: TAC (Tyr)
3: CCA (Pro)
4: TAC (Tyr)
5: GAT (Asp)
6: GTT (Val)
7: CCA (Pro)
8: GAT (Asp)
9: TAC (Tyr)
10: GCC (Ala)
11: AAA (Lys)
12: TGA (stop)

So the construct is coding for a protein that starts with Met and then has 11 amino acids before stopping. So the HA tag was supposed to be at the N-terminus, but perhaps it's not present here because the sequence starts with ATG.

Wait, so the HA tag wasn't actually inserted into the construct. Because the HA would come before the ATG. So in the given sequence, the HA is missing. So the construct starts directly with the ATG of GADD45G. But why is there a stop codon after a few codons?

Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid was cut in the wrong place, or the insert was incorrect. Suppose the HA tag was supposed to be inserted before the ATG, but it's missing, and the GADD45G starts. But in the given sequence, the GADD45G coding starts with ATG and then has a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the GADD45G gene has a mutation in the construct, such that the coding sequence includes a premature stop codon. So the mRNA would be translated only for a short stretch, leading to no full-length protein. Hence, the overexpression doesn't happen because the protein is not made.

So the problem is that the coding sequence has a premature stop codon, leading to early termination.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated the translation early, which would be due to a stop codon early in the mRNA. So if the construct has a stop codon, that's the cause.

But why did the stop codon appear? Because the construct was made incorrectly, perhaps during cloning, a mutation introduced a stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag insertion caused a frameshift. But in this case, the first codon is ATG, so no frameshift.

Wait, if the HA was inserted in the wrong frame, but that would require the ATG for GADD45G to be in a different frame, but the sequence starts with ATG, so it's correct.

Wait, perhaps the HA was inserted with a stop codon. Or perhaps the sequence after the HA includes a stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid was designed wrong, and the HA was not added, leading the GADD45G to be read from ATG but with a stop codon. But why would the GADD45G have a stop codon so early?

Wait, perhaps during cloning, the GADD45G was cut with a restriction enzyme that introduced a stop codon. For example, if the enzyme used had a recognition site that included TGA, it might have caused the stop.

Alternatively, the presence of a stop codon in the construct is a mistake, perhaps due to a cloning error.

But regardless, the main issue is that the coding sequence has a stop codon, leading to the early termination.

Now, looking at the options:

A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

Hmm. If the HA sequence had a mutation leading to a different amino acid, that would be a missense, but I don't see any indication that the HA is in the provided sequence. The sequence starts with ATG, so perhaps the HA is not present. So option A may not be directly relevant.

B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.

This seems to fit because the construct's coding sequence includes a stop codon, so the ribosome would stop early.

C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.

A linker sequence is usually between the tag and the target protein. If it's missing, proteases might cleave the protein. But in this case, the problem is that the protein isn't being expressed at all because translation stops early. So proteolysis would occur after expression, but here the issue is lack of expression.

D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.

Wait, in the construct, the stop codon is TGA, not UAA. The stop codons are UAA, UAG, and UGA. Mammalian cells recognize all three. So option D is about UAA, which isn't the case here. So option D is incorrect.

So the correct answer seems to be B. The stop codon is causing the ribosome to terminate early.


The question involves identifying why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed in a transgenic mouse model. The construct includes a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence. However, the provided DNA sequence starts with the ATG start codon, followed by a series of codons and a premature stop codon (TGA) after only 11 amino acids. This indicates that the ribosome terminates translation early, preventing the production of a full-length protein.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.**  
   This is unlikely because the HA tag is not present in the provided sequence. The sequence starts directly with the ATG of GADD45G, so there is no evidence of a missense mutation in the HA tag.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.**  
   This is consistent with the observation. The construct contains a premature stop codon (TGA) after only a few codons, causing the ribosome to terminate translation early and produce a truncated protein.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.**  
   Proteolysis occurs after the protein is expressed, but the issue here is the absence of full-length protein due to early termination of translation. Therefore, this option does not explain the lack of overexpression.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.**  
   The stop codon in the construct is TGA, not UAA. Mammalian cells recognize TGA as a valid stop codon, so this option is irrelevant.

### Conclusion:
The premature stop codon in the construct causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the expression of full-length GADD45G protein. This aligns with **Option B**.
