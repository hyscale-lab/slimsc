Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but let's try to work through it.

The question lists four options, each a different molecule. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about each one.

First, I remember that symmetry elements like C3h are a type of molecular symmetry. C3h symmetry implies that the molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and a mirror plane (Ïƒ) that is perpendicular to that axis. Wait, no, actually, I think C3h is the combination of a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So, when you rotate the molecule 120 degrees around the C3 axis and then reflect it across the mirror plane, it should look the same.

So, for a molecule to have C3h symmetry, it must have a three-fold rotation axis, and mirrored symmetry across a plane that's perpendicular to that axis. Alternatively, maybe the mirror plane is along the axis? I get a bit confused here. Let me think: the h in C3h refers to the horizontal mirror plane. So the mirror plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis, which is vertical. So the symmetry involves rotation by 120 degrees and a reflection in a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis.

So, how do I determine which of these molecules has such symmetry?

Let me go through each option.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. I remember that
