Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh wait, the formula I think is something like Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4), right? Or was it adjusted with the planet's distance in some way?

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is given by T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 ), where T_s is the star's effective temperature, R_s is the star's radius, a is the planet's orbital distance, and A is the albedo. Oh, but wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so A is the same for both. So that part cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the main variables are the distance from the star (a) for each planet. But how do I find a for each planet?

The question mentions the radial velocity method and the transit method. Oh, right! The radial velocity (RV) method gives the mass of the planet and its distance from the star (through the Doppler shift). But wait, the RV method can only give the minimum mass, but since the problem says the planets' masses are given, maybe we can use that to find the orbital period or the distance.

Wait, but the question gives the RV shifts induced by each planet. Hmm. Let me think. The RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I remember is K = (v) = (G*(M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ), but that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the RV shift is proportional to the mass of the planet and inversely proportional to the orbital period or something else.

Wait, but the problem states that Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å, and Planet2 a shift of 0.04 Å. Oh, but wait, the RV method's shift is related to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The Doppler shift (in wavelength) is given by delta lambda = lambda * (v/c), where v is the velocity. So, delta lambda is proportional to v. So, K (the velocity) is proportional to delta lambda.

So, K1 (Planet1) = 0.03 Å / 6300 Å. Wait, because the line is at 6300 Å. So delta lambda is 0.03, so K1 is (0.03/6300) * c, where c is the speed of light. Similarly for K2, it's 0.04/6300 * c. So K2 is (0.04 / 0.03) times K1, which is 4/3 times as much.

But how does K relate to the planet's mass and orbital period? The formula for K is K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) 

But since the orbits are circular (e=0), and sin i is 1 (edge-on, which is the case for transit method), and M_p is much less than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( (G M_p) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) * (2π)^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )

But since e=0, and sin i =1 (as transit implies i≈90 degrees), and M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

Thus, K ≈ ( (G M_p) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P
