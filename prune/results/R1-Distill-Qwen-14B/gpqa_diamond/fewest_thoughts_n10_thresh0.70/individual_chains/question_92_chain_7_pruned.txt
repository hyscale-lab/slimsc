Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a mouthful. I should probably draw it out or at least visualize the structure to count the bonds. The question gives me some bond energies, so I think I'll need to use those.

Wait, enthalpy of formation... Oh right! The standard enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for a hydrocarbon like this, it would involve calculating the energy from breaking all the bonds in the reactants (elements) and forming the bonds in the product.

The formula for calculating the enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 
ΔH°f = [Σ (Bond energies of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of products)].

But wait, the reactants here are the elements in their standard states. For most hydrocarbons, that's carbon ( graphite) and hydrogen gas. So I need to consider the bonds broken in the reactants and formed in the product.

Wait, but how do I approach this? Let me think. For each molecule of the compound, I can calculate the total bond energies for all the bonds in it. Then, the enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the bond energies of the elements' bonds minus the bond energies in the compound.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The standard enthalpy of formation is calculated as the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (elements) minus the sum of the bond energies of the product's bonds. So, for example, for methane, it's breaking C-C (but wait, graphite is a network solid, so each C has four bonds... I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as the sum of the energies required to break all the bonds in the elements (like C and H2) minus the sum of the energies released when forming the bonds in the compound.

Alternatively, the formula is:
ΔH°f = (Σ bonds broken in elements) - (
