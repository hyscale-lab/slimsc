Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read through it again and try to figure out what's going on. Hmm, the question is about a star with some spots on it and how that affects the photometric observations. It's being compared to an exoplanet's effect on the light curve.

Alright, the star's radius is the same as the Sun, so R_star = R_sun. The star has dark spots covering one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So, the spots are at 5000 K.

The problem says that the situation can resemble an exoplanet causing periodic brightness variations. We need to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the spots do. So, the question is asking for R_pl divided by R_star.

Wait, but wait. If the star wasn't spotted, what exoplanet radius would give the same signal? So, the observed brightness dip when the planet transits the star is what we're comparing to the brightness variation caused by the spots.

Let me think about how each effect contributes to the brightness variation.

First, the spots. Since they're on one hemisphere, and the star is rotating, when the spots face towards us, the brightness changes. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the star's surface is covered by spots. But wait, it's one hemisphere that's covered, so does that mean 50% of the star's surface? Wait no, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so maybe 10% of the total surface? Wait, the question states "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, so the entire hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface. But the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.5 (hemisphere) * 0.2 (filling factor) = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the visible hemisphere covered by spots. So if it's 20%, then when we see the hemisphere, 20% is spots. But since a star is a sphere, if one hemisphere's 20% is spotted, that's 20% of half the surface. So total spotted area would be (0.2)*(0.5) = 0.1, which is 10% of the entire star's surface.

But wait, the star is rotating, so for an observer, the spots come into view as the star rotates. But the problem says that the brightness variation is due to rotational modulation. So when the spots are on the visible side, the brightness decreases because the spots are cooler.

So how does that affect the observed brightness? The star's total luminosity is the sum of the contributions from all its surface area.

The star's luminosity without spots is L = 4πR²σTeff^4.

Each spot has a temperature of 5000 K. The area of each
