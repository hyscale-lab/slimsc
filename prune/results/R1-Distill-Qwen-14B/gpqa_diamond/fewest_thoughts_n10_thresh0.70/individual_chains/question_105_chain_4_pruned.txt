Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. Half of its surface (one hemisphere) has dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I remember means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered in spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K, so their temperature is 5000 K. 

The problem says that because of these spots, when the star rotates, the observed brightness changes, making it look like an exoplanet transit. We need to find out what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would be, relative to the star, to produce the same brightness variation. So, the goal is to find Rpl/Rstar.

Hmm, I think I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula I think is (Rp/Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is the area of the planet's disk over the star's disk. But wait, in this case, the spots are causing a dip in brightness, so the change should be similar to a planet blocking part of the star.

But wait, the spots are cooler. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view. So when the spotted area is facing us, the brightness should decrease because the spots are darker. Wait no, actually, when a spot is on the side facing us, it's part of the star's surface that's cooler. So the total brightness would be a bit lower than when the spot is on the far side.

So the variation in brightness would be the difference between the star's normal brightness and the brightness when the spots are facing us. So the question is, what's the amplitude of this brightness variation, and compare it to the amplitude caused by a planet.

Let me think about the star's normal brightness. The star emits based on its effective temperature. The flux from a star is given by the
