Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics interactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through this.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). I remember that the Lagrangian determines the interactions, so I'll need to figure out which fermions X can interact with.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, when X decays, it has to produce particles whose combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Also, because it's a boson, it should decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Because bosons can't decay into a single fermion; they need to create pairs to conserve things like charge and spin.

Looking at the options, each option lists possible decay channels. The possible decay products are various quark-antiquark pairs and lepton pairs. I need to figure which of these are kinematically allowed, meaning their combined mass is less than 6 GeV.

First, let's list out the masses of the particles involved. I think:

- Quarks: The masses vary, but the current quark masses (which are relevant here) are approximately:
  - Up (u): about 2 MeV
  - Down (d): around 4-5 MeV
  - Strange (s): about 95-100 MeV
  - Charm (c): around 1.3 GeV
  - Bottom (b): about 4.5 GeV
  - Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV, so it's way beyond 6 GeV.
  - For leptons:
  - Electron (e): 0.511 MeV
  - Muon (μ): about 105.7 MeV
  - Tau (τ): around 1.78 GeV

So for each decay channel, the sum of the masses of the fermions must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let's go through each possible pair:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, e+ e−.

Wait, the b quark is about 4.5 GeV. So creating a b b̄ pair would require 2 * 4.5 = 9 GeV. Oh wait, X is only 6 GeV, so that's impossible. So this option can't be right because it includes b quarks. So A is out.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

So let's check the c quark. c is about 1.3 GeV. 2 * 1.3 = 2.6 GeV. That's fine. τ is about 1.78 GeV each, so 2 * 1.78 is ~3.56 GeV, which is under 6. So τ+τ− is allowed.

What about muons? Each is about 0.1 GeV, so 2*0.1 is 0.2, which is fine. Electrons are negligible.

So in option B, the possible decays are c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ τ, μμ, ee. All of these have total masses less than 6 GeV. So B is a possible candidate.

Option C: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Wait, the t quark is way too heavy. Each t is ~173 GeV, so 2t would be 346 GeV. X is only 6 GeV, so t t̄ is impossible. So option C can't be correct. So C is out.

Option D: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Again, the b quarks are too heavy. So D can't be right either.

Wait, but let me double-check. Option B includes c c̄, which is allowed, but does the interaction allow X to decay into those particles? Because the Lagrangian determines what interactions are possible.

Looking at the Lagrangian: the interaction term is -λf ψ̄f (v + X) ψ_f(y). So X couples to the fermions ψf. So which ferm
