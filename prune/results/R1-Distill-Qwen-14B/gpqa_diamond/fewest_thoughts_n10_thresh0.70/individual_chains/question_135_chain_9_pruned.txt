Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the particle physics details, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question says.

The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f f-bar(y) (upsilon + X(y)) psi_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation here. Oh, right, in the Lagrangian, the terms usually involve fields interacting. So the interaction term here is λ times something involving the fermions and the boson X.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, possible decay channels where the boson X can decay into a pair of particles.

I remember that for a particle to decay into a pair of fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because in particle physics, when a particle decays, the rest mass has to be enough to produce the daughter particles, right? So the mass of X is 6 GeV, so any fermion pair it decays into must each have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV each. Wait, no, because the total mass would be 2 times the fermion mass. Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. But since they're a pair, each would need to be less than 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait. For a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, say f and f-bar, the mass of X must be greater than or equal to 2 times the mass of the fermion. So for each possible fermion, if 2m_f ≤ m_X, then X can decay into that fermion pair.

So I need to figure out all the fermions whose mass is ≤ 3 GeV because 6 GeV divided by two is 3 GeV. Let me list the known fermion masses.

The standard model fermion masses (approximate):

Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
Up quark (u): ~0.004 GeV (but I think this is a bit model-dependent, like in the MS-bar scheme. But for this problem, maybe we're considering their current masses.)
Down quark (d): ~0.005 GeV
Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
Bottom (b): ~4.1 GeV
Top (t): ~173 GeV. Way too big, so X can't decay into top quarks.

So let's see which of these have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV. All except b and t are eligible, but wait, how about their masses.

Wait, the tau is about 1.78 GeV. So 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV. Wait, but m_X is 6 GeV. So 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV. So tau can be produced. Wait, but wait: the mass of X is 6 GeV. So 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, X can decay into tau pairs.

But what about the bottom quark? m_b is about 4.1 GeV. So 2*m_b is about 8.2 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b-bar.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused about the quark masses. Because in reality, the current quark masses for u, d, s, c are light. Up and down are like a few MeV. So for them, 2m is way less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar, tau tau-bar, and the leptons e and mu.

Wait, but what about the bottom quark? As I said, 2*m_b is about 8.2 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV, so X can't decay into b b-bar. So the decay channels allowed are all the fermion pairs where each fermion has a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So let's list the possible fermion pairs:

e+ e- : mass 0.0005 GeV each, so 2m < 0.001 GeV, definitely allowed.

mu+ mu- : ~0.105 GeV each, 0.21 GeV <6 GeV, allowed.

tau+ tau-: 1.78 GeV each, 3.56 GeV <6 GeV, allowed.

u u-bar: 0.004 GeV each, 0.008 GeV, allowed.

d d-bar: same as u, allowed.

s s-bar: ~0.095 GeV each, 0.19 GeV, allowed.

c c-bar: 1.27 GeV each, 2.54 GeV <6 GeV, allowed.

b b-bar: 4.1 GeV each, 8.2 GeV >6 GeV, not allowed.

t t-bar: way too heavy, not allowed.

So the possible decay channels are: e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check.

Option A: X→ b,b-s,s-u u-d d, tau, e, etc. But wait, option A includes b and s and all the rest. But since b is too heavy, so option A can't be correct.

Option B: c c, s s, u u, d d, tau, mu, e. So it includes c, which is allowed, but no b. So yes, option B's decay includes c c-bar, which is allowed, but does it have tau? Yes. So option B says X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau tau-bar, mu mu, e e.

Wait, but then in the options, looking at the given options, the options are:

Option A: has b and s, u, d, tau, e.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So option B includes c, which is allowed, but no b.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is too heavy, so C is not allowed.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But b is too heavy, so D is incorrect.

So the correct decays are all those fermions with mass less than 3 GeV. That includes e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So the allowed decay channels are X→ e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

Looking at the options, option B includes all these except for the b and t, which are too heavy. So option B is correct.

Wait, but let me look again. The initial Lagrangian given is -λ f f-bar (y) (upsilon + X(y)) psi_f(y). Wait, psi_f is the field. Wait, perhaps the interaction term is Yukawa-like. So the interaction is between X and a fermion f. So the decay X → f f-bar is possible as long as the mass is sufficient.

So, for each possible fermion f, if 2m_f ≤ m_X, then X can decay into f f-bar.

So, which fermions have 2m_f ≤6 GeV?

It's all fermions except b and t.

Because:
- e: 2*0.0005 = 0.001 <<6 → allowed.

- mu: ~0.21 GeV
