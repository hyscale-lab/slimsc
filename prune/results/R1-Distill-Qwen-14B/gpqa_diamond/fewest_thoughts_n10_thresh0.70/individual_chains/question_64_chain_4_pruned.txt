Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about heating an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The mixture weighs 7.20 grams. When heated without air, it produces a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through several tubes: first anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. The results are that tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g, tube 2 doesn't change, and after all that, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure.

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm. I think I need to figure out what the salts A and B are, based on the reactions and the data given.

First, let's think about each tube. The first tube is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong desiccant and can react with water vapor. So I think when the gas mixture comes into contact with this, any water vapor would be absorbed, increasing the tube's weight. So the 3.60g increase in tube 1 is due to water (H2O) being trapped. So the amount of H2O is 3.60g.

Let's calculate moles of H2O: molecular weight of H2O is 18 g/mol. So 3.60g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol. So 0.2 moles of H2O were produced.

Next, the second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight didn't change. That probably means that no CO2 was present because Ca(OH)2 reacts with CO2 to form CaCO3 and water. If there's no change, maybe the CO2 wasn't present. Or perhaps all the CO2 was absorbed, but the solution can only take a certain amount. Wait, but the Ca(OH)2 solution is probably saturated, so maybe any CO2 would have reacted, but if there was no CO2, nothing happens. Hmm.

Wait, but if the weight didn't change, that suggests that no CO2 was present because Ca(OH)2 would have absorbed the CO2 and increased in mass. So maybe there was no CO2 in the gas mixture. Or perhaps the CO2 was already removed in another step. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas mixture had CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 precipitate and water. The mass of the tube would increase because CaCO3 is more massive than the solution. But in this case, there's no change. So that suggests that no CO2 was present in the gas mixture. So perhaps the gases produced are H2O and something else.

The third
