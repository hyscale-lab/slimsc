Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll take it step by step.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the speeds like in classical mechanics, right? Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, which way are we considering the relative speed? Since both are moving in the positive x-direction, from the perspective of the first astronaut (2m), what's the speed of the second (3m)?

So, v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. Plugging them into the formula: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel is (0.1c)/0.7. 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c. So that's about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So relative speed is either C or D.

Now, the total energy of the system. In relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Oh wait, but when you have two objects, the total energy is the sum of their individual energies. Each object's energy is gamma times m c squared.

So for each astronaut, calculate gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36)
