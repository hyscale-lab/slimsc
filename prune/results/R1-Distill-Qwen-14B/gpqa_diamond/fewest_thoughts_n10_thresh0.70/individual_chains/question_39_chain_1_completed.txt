Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The question says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second, the wave function should probably be a function of x, right? Like ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, no, because I think the imaginary unit is usually denoted by 'i', so 0.5i is just the imaginary part. But wait, the wave function must be normalized. So that's probably the key here. Because when you measure the position, the probability of finding the particle is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function. And the problem states that when you measure, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region, but wait, the given wave function doesn't have any such term. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, no, the problem says that in the part where the particle can exist (where the wave function is non-zero), the function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But wait, that seems a bit odd because the wave function should be zero outside the region where the particle is found. Wait, but the problem says that when they measured, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside that interval. So perhaps the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. That makes sense because the possible outcomes of the measurement are between 1 and 3. So the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's a complex function. But when you square it, you get the probability. Wait, no, because the wave function's modulus squared is |ψ(x)|². So for a complex wave function, ψ = A + Bi, then |ψ|² = A² + B².

But wait, in this case, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5)i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the modulus squared would be (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Because the square of the imaginary part is (0.5i)^2 ? No, wait no, when you take the modulus squared, you just take each component squared and add them. So (Re(ψ))² + (Im(ψ))².

So the probability density is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.25). But wait, the wave function must be normalized. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1.

But wait, that would mean integrating [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3. Hmm, but that seems a bit complicated. Let me write it down.

So the normalization condition is:

∫ (from 1 to 3) |ψ(x)|² dx = 1

Which is:

∫ [ (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx = 1

Wait, 0.5 squared is 0.25, so yes.

So the integral becomes:

a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3 + 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to3 = 1

Let's compute each part.

First part: ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluated from x=1 to x=3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first part is a² * ln(2).

Second part: ∫dx from 1 to3 is (3-1) = 2. So 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

Putting it all together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1

So:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a would be the square root of that. So sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close to this value.

Wait, but wait a minute. The wave function given in the problem is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But usually, the wave function is real in such cases, right? Otherwise, the presence of a non-zero imaginary part would complicate things. But perhaps in this case, the wave function is a complex function, but when considering the normalization, the imaginary part contributes to the probability.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in treating the wave function as complex. Let me think again. Another approach: perhaps the wave function is purely real except for a global phase, which doesn't affect probabilities. But in this case, the wave function has a real part and an imaginary part. So when you compute the modulus squared, both parts contribute.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So that's a + ib, where a is a real function, and b is also a real function. But in this case, the imaginary part is constant, -0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral becomes as I did before.

But wait, another thought: is the wave function given in the region where the particle exists (x between 1 and 3), and zero elsewhere. So the wave function is zero outside 1-3. So the integration is only from 1 to3.

So with that, the normalization gives a as approximately 0.85, which is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Let me compute a² again.

a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which rounds to 0.85. So yes, option B is correct.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is proportional to the modulus squared of the wave function, \(|\psi(x)|^2\), which is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The wave function is non-zero only between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\), as particles are not found outside this region. To normalize the wave function, the integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over this interval must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\)
2. \(\int_1^3 0.25 dx\)

For the first part, the integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln(1+x)\). Evaluating this from \(x=1\) to \(x=3\):

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

For the second part:

\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is closest to the option \(0.85\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
