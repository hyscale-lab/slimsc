Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the number of stars varying with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance, but I'm not 100% sure on the units. Wait, actually, parallax in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So yeah, plx = 1/d.

The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. Wait, that's the number of stars (N) equals 1 divided by plx to the fifth power. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But I need to find how the number of stars changes with distance. So I need to express N in terms of distance r, I guess. Let's denote r as distance. So since plx is 1/r, substituting that into the equation.

So plx = 1/r. Then, 1/(plx)^5 becomes (r)^5. So N ∝ r^5. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because when distance increases, how does the number of stars change? Oh wait, the number should decrease with distance because stars are less dense as you look further away. But according to this, N is proportional to r^5, which would mean more stars as r increases. That doesn't seem right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let's think again. The original relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, then 1/(plx)^5 is (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. But wait, that would mean as r increases, N increases, which is the opposite of what I expected. Maybe I got the proportionality wrong?

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the number of stars in a given volume as a function of distance. Wait, the number of stars per unit volume decreases with distance, but maybe the way the question is phrased is a bit different.

Wait, perhaps the number of stars in a particular region (like a shell at distance r) would depend on the volume. Because when you look at a larger distance, the volume of the shell increases, and if the density decreases, the total number could vary.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars is inversely proportional to plx^5. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance (plx = 1/d). So plx^5 is (1/d)^5 = 1/(d^5). So 1/(plx^5) would be d^5.

So N ∝ d^5. But that's the same as r^5. So for each unit increase in r, the number of stars increases by r^5? That seems like a lot. But the options have B as r^5. So that would be the answer. But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. Maybe I need to think about the differential, like the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r.

Wait, but the initial statement is that the number varies as 1/plx^5. So if you have more stars when plx is smaller, which happens when r is larger. So as r increases, plx^5 decreases, so 1/plx^5 increases. So N increases with r^5. But that's a bit counterintuitive because I thought that as you go further, fewer stars are visible. But perhaps the way the question is structured, it's not considering the flux or brightness but just the count as a function of parallax.

Wait, maybe I should model this mathematically. Let's say N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, then N = k * r^5, where k is a constant of proportionality. So the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. But this seems odd because in reality, the density of stars decreases with distance, so the
