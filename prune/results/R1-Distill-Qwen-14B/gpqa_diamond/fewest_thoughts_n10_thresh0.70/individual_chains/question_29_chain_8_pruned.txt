Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The bad guy here is a gene that's responsible for making this compound. The gene has five exons and four introns. The person is using EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, hoping to get rid of the compound.

They sequenced the target gene in all mutants and found changes in the first exon area. The task is to figure out which mutation is most likely to eliminate the compound. 

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change. I think I need to look at each mutation and see what effect it has on the protein, which is probably the anti-nutritional compound.

First, I should probably compare each mutant's DNA sequence to the intact gene. Let me write down the intact gene and each mutant's sequence for the affected area.

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Wait, looking at the first part. Intact has ATGTTTCTCGCTGG..., while Mutant 1 has ATGTTCTACGCTGG...

Let me see the changes. So, the first part of the intact gene is ATGTTTCTCGCTGG. Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGG. So, let's break it down. The intact gene's first part is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant 1 is:
ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Wait, the 5th and 6th nucleotides: Intact is TTT, Mutant 1 is TCT? Or wait, maybe I should align them better.

Alternatively, maybe I should look at the exons. The mutation is in the first exon, so any changes here would be in the coding region, leading to possible amino acid changes.

But wait, exon sequences are part of the mature mRNA, so any mutation in the exon could lead to a change in the protein.

Now, the idea is that the anti-nutritional compound is made by this gene. So, if we disrupt the gene's function, the compound won't be made. So, we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene product. That could be a premature stop codon, a frameshift, or a missense mutation that disrupts the protein's function.

Looking at each mutant:

Let me see each one's change.

Intact: starts with ATG (which is the start codon). Then TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGT... So, in the first part, instead of TTT, it's TTC. Let me see the DNA changes. So the first 6 nucleotides of the intact are ATGTTT, and mutant 1 is ATGTTCTA. Wait, maybe I should compare each nucleotide.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compare each mutant's sequence to the intact and see where the changes are.

Alternatively, I can think about what each change does in terms of the protein. So, the DNA sequence is the coding strand, which is the same as the mRNA except T for U.

So, the intact gene starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. Then the next codons are TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), etc.

Now, looking at Mutant 1: The sequence is ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTT... So, the first
