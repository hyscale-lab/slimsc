Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like this often relate to angular momentum or spin. Oh wait, muons have spin-1/2, right? So the operator here is probably the spin operator.

The question gives me the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices. Each component (X, Y, Z) is multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down:

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

I think these are the standard Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P is a vector operator with components along x, y, z.

Now, the direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. That means the direction can be represented as a vector (l, 0, m) since it's in x-z, so the y-component is zero. So direction vector n is (l, 0, m), and since it's a unit vector, l² + m² = 1. But perhaps I can parameterize it in spherical coordinates. Since it's in the x-z plane, the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and φ is zero because it's in the x-z plane. Wait, no, actually, if the direction is in x-z plane, φ is 0 or π? Wait, in spherical coordinates, φ is the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane. So if the direction is in x-z, then the projection on the y-axis is zero. So φ is either 0 or π, but perhaps it's more general to just say that the direction is (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) with φ=0. So the direction vector n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because when φ is 0, cosφ is 1, so it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but I might have to double-check that.

Wait, no. The standard spherical coordinates are (r, θ, φ) where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane. So a vector in the x-z plane would have φ=0 or π, because any other φ would take it into the y direction. So for n in x-z plane, φ=0. So the direction vector is (sinθ cos0, 0, cosθ) which simplifies to (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So the operator P along direction n would be P·n = Px * n_x + Py * n_y + Pz * n_z. But since n_y is zero, the Py term drops out. So P·n = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

Now, I need to find the eigenvector of this operator P·n corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Let me write out P·n explicitly. Since n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, but wait, wait: no, wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x = sinθ * cosφ. But since phi is zero, n_x is sinθ and n_z is cosθ. So P·n = (sinθ) Px + (cosθ) Pz.

Let me compute that. So substituting in the matrices:

Px is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], Pz is (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [ [0,1], [1,0] ] + cosθ * [ [1,0], [0,-1] ] ]

Let me compute the matrices inside:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding these gives:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So P·n = (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck:

Wait, the matrices are added together, so each element is added. So the (1,1) element
