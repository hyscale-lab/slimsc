Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says: Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator H = ε σ · n. Here, n is an arbitrary unit vector, ε is a constant with energy dimensions, and the σ components are Pauli spin matrices. We need to find the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.

Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems. The Hamiltonian here is a dot product between σ and a unit vector n, scaled by ε. So, the structure is similar to the Hamiltonian for a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field pointing in the direction of n.

Wait, the Pauli matrices σ are 2x2 matrices. So, σ · n would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² =1.

I think the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix combination like this can be found using some standard approach. Let me think about the general properties. For any unit vector n, the operator σ · n is a traceless Hermitian matrix since each Pauli matrix is Hermitian and traceless.

Wait, the eigenvalues of σ · n. Let's consider another approach. The trace of σ · n is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero, and n's components are just scalars. So the sum of eigenvalues will be zero. But for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues
