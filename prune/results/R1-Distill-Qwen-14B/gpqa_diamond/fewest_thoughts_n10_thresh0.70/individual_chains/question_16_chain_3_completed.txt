Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but I'll try to think it through. Optical activity means the compound has chiral centers, right? Or maybe it's about some kind of asymmetry that causes it to rotate plane-polarized light.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, but-1-ene is a double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents on each carbon... Hmm. The structure is Cl attached to C1 and a methyl group on C2. For (Z) configuration, the higher priority groups on each carbon are on the same side.

Wait, but does that make it chiral? Let me draw it. Structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but wait no, wait. Wait, the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group and another substituent.

Wait, but wait, butene is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3? Wait no, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), and then two more carbons. Wait, no, but but-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH3. So substituting Cl on C1 and methyl on C2? So the structure is Cl-CH₂-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? Wait no, but that's not possible because but-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 with a methyl group, and then two more CH2 groups? Wait, no, wait but but-1-ene is four carbons: 1 and 2 are double bonded. So if it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure is Cl-CH₂-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group and two other groups. Let me think again. The formula would be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond? No, wait, no, wait. The correct structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which is CH(CH3)), and then C3 and C4 are single bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is Cl-C1 double bonded to C2 (which is CH(CH3)), and then C3 and C4? Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons, so C1, C2 (double bond), C3, C4.

Hmm, maybe the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group and two other substituents). So C1 is Cl, C2 has a methyl and maybe two CH2 groups? Wait, no, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, which would be Cl-C1=C(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is Cl attached to one end of a double bond. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and two CH2 groups? No, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps it's (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene has a structure where the Cl and methyl group are on the same side of the double bond. But regardless, the point is, does this molecule have a chiral center?

Wait, for a molecule to have optical activity, it must have a chiral center or a plane of asymmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's about internal planes of symmetry.

In this case, the molecule is an alkene. Let's see: if the molecule has a double bond, can it have a chiral center nearby? Let me think. The molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: so the structure is Cl–C1=C(CH2CH3)–CH2CH3? No, wait. Wait but but-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₃. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1; 2-methyl would make C2 have a methyl group. So it's Cl–CH₂–C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, that's but-1-ene with Cl on C1 and methyl on C2. So the structure is CH₂Cl–CH(CH3)–CH₂–CH3? No, but that's single bonds. Wait, no, wait. The structure is Cl–CH₂–CH(CH3)–CH₂–CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, that can't be because but-1-ene has double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl–CH₂–C(CH3)=CH₂? No, because but-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, and 2-methyl would be a methyl on C2. So C1 is Cl, double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group and another substituent, which would be CH2CH3 perhaps?), wait no, wait C2 is connected to C3 and C4 as well? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps the key point is whether this molecule has a chiral center.

Wait, but the molecule is an alkene, but the substituents around it: Cl on C1, which is attached to CH2, but wait, perhaps the structure is Cl–C(=CH2)–CH(CH3)–CH3? No, perhaps it's Cl–C(=CH(CH3))–CH2–CH3? I'm not sure, but perhaps the molecule is CH₂=CH(CH2CH3)Cl, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl–CH₂–CH(CH3)–CH₂–CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the formula would be Cl–CH2–CH(CH3)=CH2? No, but that would be but-2-ene. Wait, but the question says but-1-ene, so the double bond starts at C1.

So, the structure is CH₂Cl–CH(CH3)–CH₂–CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no, that would be CH2=CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3 with Cl on C1? No, perhaps it's Cl–C(H)=CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3? Hmm, not sure. But the key point is: does this molecule have a chiral center?

Wait, in any case, for a molecule to be chiral, it must have no plane of symmetry and at least one chiral center or another form of asymmetry. So, if the molecule has a double bond, can that lead to chirality? Well, allenes can have chirality if they have proper substituents, but this is a simple double bond.

Wait, but looking at the molecule, perhaps it's a trans or cis isomer. But that doesn't affect chirality. So, perhaps the molecule (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene doesn't have any chiral centers. Let me think: the Cl is on C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and two other substituents. So, the structure is Cl–C1=C(CH3)–CH2–CH3. Wait, no, that's but-1-ene, so C1 is CH2, but with Cl attached. So, perhaps the structure is Cl–CH2–C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's but-1-ene with Cl on C1 and methyl on C2. So, the groups around C2 would be: methyl, CH2Cl, CH2CH3, and the double bond. Hmm. Wait, but that would make C2 attached to four different groups: methyl, CH2Cl, CH2CH3, and the double bond. Wait, no, because the double bond is a substituent that counts as a group. Wait, no, when counting substituents for a chiral center, the double bond is a substituent but perhaps not four different groups. Wait, no, because in a double bond, each carbon is connected to two other carbons (the double bond is between C1 and C2). So for C2 in this case, the groups attached are: methyl, CH2Cl, CH2CH3, and the double bond to C1. So four different groups. Does that make it a chiral center?

Wait, but wait, C2 is double bonded to C1, so it's sp² hybridized. Chiral centers must be sp³ hybridized. So, sp² carbons can't be chiral centers. So in this molecule, C2 is sp², so even if it has four different substituents, it's not a chiral center. So no, so this compound doesn't have a chiral center. So it won't exhibit optical activity. So the first compound is not chiral.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down. The base structure is hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Methano suggests a ring with a bridge. Isobenzofuran is a benzene ring fused to a furan ring. So, the structure has a bridge, perhaps a five-membered ring fused with a benzene.

The substituent is 8-(chloromethylene). Methylenes are CH2 groups, but chloromethylene would be Cl–CH2–? Or perhaps Cl attached to a carbon that's part of a double bond. Hmm. Alternatively, chloromethylene would be Cl–CH₂–, but more accurately, chloromethylene is CH₂Cl where Cl is attached to a CH2 group that's part of a double bond. Wait, maybe it's CH₂Cl attached as a substituent.

But regardless of the substituent, I need to determine if the molecule has a chiral center. The compound has specific stereochemistry: (3aR,7aS,E). So the E designation probably refers to the configuration around the double bond (if any). So, perhaps the molecule has bridgehead stereocenters, which are possible in certain bicyclic compounds, even though bridgehead double bonds are not usually allowed (Bredt's rule), but in this case, it's a bicyclic system with a bridge.

Wait, bridgehead chiral centers can occur in some cases. So, if the molecule has bridgehead stereocenters at 3a and 7a, then those are chiral centers. So each of them would contribute to the molecule's chirality. Additionally, the E configuration on another part (maybe a double bond) would not add a chiral center but could affect the overall symmetry.

So, this compound definitely has chiral centers. Therefore, it's optically active. So this is one.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would make it HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, succinic acid is H₂OOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH. So 2 and 3 positions are the two CH₂ groups. So 2,3-dimethyl would be H₂OOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, but the stereodescriptors are R and S. So the carbons 2 and 3 are each substituted with methyl groups and have specific configurations.

Wait, the structure is:

HOOC
|
CH(CH3) at C2 (R) and CH(CH3) at C3 (S).

So each of those carbons is connected to four different groups? Let me check. For C2: attached groups are HOOC-CH2 (from the adjacent carbon), CH3, and two other groups. Wait, no. Wait, the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So for C2 (the second carbon): attached groups are a succinate group (from the first carbon, which is connected to the other COOH), a methyl group, and two CH groups (from the adjacent carbons). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me think more clearly. The structure of succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When you add methyl groups to C2 and C3, you get HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, each CH(CH3) is attached to what? Let me imagine C2: it's connected to C1 (which is HOOC-CH), C3 (which is CH(CH3)-COOH), and two CH3 groups?

Wait, no. Each CH(CH3) group would be connected to two CH2 groups from the succinic acid, but with the methyl substitutions. Wait, no, for C2, the structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each CH(CH3) is connected to:

- The previous carbon (C1: HOOC-CH-)
- The next carbon (C3: CH(CH3)-COOH)
- Two CH3 groups?

Wait, no, that can't be. Because each carbon in a CH2 group would have two Hs, but with substitution, each CH(CH3) has one CH3 and three other groups. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me number the carbons:

1: HOOC-
2: CH2- (in succinic acid)
3: CH2-
4: COOH

But with 2,3-dimethyl, carbons 2 and 3 each have a methyl group. So carbons 2 and 3 are CH(CH3).

So looking at carbon 2:

- Connected to carbon 1 (which is a COOH group via CH2)
Wait, no: Carbon 1 is the first carbon, which is the COOH group. Wait, no, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So the four carbons are:

1: COOH (as -COOH)
2: CH2
3: CH2
4: COOH

So when 2 and 3 are methylated, they become CH(CH3). So for carbon 2, the groups attached are:

- COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (C2)
- CH(CH3) (C3)
- One more group? Wait, no, each carbon in a chain has four bonds. So, carbon 2 is CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-... Wait, no, carbon 2 is CH(CH3) connected to two CH2 groups? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is CH(CH3). So for C2:

- One bond to C1 (which is HOOC-CH)
- One bond to C3 (which is CH(CH3)-COOH)
- Two bonds to CH3 groups?

Wait, that can't be because each carbon can't have more than four bonds. So, perhaps the correct structure is that each of the middle carbons has two CH3 groups and two other substituents?

Wait, no. Wait, the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is a CH(CH3). So the substituents on C2 are:

- One to C1 (HOOC-CH)
- One to C3 (CH(CH3)-COOH)
- Two CH3 groups.

Wait, that's four substituents: the two CH3 groups, and the two adjacent carbons. So each CH(CH3) is attached to two other CH(CH3) groups. Wait, no, because C2 is attached to C1 (which is a COOH group) and C3 (which is a CH(CH3) group), plus two methyl groups. So, each middle carbon (C2 and C3) is connected to:

- COOH (via C1)
- CH(CH3) (on C3)
- Two CH3 groups.

Wait, but then each of these carbons (C2 and C3) has four substituents: two methyl groups, the adjacent carbons (C1 and C3 for C2, and C2 and C4 for C3). Wait, but C3 is connected to C2 and C4 (which is the other COOH group).

So, if the groups are:

For C2: 

- CH3 (two of them)
- C1 (which is connected to a COOH)
- C3 (which is connected to another CH(CH3) and a COOH)

Wait, but for a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. In this case, C2 has two methyl groups (so two same groups), C1 (which is a -CH2-COOH group?), and C3 (which is a -CH(CH3)-COOH group?).

Wait, no. Let me think again in terms of substituents for C2. C2 is attached to:

- a methyl group (CH3)
- another methyl group (CH3)
- a carbon from C1 (which is -CH2-COOH)
- a carbon from C3 (which is -CH(CH3)-COOH)

So the substituents are: two CH3, one -CH2-COOH, and one -CH(CH3)-COOH. So, are any of these the same? The two CH3 groups are same, so C2 has two identical substituents. Therefore, C2 cannot be a chiral center. Similarly for C3.

Wait, but the molecule has (2R,3S) configuration. So the question is, can these carbons be chiral centers? If each has two same substituents, then no. So perhaps this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. But wait, I might be getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure. Let me imagine the structure:

The succinic acid chain is:

COOH - CH2 - CH2 - COOH.

After adding methyl groups to C2 and C3:

COOH - CH(CH3) - CH(CH3) - COOH.

Now, each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has:

- Two CH3 groups?
No, because each CH(CH3) has only one CH3. Because each carbon is CH(CH3), meaning it has one CH3 and three other bonds. So each has:

C2: connected to C1 (which is CH2COOH), C3 (which is CH(CH3)COOH), and two CH3 groups?

Wait, that can't be because that would make four substituents. So:

C2: attached to:

- C1: which is (CH2) connected to COOH
- C3: which is (CH(CH3)) connected to COOH
- Two methyl groups (CH3)

Wait, that would make four substituents, but two are CH3. So the substituents are: two CH3, one -CH2-COOH, and one -CH(CH3)-COOH.

So two substituents are same (the two CH3), so C2 can't be a chiral center. Similarly for C3. So, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active. But wait, the question says (2R,3S), which implies that those carbons are stereocenters. So perhaps my analysis is wrong.

Wait, am I missing something? Let me count again. For a carbon to be a chiral center, it must be connected to four different groups. So, for C2 in this case:

What are the four groups attached?

1. One methyl group (CH3)
2. Another methyl group (CH3)
3. The adjacent carbon C1 (which is connected to a COOH group)
4. The adjacent carbon C3 (which is a CH(CH3) connected to another COOH)

So, substituents are:

- Two CH3 groups (same)
- C1: which is a CH2 group leading to COOH
- C3: which is a CH(CH3) leading to COOH

So, the substituents aren't all different because two are CH3. So, C2 can't be a chiral center. Same for C3. So, the molecule lacks a chiral center, so it's not optically active. So, this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but the question states (2R,3S) configuration. That can't happen if they aren't chiral centers. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Maybe the molecule has another feature that makes it chiral.

Wait, maybe I'm not considering the possibility that the two methyl groups are on the same side, making the molecule symmetrical. Wait, if both methyl groups are on the same side, then the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. But if they're on opposite sides, maybe not. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the entire molecule is symmetrical because the two methyl groups are in the same configuration.

Wait, but with (2R,3S), the configurations are opposite. So perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical. Let me think: the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)(R)-CH(CH3)(S)-COOH. So if the configurations are R and S, perhaps the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. But wait, each of the middle carbons has two CH3 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3, making it achiral despite the configurations. Because if the configurations are R and S, they could be mirror images of each other, leading to an overall symmetrical structure. So, the molecule may not be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the two stereocenters are actually in a meso compound. Because if the molecule has two stereocenters with opposite configurations and a plane of symmetry, it's a meso compound and thus achiral.

Wait, so if the two stereocenters are in a meso arrangement, then the molecule won't be chiral. So for example, tartaric acid is a meso compound when it has two stereocenters with opposite configurations and a plane of symmetry.

In this case, if the (2R,3S) configuration leads to a meso form, then the molecule is achiral. So, the compound (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid would be a meso compound and thus not exhibit optical activity.

So, that's the third compound. It doesn't exhibit optical activity.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Again, this is the same base structure as the previous compound, but with both configurations R.

So, the molecule is (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Let's see if this is a meso compound or not.

If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound. For example, if the two stereocenters are mirror images across that plane, then the molecule is achiral. But in this case, both are R configurations.

Wait, let me think about the structure again. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)(R)-CH(CH3)(R)-COOH.

If both configurations are R, then the substituents on each chiral center are arranged in the same way. So, perhaps the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, thus being chiral.

Wait, but wait, let's think about actual substituents. Each CH(CH3) is connected to:

- Two COOH groups (via the adjacent CH groups)
- Two CH3 groups.

Wait, no, each CH(CH3) is connected to four substituents. Let me think again.

If the molecule is (2R,3R), then the substituents on each CH(CH3) would be arranged in such a way that perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical. So, perhaps each of the two stereocenters is chiral and the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, but wait, does having two R configurations make the molecule chiral? Let me think about the structure. If the two stereocenters are on adjacent carbons and both are R, would that create a chiral molecule?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is identical to its mirror image. Wait, but if both are R, their arrangement might not be symmetrical. So, the molecule would have a chiral center. So, each of the two stereocenters (C2 and C3) is a chiral center, and the molecule as a whole is chiral.

Wait, but in the previous case, when both configurations were R and S (opposite), the molecule was a meso compound. So, in this case, both are R, so it's not a meso compound. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical activity.

So, this fourth compound is optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4 (since it's 3-en).

So the structure is a cyclohexene where C1 has an -OH group, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. The configuration is R, so the arrangement around C1 must be such that it's a chiral center.

Wait, but wait: for C1 to be a chiral center, it must be connected to four different groups. Let's see:

C1 is attached to:

- The cyclohexene ring (specifically, the adjacent carbons: C6, C2)
- An -OH group
- A hydrogen (since it's cyclohexane)
Wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the structure where C1 is -OH, and the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4.

So, C1 is connected to:

- C6 and C2 (as part of the ring)
- -OH
- And a hydrogen if it's a CH group.

Wait, let me think again. The structure is a cyclohexene ring, so the carbons are arranged in a ring. C1 has an -OH, and there's a double bond between C3 and C4.

So, C1's structure: it's part of the ring, connected to C2 and C6. Also, it has an -OH group. So the substituents on C1 are:

- -OH
- C2 (which is part of the ring)
- C6 (which is part of the ring)
- And a hydrogen.

So, is C1 a chiral center? Wait, for a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. In this case, C1 has:

- -OH
- Two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) which are part of the ring and might have similar substituents
- A hydrogen.

Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, the substituents on C1: C2 is a CH2 group (since the double bond is between C3 and C4), and C6 is a CH2 group as well. So, substituents on C1 are:

- -OH
- Two CH2 groups (C2 and C6)
- A hydrogen.

So, are the two CH2 groups (C2 and C6) substituents the same? If the ring is symmetric, then perhaps the substituents are the same, making C1 not a chiral center.

Wait, but in reality, the ring is not symmetric because the double bond is at C3-4, which is two positions away from C1. So C2 and C6 are not equivalent. Because the double bond is between C3 and C4, the structure of the ring would make C2 and C6 different.

Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, the substituents on C1 might be:

- The adjacent C2, which is connected to C3 (which is double bonded to C4)
- Adjacent C6, connected to C5 and C1.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on C1 are: -OH, two CH2 groups (but connected to different parts of the ring), and a hydrogen. So perhaps the substituents on C1 are all different, making it a chiral center.

Wait, but wait, in a cyclohexene ring, if the ring is in a chair conformation, would the substituents on C1 be all different? Let me imagine:

C1: connected to C6 (which is CH2), C2 (which is CH2, connected to C3 which is part of a double bond), -OH, and H. So, the substituents are:

- -OH
- C2 (which is CH2 connected to a double bond)
- C6 (which is CH2 connected to C5 and C1)
- H.

Are C2 and C6 substituents the same? Probably not because their positions relative to the double bond are different. So, C2 is adjacent to the double bond, while C6 is not. Therefore, the substituents on C1 are all different, making C1 a chiral center. So the molecule has a chiral center and is optically active.

So, the fifth compound is optically active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5, all in the s configuration. Let's see if this molecule is chiral.

First, each of the OH-bearing carbons (C1, C3, C5) would need to have four different substituents to be chiral centers. Let me think about the structure.

Each of these carbons is attached to:

- Two adjacent carbons in the ring (so two CH2 groups)
- An -OH group
- A hydrogen.

Wait, but wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. Each carbon is connected to two adjacent ring carbons and two other substituents. So, for C1:

- Connected to C2 and C6 (both CH2 groups)
- -OH
- H.

So, substituents are: -OH, two CH2 groups, and H. So, if the two CH2 groups are different, then the substituents would be different. But in a cyclohexane ring, the substituents on each carbon's adjacent positions may be same or different.

Wait, for a cyclohexane ring, each carbon has two adjacent CH2 groups. So, for example, C1 is connected to C2 and C6. Are C2 and C6 substituents same or different?

In this case, the molecule is 1,3,5-triol. So, C1, C3, C5 all have OH groups. Let me imagine the ring structure:

C1: OH, connected to C2 and C6
C2: connected to C1 and C3
C3: OH, connected to C2 and C4
C4: connected to C3 and C5
C5: OH, connected to C4 and C6
C6: connected to C5 and C1.

Wait, but each of the OH groups is on C1, C3, C5, which are every other carbon. So the ring has alternating OH and CH2 groups. So, each OH is on a carbon that's bonded to two CH2 groups.

Wait, but the substituents on each OH-bearing carbon would be:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (adjacent to the ring)
- H.

So, for each of these carbons (C1, C3, C5), the substituents are:

- OH
- CH2 (from C2 and C6 for C1; C2 and C4 for C3; C4 and C6 for C5)
- H.

If the CH2 groups are same, then substituents would be: OH, two same CH2 groups, and H. So, for each of these, substituents would be: OH, same CH2 groups, and H. That would mean each carbon has two identical substituents (the two CH2 groups), making them not chiral centers.

Wait, but wait: the CH2 groups are part of the ring, so for C1, the substituents would be:

- OH
- C2 (which is CH2 connected to C3)
- C6 (which is CH2 connected to C5)
- H.

But in a cyclohexane ring, the substituents on C2 and C6 would be the same if the ring is symmetric. Because in a 1,3,5-triol, the substituents would be symmetrically placed.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, the ring could be symmetric across a plane that passes through C2 and C5 (or some other positions), making the molecule achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral despite having three stereocenters. But each stereocenter must have four different substituents. If each stereocenter doesn't have four different substituents, then it's not a chiral center.

In this case, for each OH-bearing carbon (C1, C3, C5), the substituents are:

- OH
- Two identical CH2 groups (from their adjacent carbons)
- H.

So, each has two CH2 groups, which are same. So substituents are: OH, two same CH2, H. Therefore, each doesn't have four different substituents, so they aren't chiral centers. Hence, the molecule lacks any chiral centers and is not optically active.

Wait, but wait. If all three OH groups are on the same face (cis) or alternating, would that affect the symmetry?

Wait, the configuration is (1s,3s,5s). So, each OH group is in the same configuration. Let's imagine the ring. If each OH is on the same face, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the OH groups are all axial or all equatorial, the molecule could be symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is similar to inositol, which has multiple hydroxyl groups but is a meso compound.

Wait, inositol is a cyclohexane hexol and is a meso compound because it has multiple stereocenters but is achiral due to a plane of symmetry.

Similarly, this molecule has three stereocenters. Let me think: 1,3,5-triol with s configuration on each. So, each of the OH groups is on a carbon that's in a specific configuration. But if the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry, it would be achiral.

For example, if the molecule is symmetric with respect to a plane that passes through a certain axis, making mirror images of the stereocenters. So, in this case, if the configurations are s on all three, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and thus achiral.

Wait, let me think about the positions. 1,3,5 are opposite each other in the ring. So, if each OH is oriented the same way (all R or all S), the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. So, for example, if each OH is axial, then the molecule is symmetrical across the plane through the center of the ring. So, the molecule would be achiral.

Therefore, this sixth compound doesn't exhibit optical activity.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of a butan-1-one (which is a four-carbon chain with a ketone at C1).

The structure would be: cyclopentyl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with the ketone at C1. Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CHCO, wait no. Wait, butanone is either 2-butanone (most common), but 1-butanone would be CH₂CH₂CH₂CO, but that's not possible because you can't have a ketone at the end (it would be an aldehyde). Wait, perhaps it's 3-pentanone? No, the question says butan-1-one, which would be (CH2)3CO, which would be pentan-2-one. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the naming wrong.

Alternatively, butan-1-one would be CH₂CH₂CH₂CO, but that's not possible because ketones can't be at the end. So perhaps it's a typo, and it's butan-2-one, which is 2-butanone, but the question says butan-1-one, so the structure must be something else.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH2CH(CH3)2? No, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's impossible because the carbonyl can't be at the end of a chain; it needs to be between two carbon groups. So perhaps the correct structure is O=C-C(CH2Cyclopentyl)(CH2CH3) or something else. Maybe it's O=C-CH2-Cyclopentyl-CH(CH3)2? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more simply (cyclopentyl)methyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. But I'm not getting it right. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The structure is cyclopentyl attached to C1, which is a carbonyl group. So, the molecule would be cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

So, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3, with the cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon.

So the carbonyl carbon (C1) has:

- A cyclopentyl group
- A ketone (O)
- Two CH2 groups attached (one to C2, which is CH2, and another to C3, which is CH(CH3)).

Wait, but wait, the carbonyl carbon (C1) is connected to:

- Cyclopentyl group
- O
- Two CH2 groups (since the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2).

Wait, but even if that's the case, the substituents are cyclopentyl, O, and two CH2 groups (but those CH2 groups may not be same if the chain is longer).

Wait, no, the structure is butan-1-one, which is four carbons. So:

C1: CO
C2: CH2
C3: CH(CH3)
C4: CH3.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because butan-1-one would be CH3CH2CH2CO, which is impossible for a ketone. So perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is (cyclopentyl) attached to C1, which is a carbonyl group. So, C1 is the carbonyl, C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH3.

So the structure is:

O=C-(CH2)-CH(CH3)-CH3.

But the cyclopentyl is attached to C1, which is the carbonyl carbon. So, the substituents on C1 are:

- Cyclopentyl group
- O (as part of the carbonyl)
- Two CH2 groups?

Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon is only connected to three substituents: the cyclopentyl, the oxygen, and the adjacent CH2 group. Wait, no, a carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and connected to two other groups. So, in this case, the carbonyl carbon (C1) is connected to:

- Cyclopentyl
- O (double bond)
- CH2 group (leading to C2)

So, that's three substituents. But wait, that can't be right because a carbon can't have three bonds and leave the fourth. Oh, wait, no: the carbonyl group is double-bonded to O, and connected to two other groups. So, the carbonyl carbon (C1) is connected to:

- Cyclopentyl group
- The CH2 group (C2)
- Double-bonded to O.

So, that's three substituents plus the double bond. So, the substituents are cyclopentyl, CH2, and O. So, three different groups, but the double bond doesn't count as a substituent in this context.

So, the question is: does this carbon have four different substituents? Well, the substituents are:

- Cyclopentyl
- CH2 (which leads to C2)
- O (double bond)
- And a hydrogen? No, wait, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it has a double bond, making it a trigonal planar geometry, not tetrahedral. Therefore, it can't be a chiral center.

So, the carbonyl carbon isn't a chiral center. Now, are any of the other carbons chiral?

Looking at C2: connected to C1 (CO), C3, and two Hs. So, C2 is CH2, so it's not a chiral center.

C3: connected to C2 (CH2), C4, and a methyl group (CH3). So, substituents are CH2, CH(CH3), and two Hs. Wait, no, C3 is CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), and two Hs.

Wait, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

So, C3 is CH(CH3):

- Connected to C2 (CH2)
- C4 (CH3)
- And two Hs.

So, substituents are:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH3 (from C4)
- Two Hs.

Therefore, two substituents are same (the Hs), so C3 is not a chiral center.

C4 is CH3, so it's not a chiral center.

So, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it's not optically active.

Wait, but perhaps the cyclopentyl group is causing some kind of asymmetry. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. In the case of 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the substituents on the carbonyl carbon are cyclopentyl and a CH2 group. The question is, does the molecule have any other chiral centers.

But earlier analysis suggests that none of the carbons are chiral centers, so the molecule is not optically active.

So, let me recap each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers. Not optically active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Yes, has chiral centers. Optically active.

3. (2R,3S)-dimethyl succinic acid: Meso compound. Not optically active.

4. (2R,3R)-dimethyl succinic acid: Not a meso compound. Optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes, chiral center. Optically active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Meso compound. Not active.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No chiral centers. Not active.

So, the compounds that are optically active are numbers 2, 4, and 5. That's three.

Wait, let me count again:

2: active

4: active

5: active

So three compounds. But wait, wait, number 6: earlier I thought it's a meso compound and not active. Number 7: not active.

So, the total is 3.

But wait, the options are:

A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

So the correct answer would be option B)3.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or another form of asymmetry.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound is an alkene with the double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents on C2 include a methyl group, a chlorine atom, and two other carbons. However, C2 is sp² hybridized due to the double bond, so it cannot be a chiral center. Thus, this compound is **not optically active**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This bicyclic compound has specific stereochemistry at the bridgehead carbons (3a and 7a), which are both chiral centers. The E configuration of the double bond does not contribute to chirality, but the presence of two chiral centers makes the molecule optically active. Thus, this compound is **optically active**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid has the structure HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding methyl groups to C2 and C3 gives HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Each CH(CH3) carbon is bonded to two identical methyl groups, making them achiral. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Thus, this compound is **not optically active**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Similar to the previous compound, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. However, in this case, the configurations at C2 and C3 are both R, and there is no plane of symmetry. This lack of symmetry means the molecule is chiral and optically active. Thus, this compound is **optically active**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   This compound is a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group on C1. The substituents on C1 are -OH, two different CH2 groups (adjacent to the double bond), and a hydrogen, making it a chiral center. Thus, this compound is **optically active**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. Each OH-bearing carbon is bonded to two identical CH2 groups, a hydrogen, and an -OH group, meaning none of these carbons are chiral centers. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Thus, this compound is **not optically active**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   This compound has a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon (C1) and a methyl group on C3. The carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and cannot be a chiral center. None of the other carbons in the molecule are bonded to four different groups, so there are no chiral centers. Thus, this compound is **not optically active**.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are numbers 2, 4, and 5. Therefore, **three compounds are optically active**.
