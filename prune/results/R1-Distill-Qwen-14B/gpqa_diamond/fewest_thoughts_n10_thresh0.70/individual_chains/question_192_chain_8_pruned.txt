Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what's going on here. Hmm, the setup is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity. So, the conductor is initially uncharged, meaning it has no net charge. But inside the cavity, there's a small positive charge +q placed somewhere. 

Wait, the conductor has a cavity, which is a hollow space inside. The cavity is spherical as well, right? The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. Oh, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R, the radius of the conductor. So the conductor's outer part is R, and the cavity is inside, with radius r, not touching the conductor because s is the separation. So the cavity doesn't reach the conductor's surface.

The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. So point P is outside the conductor's outer radius. The distance from the center of the conductor to P is L. Also, the distance from the center of the cavity (where the charge q is placed) to point P is l. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is outside the conductor but the charge q is inside the cavity.

The angle between l and s is theta. I'm a bit confused about this
