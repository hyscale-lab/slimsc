Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the two speeds. Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't use the classical velocity addition. I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. Let me recall it. Oh yeah, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Or wait, is it (u' - v')/(1 - (u' v')/c²)? Oh wait, wait, no. Let me get it right. If one object has velocity u and the other v, from the perspective of the first object, the second is moving at (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so if I want the relative speed of the second astronaut from the first's frame, it would be (u2 - u1)/(1 - (u1 u2)/c²).

Wait, let's clarify. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c
