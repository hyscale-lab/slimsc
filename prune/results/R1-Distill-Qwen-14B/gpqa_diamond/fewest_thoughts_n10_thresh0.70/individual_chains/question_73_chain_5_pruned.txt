Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to figure out the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract them normally because of relativity effects. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the problem says astronaut A has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c. Astronaut B is 3m and moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but when they're moving in the same direction, how do we calculate the relative speed? I think it's not as simple as just subtracting the two speeds. Oh right, I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Let me make sure I got that right. So since both are in the same direction, I suppose we plug in v1 as 0.6c and v2 as 0.5c.

Calculating that, let's see. The numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1-0.3=0.7. So the relative
