Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question starts with compound A, which has two signals in its proton NMR. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and another is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, what does that tell me about the structure of A?

Wait, in NMR, the number of protons corresponds to the integration, right? So 6H as a triplet and 4H as a quartet. A triplet usually means it's next to a CH2 group because each proton adjacent would split into a triplet. Similarly, a quartet suggests it's next to a CH3 group, since each proton would split the signal into four peaks.

So maybe the structure is a di-substituted alkane. Let's think: if I have a group with 6H as a triplet, that's likely two CH3 groups next to a CH2. Because each CH3 has 3H, so two would give 6H. And the quartet is 4H, so that's a CH2CH2 group? Wait, no. Wait, if it's a quartet for 4H, that would be two sets of two protons. Maybe it's two adjacent CH2 groups. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach. The triplet with 6H suggests two equivalent CH3 groups, each attached to a CH2. Because each CH3 would be adjacent to a CH2 (like in an ethyl group), which would cause the triplet. And the quartet with 4H would be two CH2 groups, each adjacent to a CH3.

Putting that together: it's likely a structure where there are two CH3 groups connected to a CH2, which is connected to another CH2, maybe a longer chain. Wait, let me sketch it.

So, something like CH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Let's think of a di-substituted ethane. Oh! Wait, what about neopentane? No, that's 2,2-dimethylpropane. Hmm. Or maybe it's an ethyl group connected to something else. Let me think about the splitting.

Wait, if there are two CH3 groups attached to a central CH2, and the central CH
