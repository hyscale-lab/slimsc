Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it out.

So the setup is: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, they put a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and at a distance l from the cavity's center. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so I need to find the electric field E at point P. Let me try to visualize this. The conductor is initially uncharged. When we place a charge +q inside the cavity, which is inside the conductor, what happens? I remember that in electrostatics, charges in conductors redistribute themselves. But wait, the conductor is neutral to start with. So when we put a charge inside the cavity, how does that affect the charges on the conductor?

Oh wait, right! When a charge is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, and the outer surface will have the same sign as the inner charge. Because the conductor was initially neutral, the total induced charge on the inner and outer surfaces must balance. Let me think: the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface +q. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, the inner and outer charges must sum to zero. So inner is -q, outer is +q.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. The conductor is neutral, so the total charge is zero. When we put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (inside the cavity) must have -q induced, because the charges in the conductor rearrange to oppose the field inside the conductor material. So the inner surface has -q. Then, because the conductor
