Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals are a type of crystal system where all the edges are equal, and all the angles are the same. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters a, b, and c are all equal, so a = b = c. And in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance is usually the distance between adjacent atoms along the edge of the unit cell. So in a simple cubic structure, that would be the edge length 'a'. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the case here, but I think so. So a is 10 Angstrom.

The question asks for the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance d is calculated using the formula from X-ray crystallography, which is the Bragg's equation, but more specifically, the formula for d is derived from the reciprocal lattice.

The formula I think is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cosα) + 2(hl cosβ) + 2(kl cosγ) ) ) where h, k, l are the Miller indices. Wait, but wait! That seems a bit off. I think the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos γ) ) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Because in some sources, I remember seeing a different arrangement of signs. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, let me double-check. The general formula for the interplanar spacing in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is given by:

1/d² = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - 2hk cos(α) / (ab) - 2hl cos
