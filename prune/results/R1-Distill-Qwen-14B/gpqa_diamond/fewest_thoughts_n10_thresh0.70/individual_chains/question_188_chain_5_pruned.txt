Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral, right. I remember that a rhombohedral crystal system has all the edges equal, but the angles between them are all the same and not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees each. Wait, or is it different? Oh yeah, I think rhombohedral is one of the seven crystal systems where a is equal to b equals c, and the angles can be different, but in this problem, they’re all 30 degrees. Interesting.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance, d(hkl), is calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor. Oh right, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)(cos^2 α + cos^2 β + cos^2 γ - 2 cos α cos β cos γ) ) )

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused with something else. Oh wait, another approach. The general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector. So for a cubic system, it's simple, but for other systems like rhombohedral, it's a bit more involved.

Let me think. The formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos θ ), but wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should recall that for a general hexagonal or rhombohedral system, the formula involves the angles between the axes.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d(hkl) = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk + kl + lh) cos θ ) ]^(-1/2) ?

Wait, but I'm mixing up some terms here. Alternatively, the correct formula for d is a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + kl
