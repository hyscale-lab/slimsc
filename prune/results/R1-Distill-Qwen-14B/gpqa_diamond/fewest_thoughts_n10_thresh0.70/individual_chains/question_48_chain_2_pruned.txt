Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. Okay, the problem involves a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. Then, each product goes through different reactions, and finally, I need to find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? So, the structure is a six-membered cyclohexane ring with a ketone group (O) attached.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2), forming product 1. Bromine is a dienophile, I think. So, this must be a Diels-Alder reaction. Wait, wait, cyclohexanone isn't a diene, though. Oh wait, maybe it's an enolate formation? No, wait. Cyclohexanone can undergo a [2+4] cycloaddition with bromine in certain conditions. Oh, wait, perhaps it's an addition reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination via enol formation.

Wait, another thought: cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When bromine (Br2) is added, perhaps it's a halogenation. Oh, right! I think in the presence of a base, the carbonyl can form an enolate, which attacks Br2. But wait, wait, cyclo
