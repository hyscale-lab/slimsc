Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that an electron is moving at a speed v of 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. The options are from 1e-18 J down to 1e-19 J, so I think it's going to involve some exponentials.

Wait, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh right, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So, I can use this to find Δp, the uncertainty in momentum.

Let me write down the formula: Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Wait, no, more accurately, the minimum uncertainty is when it's equal to ħ/2. So, Δp = ħ/(2Δx). But wait, sometimes people just take Δp ≈ ħ/Δx for order of magnitude estimates, so maybe I can just use Δp ≈ ħ/(Δx) for simplicity. Because if I take the minimum uncertainty, it's the smallest possible Δp, so I'll proceed with that.

So, given Δx is 0.1 nm. Oh wait, 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters, right? Because 1 nm is 1e-9 m, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 m.

Plugging the numbers in: ħ is about 1e-34 J·s, divided by 1e-10 m. So Δp ≈ 1e-34 / 1e-10 = 1e-24 kg·m/s? Wait, no, wait, that's 1e-34 divided by 1e-10 equals 1e-24? Yes, because 1e-34 /1e-10 is 1e-24.

Wait, but wait a minute, units. ħ is J·s, which is kg·m²/s. So when you divide by meters (Δx), you get kg·m/s, which is correct for momentum. So that's correct.

Now, to find the uncertainty in energy ΔE, I think I need to relate the uncertainty in momentum to the uncertainty in energy. Since the electron is moving at speed v, maybe I can use the kinetic energy formula. But wait, the uncertainty in energy is related to the uncertainty in momentum through the energy-momentum relation.

Wait, the kinetic energy K is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So the uncertainty in energy ΔK would be approximately (Δp²) / (2m). Because for small uncertainties, the derivative of K with respect to p is p/(m), so using ΔK ≈ (Δp) * (dK/dp) ) = (Δp)
