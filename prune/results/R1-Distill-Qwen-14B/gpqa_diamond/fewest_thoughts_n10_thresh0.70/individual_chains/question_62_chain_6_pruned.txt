Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target molecule. The name suggests a cyclohexane ring with two substituents. One substituent is a carbaldehyde group, which is a CHO group attached to the cyclohexane. The other is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. Wait, hydroxy methyl would be a CH2OH group, right? And it's attached to another cyclohexyl group. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a CH2OH attached, and that CH2OH is also connected to another cyclohexane ring. Plus, there's a carbonyl group (CHO) attached somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. Okay, the main ring is cyclohexane. Attached to it is a CH2 group. On that CH2, there's an OH group and a cyclohexyl group. So, it's like cyclohexane-CH2-OH but also connected to another cyclohexane? Hmm, no, wait, maybe it's CH2OH, but that CH2 is connected to another cyclohexane ring. So, the molecule is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl attached to the main cyclohexane, and there's a carbaldehyde group on the main ring as well.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group, which is a carbon-carbon triple bond, so it's like CH2-Câ‰¡CH attached to the cyclohexane.

So, to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target, what reactions do I need?

Let me think about the steps. I remember that when dealing with triple bonds, possible reactions include hydrogenation, oxidation, and maybe some kind of addition or elimination. Also, cyclopropane rings can form under certain conditions.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached as
