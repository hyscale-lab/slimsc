Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty in Pz given that the system is in an eigenstate of Px with a specific eigenvalue.

Alright, let's start by understanding what each part means. The operator Px has a matrix form given. Similarly for Py and Pz. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which I think means that the state vectors are expressed in the eigenbasis of Pz. So the state provided is already in this basis.

The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Wait, that's three components, so it's a 3x1 vector. So the system is in a three-dimensional space, probably spin-1 or something similar because the eigenvalues for Pz are ±ħ and 0, looking at the matrix of Pz.

The problem is to find the uncertainty ΔPz. I remember that uncertainty is calculated using the standard deviation formula. So ΔPz = sqrt( <Pz²> - <Pz>² ). But wait, since the state is an eigenstate of Px, what's the expectation value of Pz in this state?

Wait, no, the expectation value of Pz in the state might not be zero, but since the state is an eigenstate of Px, not Pz, it's not an eigenstate of P
