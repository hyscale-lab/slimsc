Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both are detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass. But Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and both orbits are circular.

The host stars have the same radius, but Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but same radiusâ€”so that's interesting. I remember that a star's radius affects the transit probability because a larger star would have a smaller chance of the planet transiting in front of it from our line of sight. But since both stars are same radius, maybe that part cancels out in the probability ratio.

So, transit probability depends on a few factors: the size of the planet relative to the star, the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight, and the orbital period. Wait, no, the orbital period affects how often we can observe transits. But the question is about the probability of a transit occurring during the observation, not how often it happens. Wait, no, the transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough to cause a transit. So it's more about the alignment with our line of sight.

Oh right, the probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula (R_planet + R_star) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Or perhaps it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but that's not exactly accurate either.

Wait, the transit probability is actually the probability that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is such that it passes in front of the star. This is a function of the inclination of the orbit. The probability is higher if the orbit is more likely to be aligned edge-on. But wait, for a star with a given radius, the probability is (R_star / a) * (something?), or is it the other way around?

Wait, I think the formula for the transit probability is (R_*/ a) * ( (R_p + R_*)^2 )^(1/2) / (
