Okay, so I have this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what it's about. The question is about detecting transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting, given their limited time. 

Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. But wait, I think there's another factor related to the orbital period and the star's size. Oh right, because the alignment depends on the planet's orbital plane being edge-on enough for the transit to occur.

Wait, but both planets have already been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The RV method gives the minimum mass because it depends on the planet's velocity along our line of sight. But in this case, both planets have the same mass, so that's the same. So minimum mass is same, but actual masses could be higher, but that might not matter here.

The key here is the probability of a transit. I think the probability is higher when the star is larger and the planet's orbital distance is smaller relative to the star's radius. Or wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think. The probability of a transit is proportional to (R_star / a), where R is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Because if the star is bigger relative to the planet's orbital distance, the alignment needed for transit is more likely. No, wait, the transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The probability is roughly (R_star / a) where a is the distance of the planet's orbit. Or is it (R_star / (a)), or (R_star / (a)) multiplied by something else?

Wait, I think the formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_star + R_planet) / a

But R_planet is much smaller than R_star
