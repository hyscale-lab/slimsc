Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required to accelerate a specific nucleus to a certain speed. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium has 3 protons. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it lithium-6, because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 total nucleons. So the nucleus is ^6Li.

I remember that energy in particle accelerators is often given in terms of the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. So I need to clarify that. The problem says "the energy of RHIC," which typically refers to the kinetic energy, but I should think about it.

Wait, no, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of the collider, it's the total energy, not just kinetic. Because the kinetic energy is part of the total. So the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but wait, in high-energy physics, the kinetic energy is a significant portion of the total, especially at relativistic speeds.

Wait, no, the energy given by accelerators is usually the kinetic energy. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. For example, in the case of electrons in an accelerator, the energy is the kinetic energy. Because the rest mass of an electron is negligible compared to the kinetic energy when it's moving at relativistic speeds. But for heavier particles like heavy ions, perhaps it's similar, but maybe the total energy is considered.

Wait, no, I think for heavy ions, the energy is the kinetic energy. Because the rest mass is much larger than in the case of electrons. Wait, but maybe not. I'm a bit stuck on this point.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy provided by the collider is the kinetic energy. So I need to compute the kinetic energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c.

So first, let's find the gamma factor, because gamma is the Lorentz factor, which relates the rest mass energy to the total energy.

Gamma is given by 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

Given v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) is, let's see, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me compute that exactly. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.57142857... So about 3.5714.

But wait, another approach: 0.96 is 24/25. So (24/25)^2 = 576/625, right? So 1 - 576/625 = 49/625. So sqrt(49/625) is 7/25 = 0.28, same as before. So gamma is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, 25 divided by 7 is approximately 3.5714. So yes, gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the total energy E of the nucleus is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy.

The rest mass energy is m*c². So I need to find the mass of the ^6Li nucleus.

Lithium-6 has a mass number A=6. So the mass is approximately 6 times
