Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about two different reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B from each. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different products for A and B.

First, I'll look at the first reaction. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene, and the reagents are BuLi followed by H+. So I need to figure out what happens in this scenario.

I remember that BuLi is a strong base, usually used as a deprotonating agent, especially for compounds with acidic hydrogens. The structure given has an ether linkage: the benzene ring is connected to an oxygen, which is attached to a methyl group and a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Wait, let me draw that out.

The structure is (Ph-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2?), no, wait. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. So the 1-yl would be the end with the double bond. So the substituent is CH2-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, maybe I should think again. The structure is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl benzene. So the benzene has a substituent which is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me clarify:

The group is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl, which is a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at position 2 and a methyl at position 3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but it's connected as the 1-yl group, meaning the substituent's attachment point is the first carbon. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- but with a double bond. Wait, no, but 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH
