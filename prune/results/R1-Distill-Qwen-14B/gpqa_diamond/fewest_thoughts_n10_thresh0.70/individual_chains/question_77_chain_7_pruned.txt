Okay, I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. The question involves two reactions: one using BuLi and then H+, and another involving heat, which is probably a Cope rearrangement. Hmm.

So let's break it down. The first reaction is with (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. I think that's a benzene ring with a substituent, which is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl group. Wait, maybe I should draw that structure. So the benzene has a methylene group (CH2) attached. That CH2 is connected to an oxygen (O), which is connected to another group. The other group is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. Let me see: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, no. Let me think again. The structure of but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2- attached at the first carbon. So the group is CH2=CHCH2CH3 but wait, no, wait. Wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl, so the structure is OCH2-(but-2-en-1-yl with a methyl on C3). Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me write it correctly.

But-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but correct structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait that's but-1-en-3-yl? Maybe I should clarify. The structure of but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- attached at the first carbon. So the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, wait. Let's think again: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-CH2- but that
