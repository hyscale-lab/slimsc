Okay, let's try to tackle this physics problem. Hmm, the question is about an annihilation process involving protons and antiprotons. So, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. I remember that in particle physics, when particles and their antiparticles annihilate, they convert into other particle-antiparticle pairs, right?

The problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, which probably means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Wait, no, wait. Oh, but wait, if it's moving slowly, then maybe we can approximate some terms. Or perhaps it's the opposite; maybe the antiproton is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, but the problem states it's "slowly moving," so maybe it's non-relativistic. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that for now.

The mass of particle A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. So that's the rest energy of A. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So each A⁺ and A⁻ must have some charge. But I'm not sure yet how the charge plays into this, maybe it's just about conservation of energy and momentum.

So, the process is an annihilation, but wait, protons and antiprotons annihilate, but they usually produce pions. But in this case, it's producing two A⁺ and two A⁻. So, perhaps A is a new hypothetical particle. Anyway
