Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. 

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key data points are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 milliangstroms for planet #2. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is proportional to (M_p sin i)/(M_star^(1/3)) * (P/(2π))^(1/3), where M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and P is the orbital period. But wait, since the planets' masses are similar and the stars' masses are the same, maybe I can simplify this.

But wait, I think the formula for K is K = (v) = (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * ( (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3) )

But since e=0 (circular orbits) and M
