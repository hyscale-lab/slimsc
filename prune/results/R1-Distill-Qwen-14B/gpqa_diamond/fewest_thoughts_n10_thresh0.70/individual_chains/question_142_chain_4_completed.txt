Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices, and I'm trying to figure it out. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (like a statistical mixture of states) rather than a pure state.

First, I need to understand what this ρ looks like. The |0><0| and |1><1| are projectors, right? Each of them is a rank-1 projector. So when I add them and multiply by 1/2, I'm creating a diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal elements. Because |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and 0 elsewhere, same for |1><1|. So adding them gives a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere, and then multiplying by 1/2 gives 1/2 on the diagonal.

So the density matrix ρ is:

ρ = [[1/2, 0],
     [0, 1/2]]

Wait, actually, in the computational basis, |0> is [1, 0]^T and |1> is [0,1]^T. So |0><0| would be a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly for |1><1|. So adding them gives a 2x2 identity matrix, scaled by 1/2. So ρ is (I)/2, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I think this relates to the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit state, any density matrix can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector (r) is a vector in 3D space, with components (x, y, z), and the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices.

The general form for a single qubit density matrix is:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector (x, y, z). So if I can express the given ρ in this form, I can find r.

Given ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is (I)/2 since |0><0| + |1><1| is I. So that would imply that the Pauli terms sum to zero because (I + 0)/2 = I/2, so r must be (0,0,0).

Wait, let me check. Let's substitute:

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2.

But our ρ is I/2. So setting up the equation:

I/2 = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2.

Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

Since the Pauli matrices are all non-zero and linearly independent, the only solution is r_x = r_y = r_z = 0. So the Bloch vector is (0,0,0), which is the origin. That makes sense because ρ is a completely mixed state, which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. In contrast, pure states are on the surface of the sphere.

Looking at the options:

A) (1,1,0) → That's a point on the Bloch sphere, but not the origin.

B) (0,0,1) → That's the north pole, which would be the pure state |0> or |1>, depending on how you look at it.

C) (0,0,0) → The origin, which matches our conclusion.

D) (1,1,1) → That's another point on the sphere, but again not the origin.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the \(2 \times 2\) identity matrix. In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that the Pauli terms must vanish, meaning \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which represents a completely mixed state.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) (1,1,0):** This is a point on the Bloch sphere but does not correspond to the origin.
- **B) (0,0,1):** This is the north pole of the Bloch sphere, representing a pure state, not the mixed state.
- **C) (0,0,0):** This is the origin of the Bloch sphere, correctly representing the completely mixed state.
- **D) (1,1,1):** This is another point on the Bloch sphere but not the origin.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the qubit space.

Answer: C
