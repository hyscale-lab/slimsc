Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission, and I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy (relativistic) and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation for the more massive fragment. Hmm, let's break this down.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So wait, M's rest mass is 300 GeV, but the sum of the two fragments is 0.99*M, which is 0.99*300 GeV = 297 GeV. That's 3 GeV less than the initial mass. So there's mass defect, and that energy is released as kinetic energy, right?

Wait, but actually, in fission, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum should be conserved. Since it's initially at rest, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momentum to conserve it. So their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let me note down the given data:

- M_initial = M, rest energy = 300 GeV.
- After fission, two fragments: mass m1 and m2.
- m1 = 2 * m2.
- m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.

Wait, but the sum is 0.99*M. So, 3 M = m1 + m2 = 0.99 M? Wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, M is the initial mass. So the sum of the two fragments' masses is 0.99*M. So M is 300 GeV/c², so the sum of the two fragments is 0.99*300 = 297 GeV/c².

Let me assign variables:

Let me let m2 be the mass of the lighter fragment. Then m1 = 2 m2. So m1 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M. Wait, no, because 3 m2 = 0.9
