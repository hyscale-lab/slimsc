Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission. Hmm, let me see how I can tackle this. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. And the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value using the classical approximation.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum after fission must be zero because momentum is conserved. That means the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Oh right, because if one is moving one way, the other must balance it out.

Let me jot down the given information:

- Initial rest mass energy: 300 GeV. So M c² is 300 GeV. Wait, but when we're dealing with mass, do we need to consider c²? Hmm. Maybe not in the end because we're comparing kinetic energies, which are in terms of rest mass energy.

- After fission, two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. So let me denote the masses. Let the smaller mass be m, so the larger is 2m. But wait, the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So m + 2m = 0.99 M. That is 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So the two fragments have masses 0.33 M and 0.66 M.

Wait, wait. Because 0.33 + 0.66 is 0.99 M, right. But the initial mass is M, so there's a loss of 1% of the mass, which goes into energy, probably kinetic.

Now, the nucleus is initially at rest, so the total momentum after fission is zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2.

But wait, in classical mechanics, momentum p = m v. So p1 = m1 v1, p2 = m2
