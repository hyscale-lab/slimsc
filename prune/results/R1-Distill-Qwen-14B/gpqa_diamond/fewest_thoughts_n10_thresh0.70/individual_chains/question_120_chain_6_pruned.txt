Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is asking about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Okay, I remember that parallax is related to distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, but I'm not sure if that refers to uniform number density in space or something else. Oh, wait, when they say uniformly distributed, I think that usually means that the number density of stars is constant throughout space. So, the number of stars in a certain volume doesn't depend on where you are in that volume.

Parallax (plx) is measured in arcseconds, right? And the formula connecting parallax to distance is plx = 1 / (distance in parsecs). So, distance d = 1 / plx. But wait, when considering a range of parallaxes, like from plx to plx + dplx, each star contributes to that range based on their distances.

I'm trying to think about how the number of stars relates to parallax. Let's see, if we have a range of parallax values, how does the number of stars in each such range depend on plx.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a spherical shell depends on the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell between distances d and d+dd is approximately 4πd² dd. Because the number density is constant, say n stars per cubic parsec, the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4π d² dd.

But wait, plx is 1/d. So d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that into the expression. The number of stars in a shell between plx and plx + dplx (since d decreases as plx increases) would be n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx). Wait, but how does this translate to number per unit plx?

Wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So, the number of stars in a small range dplx is proportional to (1/plx²) dplx. So, the number per unit plx (dplx=1) would be proportional to
