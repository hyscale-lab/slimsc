Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, I remember SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework where you write down all possible interactions (operators) that can be added to the Standard Model, respecting certain symmetries.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I think Lorentz symmetry is a big one because all the operators in the SMEFT are constructed respecting Lorentz invariance. Because without that, you can't have a consistent theory that works in different inertial frames.

Then what about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. Oh wait, I remember that Poincare symmetry is more about the overall structure of spacetime, including translational invariance. But does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry for all operators? Or is it automatically included because the Standard Model already respects it?

Wait, the Standard Model is Poincare invariant. So SMEFT, being an effective theory built from the Standard Model, would also respect Poincare symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry too. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Maybe SMEFT is constructed in a way that includes all possible terms that are Lorentz and gauge invariant, but does that automatically make them Poincare invariant
