Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f_bar(y)(upsilon + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, not exactly sure what that implies, but I remember that the interaction terms in the Lagrangian determine what particles can decay into each other.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different possible fermion pairs.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the energy of the boson must be enough to produce the daughter particles. So for a decay X → f f_bar, the mass of X (which is 6 GeV) must be greater than or equal to twice the mass of the fermion f. Oh right, because each fermion would carry away some energy, and the minimum would be when they are at rest, so 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So I need to find all possible fermions (like quarks, leptons) where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. Let's think about the masses of the known particles.

But wait, particles like quarks have constituent masses, but in reality, for decay purposes, I should use their current masses. So let me list the masses of the fermions.

Electron (e-): about 0.0005 GeV
Muon (mu-): ~0.105 GeV
Tau (tau-): ~1.777 GeV
Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV (current mass is very light)
Down quark (d): ~0.004 GeV
Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV
Bottom quark (b): ~4.1 GeV
Top quark (t): way too heavy, like 173 GeV

Wait, but wait. The X boson is 6 GeV, so any fermion with mass m where 2m ≤6
