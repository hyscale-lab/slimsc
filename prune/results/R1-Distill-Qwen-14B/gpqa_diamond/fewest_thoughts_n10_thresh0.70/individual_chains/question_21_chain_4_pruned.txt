Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically dealing with isomerism and tautomerism. Hmm, I need to figure out which compounds show or don't show certain properties.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let me tackle them one by one.

Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione?

Wait, tautomerism involves the transfer of a hydrogen and a shift of electrons, right? It usually happens in compounds where a hydrogen can shift between two adjacent atoms, like in keto-enol tautomerism.

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Quinones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism because they have conjugated carbonyl groups. So benzoquinone probably does show tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, all in the 1,3,5 positions. So the structure is like O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C, all alternating. Since all the ketones are conjugated, maybe they can tautomerize. Wait, but tautomerism requires a hydrogen that can shift. Each ketone has adjacent carbons that aren't necessarily attached to hydrogens. Hmm, wait. Let me think again. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is between two CH2 groups? Or maybe each is between two carbons that are part of the ring. Wait, no, the structure would be O=C-(CH2)-O=C-(CH2)-O=C, but in a ring. So each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group on either side. So each CH2 is next to a carbonyl. That would mean that each CH2 has alpha hydrogens. So each ketone in the trione can potentially lose a hydrogen and form an enol, right?

Wait, but wait. For tautomerism, you need at least one alpha hydrogen. Let's see. In benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to the benzene ring, which is sp2 hybridized. So the adjacent carbons are carbons in the ring, which don't have hydrogens attached because
