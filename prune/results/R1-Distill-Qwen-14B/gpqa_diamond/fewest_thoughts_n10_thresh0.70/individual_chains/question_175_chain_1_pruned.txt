Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the radiation from an oscillating charge distribution. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The setup is that there's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. The question is about the radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone. The function is given as f(λ, θ), and we're supposed to find two things: the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at θ=30 degrees, and the possible form of f.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a fraction and a power dependence on λ. The fractions are 1/2, 1/4, 3/4, and the λ dependencies are λ^-4, λ^-3, λ^-6.

Alright, first I need to think about how the power radiated varies with angle θ. I remember that for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is given by the dipole formula. For an oscillating dipole, the power radiated is proportional to (dipole moment)^2 times something with angles.

Wait, in dipole radiation, the power per unit solid angle (the radiation pattern) is proportional to (1 + cos²θ)/2, isn't it? So the function f would have something like (1 + cos²θ) dependence. Or maybe wait, no, I think another way. The intensity (power per unit solid angle) for a dipole is proportional to (sin²θ), because for a dipole, the radiation is maximum at the equator (θ=90 degrees) and minimum along the poles (θ=0, 180).

Wait, let me think again. The dipole radiation pattern in terms of the electric field is E proportional to sinθ e^{iφ}, but the power is proportional to E squared, so the intensity would be proportional to sin²θ. So the intensity peaks at θ=90 degrees. So the maximum intensity is when sinθ is 1, so at θ=90, the intensity is maximum. But in this question, the maximum power is A, which would be the maximum value of f(λ,θ), which occurs at θ=90°, right?

So for the intensity, f(θ) would have a maximum at θ=90°, and that maximum would be A. The question is asking what fraction of A is the power at θ=30°, so we need to compute f(30°)/A.

Given that f is maximum at θ=90°, and the function is proportional to sin²θ, then f(θ) = f(90) * sin²θ. Wait, no, wait. Because wait, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin²θ, so the maximum is when sinθ is 1, so f(θ) = K sin²θ, where K is a constant. So the maximum power A is K*(1)^2 = K.

So at θ=30°, sinθ is 0.5, so sin²θ is 0.25. So the power at θ=30 is K
