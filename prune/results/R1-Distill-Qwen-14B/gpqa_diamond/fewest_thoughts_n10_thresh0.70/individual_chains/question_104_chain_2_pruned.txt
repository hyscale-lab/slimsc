Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the setup: two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The question is about the orbital periods of these planets based on the observed spectral line shifts.

Wait, so the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The star moves towards us, the spectral lines shift blue (shorter wavelength), and when it moves away, they shift red (longer wavelength).

The problem says that for Planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms. For Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. Wait, wait. So the maximum shift is 5 and 7? Or is it the periodic shift in the same spectral line? Oh, the question states the same spectral line for both. So the shift values are 5 and 7 milliangstroms respectively.

I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star. The formula I think is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/( (4π²) * P )^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of Kepler's third law. But wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by a specific formula. Let me recall: K is roughly proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (sin i) / (P)^(1/3), but maybe I'm mixing up terms. Alternatively, the formula I think is K = ( (27 * π * G )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given
