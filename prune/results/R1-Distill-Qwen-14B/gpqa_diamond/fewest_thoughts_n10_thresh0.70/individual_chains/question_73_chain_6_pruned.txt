Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to figure out their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds (like a significant fraction of the speed of light), you can't just use classical mechanics. I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula for the relative speed part. And for the total energy, I should calculate the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy, but wait, actually in relativity, total energy is given by the sum of their energies from their respective frames. Or wait, no, wait. Since they're moving in the same direction, their energies add up in the same frame, right?

Wait, let me clarify. The problem states that both astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction. So we can consider their velocities and calculate their energies in the same inertial frame, probably the rest frame of the combined system or perhaps the initial frame. Wait, no, the total energy would be the sum of their individual energies as observed from the same frame. But wait, the question is about the total energy of the system, which I think refers to the sum of their relativistic energies.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "the total energy of the system." So each astronaut has their own energy in the same frame. So each has their own relativistic energy, and the total is the sum. But wait, the options have different E
