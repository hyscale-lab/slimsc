Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think it through.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed. Oh right, when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract their velocities like you would in classical mechanics. I remember there's a formula for adding velocities relativistically. Let me recall... Oh yes! The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). But since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is v1 minus v2. So for this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So subtracting them gives 0.1c, but wait, I have to apply the relativistic addition formula.

Wait, no. Because when calculating the relative speed from one object's frame to another, it's not just the difference. Oh right, if I'm in the frame of the first astronaut (2m) moving at 0.6c, what would the second astronaut (3m) appear to be moving at?

So, let's call the first astronaut A (2m, 0.6c) and the second B (3m, 0.5c). The problem states both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed would be how fast B is moving relative to A.

The formula for relative velocity u' in A's frame is (vB - vA)/(1 - (vB vA)/c²). Wait wait, no, because in the lab frame, A is moving at vA, and B is moving at vB. So from A's perspective, B's speed is (vB - vA)/(1 - (vB vA)/c²). 

Wait, but wait! Let me double-check. The formula for transforming velocities is: u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of the object in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame (
