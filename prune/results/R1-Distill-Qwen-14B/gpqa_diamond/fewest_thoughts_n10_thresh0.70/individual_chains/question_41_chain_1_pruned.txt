Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me think about it. So the question is, a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, right, the speed of light in a medium is generally c divided by the refractive index n. So normally, when the medium isn't moving, the speed is v = c/n. But in this case, the glass is moving, so that complicates things.

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh wait, but wait, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is inside it. Do I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula here?

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving at speed v towards the observer. The light inside the glass is moving at v_light = c/n in the same direction as the glass's movement. So how does that work when you're considering the speed of the light relative to the lab?

I think I should apply the relativistic velocity addition formula here. The formula for velocity addition in special relativity is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). But wait, in this case, what's u and what's v in the formula?

Wait
