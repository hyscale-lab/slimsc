Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound is the correct one based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that FTIR and 1H NMR are the techniques used here. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. I think the broad peak at 3000 is probably due to O-H stretching because that's a common feature, especially if it's a broad peak. The 1700 region usually corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches that are usually even broader and appear around 2500-3300 cm^-1. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid. That makes sense because the 1700 peak would then be the C=O of the acid.

Now looking at the NMR data. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So there's no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens, which means the structure doesn't have any vinyl groups. That rules out any possibility of something like a double bond or an aromatic ring. So all the protons in the molecule must be attached to single bonds.

The 1H NMR shows some complex splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, this suggests that these protons are experiencing splitting from multiple neighboring groups. Let me think about how that happens.

Looking at the options, all are substituted carboxylic acids. Let's list them out:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So the structure is something like (CH3)(C2H5)CHCH2COOH. Wait, but the formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So each central carbon (the two middle Cs) is attached to a CH2COOH group and two substituents, one CH3 and one C2H5.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Here, the structure is (CH3CH2)C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the central carbons each have a CH2CH3, another C2H5, and then the COOH attached.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
This would be (CH3)2C-C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So each of the two middle Cs has two CH3 groups, and one CH2COOH group.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
So, (CH3CH2) attached to a C(H)(CH3), then another C(H)(CH3), and then the COOH group. So the structure is (CH3CH2)C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but looking back at the NMR, there are no vinyl hydrogens. So all structures are aliphatic. Now, the splitting in the NMR suggests that the protons are next to several sets of equivalent protons.

The splitting in the NMR is complex. Let me think about what causes a quartet of triplets or a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's
