Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully and try to break it down.

The problem talks about two mixtures, X and Y. Let me see what each step does.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm. So, decolorizing bromine usually means that the substance has unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or alkynes, which can undergo addition reactions with bromine. So, the mixture X must consist of compounds that can react with bromine, which explains why it decolorizes the solution.

Next, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also an equimolar mixture of two liquids but now Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Oh, right, because the reaction might be a hydrogenation or some kind of reduction. Since it's treated with platinum, which is a catalyst, and heated, that makes me think of hydrogenation—adding hydrogen across double bonds.

Wait, but the problem says it's a result of a disproportionation. Oh, right! Disproportionation is when an element in a compound undergoes both oxidation and reduction. So, the initial mixture X must have a compound that can disproportionate into two different products. Like, for example, maybe something like cyclopropane or another cyclic structure that can open up in a certain way.

The hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z. And Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%. Also, Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent. So, what's a common solvent that's a hydrocarbon? Maybe something like hexane, heptane, or perhaps something smaller like pentane? But wait, let's think about the hydrogen percentage.

Hydrogen's mass fraction is 14.28%. Let me calculate that. Suppose the molecule is CnH2m. The mass fraction of H is (2m * 1)/(12n + 2m) ) *100 =14.28. Let me think: 12n + 2m = (2m)/(14.28/100) → Wait, maybe it's better to approach it as: 

Hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28% → so (mass of H)/(mass of molecule) = 0.1428.

Hydrogen has a molar mass of 1 g/mol, carbon is 12. So, let's say the formula is CnH2k. Then, total molar mass is 12n + 2k. The mass of H is 2k *1 = 2k. So:

(2k) / (12n + 2k) ) = 0.1428 → 2k = 0.1428*(12n + 2k) → 2k = 1.7136n + 0.2856k → 2k -0.2856k =1.7136n → 1.7144k ≈ 1.7136n → approximately k ≈ n.

Hmm, that suggests that 2k ≈ 12n → k ≈6n? Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me re-do.

Wait, let's write the equation again:

2k / (12n + 2k) = 0.1428 → Multiply both sides by denominator:

2k = 0.1428*(12n + 2k) → 2k = (0.1428)(12n) + (0.1428)(2k) → 2k = 1.7136n + 0.2856k → Subtract 0.2856k from both sides:

2k - 0.285
