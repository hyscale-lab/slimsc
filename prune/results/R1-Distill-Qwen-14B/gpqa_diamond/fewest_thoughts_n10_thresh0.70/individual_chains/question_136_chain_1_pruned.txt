Okay, so I have this problem about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on vector calculus, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The vector field f(r) is given as having a magnitude of 1/r² and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. So, f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. I remember that the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates can be a bit tricky, but I think there's a formula for it.

Wait, the divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field A = A_r r̂ + A_θ θ̂ + A_φ φ̂ is (1/(r²)) [d(r² A_r)/dr + (1/sinθ) d(A_θ sinθ)/dθ + (1/(sinθ)) [dA_φ/dφ]]. But in this case, since the field only has a radial component, A_θ and A_φ are zero. So the divergence simplifies to (1/r²) d(r² A_r)/dr.

Right, so substituting A_r which is 1/r². Wait, A_r is 1/r², so r² A_r is r²*(1/r²) = 1. Then, taking the derivative of that with respect to r. The derivative of 1 with respect to
