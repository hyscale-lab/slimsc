Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about comparing the brightness variation caused by a planet transiting a star to the variation caused by star spots. So, the setup is that there's a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface, and these spots are cooler by 1000K. The star's effective temperature is 6000K. When this star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective, causing periodic changes in brightness. The problem says this situation can mimic an exoplanet's effect on the star's light curve. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same amplitude in brightness variation as these spots do.

Hmm. So, I need to calculate the relative radius of the planet to the star, Rpl/Rstar, such that when it transits, the dip in brightness is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

I remember that the change in brightness (the dip) when a planet transits a star is given by the formula:

ΔF = (Rpl / Rstar)^2

Because the area blocked is the area of the planet relative to the star, and flux is proportional to area. So the maximum dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Now, the star's brightness variation due to the spots is a bit more complicated. The spots are cooler, so when they come into view, the star appears dimmer. The total brightness change depends on how much of the star is covered by spots and the temperature difference.

Wait, the problem says that the filling factor is 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So spots cover 20% of the star's surface. The temperature of the spots is 1000K less than the rest of the star. So the star's effective temperature is 6000K, so the spots are at 5000K.

The star emits flux proportional to T^4 (Stefan-Boltzmann law). So the average flux per unit area on the star is sigma * T^4. The spots have sigma*(T-ΔT)^4 per unit area.

So the total flux when the spots are visible would decrease by the area covered by spots times the difference in flux per unit area.

Let me think. The star's total flux without spots is F0 = sigma * T^4 * (4π Rstar^2). But when spots are present, some areas are at lower temperature. The fraction of the area covered is f = 0.2 (20%).

The flux when spots are visible is F = F0 - f * (T^4 - (T-ΔT)^4) * sigma.

Wait, because each spot has area A, and there are f * A_total spots. So the flux from the spots is f * A * sigma (T_spot)^4.

So the total flux F = F0 * (1 - f ( (T_spot / T )^4 - ??? Wait, maybe another approach.

The star's total luminosity when spots are present is:

L = L0 * (1 - f [(T_spot^4)/(Teff^4)] )

Wait, no. Because the spots are cooler, their contribution to the total flux is less.

Wait, the star's normal flux is L0 = 4π Rstar^2 * sigma * Teff^4.

With spots covering f of the surface, the flux becomes: 4π Rstar^2 * sigma * [ (1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * (Teff - ΔT)^4 ]

Which can be written as L0 * [ (1 - f) + f ( (Teff - ΔT)^4 ) / Teff^4 ) ]

So the ratio of the flux with spots to the flux without is:

F = L0 [ (1 - f) + f ( (Teff - ΔT)^4 ) / Teff^4 ) ] / L0

Simplify:

F = (1 - f) + f * [ (Teff - ΔT)^4 / Teff^4 ]

So the change in flux is delta F = 1 - F = 1 - [ (1 - f) + f * ( (Teff - ΔT)^4 ) / Teff^4 ]

Alternatively, delta F = f [ 1 - ( (Teff - ΔT)^4 ) / Teff^4 ]

Wait, but wait—when the spots are on the side facing us, the flux decreases because some cooler areas are visible. The maximum dip in brightness would be when the entire spot area is on our side. So the dip is delta F.

But the question says that this dip is modeled as the same as the dip caused by a planet. So the dip from the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, and the dip from the spots is delta F as calculated.

So set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = delta F.

So let's compute delta F.

Given:

Teff = 6000 K

ΔT = 1000 K

f = 0.2

Compute (Teff - ΔT) = 5000 K.

Calculate (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

Hmm, 5/6 is approximately
