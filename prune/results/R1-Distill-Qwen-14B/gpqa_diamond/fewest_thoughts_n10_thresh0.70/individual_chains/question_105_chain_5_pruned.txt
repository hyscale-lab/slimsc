Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this astronomy problem here. Let me read it carefully and think through it step by step.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Observations of this star's brightness over time (a light curve) show periodic dips because the star is rotating, and as the spotted hemisphere comes into view, the brightness changes. The situation can mimic an exoplanet transit, making it look like there's a planet causing the brightness variations.

The question asks: To produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve, what should be the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star? The options are A to D.

Hmm. So I think the key here is to compare the brightness variations caused by the spots versus those caused by a planet. The amplitude of the dip in brightness when a planet transits a star depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. Similarly, the spots on the star would cause a dip in brightness when they rotate into view.

Wait, but let me think more carefully. The star itself has spots that are cooler, so when they are facing us, the total brightness would decrease because part of the star's surface is emitting less. But without spots, an exoplanet would block some of the star's light when it transits, causing a dip proportional to the planet's area over the star's area.

But in this problem, the star is already spotted, which affects the observed light curve. So the question is, how would the presence of a planet (without the spots) produce the same light curve amplitude as the star's spots do with a 20% filling factor and a 1000 K temperature difference.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me read the question again.

The star has spots covering 20% of one hemisphere. The situation can resemble an exoplanet. But the question says, "to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of the exoplanet?"

So if the star wasn't spotted, what exoplanet size would cause the same dip as the star's spots do when they are present.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the problem says that the observed variations can resemble an exoplanet. So when the star is observed, the brightness variations are due to the spots rotating into and out of view. But if the star had no spots, but instead a planet transiting, what size planet would cause the same dip in brightness.

So the amplitude of the dip caused by the spots is compared to the dip caused by a planet. We need to find the planet radius that would cause the same dip as the spots do.

Wait, but how does the spot affect the brightness? It's about the change in brightness when the spot is in a certain position.

But let's think about the star's brightness without spots. The star's total flux is based on its entire surface area. When a spot is present, that part of the star emits less flux. So when that spot is on the near side of the star (from
