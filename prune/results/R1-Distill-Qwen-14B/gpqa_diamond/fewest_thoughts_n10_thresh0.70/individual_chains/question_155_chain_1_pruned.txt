Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with operators and uncertainties yet. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's an operator P which has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these has a given matrix form in a certain basis. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which makes sense because typically, when you work in the eigenbasis of an operator, things simplify a lot, especially when dealing with eigenstates and uncertainties.

The system is found in an eigenstate of Px corresponding to the eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I'm supposed to find the uncertainty ΔPz, which is the standard deviation of the operator Pz in this state.

Hmm, okay, I remember that the uncertainty of an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(<A²> − <A>²), where <A> is the expectation value of A. So for Pz, I need to compute <Pz> and <Pz²>, then take the square root of their difference.

First, I need to find the expectation value <Pz>. That means I have to compute the state vector multiplied by the Pz matrix, then take the inner product, or perhaps more straightforwardly, compute each component multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of Pz.

Wait, Pz is a diagonal matrix because the basis is its eigenvectors. So the matrix of Pz is diagonal with elements [ħ, 0, -ħ] on the diagonal. Right, because the basis is the eigenvectors, so each basis vector |n> is an eigenstate of Pz with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ for the first, second, and third basis vectors, respectively.

The state vector is given as (−1/2, 1/√2, −1/2). Let me write that as a column vector:

|ψ> = [ -1/2;
          1/√2;
         -1/2 ]

Since Pz is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value <Pz> is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, because in the eigenbasis, each component of the state corresponds to the amplitude of that eigenstate. So the expectation value is the sum over i |ψ_i|² * (eigenvalue of Pz for state i).

So let's compute each term:

The eigenvalues of Pz are:
- For the first basis vector (i=1): ħ
- For the second (i=2): 0
- For the third (i=3): -ħ

The amplitudes squared (probabilities) are:
- |ψ₁|² = (-1/2)² = 1/4
- |ψ₂|² = (1/√2)² = 1/2
- |ψ₃|² = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4

So, <Pz> = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (ħ/4) - (ħ/4) = 0. So the expectation value is zero.

Now, I need to compute <Pz²>. Since Pz is diagonal, Pz squared is also diagonal, with each element being (eigenvalue)^2. So the eigenvalues squared are ħ², 0, and ħ².

So <Pz²> would be:

(1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (ħ²/4 + ħ²/4) = ħ²/2.

Now, the uncertainty is sqrt(<Pz²> - <Pz>²) = sqrt( (ħ²/2) - 0 ) = sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Did I calculate everything correctly?

Wait, the state vector is (−1/2, 1/√2, −1/2). Are these normalized? Let's check the sum of squares.

( (-1/2)^2 ) + ( (1/√2)^2 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 ) = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So yes, the state is normalized, which is good.

So <Pz> is indeed zero. Then, <Pz²> is 1/4 * ħ² + 0 +
