Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the operator Ay is given by c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. So S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Wait, that's the sigma y matrix, right? Because Pauli matrices have similar forms. So sigma y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So in that case, Ay = c * sigma_y, and c is h/(4π). 

So the operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix. The problem is asking about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let's think about how to find the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues a satisfy the equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me write down Ay explicitly. Since c = h/(4π), then Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So:

Ay = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
        [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

To find eigenvalues, compute the characteristic equation:

det(Ay - a I) = 0

So the matrix becomes:

[ -a, -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

Which is a² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))^2 ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So inside the brackets: (h²/(16 π²)) * 1. 

So determinant equation is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0. 

So a² = h²/(16 π²), which means a = ± h/(4π). Wait, wait, no: because sqrt( (h/(4π))^2 ) is h/(4π). But actually, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check.

Wait, no, the determinant is a² - ( (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) because the element is -i h/(4π) in the first position but when you subtract a I, the (1,2) element is -i h/(4π) * 1, right? Wait, no, the (1,2) element is -i c, so in the matrix Ay - a I, it's (0 -a) in (1,1), ( -i c - 0) in (1,2), (i c -0) in (2,1), (0 -a) in (2,2). So the matrix is:

[ -a, -i c
