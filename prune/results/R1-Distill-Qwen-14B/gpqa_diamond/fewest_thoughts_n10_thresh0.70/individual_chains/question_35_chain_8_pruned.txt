Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is c multiplied by matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second as (i, 0). So I'll need to write down this matrix Ay.

Wait, matrix S looks familiar. Oh right, the Pauli matrices. I think sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is sigma_y, which is a 2x2 matrix. So Ay is c multiplied by sigma_y. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Then, among the options A to D, which statement is correct.

First, I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

Let me compute the matrix Ay - aI. So, Ay is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]], and subtracting a I gives [[-a, -i c], [i c, -a]]. The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - ( (-i)(i) c² ). Let's compute (-i)(i): that's (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is a² - (1)(c²) = a² - c².

Set the determinant to zero: a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c. So the eigenvalues are +c and -c.

Wait, since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So their real parts are h/(4π) and -h/(4π), and their imaginary parts are zero because the eigenvalues are real. Because the matrix Ay is Hermitian? Let me think: sigma_y is Hermitian, and c is real, so Ay should be Hermitian. Therefore, eigenvalues are real.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options either talk about complex eigenvalues or not. Let me check the options.

Option A: Im eigenvalue is ±2πh, Re is ±h/(4π). But wait, that can't be right because eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts are zero. So option A is wrong.

Option B: Im is ±1/2, Re ±1. That doesn't fit because our eigenvalues are ±c, which is h/(4π). Unless h is Planck's constant, which is about 6.626e-34 J·s. But
