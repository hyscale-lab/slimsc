Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence correctly leads to the desired product with high yield.

First, I should draw the target molecule. It's 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the phenyl group is attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one), and on the benzene ring, there are substituents: a bromine at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5. Wait, numbering the ring: if the ketone is attached to position 1, then positions 3 and 5 are meta to each other, right? So, the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other.

I remember that for electrophilic substitution reactions, the directing effect of substituents is important. Nitro is a strong meta director, and bromine is a meta director as well, but since bromine is a leaving group, maybe it's introduced via a different mechanism.

Wait, but benzene is the starting material. So we need to add substituents in a way that the bromine and nitro groups end up in the correct positions relative to the ketone.

Let me think about the steps required. The target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: the ketone (from ethan-1-one), a bromine, and a nitro group. Wait, wait, no. Wait, actually, the ethan-1-one is a ketone attached to the benzene; the benzene has two substituents: bromine and nitro. Because the formula is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1, bromine at 3, and nitro at 5. So the benzene ring has three substituents? No, wait, no. Wait, benzene has six positions. Wait, the substituents are on the benzene ring attached to the ethanone. So the ethanone is attached at position 1, bromine at 3, and nitro at 5. So that's three substitu
