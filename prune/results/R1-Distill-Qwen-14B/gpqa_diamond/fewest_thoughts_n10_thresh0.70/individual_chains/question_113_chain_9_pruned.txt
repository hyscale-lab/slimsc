Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these spectroscopy concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are different chemical formulas, so I need to match the data to the structure.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups because the O-H stretch in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids can be broad. But wait, the problem says 'very broad' at 3000. Oh, right, maybe it's an -OH group, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, what could those be?

1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which usually correlates with a carbonyl group. So that might be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid (though their O-H is usually a broad peak around 2500-3300, but wait the 1700 might be an ester or a ketone). The 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could be another carbonyl, maybe a conjugated one. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl groups or an amide. But I don't see any N in the options, so probably not amide. Let me think: esters usually have a strong peak around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. Wait, but the 1700 could be an ester, and the 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe a conjugated one. Or perhaps a carboxylic acid, but then the O-H would be a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe one of the carbonyls is an aromatic group, like an aromatic ketone? Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl (like an enone), which might
