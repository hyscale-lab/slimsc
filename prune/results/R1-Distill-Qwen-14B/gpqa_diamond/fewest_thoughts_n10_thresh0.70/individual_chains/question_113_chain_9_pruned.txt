Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully. 

The question describes an unknown compound that's been analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to determine its chemical formula from the given data, choosing between four options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Hmm, let me break down each piece of information.

First, the FTIR spectrum. They mentioned a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So that's probably an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad peak around 2500-3300, but sometimes it's more of a broad O-H in alcohols. Also, the presence of a broad peak could suggest something else, like maybe an ether? No, wait, ethers don't have O-H; they're R-O-R. So the broad peak at 3000 is more likely an alcohol or maybe a phenol. 

Then, there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 1700 is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 cm⁻¹ peak is a bit lower, which might indicate conjugation or maybe an aromatic ring. Wait, but another thought: maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl system. Those often show lower carbonyl peaks. Alternatively, 1650 could be an aromatic ring (C=C) stretch, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

So 1700 is a carbonyl, and 1650 could be another carbonyl or something else. Wait, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic C=C stretching. But then, why two strong peaks in the same area? Another thought: maybe the 1700 is the carbonyl (like an ester or ketone), and the 1650 is an amide or maybe another functional group. Or perhaps it's an enone system, which combines a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So, the compound has a double bond. That's useful information. So the structure has a conjugated system maybe.

Looking at the Mass Spec: a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 could be a CH3CO+ ion (acetone), which is 45. Or maybe a CH3CHO (acetaldehyde) fragment? Wait, what's the molecular formula for that? Acetaldehyde is C2H4O, so the fragment would be that. But wait, the molecular formulas we're considering are all C6, so maybe the compound is something like an ester or a ketone with an ethyl group or something.

Let me try to piece this together.

The IR data suggests a carbonyl group (1700) and another peak at 1650, which could be either another carbonyl (like an ester with a conjugated double bond) or a double bond. The broad peak at 3000 suggests an O-H, so maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would have a very broad O-H and the carbonyl might be around
