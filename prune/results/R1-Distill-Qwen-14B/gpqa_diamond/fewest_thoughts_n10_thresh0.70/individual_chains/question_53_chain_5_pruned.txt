Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The FTIR shows ester groups, which means there's an ester functional group present. The 1H NMR has six signals: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two CH3 groups. No CH2 signals, so the molecule doesn't have any methylene groups.

Let me think about what this structure might look like. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, there are two substituents attached. The presence of an ester group suggests that at least one of the substituents is an ester group, like an OCOOR group.

Wait, but wait. Ester groups typically have the structure R-O-CO-O-R, but more accurately, it's R-O-CO-R'. So in the NMR, the ester oxygen would show up as a carbonyl peak in the IR, which they've already noted. The ester's adjacent oxygen would also have neighboring protons if it's an ethyl ester, for example.

Looking at the NMR signals: two aromatic protons. Di-substituted benzene rings can have different substitution patterns, like para, meta, or ortho. The number of distinct aromatic protons depends on the substitution. For example, para substitution would have two equivalent protons, so that would contribute one signal (but maybe two signals if the substituents are different). Wait, no. If the ring has two substituents that are different, then the aromatic protons would split into two sets. For instance, in para substitution with two different groups, each substituent is opposite each other, so the ring would have two types of aromatic Hs. Let me think: for a 1,4-disubstituted benzene with two different substituents, the ring would have two protons in one position and two in another, so maybe two signals. So that fits with the two aromatic signals.

Then, the vinyl protons. Two signals here: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in alkenes. So perhaps the structure has an alkene group attached to the ring. For example, maybe a substituent like a vinyl ester, or an allyl group. Alternatively, another possibility is that the substituent is a propenyl group or something similar.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about how the substituents would be arranged. Let's say one substituent is an ester group, and the other is an alkenyl group. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester with an adjacent alkene.

But another thought: the presence of vinyl protons in the NMR suggests that there's a double bond adjacent to the ring. So perhaps one of the substituents is an ethenyl (vinyl) group, maybe attached to the ester.

Wait, no, the ester is OCOOR, so the R could
