Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are about their relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we can't just subtract them like in Newtonian mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let me recall that formula.

The formula for relative velocity u' when observed from one frame to another moving at speed v is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). So, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me calculate that numerator and denominator.

The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator: 0.6*0.5 is 0.3, so 0.3c² divided by c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed u' is 0.1c / 0.7. 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c, so that narrows it down to those two.

Now, the total energy part. The total energy of a system would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy E is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So first astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Let's compute gamma for him. Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So his energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.4641 mc².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈ 5.9641 mc². So that's around 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc². So option C must be the correct one because the relative speed is 0.14c and E is about 5.96.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation for the second astronaut's gamma. 0.5c squared is 0.25c², so 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. Square root of 0.75 is approximately 0.8660, so 1/0.8660 is about 1.1547. Multiply by 3m: 3 * 1.1547 = 3.4641. Yep, so that's correct.

So the combined energy is about 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc², which rounds to 5.96 mc². So the option is C, which has v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc^2.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, the two velocities are \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
u' = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.4641mc^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.4641mc^2 \approx 5.9641mc^2
\]

Thus, the total energy is approximately \( 5.96mc^2 \).

From the options, the relative speed \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \) and the total energy \( E = 5.96mc^2 \) correspond to **Option C**.
