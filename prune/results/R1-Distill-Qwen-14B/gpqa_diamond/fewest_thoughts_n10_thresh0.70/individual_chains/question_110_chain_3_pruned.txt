Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Hmm, I remember that each spectrograph has different brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes up to 17, while HIRES can go up to 16. So any star that's brighter than 17 mag can't be seen by either. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So wait, no—brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Oh wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me clarify: the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, that's not right because lower magnitudes mean brighter. Oh wait, no—apparent magnitude: the lower the value, the brighter the star. So if ESPRESSO can detect stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, that means their apparent V magnitude is less than 17. Because stars brighter than 17 mag (so magnitude less than 17) would be observable. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, which is apparent magnitude less than 16.

So the key is to find stars that have apparent V magnitudes less than 17 (so ESPRESSO can see them) and less than 16 (so HIRES can also see them). Oh wait, no—no, wait. Wait, no. Because the question says, which stars can be detected by both. So a star must be bright enough for both to see. So the apparent magnitude has to be less than 17 (for ESPRESSO) and less than 16 (for HIRES). Because ESPRESSO can handle up to 17, but HIRES only up to 16. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=16, because HIRES can't go beyond 16.

Wait but looking at the options, I think the answer is stars that have apparent V mag <=16. Wait, let's think again. Because each spectrograph's limit is the maximum apparent magnitude they can observe. So a star with apparent V mag of 16.5 is too faint for HIRES (since HIRES can't go beyond 16), but ESPRESSO can see it (as it can go up to 17). But if a star is too faint for one, it can't be detected by both.

So the strategy is: for each star, calculate its apparent V magnitude and see if it's <=16, because that's the stricter condition (since HIRES can't go beyond 16). Because both need to be able to detect it, so the apparent V must be below both limits. So for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V mag must be <=16.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about how apparent magnitude works. The brighter the star, the lower the magnitude. So the maximum magnitude that a telescope can observe is the faintest it can see. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means it can see stars with V mag less than or equal to 17
