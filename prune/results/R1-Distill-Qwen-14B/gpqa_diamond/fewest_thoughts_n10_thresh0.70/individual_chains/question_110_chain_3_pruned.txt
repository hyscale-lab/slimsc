Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand the key information given. The ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, wait—wait, no. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, magnitude scale is a bit counterintuitive. Lower magnitudes are brighter. So, for a star to be observed, its apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, brighter than 17 probably means m_V ≤ 17.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. Wait, same logic here. So m_V ≤ 16 for HIRES.

So, the star must be detectable by both, meaning it must satisfy both conditions. So, the apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16 for HIRES and less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO. So, the star must have m_V ≤16 to be detected by both. Because if m_V is 17, it's too faint for HIRES, which can only go down to 16.

Now, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude of each star. Let's go through each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude M_V is 15.5, distance d is 10 pc. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d / 10). So, d=10, so log10(10/10)=0. So m =15.5 + 0 =15.5. So m=15.5. Now, since 15.5 is ≤16, it can be detected by HIRES. And 15.5 is also ≤17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So Star1 is detectable
