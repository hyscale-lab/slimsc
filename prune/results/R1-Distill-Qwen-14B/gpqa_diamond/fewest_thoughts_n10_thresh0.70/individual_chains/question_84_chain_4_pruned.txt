Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one using matrix exponential functions approximated by fractional methods. Hmm, I remember from my studies that matrix exponentials are used in solving systems of linear differential equations, especially in methods like the exponential time differencing.

Wait, the question mentions higher order finite differences and parallel splitting. I think parallel splitting refers to methods like the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method or maybe the Parallel Alternating Direction Implicit (PADI) method. Those methods split the problem into smaller parts that can be solved simultaneously. 

So, the key factor for making this parallel—what's that about? The options given are A to D. Let's look at each option. 

Option A: Stability analysis. Stability is important in numerical methods, ensuring that the errors don't grow without bound. But is that the key factor for making the algorithm parallel? I don't think so. Stability is a requirement, but not the main factor for parallelism.

Option B: Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal conditions are when the boundary depends on some integral or average of the function, not just point values. I'm not sure how that ties into parallel algorithms. Maybe some methods require certain boundary conditions for splitting, but I'm not certain this is the main factor here.

Option C: Complex roots of fractional approximation. Fractional approximation methods, like those using Padé approximants, approximate the matrix exponential. If the approximation has complex roots, how does that affect parallelism? Maybe the structure of the approximation allows for decomposition into parts that can be handled in parallel. Because if the approximation's roots are complex, perhaps they can be split into real and imaginary parts which can be computed separately, allowing parallel execution.

Option D: Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Partial fraction decomposition is a method used to break down complex rational functions into simpler fractions. If the approximation can be linearly decomposed, that might allow each part to be solved independently, which could be parallelized. So linear partial fractions might enable parallel computation by splitting the problem into parts that don't interfere with each other.

Wait, the question says the matrix exponential is approximated by a fractional approximation. Fractional approximation methods, like Padé approximants, aim to provide a good approximation of the exponential function. The key here is how to convert the sequential approach into a parallel one. 

In sequential methods, you'd compute the matrix exponential step by step. But for parallel splitting, you might need the approximation to be expressible as a sum of terms that can be computed concurrently. 

If the approximation can be written as a sum of functions that each depend on a subset of the matrix, then each subset could be computed in parallel. How would that decomposition happen? Maybe through partial fraction decomposition or by having roots that can be split into independent components.

Option C talks about complex roots. If the approximation's denominator factors into linear terms with complex roots, perhaps those can be grouped into complex conjugate pairs, which can be handled together. But I'm not sure how that directly leads to parallelism.

Option D, linear partial fraction, suggests that the approximation can be expressed as a sum of terms, each of which can be handled by a separate process. For example, if the approximation is a sum of terms like (A)(I)⁻¹, (B)(I)⁻², etc., each term can be computed in parallel because each is a separate operation on the matrix. So if the approximation can be broken down into a sum of such terms, each part can be computed independently, leading to a parallel algorithm.

Alternatively, the ability to split the problem into independent subproblems (like in ADI methods for PDEs) requires that the approximation can be decomposed in a way that allows each direction (or each part) to be handled separately. This decomposition might come from the structure of the fractional approximation, perhaps its partial fraction decomposition.

So between C and D, which is more about the roots and which about the decomposition
