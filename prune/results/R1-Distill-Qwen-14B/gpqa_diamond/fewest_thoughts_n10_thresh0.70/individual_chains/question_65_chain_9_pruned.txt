Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question has two parts, reactions A and B, and we need to choose the correct products from the options provided. Let me look at each reaction separately.

First Reaction:
The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol, and it's reacting with THF, KH, and then H+. I remember that THF is a common solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. So this reaction is likely deprotonating something.

Wait, the structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, which in this case is the spiro alcohol. The molecule has a five-membered and a seven-membered ring? Or wait, wait, the spiro notation is [3.5], so the two bridgehead carbons are connected by a single atom. So the molecule has a three-membered ring and a five-membered ring connected at the same carbon where the OH is attached. Additionally, there's a vinyl group (CH2CH2?) I think.

So the structure is a spiro compound with a hydroxyl group on the bridgehead carbon, and a double bond elsewhere. So when we treat this with a strong base like KH in THF, I think it's going to abstract a proton, leading to some kind of elimination or possibly a ring-opening.

Wait, but another possibility is that under basic conditions, the hydroxyl group gets deprotonated to form an alkoxide, which could act as a nucleophile. But with a spiro alcohol, what happens? Maybe it's more about elimination.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think. When an alcohol is treated with a strong base like KH, it can deprotonate to form an alkoxide. Then, in the presence of H+ (the second part of the reaction), perhaps it quenches the base. So maybe the reaction is a deprotonation followed by some kind of elimination.

But wait, I've heard of the Cope elimination and Claisen rearrangement, but perhaps in this case, it's an example of a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed process, but here the base is used first.

Wait, wait, the reaction conditions are THF, KH, then H+. So first, the base deprotonates the alcohol to form an alkoxide. Then, when H+ is added, perhaps it's a workup or an acid quench.

But how does this lead to a product? Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a conjugate base-induced elimination. Let me think about the structure again. 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The hydroxyl is on the bridgehead, and there's a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the same carbon as the OH. So, when the OH is deprotonated, the adjacent
