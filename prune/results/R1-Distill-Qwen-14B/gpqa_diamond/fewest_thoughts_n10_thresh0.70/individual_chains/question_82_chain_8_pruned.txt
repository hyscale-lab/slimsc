Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with cyclooctatetraene. The steps are:

1. Cyclooctatetraene heated with maleic anhydride in a 1:1 ratio to form product 1.
2. Product 1 is heated with methanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid to form product 2.
3. Product 2 is heated with cyclopentadiene to form the final product 3.

The question is about the structure of the major isomer of product 3, with four options provided.

Hmm, I remember that cyclooctatetraene is a conjugated eight-membered ring with alternating double bonds. When it reacts with a dienophile like maleic anhydride, it probably undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction. But wait, cyclooctatetraene can act as a diene or a dienophile? Let me think. Diels-Alder requires a diene (conjugated double bonds) and a dienophile (like an electron-deficient molecule such as maleic anhydride). Cyclooctatetraene has four double bonds—so perhaps it can act as two conjugated dienes? Or maybe it's a single conjugated system that can undergo multiple additions.

Wait, but cyclooctatetraene is non-aromatic because it's an eight-membered ring with alternating double bonds—it's actually antiaromatic if it were planar, but it's not because it's tub-shaped. So, in any case, it's a conjugated diene that can undergo Diels-Alder reaction. So when heated with maleic anhydride, the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring with the maleic anhydride adding across two double bonds of the cyclooctatetraene.

Wait, but cyclooctatetraene has four double bonds, so maybe two Diels-Alder reactions could happen? Or perhaps it's a 1,3-diene somewhere in the ring. Alternatively, maybe the cyc
