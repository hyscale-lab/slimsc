Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Right, metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene catalyst, typically used for ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis.

The starting molecule is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of the two enantiomers. But since the molecule is itself chiral, that might affect the products. Let me draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but 3-methyl would make it CH2=CHCH(CH3)2? Wait, wait. Let me count the carbons. Pent means five carbons. So, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. Wait, no, in pent-1-ene, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but if it's 3-methyl, the methyl is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me number the chain.

Wait, pent-1-ene: positions 1 2 3 4 5. So, double bond is between 1 and 2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. If it's 3-methyl, then the third carbon (which is the one after the double bond) has a methyl group. So it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait, that's 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2. Wait, no, wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.
