Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me see. The question is about identifying a compound X after a reaction. The reaction conditions are with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the formation of epoxides, specifically in the Prilezhaev epoxidation. Oh wait, that's right—it's used to epoxidize alkenes. So the starting material, compound X, probably has an alkene that gets converted into an epoxide.

The product's NMR data is given. Let's look at the 1H NMR first. The signals are:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet integrating for 3H. That's likely a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split the signal, maybe an oxygen or a carbonyl. Or perhaps a methyl adjacent to an electronegative atom.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet for 3H. Wait, that's two singlets close to each other. Maybe two methyl groups in similar environments. Like two CH3 groups attached to adjacent carbons, maybe in a ring structure or connected to electronegative atoms.
- Then, the aromatic region: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). Hmm. The doublets suggest coupling between aromatic protons. Let me think about how this would look. Maybe two substituents on the aromatic ring? Or perhaps it's a substituted styrene structure. Wait, the integration is 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H. That adds up to 6H, which makes sense for a benzene ring with some substituents. Let me try to figure out the splitting. Suppose it's a styryl group. Styryl is a benzene ring with a double bond attached. So perhaps the aromatic protons are split into two doublets each. Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted
