Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining vertically onto this aperture, and we're looking at the resulting intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Also, we can use the small angle approximation where tan(theta) is about theta.

Hmm, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a diffraction pattern. The far field region is where the light has spread out, and the interference patterns form maxima and minima. For a circular aperture, I think there's a specific formula for the minima—like the first minimum is at a certain angle. But this isn't a circle; it's a polygon with many sides. Oh, right, when N is large, the polygon approximates a circle, so maybe this problem is similar to the circular case.

Wait, but wait. Aperture shape affects the diffraction pattern. For a circular aperture, the first minimum in the intensity occurs at an angle θ where sinθ = λ/(π a), right? Or was it sinθ = 1.22 λ/(diameter)? Oh wait, the diameter is 2a, so 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a. So sinθ ≈ 0.61 λ/a, so θ is about that value when λ is small. But wait, in the question, when N is infinite, the shape becomes a circle. So perhaps the minima in this problem relate to the minima of the circular case.

But wait, the problem is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait a second, for a circular aperture, the central maximum is the brightest, and the first minimum occurs at θ ≈ λ/(π a), or maybe I'm mixing up the factors. Let me think again. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture has a central bright spot, and the first dark ring (minimum) is at an angle θ where sinθ = λ/(π a). Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. The formula I remember is that the first minimum occurs at θ where sinθ = 1.22 λ/(diameter
