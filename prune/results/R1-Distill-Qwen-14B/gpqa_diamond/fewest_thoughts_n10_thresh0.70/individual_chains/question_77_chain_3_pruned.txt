Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember from my notes that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes and they rearrange under certain conditions—like heat or light. The reaction forms a new structure with the double bonds shifted. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B, each involving different reactions. I need to figure out the major products for both and choose the correct option among A, B, C, D.

Starting with part A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Then, it's treated with BuLi and H+. Wait, BuLi is a strong base, usually used for deprotonation or in conjugate additions. Then H+ workup, so maybe an acid workup. 

Wait, but the Cope rearrangement is typically thermal. But in this case, part A is BuLi and H+. Hmm, maybe it's a different type of reaction. Let me think: the molecule has a benzene ring with an ether group attached, where the ether is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Let me draw it out.

The structure is benzene-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2, but wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2-CH2-? No, but the substituents: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but that can't be right because position 2. Wait, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with the double bond between C2 and C3? So 1-yl would be the substituent on the first carbon. So it's CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CH2-C6H5? Wait, no, the starting structure is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl benzene, which would be benzene-O-CH2-C

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives two reactions, and I need to pick the major products A and B from the options. The first part is the reaction of ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene with BuLi and then H+. The second part is a more complex molecule undergoing Cope rearrangement upon heating to give product B.

Starting with reaction A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw the structure. Benzene ring with a substituent attached. The substituent is an oxygen connected to a methyl group, which is further connected to a but-2-en-1-yl group that's substituted with a methyl.

Wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy methyl. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, let me see. The group is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. But wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait: For but-2-en-1-yl, the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the substituent is at position 1. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, that would be but-1-en-3-yl or something else? Maybe it's better to write the structure.

But-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2–, but wait no, the numbering. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl: the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and the substituent is at position 1. So the group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but
