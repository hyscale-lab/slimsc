Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives two reactions, and I need to pick the major products A and B from the options. The first part is the reaction of ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene with BuLi and then H+. The second part is a more complex molecule undergoing Cope rearrangement upon heating to give product B.

Starting with reaction A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw the structure. Benzene ring with a substituent attached. The substituent is an oxygen connected to a methyl group, which is further connected to a but-2-en-1-yl group that's substituted with a methyl.

Wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy methyl. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, let me see. The group is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. But wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait: For but-2-en-1-yl, the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the substituent is at position 1. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, that would be but-1-en-3-yl or something else? Maybe it's better to write the structure.

But-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2â€“, but wait no, the numbering. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl: the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and the substituent is at position 1. So the group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but
