Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember from my notes that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes and they rearrange under certain conditionsâ€”like heat or light. The reaction forms a new structure with the double bonds shifted. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B, each involving different reactions. I need to figure out the major products for both and choose the correct option among A, B, C, D.

Starting with part A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Then, it's treated with BuLi and H+. Wait, BuLi is a strong base, usually used for deprotonation or in conjugate additions. Then H+ workup, so maybe an acid workup. 

Wait, but the Cope rearrangement is typically thermal. But in this case, part A is BuLi and H+. Hmm, maybe it's a different type of reaction. Let me think: the molecule has a benzene ring with an ether group attached, where the ether is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Let me draw it out.

The structure is benzene-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2, but wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2-CH2-? No, but the substituents: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but that can't be right because position 2. Wait, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with the double bond between C2 and C3? So 1-yl would be the substituent on the first carbon. So it's CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CH2-C6H5? Wait, no, the starting structure is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl benzene, which would be benzene-O-CH2-C
