Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm.

The setup is a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis. I remember that the paramagnetic effect involves the interaction of electrons with a magnetic field. In atoms, this is often described by the Zeeman effect, which splits the energy levels when an external magnetic field is applied.

Wait, the question mentions small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh right, m can be -1, 0, +1 for p orbitals, but if m is small, maybe we're considering m=0 or something close. But how does that affect the coupling term?

The given B is 1 Tesla. I know that 1 Tesla is a strong magnetic field, but I'm not exactly sure how that translates into energy terms. Maybe I should think about the energy of the paramagnetic coupling term.

The paramagnetic coupling term is probably the Zeeman term. The Zeeman energy is given by something like E_Zeeman = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number. Wait, but in the case of paramagnetic coupling, I think it's more about the spin-orbit interaction. Or is it the orbital contribution? Oh wait, no—the paramagnetic term usually refers to the spin part. But orbital contribution is part of the Zeeman effect. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the transition energy ΔE is for hydrogen with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh, that's the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line. The energy of this transition can be calculated using the Rydberg formula. Let me recall: E = hc / λ. H is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Calculating ΔE: λ is 0.4861 μm, which is 486.1 nm. So E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m). Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1
