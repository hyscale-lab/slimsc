Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

So the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. Wait, the first part is finding the relative speed. Oh, right, but in relativity, velocities don't just subtract normally. I remember that you can't just say 0.6c minus 0.5c because that would be 0.1c, but that's not how relativity works. So I need to use the velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), right? So u is the speed of the second astronaut from the first's frame, or vice versa? Wait, wait. Wait, I think u is the speed of the object as seen from the first frame, and then we want to find the speed from the second frame. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me get this straight.

Wait, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the perspective of someone on the ground, both are moving in the same direction, with A faster than B. But the question is about the relative speed of one from the other's frame. So, for example, what is B's speed in A's frame.

Wait, no, wait. Let's clarify. Let me define the frames. Let me take astronaut A's frame as the first frame, moving at velocity u_A = 0.6c relative to the Earth. And astronaut B is moving at u_B = 0.5c relative to Earth. So from A's frame, what is B's velocity?

Wait no, the problem is about the relative speed between them. So if A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's perspective, how fast is B moving? Or is it the other way around? I think the relative speed would be how fast B is moving as seen from A. Or maybe A's speed as seen from B. Does it matter? Because the formula is symmetric in a way, but let me think.

Wait, the relative speed when you have two objects moving in the same direction. Let me think of their velocities as u = 0.6c and v = 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So when you want to find the speed of B as observed from A's frame, I think I need to use the velocity addition formula. Because in relativity, the velocities don't just subtract directly.

The formula is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Let me get the formula right. The velocity of B as seen from A's frame is (v' - u) /
