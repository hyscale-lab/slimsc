Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

Alright, first, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we can't use classical mechanics. We have to use special relativity. So, for relative speed, I think I should use the velocity addition formula from relativity. But wait, how does that work again?

The problem states that both astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction. So, they're moving in the same direction. The first astronaut has a mass of 2m and a speed of 0.6c, and the second has a mass of 3m at 0.5c. Wait, no, actually in relativity, mass isn't directly additive because of the way velocities work. Or maybe when calculating total energy, mass plays a role in that.

So the first part is the relative speed. I'm trying to find the speed of one astronaut from the other's frame of reference. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c, because that's what you'd do classically. But relativity says that's not correct. The correct way is to use the formula:

v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(cÂ²))

Wait, no, wait. Because in the problem, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So from A's frame, what's B's speed? Or is it the other way around? The relative speed would be the speed of one as seen from the other. So maybe I should calculate the relative speed of B with respect to A.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "relative speed." So I think it's the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. Let me make sure. So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) = -0.1c, but in reality, the speed isn't
