Hmm, okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e being the elementary charge, right? So 2e would be twice that. And they have negligible mass, which probably means I don't have to consider kinetic energy or anything like that.

Out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Oh, and the 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, energy in an electrostatic system usually refers to electric potential energy, right? Because all the charges are fixed, so the kinetic energy isn't a factor here. So I should calculate the potential energy of this configuration.

Let me think about how potential energy works with multiple charges. The electric potential energy of a system of charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. Oh right, and because potential energy is a scalar quantity, I can add them up.

So, the setup is that the 13th charge is fixed at point P. The other 12 charges are each 2 meters away from P. So each of these 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th charge.

Wait, but each
