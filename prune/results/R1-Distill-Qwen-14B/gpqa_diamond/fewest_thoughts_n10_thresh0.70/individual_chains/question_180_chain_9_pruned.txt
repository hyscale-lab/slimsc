Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about the minimum energy of a system with charges. Let me read it again.

We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. So each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge, which is 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs. That makes each charge 3.2e-19 C. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system. 

Hmm, I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is related to the work done to assemble them. Since the system is isolated, we're dealing with electrostatic potential energy. Also, since the charges are identical and the same sign, they repel each other, so bringing them together would require work, which would correspond to potential energy.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum energy. Minimum energy in this context probably refers to the lowest possible potential energy configuration. But wait, because these charges are all positive (since each is 2e, and e is positive), arranging them as close as possible might actually maximize the potential energy, not minimize it. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Let me think. The potential energy of a system of point charges is given by U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (1/2) Σ Σ (q_i q_j / r_ij). Since all charges are the same, each pair contributes positively to the potential energy because the product q_i q_j is positive. So the more you bring them together, the higher the potential energy because each pair contributes more. Wait, but wait, if you have a fixed number of charges, and some are fixed at a point, perhaps the minimal energy isn't the one where they are all as close as possible.

Wait, in this problem, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 12 charges are each 2 meters away from P. So the 13th charge is fixed there, and the others are at 2 m from it. But wait, the 12 charges are all at 2 m from P. So for each of the 12 charges, they are 2 meters away from the fixed charge at P. But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? Because in a system where all 12 are at 2 m from P, their positions could form a sphere around P. So their mutual distances could vary, but perhaps they can't get any closer than a certain distance.

Wait, the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 m from P. That means the fixed charge at P is at the center of this sphere, and the 12 charges are on the surface. But the exact positions of the 12 charges relative to each other can vary, which affects the potential energy because of their mutual interactions.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the minimum energy. Since all the charges are the same, adding more repulsion would lead to higher potential energy. So to minimize the potential energy, perhaps we need to arrange the 12 charges as far apart as possible, thus minimizing the repulsion between them. Wait, no, that might not be the case. Wait, when you arrange the charges as far apart as possible, the potential energy would be lower because the repulsive forces are less, but each pair's contribution is positive (since same charges), so the potential energy is positive and adding more separation would decrease each pair's contribution, leading to lower potential energy. So to minimize the potential energy, we want to arrange the 12 charges as far apart as possible, but under the constraint that each is 2 meters from P.

Wait, but what's the minimal potential
