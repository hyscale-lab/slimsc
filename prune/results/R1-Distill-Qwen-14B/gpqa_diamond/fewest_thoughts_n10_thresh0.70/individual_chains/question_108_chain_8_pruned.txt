Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says: For a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, with small values of m (orbital magnetic quantum number) and B=1T, compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of the Hydrogen atom with wavelength λ=0.4861μm. The options are about whether the expectation value ⟨H⟩ is much bigger, much smaller, or similar to ΔE.

Hmm, wait, so I think I need to calculate or estimate two things: the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the energy due to the interaction of the magnetic moment with the external magnetic field) and the transition energy ΔE given by the wavelength.

First, let's think about the paramagnetic coupling. The magnetic energy for an atom in a magnetic field is given by the Zeeman effect. The formula, I believe, is something like U = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. But the magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expressions. Oh right, the energy due to the magnetic field is H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment for an electron is μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m * something? Or wait, the Bohr magneton μ_B is (eħ)/(2m_e), right? So the energy is H = -μ·B, which would be proportional to m, the magnetic quantum number. But the question says m is small. So perhaps m is about 1 or 0? Because for a given orbital, m can be -l, ..., 0, ..., +l. So small m might mean m=1 or m=0.

Wait but for Hydrogen, if we're considering the ground state, the electron is in an s orbital, which has l=0, so m=0. Hmm, but maybe the question is considering higher orbitals where m could be non-zero but small. But I'm not sure. So perhaps the paramagnetic term is proportional to m, which is small. But then, what's the magnitude of that term compared to the transition energy?

The transition energy ΔE is given by the wavelength λ=0.4861 μm, which is about 486.1 nm. Oh wait, that's the Balmer series, probably the H-alpha line, which is 656 nm, but maybe not exactly. Wait, but the exact value doesn't matter as much as the order of magnitude.

The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So let me compute that. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. λ is 0.4861e-6 meters. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.48
