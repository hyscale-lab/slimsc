Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles, like protons. But wait, what's a synchrocyclotron? I think it's a type of cyclotron that uses a varying magnetic field, right? Oh right, because in regular cyclotrons, the frequency of the applied voltage has to change as the particles gain energy to keep them in sync.

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, T≈0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given is Φ0 = π/4, U0=190 kV. The question is, how many revolutions does the proton make?

Wait, revolutions... so each time the proton goes around the circular path in the synchrocyclotron is a revolution. But how does the acceleration relate to the number of revolutions?

I think I need to recall how a synchrocyclotron works. In a regular cyclotron, the magnetic field is constant, so the frequency of the applied voltage is fixed. The particles spiral out as they gain energy. But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases with time so that the cyclotron frequency remains in tune with the accelerating voltage's frequency as the particle's energy increases.

The key here is probably the phase term in the voltage. The voltage is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], where ν(α) is the frequency which depends on the angle α, I suppose. The initial phase Φ0 is π/4 radians.

Wait, but how does the phase affect the number of revolutions? Hmm.

Another approach: the number of revolutions would relate to the time the proton spends in the accelerator and the angular frequency. Because each revolution is 2π radians, the number of revolutions N is (angular frequency × time) / (2π). So N = (ωt) / (2π), but ω is 2π times the frequency ν. So N = ν t.

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency ν isn't constant because the magnetic field is changing. Oh wait, but the magnetic field is changing in
