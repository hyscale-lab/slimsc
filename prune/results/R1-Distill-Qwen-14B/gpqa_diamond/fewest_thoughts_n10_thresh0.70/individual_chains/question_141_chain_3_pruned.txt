Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here. Let me read it again. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I'm supposed to find out how many possible organic products there are. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, I'm a bit shaky on my aromatic substitution reactions, but let's think. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions, especially in the context of aromatic compounds. Oh wait, maybe it's about the benzene ring undergoing some kind of substitution or elimination.

Wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, that notation is a bit confusing. Oh, wait, 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe it's 2-bromo-1-dimethylbenzene? Wait, no, the numbering might be off. Let me think: Benzene-2-d would have two methyl groups attached? Or perhaps it's 2-dimethyl something else. Wait, maybe it's 2,4-dimethyl? No, that's not clear. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or is it 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene? Hmm, the way it's written, 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, maybe the 'd' stands for something else. Wait, wait, maybe it's
