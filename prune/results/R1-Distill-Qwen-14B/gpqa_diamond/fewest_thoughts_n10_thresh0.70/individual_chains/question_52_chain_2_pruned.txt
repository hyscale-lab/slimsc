Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again and then break it down.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So the spots are causing the star to appear cooler overall.

Now, the main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The options are A to D with various factors.

Hmm. I remember something about the Boltzmann equation in stellar atmospheres. The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

But wait, in this scenario, when the star has spots, parts of its surface are cooler. So the observed effective temperature is lower, but does that affect the photospheric temperature where these atoms are? Oh, the problem says when examining the photosphere, so the temperature in the photosphere is what's relevant for the LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) assumption.

Wait, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K, but does that mean the entire photosphere is at 5500 K? Or do the spots have a different temperature?

Wait, the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. I think that the spots are cooler regions, so when they cover part of the surface, the average flux (and thus Teff) drops. But in reality, the photosphere in the spotted areas would be at a lower
