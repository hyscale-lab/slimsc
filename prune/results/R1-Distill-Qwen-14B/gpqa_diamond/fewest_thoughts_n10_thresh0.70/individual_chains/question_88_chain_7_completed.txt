Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged proteins. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So the scenario is that they've tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP. Then they delivered these to mice via oral gavage. When they did in vivo imaging, they saw that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Hmm, I remember that the stomach is highly acidic, so it probably denatured or broke down some of the proteins. But some made it through and got entangled in the intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs, which I think are places like the Peyer's patches.

They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cell population. Then they sequenced the variable heavy chain gene and saw high variability. So the question is about which process is happening here.

The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Let me think about each process.

VDJ recombination is part of the initial diversification of B cell receptors during development in the bone marrow. It's the process where V, D, and J segments are combined to create the variable region of the B cell receptor. But this happens early on, like during the maturation of B cells in the bone marrow. So if the GFP-tagged proteins are getting to the Peyer's patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, perhaps the immune response is being triggered there. But VDJ is more about the initial diversity, not so much about the response after antigen encounter.

Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, occurs after the B cells have been activated. This process introduces point mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptor, increasing the diversity and affinity for the antigen. This happens in the germinal centers, which are part of secondary lymphoid organs like the Peyer's patches. So if the cells are proliferating and their variable heavy chain genes show high variability, that points to somatic hypermutation.

Complement activation is part of the innate immune response, leading to the destruction or neutralization of pathogens. It's not directly about the variability in the immune cells' receptors, though. It's more about marking the pathogen for other immune cells to attack.

Class switching recombination is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), which involves recombination at the heavy chain locus but doesn't affect the variable regions. So the variable heavy chain gene variability wouldn't be due to class switching.

So the process that would lead to high variability in the variable heavy chain after the B cells have encountered the antigen is somatic hypermutation. That's because in the germinal centers, B cells undergo this process to fine-tune their receptors and increase affinity for the antigen.

So the answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while the rest becomes entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. Fluorescent Peyer patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene reveals high variability, suggesting a process that diversifies B cell receptors after antigen encounter.

- **VDJ recombination (Option D)** occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, generating initial diversity by combining V, D, and J segments. This happens early and does not explain the observed variability in the Peyer's patches after antigen exposure.
- **Complement activation (Option B)** is part of the innate immune response, marking pathogens for destruction, but it does not affect the variability of B cell receptors.
- **Class switching recombination (Option C)** changes the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG) without altering the variable regions of the heavy chain, so it does not account for the observed variability.
- **Somatic hypermutation (Option A)** occurs in germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs, introducing point mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors to increase diversity and affinity after antigen encounter. This process aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene.

Given the context of antigen exposure and the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene, the process taking place is **somatic hypermutation**.

Answer: A
