Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct 1H NMR data for a specific compound. Let's start by breaking down the question and the given information.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Wait, di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. And the ring is aromatic, so it's probably something like benzene or a naphthalene derivative, but wait, naphthalene is two fused rings. Hmm, but the question says a 6-membered aromatic ring, so it's a single benzene ring with two substituents.

So the molecular formula... Let's count. Benzene has 6 carbons. The substituents add two more, making 8 carbons in total. So each substituent contributes one carbon each. Or wait, maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is one? Hmm, but the substituents could be anything, perhaps.

The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the compound must have both a carbonyl group and a halogen (like Cl, Br, I) attached to the aromatic ring.

So the substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Wait, but a carbonyl group is typically a ketone, aldehyde, or something like that. Wait, but in the case of a benzene ring, substituents can be things like -COOR (ester), -CN, or maybe a ketone. Wait, but the carbonyl is present as a substituent, so maybe it's a ketone attached to the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like an aldehyde, ketone, or maybe an ester.

Wait, the question says di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene ring. One is a carbonyl group (maybe a ketone, like a substituent like -CO-) and the other is a halogen, like -Cl or -Br. Or perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group and another is a halogen.

Wait, but wait, the carbonyl group could be part of a substituent. For example, the substituent might be a carbonyl group with another substituent, but I think the question
