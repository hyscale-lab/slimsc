Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me think through this.

The question says: If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.

Wait, the options are given, but I need to figure it out step by step.

First, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges can flow away, but wait, no, wait. Actually, when a conductor is grounded, it can exchange charges with the earth. So, if a positive charge is placed near the sphere, the electrons (negative charges) in the sphere will be attracted towards the near side, leaving the far side positively charged. But since the sphere is grounded, those excess charges can flow into the earth, right?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. For a conducting sphere, the charges reside on the surface. When another charge is placed near it, the charges on the sphere redistribute. If the sphere is not grounded, it would have induced charges. But if it's grounded, it can lose or gain electrons until the electric field inside the conductor is zero. But in this case, because it's grounded, the sphere's potential is the same as the ground, which is zero.

Wait, no, the ground is a reference at zero potential. So the sphere being grounded means its potential is zero. So when the charge q is placed near it, the sphere's induced charges will adjust such that the sphere's
