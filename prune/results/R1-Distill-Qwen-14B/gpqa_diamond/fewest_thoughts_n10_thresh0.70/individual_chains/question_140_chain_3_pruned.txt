Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to parse through all the information given.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating gives B. B has a melting point close to 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. So B is probably a solid at room temperature but just above freezing.

Also, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Oh, and I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's break this down. Let me think about each part.

First, the reaction: X reacts with Y to produce W and G. Let's think about what Y could be. Y is a liquid, so possible candidates are water (H₂O), maybe something like concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), or perhaps another liquid like liquid nitrogen, but that's less likely. Wait, but if Y is water, then what's X?

When X reacts with Y (water), it produces gas W. Let's think about possible gases. Maybe hydrogen, oxygen, or carbon dioxide, etc. But the key here is that W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule of W, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons.

Let's think about some gases. Hydrogen (H₂) has 1 proton and 1 neutron per molecule? Wait, no. Each H has one proton. So H₂ has 2 protons in total. Neutrons would be 2 if we're considering deuterium? Or maybe not. Wait, wait. Alternatively, take oxygen isotopes. Or perhaps another molecule.

Wait, the molecule of W has same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about H₂O: that's not, because protons are 2 (from H₂) + 8 (from O) = 1
