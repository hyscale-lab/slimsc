Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X. I'll try to break down each part of the information given.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Hmm, so X is probably an element that has isotopes, and in this case, the heavier one is present. Maybe it's something like chlorine, which has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37. Or perhaps it's something else.

Next, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, a molecule where the number of protons equals neutrons. Let me think: what gas fits that? Well, the most common is probably H2O, but wait, let me think again. Wait, in H2O, each oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, but H has 1 each. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's something like CO, where each molecule has (C has 6 protons, O has 8. So CO has 14 protons total. Neutrons: C has 6 (since carbon is usually C-12, 6 neutrons), O has 8. So total neutrons in CO molecule is 14 as well. So 14 protons and 14 neutrons
