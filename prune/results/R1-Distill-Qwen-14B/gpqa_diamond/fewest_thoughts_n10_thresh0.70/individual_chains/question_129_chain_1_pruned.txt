Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem is about a reaction scheme involving compounds A through E. I need to figure out what E is. The options are given, so I can check each step against them once I have more info.

So, the reaction steps are:
1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

Plus, there are two hints provided. Let me jot down the steps and think about each part.

First, let's think about each reaction. 

Step 1: A + HCN → B. HCN is used in the formation of cyanohydrins. Wait, but wait—another possibility is that A is a ketone reacting with HCN to form a cyanohydrin. Because HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, then B would be a cyanohydrin.

Wait, but another thought: when an aldehyde or ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So A must have a carbonyl group. So A could be a cyclic ketone.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. Hydrogenation usually reduces triple bonds or double bonds. If B is a cyanohydrin, which has an -OH and -CN group adjacent, then reduction of the nitrile (CN) group. Wait, Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation, but in this case, perhaps the nitrile is being reduced. So CN group would become CH2NH2? Or wait, no, more accurately, the nitrile group would be reduced to a primary amine, but wait, conditions matter. Oh wait, when using H2 and Pd, the nitrile group would typically reduce to an amine. But wait, perhaps more accurately, nitrile to amine is done with H2 and a catalyst like Raney Ni, but Pd is sometimes used. Or wait, another possibility: perhaps the reduction is of a ketone in B. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. If step 1 is A (a ketone) reacting with HCN, then B would be a cyanohydrin. So B would have an alcohol (-OH) and a nitrile (-CN) group attached to the same carbon. For example, if A is cyclopentanone, then B would be 3-hydroxycyanocyclopentane. Then, step 2 is hydrogenation of B with H2 and Pd. What would happen then? The nitrile group is typically reduced to an amine, but in the presence of hydrogen, perhaps the nitrile becomes an amine. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact product. Alternatively, another possibility is that the nitrile group is hydrogenated to a methylene group (-CH2-).

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible structure of B. Let's say A is a cyclopentanone
