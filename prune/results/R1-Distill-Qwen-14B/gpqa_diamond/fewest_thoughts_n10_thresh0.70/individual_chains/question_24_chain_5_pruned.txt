Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this chemistry problem, but it's a bit complicated. Let's break it down step by step. 

First, the problem describes a mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Decolorizing bromine, as I remember, usually happens when there's a double bond or another unsaturated structure because alkenes or alkynes can react with Br2. So mixture X has two components that are unsaturated, like alkenes or alkynes maybe.

Then, when X is treated with platinum (Pt) and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. The reaction is a disproportionation, which means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. The result is two other liquids in Y which don't decolorize bromine water. So Y's components are probably saturated because they don't react with bromine anymore. 

Next, when both X and Y are hydrogenated (which means adding hydrogen) with Pt under severe conditions, they both give the same hydrocarbon Z. Z is a single substance, and it's part of mixture Y. Also, Z is a solvent, which makes me think of something like hexane or maybe toluene, but wait, toluene is an aromatic compound and would have a higher hydrogen content? Wait, no, maybe not. 

Moreover, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So Z must be completely saturated, no double bonds left. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let me calculate that. 

Wait, mass fraction is (mass of H)/(mass of Z) = 14.28%. Let me see, 14.28% is roughly 1/7, because 1/7 is about 14.29%. So maybe the molecular weight of Z has a hydrogen content of 1/7. 

Let me think about the formula. Let's say Z has a molecular formula CnH2m. The mass of H is (2m * 1)/(12n + 2m) ) = (2m)/(12n + 2m) = 1/7. 

Let me set that up as equation: (2m)/(12n + 2m) = 1/7. Cross-multiplying: 14m = 12n + 2m → 12m =12n → m =n. So the formula is CnH2n. That's an alkene, but wait, wait. No, wait, because Z is the product after hydrogenation. So if Z is formed by hydrogenation, then it's fully saturated. Wait, no. Wait, wait, wait. Let me retrace. 

Wait, X is a mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine. So X's components have double bonds or triple bonds. When X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes disproportionation to form Y, which doesn't react with bromine, so Y has no double bonds. Then, when X and Y are hydrogenated, both give Z. So Z must be a fully saturated compound, because hydrogenation adds H2 across double bonds. 

Wait, but Z is a constituent of Y. So Y has Z, but maybe another component. But in any case, Z is a product of hydrogenation of both X and Y. 

Wait, but Y is formed from X via a disproportionation. So Y's components are derived from X's components. Let's think about what kind of reaction would cause that. For example, perhaps X has an alkene, and upon hydrogenation and some other reaction (like maybe oxidation?), but wait, no, Pt is a catalyst. Wait, no, the initial reaction is with Pt and heat, which leads to a disproportionation. 

Wait, maybe X is a diene or something else. Hmm. Another approach: Let's think about what Z could be. The hydrogen mass fraction is about 14.28%, which is 1/7. So mass of H is (1/7) of the total. Let me compute the molecular formula. 

Assume Z is CnH2m. So, the mass fraction of H is (2
