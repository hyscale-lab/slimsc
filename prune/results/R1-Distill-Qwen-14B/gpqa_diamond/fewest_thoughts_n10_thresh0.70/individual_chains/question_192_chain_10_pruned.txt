Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem here, and I want to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I get all the details.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. There's a small spherical cavity inside it, right? The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's given that r is less than R. So the cavity is entirely inside the conductor.

Now, they place a small positive charge +q somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P, which is outside the spherical conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is L. But wait, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s (the distance between the centers) is theta.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different expression for E.

Hmm. I remember from Gauss's law that for charges inside a conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total enclosed charge. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. Let me think about what happens when you place a charge inside the cavity.

When you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. Since the conductor was initially neutral, the inner surface of the conductor would develop an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the charge inside. So if +q is inside, the inner surface has -q. Then, since the conductor as a whole must remain neutral (because it was uncharged and no other net charge was added), the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner -q, because the total conductor's charge is zero.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor was uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q because the total conductor's charge is zero (inner: -q, outer: +q: net zero). Wait,
