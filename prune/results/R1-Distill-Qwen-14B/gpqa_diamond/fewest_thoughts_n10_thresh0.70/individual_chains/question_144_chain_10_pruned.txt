Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.

Alright, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. The formula I think I need is the mean decay length, which is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime, but wait, let me get the exact expression.

The mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So for a particle, the decay width Γ is the uncertainty in energy ΔE, and the mean lifetime τ is approximately ħ/(Γ). So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, no, I think I might have that flipped. Oh wait no, more accurately, Γ is the total decay width, and Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that sounds right. So the lifetime is inversely proportional to the decay width.

Once I have the lifetime, I can find the decay length as L = v * τ, where v is the velocity of the particle. So the steps are:

1. Find the velocity v of the meson.
2. Calculate the lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ.
3. Multiply v and τ to get the mean decay distance L.

So first, let's compute the velocity. The particle is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV, and its rest mass is m_X=1.2 GeV. Wait, energy and mass units, so I should convert GeV to appropriate units, probably using E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

But wait, E is given as 8 GeV, which is the total energy. The rest mass is 1.2 GeV, so the kinetic energy is E - m c². But perhaps it's easier to find the velocity from E and m.

The relativistic relation is E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. We can solve for p (momentum). Then, since energy E = γ m c², and momentum p = γ m v.

Alternatively, another approach: The velocity can be found using beta = v/c = (pc)/(E). Because E² = (pc)^2 c² + (m c²)^2, so (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2. Taking square roots, pc = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2)/c². Hmm, maybe I can express beta as:

beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Wait, let me be precise. Let's define units where c is 1 for simplicity, but remember to bring it back when necessary.

So, E is given as 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². So, E² =
