Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The structure is ethanone (acetone) attached to a benzene ring. The ring has substituents: a nitro group at the 5-position and a bromine at the 3-position. Wait, numbering the benzene ring, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group? No, wait, the compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon. The ring has bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5 relative to the point of attachment. So the substituents are meta to each other on the benzene ring.

So the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone group (attached to the acetone), a bromine, and a nitro group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the substituents on the benzene are 3-bromo and 5-nitro. So numbering the benzene ring with the ketone as position 1: substituents are at 3 (bromo) and 5 (nitro). So the ring has the ketone (position 1), nitro (position 5), and bromo (position 3). So they are both meta to each other relative to the ketone.

Wait, but how would that arrangement happen? Let me think about the synthesis steps.

I know that benzene can undergo electrophilic substitution. So the first step is probably nitration or bromination. But the order matters because each substituent directs the next substitution.

Wait, the target has two substituents on the benzene ring: nitro and bromo. Nitro is a strong meta director, and bromo is ortho/para director.

So the synthesis steps must be arranged so that the substituents are introduced in a way that the directing effects allow the correct placement.

Let me think about the possible steps. Let's consider the options given in the question, but perhaps I should outline a plan.

The target molecule is
