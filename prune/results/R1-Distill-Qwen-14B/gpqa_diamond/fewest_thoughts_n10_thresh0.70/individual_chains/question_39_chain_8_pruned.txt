Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the problem again.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube—so along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measure the position, none are found outside x=1 to x=3. I need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, right. So in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, like being normalizable. Also, the probability of finding the particle in a region is given by the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over that region. Since none are found outside 1 and 3, the probability outside must be zero, but no, wait, more accurately, all the probability is between 1 and 3. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² from -infinity to 1 must be zero, and from 3 to infinity must also be zero. Wait, but maybe the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3, but the given function is defined as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i only in a part of space. Oh, wait, the problem says the wave function can be described as that function in the part of space where the particle can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So outside this region, the wave function is zero.

But wait, the wave function given is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, wait, that would be a complex function. But I thought in some cases like infinite potential wells, the wave function is zero outside the well. But in this case, the given ψ(x) is non-zero only between x=1 and 3. So the wave function outside that region is zero, but within, it's this function.

Wait, but wait. No, the way the problem is phrased: "the wave function of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as..." So perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. So the given ψ(x) is for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero otherwise.

So the first step is to normalize the wave function. Because
