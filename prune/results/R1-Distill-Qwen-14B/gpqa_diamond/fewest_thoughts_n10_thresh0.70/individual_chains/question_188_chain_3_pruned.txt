Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says: We have a rhombohedral crystal. The interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The options are A to D.

Hmm, interplanar distance... Oh right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. I remember that for cubic systems, like simple cubic, the interplanar distance is calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameter and the Miller indices. But wait, this is a rhombohedral crystal, which isn't cubic, so I can't directly apply the cubic formulas.

Rhombohedral systems have all edges equal but the angles between them are not 90 degrees. Oh right, and the formula for interplanar distance in a general crystal system must involve the Miller indices and the lattice parameters, including the angles.

I think the general formula for interplanar distance (d) is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (2 h k (cos alpha) ) + ... ) Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I remember that the formula involves the reciprocal of the structure factor or something like that. Or wait, maybe it's the inverse of the metric tensor.

Wait, I think the formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the terms involving the reciprocal lattice vectors. Alternatively, the formula is d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * ( (1/a^2)(cos^2 α) + ... )) No, perhaps I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, another approach. The interplanar spacing formula for a general crystal system is given by:

1/d² = ( (h² + k² + l²) ) / a² ) - ( (hk (cos α ) + hl (cos β) + kl (cos γ )) ) / a²

Wait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Alternatively, I think the formula is
