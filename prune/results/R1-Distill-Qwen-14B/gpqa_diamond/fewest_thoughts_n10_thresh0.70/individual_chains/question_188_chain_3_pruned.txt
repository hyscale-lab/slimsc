Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Let me recall what I know.

First, a rhombohedral crystal system has all sides equal and all angles equal. So in this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom, which I think is the lattice parameter 'a'. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral lattice with a = 10 Å and angles 30°, 30°, 30°.

Wait, interatomic distance—right, in a crystal, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter if it's a simple cubic structure. But rhombohedral is a bit more complex. But I think the interatomic distance here is the edge length, a. So I can use that.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance d_hkl is given by the formula:

d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, no, wait. I think the formula for a general rhombohedral system is a bit different. Oh right, the formula is:

d^2 = (a^2) / ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ1 + hk cos γ2 + ... ) )

Wait, no, maybe I should think about it as a more general case. Alternatively, I might have the formula wrong. Let me think.

In a cubic system, the formula is simpler: d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But for a rhombohedral system, the formula is a bit more complicated because the angles between the axes are not 90 degrees.

The correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, alpha
