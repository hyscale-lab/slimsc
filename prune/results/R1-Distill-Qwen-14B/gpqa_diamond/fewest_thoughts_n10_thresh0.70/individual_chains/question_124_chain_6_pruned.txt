Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles moving through a detector. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the setup is that particles are collided in the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced, and they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Wait, Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time dilates and length contracts in special relativity. So gamma equals 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). At high velocities, gamma gets large.

The key here is probably about how far the particles travel before decaying. Because the problem says these are fast-decaying particles. So, the ones that reach the detector's walls must have a longer lifetime from our perspective, or perhaps the distance they cover depends on their speed and lifetime.

Wait, the problem says that when gamma is 20, one third reach the inner walls. So, for two-thirds, the gamma must be higher or lower? Hmm. Let's think.

The particles are produced at the center, so the maximum distance they can travel is the radius, which is 30 meters. So, the particles that reach the wall have to travel 30 meters before decaying. If a particle decays before reaching the wall, it doesn't contribute to the detection.

So, the probability that a particle reaches the wall depends on the product of its lifetime (from our frame's perspective) and its velocity. Because the lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame), and the velocity is a significant fraction of c, probably.

So, the average distance a particle travels before decaying is c * gamma * tau * beta, where tau is the proper lifetime, beta is v/c. So, the distance would be gamma * beta * c tau. If that distance is larger than 30 meters, the particle will reach the wall.

Wait, but in the current scenario, at gamma=20, one third reach the wall. So, the
