Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I haven't done a lot of these. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. These reactions involve the shift of a pi bond to a sigma bond, right? The examples given are Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which I'm a little fuzzy on, but I think they involve conjugated dienes and their rearrangements.

The problem has three separate reactions to complete, each producing a product A, B, and C. Then there are four options (A, B, C, D) each giving possible products. I need to figure out which option correctly lists all three products.

Let me tackle each part one by one.

Starting with the first reaction:
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) â†’ A

Hmm. The starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is a structure where ethanamine has two methoxy groups on the same carbon. So the structure would be OMe-O-C-NH2, but wait, that's not possible because that would be OMe-O-C... Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, but 1,1-dimethoxy would have two methoxy groups on the first carbon. So maybe it's (CH3O)2CH-NH2. Wait, no, that's impossible because ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. If it's 1,1-dimethoxy, the first carbon (the NH2 is on C1, so the substituents would be on C1. So the structure is OMe-O-C(NH2)-CH3? No, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2CHNH2. So it's more like CH2(OCH3)2NH2.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Let me think again. The formula for 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be CH2(OCH3)2NH2. So the molecule is (NH2)C(OCH3)2CH2? No, wait, ethanamine is two carbons, right? So ethan-1-amine is CH2CH2NH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So the first carbon is CH3, the second is CH2NH2. Wait, no, wait. No, ethanamine is CH2CH2NH2? That can't be right. Alternatively, ethan-1-amine is CH3NHCH2? No, I'm confused. Let me write it correctly.

Ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. So, the structure is CH3-CH2-NH2. Now, 1,1-dimethoxy would mean two methoxy groups on the first carbon. Wait, but the first carbon is CH3. So adding two OMe groups on the same carbon as the NH2? So the structure would be (OCH3)2CH-NH2. Wait, that would be CH2(OCH3)2NH2, but wait, that's impossible because the central carbon can't have five bonds. Oh wait, no: the structure is (OCH3)2CH2NH2, but that's not possible either. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3O)2CHCH2NH2. No, that's 2,2-dimethoxyethanamine. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is (CH2OCH3)2NH. No, that's not making sense. Alternatively, maybe it's di-methoxy on the ethanamine at position 1. So, perhaps the structure is (NH2)C(OCH3)2. That would make sense: the central carbon (the one attached to NH2) has two OMe groups and two H's. So it would be H2C(OCH3)2NH2. Wait, that's (H2C(OCH3)2)NH2? No, perhaps it's H2C(OCH3)2 connected to NH2. Wait, perhaps it's (OCH3)2CH-NH2. That would be the structure. So the central carbon is attached to two methoxy groups, one NH2 and two CH2 groups? Hmm,
