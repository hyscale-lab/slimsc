Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). After some time, they checked the reaction progress using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, meaning the reaction is proceeding. Two new spots appeared, so there are two products formed.

I need to figure out which of the options A to D represents these products. Let's break down the reaction.

First, let's draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So, the benzene ring is connected to an ether oxygen (O), which is attached to a butenyl group. The butenyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, butenyl is four carbons. The substituents are at position 2,2-dimethyl. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure is: 

The group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, butenyl is four carbons with a double bond. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Hmm, but wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So the structure is:

The but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with two methyl groups on the second carbon. So the structure is:

The group is (CH2)2C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 where the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait, maybe I should draw it like this: The substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't include the double bond. Wait, no. Let me correct.

Wait, buten-3-enyl would have the double bond between C3 and C4, right? So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, the butenyl group is four carb
