Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a specific part of the fusion process stops. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

So, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, that means the neutrinos we detect on Earth right now would be from the time before that happened.

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands. So, first, I need to understand what the pp-III branch contributes to neutrino production.

I remember that the proton-proton chain (pp) is the main fusion process in the Sun. There are a couple of branches in it. The pp-I branch goes up to beryllium-7, and the pp-II and pp-III are further steps. Oh right, the pp-III branch produces boron-8 (B8), which then decays into carbon-8, emitting a positron and a neutrino. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. No, B8 is a beta-plus emitter, so it decays to C8, releasing a positron and a neutrino. The neutrino here is a positron neutrino (Î½e+), which is part of the solar neutrino flux we detect.

But wait, the pp-III branch is a minor contributor compared to the main pp-I. So if pp-III suddenly stops, how does that affect the neutrino flux?

When the pp-III stops, the production of B8 would stop. But B8 has a half-life of about 19 seconds, which is much shorter than 8.5 minutes. So, if the production stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the B8 would have decayed away already. So the neutrinos from the pp-III branch would no longer be present.

Wait, but neutrinos are produced in other parts of the Sun's fusion as well. Like, the CNO cycle produces neutrinos too, but I think the dominant source for high-energy neutrinos is the main pp chain, particularly the B8 decay.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the B8 production stops
