Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

So, the compound X is C11H12O. It's reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and we need to find out what X is from the options A-D.

Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, right? Oh wait, isn't that a strong, non-nucleophilic base? So maybe it's involved in an elimination reaction. Oh, like an E2 mechanism. Because when you have such a base, it abstracts a proton and causes the molecule to lose a leaving group, forming a double bond. So maybe compound X is an epoxide that's undergoing ring-opening? Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, sometimes when you have an epoxide and a base, it can cause ring-opening. But if the solvent is nonpolar, maybe it's a different reaction. Hmm. Or maybe the reaction isn't about the base. Let me think again. The product's NMR is given, so perhaps it's about the structure after the reaction. But the question is to identify compound X, the starting material. So the product must be what's formed from X under these conditions.

Wait, another possibility: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is also known as DBU (1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene?), no, wait, DBU is 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene. Oh maybe that's a different compound. Anyway, regardless, it's a strong, bulky base. So perhaps the reaction is an elimination reaction, where X is a diol or something that can eliminate to form a double bond.

Wait, but the molecular formula for X is C11H12O. Let me think. The product's molecular formula would be the same, assuming it's just an isomerization. Because elimination typically involves removing two substit
