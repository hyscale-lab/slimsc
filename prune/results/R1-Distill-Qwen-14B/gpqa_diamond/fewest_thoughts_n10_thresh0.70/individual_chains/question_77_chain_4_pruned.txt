Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question is about the Cope rearrangement, which I remember involves 1,5-dienes. The reaction rearranges the double bonds, so the structure changes. The problem has two parts: first, a reaction A, and second, a rearrangement B using heat. I need to choose the correct major products from the options given.

Let's start with the first part, reaction A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methylbenzene. I think the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's an oxygen connected to a CH2 group. And the other part is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. Let me try to draw that.

So, the substituent on benzene is OCH2CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH(C H2)CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me get the structure right. But-2-enyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. So the 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. Wait, but but-2-enyl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 2 and 3? No, but-2-enyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. So 3-methylbut-2-enyl would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)2? Wait, no. Wait, but-2-enyl is four carbons, double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bond between 2 and 3, right? Or wait, but-2-enyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but that's five carbons? Wait, no, butane is four carbons. So but-2-enyl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bond between C2 and C3. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me write it as CH2=CH
