Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry reactions, specifically the Cope rearrangement. I remember the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes and rearranges them when heated or exposed to light. The question gives me two reactions, A and B, and I have to pick the correct major products from the options provided.

Let me look at the first reaction: the starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methylbenzene. So, breaking this down, the molecule is a benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is a (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy group attached to a methyl group.

Wait, wait. Let me write it out. The structure is OCH2-C6H5 (phenyl group) connected to an oxygen, which is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So, the butenyl group is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH-CH2-CH2? No, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? Wait, no. Let me think again. But-2-en-1-yl would be: the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, wait, the butenyl group is four carbons, so 1-yl means the substituent is at the first carbon. So but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2- but attached at the first carbon. Wait, that's not right. Let's think of but-2-en-1-yl as CH2=CHCH2CH2- but substituting at the first carbon. Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-C6H5. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally. The molecule is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl benzene. So the group is OCH2-C6H5 attached to the 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. The but-2-en-1-yl group would be CH2-CH2-C(CH3)-CH2 where the double bond is between C2 and C
