Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Hmm, let me see what I can remember. The question gives me the Lagrangian term for the interaction between the boson X and fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λfψ̄f(y)(v + X(y))ψf(y). Oh, wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. It looks like the interaction term involves the fermion fields ψ_f and X. So, the interaction is something like λ times the product of the fermion fields and X. So, each fermion f couples to X.

But wait, the usual Yukawa interaction term is like g ψ̄ ψ X, right? So in this case, the coupling is such that each fermion f has a Yukawa coupling. So, X can decay into a pair of fermions ff̄ if the mass is sufficient.

The mass of X is 6 GeV, so any fermion pair produced must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because, for a decay to be possible, the rest mass of the produced particles must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. That's the basic condition for decay kinematics.

So, what are the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into? Let's list the possible fermions and their masses.

Wait, the fermions are the quarks and leptons. The masses for the known fermions are:

- Up and down quarks: their masses are around 2-5 MeV (so very light, but in this case, since X is 6 GeV, their rest mass is negligible. So, uū and dđ pairs are possible because their rest masses are much less than 6 GeV.

- Strange quark: about 100 MeV, so sŝ is allowed.

- Charm quark: around 1.5 GeV. So cč pair: 2 * 1.5 = 3 GeV
