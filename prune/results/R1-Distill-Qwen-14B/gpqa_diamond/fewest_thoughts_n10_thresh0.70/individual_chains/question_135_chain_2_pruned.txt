Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle interactions and decay processes. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a go.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The problem gives a Lagrangian term, and the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to determine which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

First, I should look at the Lagrangian provided. The expression is:

L(y) = -λf f̄ (y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, actually, the LaTeX seems a bit off in my mind. Let me parse it again. Oh right, it's probably something like L = -λ f ψ_f (y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f(y)? Or maybe more accurately, perhaps it's written as L = -λ f ψ_f^dagger (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, but the way it's written, it's -λ f f̄ (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Wait, maybe it's a typo, perhaps it should be ψ instead of f in the last term.

Wait, no, perhaps the actual interaction is written as L = -λ f ψ_f̄ (y) X(y) ψ_f(y). Because the standard form for Yukawa interactions is usually something like L = -g ψ ψ X, where X is the boson. So perhaps the given Lagrangian is L = -λ f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, okay, so the interaction term is proportional to X(y) times the product of fermion fields.

Wait, but the question is about the decay of the boson X. So for X to decay, it must couple to fermions. The interaction term tells us which fermions X couples to.

In the Lagrangian, the X field is multiplied by ψ_f. So that suggests that X couples to the fermion ψ_f. So the fermion ψ_f would be the one that X can decay into.

So, the possible decay products of X would be
