Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the maximum speed of the mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator.

Alright, so the problem states that it's a 1-dimensional relativistic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The speed of light is c, and we need to find the maximum speed v_max.

Wait, I remember that in the case of a classical harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = ωA, where ω is the angular frequency. But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. This one is relativistic, so I can't use that directly.

In the relativistic case, things get a bit more complicated because of the effects of special relativity. The total energy isn't just kinetic plus potential; relativistic effects modify the energy expressions. Oh right, the energy in relativity is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², where p is momentum.

So for a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv². Wait, no. Wait, the kinetic energy in relativity is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, in the case of a relativistic oscillator, perhaps the total energy is a combination of rest mass energy and the oscillation energy. Hmm. Wait, another approach: perhaps we can model the oscillator considering both potential and kinetic energies, but in a relativistic context.

Wait, I think the approach involves finding when the potential energy is at its maximum (x = A) and then finding the speed at that point. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum speed occurs when all the energy is kinetic, but that doesn't sound right because the oscillator's energy is a combination of kinetic and potential.

Wait, no. The maximum speed would occur when the oscillator is passing through the equilibrium position, x=0, right? Because that's when the velocity is maximum. But wait, when x=0, the potential energy is zero, so all the energy would be kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv², so maybe that's a way to approach it.

Wait, but in the problem, the question is about maximum speed. So perhaps the maximum speed occurs when all the energy is kinetic. Or wait, perhaps the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and the oscillator's energy. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of total energy being the sum of the rest mass energy plus the oscillation energy.

Wait, perhaps the total energy E in the rest frame is the sum of the potential and kinetic energies. But no, in relativity, energy is more complex. Hmm.

Alternatively, another approach: the relativistic equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator. Wait, the equation of motion comes from F = d(p)/dt, where p is relativistic momentum, which is γmv. But for a harmonic oscillator, F = -kx. So, F = -kx = d/dt (γmv).

Wait, that might get complicated. Let me think about that. The equation would be:

d/dt (γmv) = -kx.

Hmm, this is a second-order nonlinear differential equation. Solving that might not be straightforward. Maybe I can find the maximum speed by considering energy conservation.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the energy is E = (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kA². At maximum displacement x=A, the speed is zero, so all energy is potential. At x=0, all energy is kinetic, so E = (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². So v_max = sqrt(kA²/m).

But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc². So when x=0, all energy is kinetic, so E = (γ - 1)mc². But the total energy E is also the sum of the oscillator's energy and the rest mass energy? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the total energy of the oscillator is E = mc² + (kinetic energy) + (potential energy). So when x=0, the potential energy is zero, and all the energy is kinetic plus rest mass energy. So E = mc² + (γ - 1)mc² = γ mc².

But wait, the total energy of the oscillator in the non-relativistic case is (1/2)kA², but that's just the maximum potential energy. So perhaps in the relativistic case, the maximum potential energy is when x=A, so (1/2)kA². But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, maybe the total energy E is (1/2)kA², which is the maximum potential energy. So when x=A, the kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)kA^2. But wait, that can't be right because in reality, the total energy includes the rest mass energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the oscillator is in a relativistic context, so the energy includes rest mass and the oscillator energy. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Another approach: the relativistic oscillator's equation of motion is (d²x/dt²) + (k/m) x = 0, but that's only when the velocity is non-relativistic. But for relativistic speeds, the equation changes.

Wait, maybe I should consider the equation for a relativistic harmonic oscillator. I'm trying to recall if there's a standard form for this. Oh, right, in relativistic mechanics, the momentum is given by p = γmv, and F = d(p)/dt.

So F = -kx = d(γmv)/dt.

Hmm, but solving this differential equation might be tricky. Let me try substituting F = ma, but relativistically, a = dv/dt, but m is variable because of γ. Alternatively, perhaps I can find some relation between velocity and displacement.

Wait, the maximum speed occurs when the velocity is maximum, which is when the acceleration is zero. Is that correct? Because acceleration is the time derivative of velocity. So when the velocity is maximum, the acceleration would be zero. So setting F = 0? But F = -kx, so x=0. So at x=0, the force is zero, so acceleration is zero, and velocity is maximum. That makes sense.

So at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So energy at x=0 would be E = K = (γ - 1) mc². But what is E in this case? Is E the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy plus the oscillator's energy?

Wait, maybe the total energy E is given by (1/2)kA² + mc². Because when x=A, the potential energy is maximum, so (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy would be E = mc² + (1/2)kA². Then, when x=0, the kinetic energy is E - mc². So:

K = E - mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because in the non-relativistic case, when x=0, K = (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², so v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). So that would correspond to option C, but option C is given as an option, but the question is about the relativistic case.

So perhaps in the relativistic case, the energy E is higher because of the γ factor. So let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy E is (1/2)kA² plus the rest mass energy, but that also doesn't seem correct. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to write the energy in two forms: one as the sum of kinetic and potential, and another as the relativistic expression.

At x=0, the potential energy U is zero, so E = K = (γ - 1) mc².

At x=A, the kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)kA². But wait, that doesn't include the rest mass energy. So perhaps the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)kA². Then, when x=0, the kinetic energy is E - mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait, but that would imply (γ - 1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

So γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, so γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

But wait, γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So solving for v_max.

Let me write that expression:

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

So,

1/ sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)

Let me invert both sides:

sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 / [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ]

Square both sides:

1 - (v_max^2)/(c^2) = 1 / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ]^2

Rearranging:

v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))]^2

Hmm. Let's compute that.

Let me let (k A²)/(2 m c²) = a for simplicity.

So,

v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + a)]^2 = [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2a + a²) -1 = 2a + a² = a(2 + a)

So,

v_max²/c² = [ a(2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2

But a = (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [ (k A^2) ]/(2 m c² )

So substituting back:

v_max²/c² = [ (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator.

Let me factor out the (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ):

Numerator: (k A^2/(2 m c²)) * [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]

Denominator: [ ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2

So,

v_max²/c² = [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ]

We can factor the denominator as (1 + a)^2, and the numerator has a (2 + a) term, where a is (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

Wait, let's factor the 2 in the numerator's second term:

2 + a = 2 (1) + a = 2 (1 + a/2 )? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express the numerator as a [ (2/(a)) + 1 ], but that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps factor the numerator as a(2 + a) divided by (1 + a)^2, which could be written as a (2 + a) / (1 + a)^2.

Wait, but perhaps this can be simplified. Let me compute the numerator:

a (2 + a) = 2a + a² = a (2 + a )

Denominator is (1 + a)^2 = 1 + 2a + a².

So,

v_max^2/c^2 = [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a )².

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this as [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Wait, let me compute this fraction.

Let me let a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), which is a positive quantity.

So,

v_max² = c² * ( a (2 + a) ) / (1 + a )²

= c² * [ a (a + 2) ] / (a + 1 )^2.

Hmm. Let me write this as:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ a (a + 2) ] / (a + 1 )² )

= c * sqrt( a(a+2) ) / (a+1 )

Hmm, perhaps we can manipulate this expression. Let's compute numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator inside the sqrt is a(a + 2) = a² + 2a.

Denominator is (a + 1)^2 = a² + 2a + 1.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (a² + 2a) ) / (a^2 + 2a +1 )

Hmm, perhaps factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, sqrt(a^2 + 2a) = sqrt(a(a + 2)).

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps write (a^2 + 2a) = (a+1)^2 -1.

So,

sqrt( (a+1)^2 -1 ) / (a+1)^2

= sqrt( (a+1)^2 -1 ) / (a+1)^2

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express this as [ sqrt(a(a+2)) ] / (a+1)^2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the entire expression as:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ a (a + 2) ] ) / (a +1 )

Because,

sqrt( (a)(a+2) ) = sqrt(a² + 2a ) = sqrt( (a+1)^2 -1 ) 

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (a+1)^2 -1 ) / (a+1 )

= c * sqrt( [ (a+1)^2 -1 ] ) / (a+1 )

= c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(a+1)^2 )

Wait, no—wait, sqrt( (a+1)^2 -1 ) = sqrt( (a+1)^2 (1 - 1/(a+1)^2 )) )

Which is (a+1) * sqrt(1 - 1/(a+1)^2 )

So,

v_max = c * [ (a+1) sqrt( 1 - 1/(a+1)^2 ) ] / (a+1 )

= c * sqrt(1 - 1/(a+1)^2 )

Hmm, that's a cleaner expression. So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(a+1)^2 )

Where a is (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

a + 1 = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

1/(a +1 )^2 = [ 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ]^2

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ]^2 )

Hmm. Let me compute this expression.

Let me compute 1 - [1/(1 + a)]^2 where a = k A^2/(2 m c² )

So,

1 - [1/(1 + a)]^2 = [ (1 + a)^2 -1 ] / (1 + a)^2

= [ 1 + 2a + a² -1 ] / (1 + a)^2

= (2a + a² ) / (1 + a )^2 = a (2 + a ) / (1 + a )^2

Which brings me back to the same expression. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (2a + a² ) ] ) / (1 + a )

Because,

sqrt( a (a + 2) ) / (1 + a ) = sqrt( a(a+2) ) / (a+1 )

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, looking at the answer options:

Option D is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) ]^2 )

Which matches what I have.

Wait, option D is written as:

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Which is exactly what I derived.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is:

D) v_max= c√(1−1/(1+ (kA²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Which matches.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option B has a similar expression but maybe a different denominator.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - kA^2/(2m) )^2 )

Hmm, that doesn't look right because it's using 1 - (kA²)/(2m), but in our case, it's 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Option C is sqrt( kA²/m ), which is the non-relativistic case, so it can't be the right answer here.

So the correct answer should be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the relativistic energy conservation and the relationship between potential and kinetic energy.

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) is the sum of the rest mass energy and the oscillator's energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), all the energy is potential, given by \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2 \). At \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic, expressed as \( E = \gamma mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the total energy at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = A \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

Subtracting \( mc^2 \) from both sides:

\[
(\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

Solving for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

The Lorentz factor is also related to velocity by \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Substituting \( \gamma \) into this expression:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Inverting and squaring both sides:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option B** have incorrect denominators or signs.
- **Option C** corresponds to the non-relativistic case, \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \), which does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
