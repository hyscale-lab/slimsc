Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm. Let me try to unpack what's going on here.

Wait, so the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two different energy bands. Band 1 is 700-800 keV, and band 2 is 800-900 keV. The flux ratio is flux1 over flux2. And the scenario is that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. But all other reactions are as usual.

First, I need to recall what the pp-III branch is. I remember the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. There are a couple of branches. The pp-I branch produces a helium-4 nucleus, and then there are other branches like pp-II and pp-III. Oh wait, the pp-III branch involves a boron-8 nucleus, which then decays into two alpha particles. Or does it? Maybe I should think about the neutrino production in these processes.

Neutrinos are produced in the Sun via the decay of boron-8, which comes from the pp-III branch. Right, because when boron-8 (B-8) decays, it emits a positron and a neutrino. So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of B-8 would stop, and thus the neutrinos from that decay would stop.

Wait, but what about the other neutrino sources? Oh, the other neutrinos come from the other branches. Wait, no, the main neutrino flux is from B-8 decay. So the majority of solar neutrinos come from that.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of B-8 would stop. That would mean that the neutrinos from that decay would stop. So the flux from the pp-III branch would drop to zero, but what about the other sources of neutrinos?

Wait, but the question says all other reactions remained as they were. So other branches (like pp-I and pp-II) are still producing their neutrinos, but wait, do they produce neutrinos? I think that in the main pp chain, the main neutrinos come from the decay of B-8. The other branches, like the pp-I and pp-II, perhaps
