Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens if a certain branch of fusion reactions suddenly stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So the neutrinos are produced in the core, and if the pp-III stops, the neutrinos from that process would suddenly decrease, but the effects would take time to reach us. So about 8.5 minutes later, we'd start noticing the change in the neutrino flux here on Earth.

The question is about the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, what's the flux in each band when pp-III stops?

First, I need to recall what the pp-III branch is. The proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. The pp-I branch involves the fusion of two protons to deuterium, then another proton fusing to form helium-3. Then, there are two branches for the third step: pp-II and pp-III. In pp-II, a helium-3 nucleus fuses with a helium-3 to make boron-8, which then decays into two helium-4 nuclei. In pp-III, two helium-3 nuclei combine to form carbon-12, which then captures two protons to form nitrogen-14, which decays back into carbon-12. 

Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, which can either go to boron-8 in the pp-II branch, or combine with another deuterium to make helium-4 in the CNO cycle? No, no, wait. The CNO cycle is a different process altogether. Let me correct myself: The pp chain has two main branches after the deuterium phase. For pp-II, two helium-3 nuclei combine to make boron-8, which quickly decays into two helium-4. For pp-III, a helium-3 nucleus captures a proton to form carbon-12, which then captures another proton to form nitrogen-14, which decays back into carbon-12.

But wait, I'm mixing up the steps. Alternatively, maybe pp-III is when a helium-3 nucleus (from two protons fusing) captures a helium-3 to form carbon-12, which then undergoes further reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but perhaps I don't need to get into the exact details of the reactions. What's important is that the pp-III branch produces neutrinos, particularly electron neutrinos, which are detected on Earth.

Neutrinos are produced when a neutron is created during fusion reactions. In the pp-III branch, I think the main neutrino source is the decay of boron-8, which is a product of the pp-II branch. Wait, no, boron-8 comes from pp-II. So if the pp-III branch stops, maybe that affects the production of certain neutrinos.

Wait, maybe I should think about which reactions produce neutrinos. The main sources are:

1. The decay of boron-8 (from pp-II) into two helium-4 nuclei, emitting a positron and a neutrino. So each boron-8 decay produces a neutrino, which is the main source of the 700-800 keV neutrinos, I think. Because boron-8 has a half-life of about 18 minutes, so the beta+ decay gives a neutrino with energy around 700-800 keV.

2. Then, the pp-III branch's main neutrino contribution is from the reaction where a carbon-12 nucleus captures a proton to form nitrogen-14, which then emits a neutron and a positron, producing a neutrino. The energy of these neutrinos is higher, around 800-900 keV. So if the pp-III branch stops, the flux in the higher energy band (band 2) would drop, while the lower band (band1) would remain as before, assuming only the pp-III neutrinos are affected.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the higher energy range. So if pp-III stops, the flux in the higher band would decrease. But what about the lower band? The lower band (700-800 keV) is from the decay of boron-8, which is part of the pp-II branch. So if pp-III is stopped, pp-II continues, but pp-III is not
