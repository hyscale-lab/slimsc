Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism—wait, that's when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. If a molecule has that, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, leading to optical activity.

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each listing a combination of the numbers 1-4.

Let me go through each one step by step.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, so this is a biphenyl structure with substituents. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' for the carboxylate groups, and 6 and 6' for the nitro groups. Wait, biphenyls can have different substituents on each ring. So, are there any chiral centers here? The central biphenyl itself is connected in such a way that maybe the substituents create a situation where the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image. But wait, biphenyls can have axial chirality. Oh right! Axial chirality refers to the arrangement of substituents around the central axis of the biphenyl. So if the substituents on the two benzene rings are arranged in a way that they can't be mirrored, the molecule can have enantiomers. So in this case, the substituents at 2 and 2' are both methyl esters of carboxylic acids, and at 6 and 6' are nitro groups. Wait, but wait—maybe they are in positions that don't allow for a plane of symmetry. So if the substituents on each benzene ring are different enough, the molecule might have axial chirality. Hmm, I need to think about whether the substituents are arranged symmetrically or not. Let's imagine the structure: biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 2' for the carbons—so that's on the ortho positions. Additionally, nitro groups at 6 and 6', which is the para position on each benzene ring. Wait, but if each benzene ring has a nitro and
