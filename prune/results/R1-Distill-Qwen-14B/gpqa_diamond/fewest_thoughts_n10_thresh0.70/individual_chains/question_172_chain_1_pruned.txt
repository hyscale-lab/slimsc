Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let me try to think through this.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. But I'm guessing the actual value of the energy difference might not be directly needed for the equation part, since the options don't have numbers—probably because the relationship is about the temperatures.

Oh right, the stars are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So the Boltzmann equation applies here. Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE / (k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the excitation level is twice as much for star_1. So for star_1, n_upper1 / n_lower1 is twice as much as n_upper2 / n_lower2. Let's denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 R2.

But wait, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So for each star, the excitation (n_upper) is relative. So maybe R1 = 2 R2, where R is the upper to lower population ratio. Because higher excitation means more atoms in the upper energy level.

So according to the Boltzmann equation, R = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). If we assume that the statistical weights (g) are the same for both stars (since we're comparing two stars and the same transition in each), then g_upper/g_lower is a constant for both stars. Let's call this constant 'A', so R = A * exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So for star_1, R1 = A * exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
And for star_2, R2 = A * exp(-
