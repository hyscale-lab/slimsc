Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my astrophysics class that this has something to do with the Boltzmann equation. Let me think through this step by step.

The question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So LTE means we can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Since the problem mentions a specific energy level, I think we can assume that the statistical weights (g_i and g_j) are the same for both stars. Or maybe the ratio g_i/g_j is the same for both stars? Well, the problem doesn't give any info about the statistical weights, so perhaps we can consider the ratio as 1, simplifying the equation to n_i/n_j = exp( - (ΔE)/(k T) ), where ΔE is E_i - E_j.

Wait, but in the problem, the excitation is higher in star_1. So for star_1, the population in the excited state is twice that of star_2. Let me denote the populations as n1 and n2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

So, applying the Boltzmann equation for each star:

For star_1: n1 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - ΔE/(k T1) )
For star_2: n2 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - ΔE/(k T2) )

But since the question states that the ratio is n1/n2 = 2, and assuming the statistical weights are the same for both stars, the (g_i/g_j) ratios are equal. So dividing the two equations:

n1/n2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] /
