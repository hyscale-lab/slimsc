Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method depends on the size of the planet relative to its star and the alignment of the orbit. Let me think about what factors influence the probability of a transit.

I recall that the probability (P) of a planet transiting is given by P = R_p / a, where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Oh right! More accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s), where R_s is the star's radius. Because the transit happens when the planet passes in front of the star, so the chance is higher if the planet is larger relative to the star.

Wait, but the formula I remember is something like (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (1 / a) because the orbital plane needs to be edge-on. Oh wait, no, the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a * sin i) ), but I'm getting a bit confused. Oh wait, no, the actual formula for the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (1 / a) only if we're considering the area or something else? Hmm, maybe I should double-check.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula for the probability of a planet transiting is P ≈ (R_p / R_s) * (1 / a) )^(-1/2) ? No, that doesn't sound right. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (1 / (a)) because the area of the star is π R_s², and the area of the planet's disk is π R_p². So the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by some geometric factor, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, no, I think the transit probability is given by the formula:

P = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (1 + (R_p / R_s)) )

Wait, maybe that's not it. Oh right, the actual probability is P = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a (e=0, circular orbits))) ??? No, wait, I'm mixing up things. Let me think again.

Wait, I've read before that for a circular orbit, the probability of a transit is approximately (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (1 / (a)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s) divided by (a) because the planet has to be in the right part of the sky. Wait, no, maybe it's (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (1 / (a)) because the area where the planet can transit is a line in the sky, so the probability is the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size, multiplied by 1 over the semi-major axis (a) because the planet's orbital plane has to be aligned within a certain angle.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is: P = (R_p / R_s) / (a) * something else. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (1 / a) but actually, the semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period and the star's mass via Kepler's third law.

Wait, since the problem gives the orbital periods, maybe I can find a way to relate the semi-major axes using Kepler's law. Kepler's third law states that (a^3) / (P^2) = (G(M_s + M_p)) / (4π²). But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_s + M_p ≈ M_s. So a^3 ∝ P² M_s.

Wait, given that both planets have the same mass, but different periods and stellar masses. Planet_1 has a period P1, and Planet_2 has P2 = 3 * P1. The mass of Planet_1's star is M1 = 2 M2, where M2 is the mass of Planet_2's star.

So using Kepler's law: a ∝ (P² * M_s)^(1/3). So for each planet:

a1 ∝ (P1² * M1)^(1/3) → since M1 = 2 M2, and P1 is the period, but wait, wait, sorry, Kepler's law is a^3 = (G(M_s) * P^2)/(4π²). So a is proportional to (P^2 * M_s)^(1/3).

So for Planet_1, a1 = k * (P1^2 * M1)^(1/3)
For Planet_2, a2 = k * (P2^2 * M2)^(1/3)

Wait, but P2 is 3 * P1, so P2 = 3 P1. Let me plug that in.

So a1 = k * (P1² * 2 M2)^(1/3)
a2 = k * ( (3 P1)^2 * M2 )^(1/3 )

Let me compute a1 and a2:

a1 = k * (2 M2 P1²)^(1/3) → (2)^(1/3) * (M2)^(1/3) * (P1²)^(1/3)

a2 = k * (9 P1² * M2)^(1/3) → (9)^(1/3) * (M2)^(1/3) * (P1²)^(1/3)

So a1 = k * (2)^(1/3) * ... and a2= k * (9)^(1/3) * ... 

So a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3)

Wait, let me compute (9/2)^(1/3). 9 is 3², 2 is 2, so 9/2 = (3²)/(2^1) → cube root of that is 3^(2/3) / 2^(1/3) ≈ (since 3^(2/3) is about 2.08, and 2^(1/3) is about 1.26) → 2.08 / 1.26 ≈ 1.65. So a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Wait, no, wait, calculating 9/2 = 4.5. The cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65. So a2 ≈ 1.65 * a1.

Wait, but actually, let me compute the ratio a2/a1:

a2/a1 = (9^(1/3) * M2^(1/3) * (P1^2)^(1/3)) / (2^(1/3) * M2^(1/3) * (P1^2)^(1/3)) )

Simplify that: (9/2)^(1/3) = ( (3^2)/(2) )^(1/3) ) = 3^(2/3) / 2^(1/3) ≈ (2.08) / (1.26) ≈ 1.65. So a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Wait, but wait: Planet_1 has a period that is shorter than Planet_2's. Since P2 is longer (3 times P1), and M1 is larger (twice M2). So a2 being larger than a1 makes sense because longer period and larger star mass would lead to a larger semi-major axis.

Wait, no, Kepler's third law: a^3 ∝ P² M. So if P increases, a increases. If M increases, a increases.

So Planet_2 has a longer period, so larger a. But since the star is less massive (M2 is smaller than M1, which is 2 M2), does that affect a2?

Wait, for Planet_1: a1^3 ∝ (P1^2) * (2 M2)
For Planet_2: a2^3 ∝ ( (3 P1)^2 ) * (M2 )

So a2^3 = 9 P1^2 * M2 = (9/2) (2 M2 P1^2) ) → a2^3 = 4.5 (a1^3) ) → because a1^3 is proportional to 2 M2 P1^2.

Wait, so a2^3 = (9 P1^2 M2) = (9/2) (2 P1^2 M2) ) = (9/2) * (a1^3) ) → a2^3 = (9/2) a1^3 → a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ a1 * 1.65.

So a2 is about 1.65 times a1. So a1 is smaller than a2.

Now, the transit probability depends on (R_p / R_s) / a. Wait, no, let's think about the formula again. The probability is given by P = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / a) ?

No, wait, I think the correct formula for the probability of a transit is approximately (R_p / R_s) * (1 / a) * something else. Or is it more like (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a)).

Wait, according to what I remember, the transit probability for a circular orbit is P = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a)) ) * (1 / sin i), but since i is 90 degrees for transiting, sin i = 1. But in reality, the probability is based on the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits. The geometric probability is given by (R_p / R_s) / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ), but since e is zero (circular orbits), it's (R_p / R_s) / a.

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the formula. But since I can't look up, I'll try to derive it.

The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that, from our perspective, the planet passes in front of the star. The probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance.

The formula is: P ≈ (R_p / R_s) * (1 / a) * (1 / 2), but I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the angular size of the star to the planet's orbital distance. So the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s) divided by a (but in actuality, it's (R_p / R_s) divided by (a), but scaled by the solid angle).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of the geometry.

Imagine the star as a circle with radius R_s. The planet's orbit is a circle of radius a. The area from which the planet can transit is a circle on the sky, but the probability depends on the likelihood that the orbital plane is edge-on. The formula I've come across before is P ≈ (R_p / R_s) * (1 / a) * something. But perhaps more accurately, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (1 / a), but also, considering that the star's position in the sky can allow the planet to transit.

Wait, I found in my notes that for a circular orbit, the probability of a transit is given by P = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / a) ) * (1/(1 - e²))^(1/2), but since e=0 here, it's simply P = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / a).

Wait, that can't be right because when a is larger, the probability should be lower, which this formula would capture, since 1/a is smaller. So the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s) * (1/a).

Wait, but wait, in that case, for a planet with same R_p, a smaller a would give higher probability. So in this problem, since Planet_1 has a shorter period, which implies a smaller a (since a^3 ∝ P^2 M), so Planet_1's a is smaller than Planet_2's.

But we also have to consider the host stars' radii. The problem states that both host stars have the same radii.

So R_s is the same for both planets.

So transit probability P is proportional to (R_p / R_s) * (1 / a).

Assuming both planets have the same radius (since they are Earth-like, but the question doesn't specify if their radii are same; wait, the question says both planets have the same masses, but not necessarily same radii. However, Earth-like planets usually have similar radius to mass, but same mass doesn't necessarily mean same radius. Hmm, but the question may assume same R_p for both, or perhaps it's not given, so I'm not sure.

Wait, the question says: "Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods." So their masses are the same, but it doesn't say anything about their radii. So perhaps we can't assume their radii are same. But the question is about which has higher transit probability, so perhaps their R_p is the same? Wait, the question doesn't state that. Hmm. Oh, but wait, the question says the planets are Earth-like, so perhaps we can assume R_p is similar, but perhaps not identical. But since it's not given, maybe the problem assumes R_p is the same for both.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is independent of the planet's radius because R_p is much smaller than R_s, but in reality, it's not. So I think the transit probability depends on both R_p and a.

But given that the problem states that both have the same minimum masses, perhaps we can assume they have similar radii, but since the problem doesn't specify, I think the key factors here are the semi-major axes and the host star's radius.

Wait, but the question says the host stars have the same radii. So R_s is same for both. So the (R_p / R_s) term is same for both, assuming R_p is same, but the problem doesn't specify. However, the question says both are Earth-like, so for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can assume R_p is the same.

So with that, P ∝ (1 / a). So the planet with smaller a will have higher probability.

From earlier, a2 is about 1.65 times a1, so a1 is smaller. So P1 (probability for Planet_1) is higher than P2.

But wait, let me recheck the calculation of a1 and a2.

For Planet_1: a1^3 = (G * M1 * P1^2) / (4 π²)
For Planet_2: a2^3 = (G * M2 * P2^2) / (4 π²)
Since P2 = 3 P1 and M1 = 2 M2.

So a2^3 = (G * M2 * (3 P1)^2) / (4 π²) = (G * M2 * 9 P1^2 ) / (4 π²)
Which is 9 G M2 P1^2 / (4 π²)

a1^3 = (G * 2 M2 * P1^2 ) / (4 π²) = 2 G M2 P1^2 / (4 π² )

So the ratio a2^3 / a1^3 = (9 G M2 P1^2 / 4 π² ) / (2 G M2 P1^2 / 4 π² ) ) = 9/(2) = 4.5.

So a2^3 =4.5 a1^3 → a2 = (4.5)^(1/3) * a1. 4.5 is 9/2, so cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65. So a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So a1 is smaller than a2. So P1 = (R_p1 / R_s) * (1 / a1)
P2 = (R_p2 / R_s) * (1 / a2)

Assuming R_p1 = R_p2 (since same mass, same radius as Earth), then P1/P2 = (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) = a2 / a1 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

But wait, what if R_p is different? The problem doesn't state that the planets have the same radius. But since they have the same mass, perhaps their radii are similar. Let's assume R_p1 = R_p2. Then yes, P1 is 1.65 times higher than P2.

So the researchers should prefer Planet_1 because it has a higher probability to transit.

Wait, but wait! The question says "the probability of transiting". So which has higher probability? If Planet_1 has a higher P, you prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit."

Option D says "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability."

Hmm, wait, earlier I thought a2 is 1.65 a1, so P1 is (1/a1) and P2 is (1/a2) → so P1 = 1/a1, P2 = 1/(1.65 a1) → P1 is 1.65 times P2. So P1 is higher.

So the probability of transit is higher for Planet_1.

So the correct answer would be option C or D.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation.

a2 = (9/2)^(1/3) * a1.

Which is cube root of 4.5, which is approximately 1.65.

So a2 = 1.65 a1.

So a1 = a2 /1.65.

So P1 = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / a1 ) = (R_p/R_s) * (1/(a2 /1.65 )) = (R_p/R_s) * (1.65 / a2 )

And P2 = (R_p/R_s) * (1 / a2 )

So P1 = 1.65 * P2.

So Planet_1 has 1.65 times the probability of Planet_2.

So the correct choice is option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

Looking at the options:

Option C is "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit."

So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait another thought. The transit probability formula is not exactly (1/a). Let me think again.

The transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s) * (1 / a) * (1 / (1 + (R_p/R_s)) ), but for small R_p/R_s, this approximates to (R_p / R_s) * (1/a). So our earlier approach holds.

So yes, the conclusion is that Planet_1 has a higher probability, 1.65 times higher, so option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula for circular orbits:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_p}{R_s} \cdot \frac{1}{a}
\]

Here:
- \(R_p\) is the planet's radius,
- \(R_s\) is the star's radius,
- \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

### Key Information:
1. **Planet_1 and Planet_2** have the same mass and Earth-like characteristics.
2. **Orbital Periods**: Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period (\(P_1\)) compared to Planet_2 (\(P_2 = 3P_1\)).
3. **Stellar Masses**: The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of the star hosting Planet_2 (\(M_1 = 2M_2\)).
4. **Stellar Radii**: Both stars have the same radius (\(R_s\)).

### Step 1: Relating Semi-Major Axes
Using Kepler's third law for circular orbits:
\[
a^3 \propto P^2 \cdot M_s
\]
For Planet_1:
\[
a_1^3 \propto P_1^2 \cdot M_1
\]
For Planet_2:
\[
a_2^3 \propto P_2^2 \cdot M_2
\]
Substituting \(P_2 = 3P_1\) and \(M_1 = 2M_2\):
\[
a_2^3 \propto (3P_1)^2 \cdot M_2 = 9P_1^2 \cdot M_2
\]
\[
a_1^3 \propto P_1^2 \cdot 2M_2 = 2P_1^2 \cdot M_2
\]
Taking the ratio:
\[
\frac{a_2^3}{a_1^3} = \frac{9P_1^2 \cdot M_2}{2P_1^2 \cdot M_2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{1/3} \approx 1.65
\]
Thus, \(a_2 \approx 1.65a_1\).

### Step 2: Transit Probability
The transit probability is proportional to:
\[
P \propto \frac{R_p}{R_s} \cdot \frac{1}{a}
\]
Assuming both planets have the same radius (\(R_p\)) and the stars have the same radius (\(R_s\)):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{1}{a_1}}{\frac{1}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 1.65
\]
Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
