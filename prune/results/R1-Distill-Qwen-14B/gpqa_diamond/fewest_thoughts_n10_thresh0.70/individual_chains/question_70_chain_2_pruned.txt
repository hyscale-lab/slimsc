Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, let's break down the reactions step by step.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E. So, C + 2D → E.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, C + H2O → A + F + G.

Fourth clue: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, D + B → H.

I need to figure out what these substances could be. Let me think about each step.

Starting with the first reaction: A and B in a 1:8 ratio. Bright red product C. Hmm, what reactions form bright red products? I'm thinking maybe something like sulfur reacting, but not sure. Or perhaps lead dioxide is reddish, but I don't know. Another thought: Maybe it's a reaction involving transition metals, like a metal reacting with a halogen or something else.

Wait, let's think about the third reaction: C reacting with water gives back A and two acids. If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, maybe C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For instance, if C is a sulfide or some other compound that can hydrolyze into two different acids.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a nitride? Nitrides can react with water to produce ammonia (a weak base, but maybe in this case it's part of the acid? Or perhaps another scenario. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide reacting with water to form a metal hydroxide and an acid. Wait, no—metals normally form bases when reacted with water, unless it's a non-metal oxide.

Wait, but the third reaction says C + H2O → A + F + G. So, perhaps C is a salt that, when it reacts with water, undergoes hydrolysis. For example, if C is a nitride (like Mg3N2), when it reacts with water, it would produce NH3 and a base (like Mg(OH)2). But since F and G are acids, maybe C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid? Or perhaps a more complex scenario.

Wait, another angle: looking at the second reaction, C reacts with D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. What compounds are extremely hazardous? Maybe something like phosgene, or sarin gas, or perhaps something like ozone or a strong acid gas.

Wait, the fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So, D + B → H. H is a solvent—maybe like water, but probably something else. Wait, what are common solvents? Ether, alcohol, maybe something like CO2? Or perhaps H is
