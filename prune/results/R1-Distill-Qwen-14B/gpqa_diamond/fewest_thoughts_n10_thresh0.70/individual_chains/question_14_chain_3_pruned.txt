Okay, so I'm trying to solve this ChIP-seq question. Let me read it again.

The question says that they did a ChIP-seq experiment using PFA-fixed samples with an antibody against the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells. After sequencing, they aligned and called peaks, but when they used PFA plus DSG fixation, the peaks disappeared. The question is where these peaks are most likely found.

Hmm. I remember that PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is a crosslinker. It's commonly used in ChIP experiments to fix proteins to DNA, so the cells are treated with PFA to crosslink proteins and DNA. Then the cells are lysed, and the DNA-protein complexes are sheared and immunoprecipitated.

Wait, but the question is about comparing PFA alone versus PFA+DSG. DSG is another crosslinker, I think. DSG stands for disuccinimide, which is a longer crosslinker than formaldehyde. So when you use PFA followed by DSG, you might be doing a more extensive crosslinking. Or wait, maybe PFA is formaldehyde. Oh wait, I think PFA is the same as formaldehyde in terms of crosslinking. So PFA is another name for it. So the question is about using PFA fixation versus PFA plus DSG.

Wait, no. Wait, I think PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is a form of formaldehyde. So when you fix with PFA, it's the same as formaldehyde. DSG is a different crosslinker. Maybe the question is about using two crosslinkers in sequence.

I remember that sometimes, when crosslinking with formaldehyde isn't sufficient, especially for proteins that are in the same complex but not directly crosslinked, they use a second crosslinker like DSG. But DSG is a homobifunctional crosslinker, which can create longer links. So maybe when you fix with PFA and then DSG, you get more crosslinking between proteins, but perhaps it doesn't crosslink proteins to DNA as effectively?

Wait no, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Formaldehyde (or PFA) crosslinks proteins to DNA. DSG is used in some protocols to crosslink proteins that are close together but not directly attached. So for example, in cases where the protein of interest is part of a larger complex, you might use DSG to pull down all the associated proteins.

But in the context of ChIP-seq, when you do crosslinking, you want the transcription factor to be crosslinked to the DNA it's bound to. So when you use more crosslinking (like DSG), does that affect that?

Alternatively, maybe the issue is that DSG might not crosslink as efficiently to DNA, or perhaps it's harder to reverse the crosslinking when using DSG. Wait, no, because DSG is a protein-protein crosslinker, not DNA. So perhaps when using DSG, the DNA-protein crosslinking is less efficient, or perhaps the conditions used in the procedure interfere with DNA shearing or IP.

Wait, wait. The problem is that when they used PFA plus DSG, the ChIP peaks disappeared. So the peaks were present when
