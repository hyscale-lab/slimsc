Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused about how to approach it. Let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom.

Hmm, the problem states that the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. Also, it mentions that m is small, which I think refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, but I'm a bit rusty on quantum numbers. Oh right, the magnetic quantum number m can take values from -l to +l in integer steps, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. But here, m is small, so maybe m is close to zero or small in magnitude.

The question is comparing two things: the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. The transition energy is given with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. That's the Balmer series, I think. Because 0.486 micrometers is the wavelength for the hydrogen Balmer-alpha emission line, which is about 1.9 eV in energy. Wait, no, let me calculate that because I might be mixing up things.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Let me compute that. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s, Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1e-9 meters. So plugging the numbers in:

E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m) 

Let me compute that. First, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 486.1e-9 m, which is 486.1e-9 is 4.861e-7 meters. So 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approximately 4.089e-19 J. To convert that to electron volts, since 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So 4.089e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. Wait, but I thought Balmer-alpha was about 1.9 eV... Maybe I made a mistake in the wavelength. Wait, Balmer-alpha is usually around 656 nm, which is longer than 486 nm. Oh wait, 486 nm is the Balmer-beta line, right? No, wait, Balmer-alpha is n=2 to n=1? Or wait, the Balmer series is transitions from higher energy levels to n=2. So, the most common one is n=3 to n=2, which is about 656 nm (red light). 486 nm would be n=4 to n=2, which is the Balmer-beta line, and that has a higher energy, so higher frequency, hence shorter wavelength. So the energy I calculated as around 2.55 eV makes sense because higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths.

Wait, but maybe I should double-check the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I can use E = 12400 eV·nm / λ (in nm). 12400 is a useful number for converting wavelength to energy in eV. So 12400 / 486.1 ≈ let me calculate. 486.1 nm is 486.1e-9 m, but when using the formula, it's easier to use nm. So 12400 eV·nm / 486.1 nm = approximately 25.48 eV? Wait
