Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the final product is. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is benzene. Then, it undergoes a series of reactions, each producing a product. My job is to track each transformation and see what the final product looks like.

First step: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitrating benzene requires a nitrating mixture, which is H2SO4 and HNO3. This should nitrate the benzene ring. Nitration is an electrophilic substitution reaction. Benzene will get a nitro group. But where does it attach?

Benzene is symmetric, so the nitro group can attach in any position, but since nothing else is present, it'll just be nitrobenzene. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Next step: Product 1 (nitrobenzene) is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Oh right, that's a bromination reaction. But wait, nitro groups are meta-directing. So when nitrobenzene reacts with Br2 in the presence of Fe (which is a catalyst for bromination), the bromine will add in the meta position relative to the nitro group.

Wait, nitro groups are strong meta directors. So the bromine will enter at the meta position. So product 2 would be meta-bromonitrobenzene. Structure-wise, benzene ring with a nitro group at position 1 and bromine at position 3 (if we number starting from nitro as position 1, then bromo is at position 3).

Wait no, let me think about numbering. Suppose the nitro group is at position 1. Then, the possible substitution is positions 3 and 5 (meta). So bromine would be at position 3 or 5. Since the ring is symmetric, it doesn't matter which. So product 2 is 3-bromo-nitrobenzene.

Third step: Product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. That's a hydrogenation reaction. Pd is usually for catalytic hydrogenation. Since the group we have is a nitro group (NO2), hydrogenation would reduce it. So the nitro group (NO2) becomes an amino group (NH2). So product 3 would be 3-bromoaniline.

Wait, let me confirm:
