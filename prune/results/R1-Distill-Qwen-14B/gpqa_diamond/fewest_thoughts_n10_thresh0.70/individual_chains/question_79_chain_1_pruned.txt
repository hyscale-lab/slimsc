Okay, so I've got this problem here about an organic chemistry reaction. Let's see what I can figure out. The question is about identifying Compound X based on the NMR data of the product after a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (which is a common reagent for epoxide ring-opening, I think). 

First, I need to understand what reaction is taking place. The compound X is reacting with a reagent that's typically used for ring-opening of epoxides. Wait, no, wait—actually, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a bulky amine, and I remember it's used in the Oppenauer oxidation. Oh wait, no, Oppenauer is for ketone oxidations. Alternatively, wait, I think that's used in the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides. Or maybe it's a base? Or perhaps it's a catalyst for some other reaction. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a solvent system. Wait, the reaction is done in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K (which is about 130°C) for a day. So, high temperature and a bulky amine—could it be an epoxide opening? Or maybe a different ring-opening reaction?

Wait, but the product's NMR is given. So the product is formed from Compound X after this reaction. So Compound X must be something that, when treated under these conditions, gives a specific product. Let me look at the NMR data of the product.

The 1H NMR shows:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): that's a singlet, so maybe a methyl group attached to something deshielded. Maybe a carbonyl adjacent, or an aromatic ring?
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): another singlet methyl group. Could be two different methyl groups attached in different environments.
- δ 6.75 (1H, d): a doublet. Perhaps a coupling with another proton on an aromatic ring.
- δ 7.08 (2H, d): two protons as a doublet. Maybe part of an aromatic ring with substituents.
- δ 7.68 (1H, d):
