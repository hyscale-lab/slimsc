Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with Grubbs catalyst reactions, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and figuring out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, first, I need to remember what Grubbs catalyst does. From what I recall, Grubbs is used for olefin metathesis, right? Metathesis is when the positions of the substituents on either side of a double bond are exchanged. It can be ring-closing or ring-opening, depending on the structure. Oh wait, and it's a catalyst for the redistribution of alkene fragments.

So the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw that structure. Pent means five carbons. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl substituent on the third carbon. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So for 3-methyl, the substituent is on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that can't be right because the 3rd carbon would have CH2 groups on either side. Oh wait, maybe I should number from the double bond. Wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Let's think again: pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Now, 3-methyl would add a methyl group on the third carbon. So that's the CH2 group in CH2CH2. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2? No, no, wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But
