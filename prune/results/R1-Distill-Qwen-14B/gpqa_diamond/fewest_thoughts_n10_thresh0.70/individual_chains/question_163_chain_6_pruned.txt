Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit a newbie, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, find out the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to do that, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I should figure out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. The molar mass calculation might be necessary here. Iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, has a molar mass. Iron is about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So let's compute that.

Fe: 55.85 g/mol
O: 3 * 16 = 48 g/mol
H: 3 * 1 = 3 g/mol
Total molar mass = 55.85 + 48 + 3 = 106.85 g/mol.

So, moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let me write that as approximately 9.36e-4 moles.

Now, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base. When it dissolves in water, it can react with water to form Fe(OH)2+ and OH- ions. But since we're adding a strong acid, the acid will react with the hydroxide ions to dissolve the Fe(OH)3.

The reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid, like HCl, would be something like:
Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So, each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ ions to dissolve completely. Since the acid is monobasic, each mole provides one mole of H+.

So, moles of H+ needed = 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 * 9.36e-4 = 0.002808 moles.

Wait, but the question is about the volume of 0.1 M acid needed. So, using the formula M = moles / volume (in liters), rearranged to volume = moles / M.

So, volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. But wait, the options don't have exactly 28, but option C is 28.05 cm³. So that's close. But wait, maybe I should double-check the calculation.

Wait, 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 divided by 106.85 g/mol. Let me recalculate that. 0.1 / 106.85 = approximately 0.00093597 moles. So 0.00093597 *3 = 0.0028079 moles H+ needed.

Then, volume = 0.0028079 / 0.1 = 0.028079 liters, which is 28.079 cm³. So approximately 28.0
