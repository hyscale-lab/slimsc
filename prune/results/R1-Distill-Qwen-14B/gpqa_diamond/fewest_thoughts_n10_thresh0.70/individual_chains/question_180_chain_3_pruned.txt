Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, I remember that electric potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula, right? Let me think... Oh wait, the formula is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But wait, when you have multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair, right?

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh, wait, e is the elementary charge, which is about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C. 

Twelve of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from point P. The 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th charge is at the center, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from it. Wait, but each of those 12 charges is 2e, so the interactions are between the 13th and each of the 12, and also between each of the 12 and each other.

Wait, but the problem says it's an isolated system, so we need to consider all the interactions. So the total potential energy would be the sum of all the potential energies between each pair of charges.

Wait, but in this setup, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th. But what about the distance between the 12 charges themselves? Are they all at the same point, or spread out? The question says they're constrained to stay at 2m from P. So maybe they're all at the same distance from P but can they be at any position on the sphere of radius 2m around P? So the distance between any two of them could be varying, but perhaps for the minimum energy, they would arrange themselves as far apart as possible. Wait, but the problem says to find the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, but maybe the potential energy between the 12 charges is minimized when they are
