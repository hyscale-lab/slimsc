Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about an isolated system with 13 identical particles. Each of these particles has a charge of 2e, and their mass is negligible. Twelve of them are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with systems of charges, the potential energy comes into play. Since the system is isolated, I think we're dealing with electrostatic potential energy here.

So, each charge is 2e. e is the elementary charge, which is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge here is 2 * 1.602e-19 C, which is 3.204e-19 C. But wait, maybe I don't need to calculate each charge's value numerically yet. Let me think.

The setup is that all the 12 charges are fixed at a distance of 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th charge is fixed, and the others are fixed at 2 meters away. Since the problem is about the minimum energy, I'm thinking about how the potential energy is arranged.

Wait a second, potential energy between charges. The formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N m²/C².

But in this case, the charges are identical. So each pair contributes to the total potential energy. But wait, since each of the 12 charges is interacting with the charge at P, and also with each other, the total potential energy is a sum of all these interactions.

Wait, but the system's minimum energy... Hmm, but the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. So their positions relative to P are fixed. But they might be arranged in some configuration relative to each other. Wait, but the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So each of them is 2m away from P, but they can move on the sphere of radius 2 m around P. But since the problem is considering the minimum energy, perhaps the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the total potential energy.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The charge at P is fixed, so the other 12 are all 2m away from it. So each of these 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P. Now, each of these 12 charges also interact with each other. So the total potential energy of the system will be the sum of two parts: the potential energy between the fixed charge at P and each of the 12 charges, and the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, but is the fixed charge at P also a charge? Yes, the 13th charge is fixed
