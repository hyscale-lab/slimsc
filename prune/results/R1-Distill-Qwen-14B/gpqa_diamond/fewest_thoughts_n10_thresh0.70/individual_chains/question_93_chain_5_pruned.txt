Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my qPCR details, but let me think this through.

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He did three technical replicates for each concentration. The efficiency was 100%, which I think is perfect because qPCR efficiency is usually around 90-110%, so 100% is top-notch. The R² was 1, which means the data fits the curve perfectly. The slope was -3.3. Wait, what's the typical slope for a qPCR curve?

I remember that the slope in the qPCR equation is related to efficiency. The formula I think is something like y = mx + b, where y is the Ct value and x is the log of the starting quantity. The standard formula for efficiency is E = 10^(-1/slope). So with a slope of -3.3, let's calculate E. The slope is negative because as the starting quantity increases, Ct decreases. So E = 10^(-1/(-3.3)) ≈ 10^(0.303). 10^0.3 is about 2, because 10^0.3010 is 2 (since log10(2) is ~0.301). So E is approximately 2, which is 100% efficiency because 2 = 1 + (100% efficiency). Oh, wait, the efficiency formula is E = 1 + (10^(-1/slope) - 1). Wait, no, I think the standard formula is E = 10^(-1/slope) when the equation is Ct = (1/slope) * log(target) + intercept. Wait no, the general equation is Ct = (1/slope) * log(starting quantity) + intercept. So the slope in qPCR is the inverse of the efficiency factor. Wait, maybe I should get this straight.

Alternatively, the efficiency E is calculated as E = 10^(-1/slope), right? So with a slope of -3.3, the calculation is 10^(-1/-3.3) = 10^(1/3.3)
