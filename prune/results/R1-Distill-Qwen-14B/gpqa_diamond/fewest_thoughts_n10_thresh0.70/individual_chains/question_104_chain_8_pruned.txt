Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I've studied a bit about this before, so let me think through it step by step.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected each planet, and the shift in the spectral lines is given for each. 

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull. The velocity semi-amplitude K is the maximum speed of the star's movement. So the shift would relate to this K value.

The formula I think I need is the one that relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the orbital period P. Oh right, the formula is K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) )? Wait, maybe I'm mixing some terms. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the distance (semi-major axis). 

Alternatively, perhaps the key relation is that K is proportional to (M_planet * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3))) ). Since the planet masses are similar and much smaller than the stars (Neptune's mass is about 17 Earth masses, stars are sun-like), M_planet/M_star is negligible. So we can approximate that (1 + M_planet/M_star) is ~1, so it simplifies the formula.

So K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M
