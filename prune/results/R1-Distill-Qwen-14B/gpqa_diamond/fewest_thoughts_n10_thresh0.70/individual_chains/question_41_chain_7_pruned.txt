Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's see. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We're supposed to find the speed of light relative to the observer. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light in it doesn't just add up with the medium's speed like in classical mechanics. Because light is an electromagnetic wave, right? So maybe I should think about special relativity here. Oh wait, but the options don't seem to involve anything relativistic, like gamma factors or anything. So maybe it's more about relative motion and the properties of the medium.

Another thought: The speed of light in a medium is given by v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But if the medium itself is moving, how does that affect the observed speed? I think in the rest frame of the medium, the light is moving at c/n. But when the medium is moving relative to the lab frame, how does that change things?

Wait, maybe the key is that the speed of light in the medium is always c/n, regardless of the medium's motion. Because in any inertial frame, light should still move at c/n in the medium. But wait, that can't be right because if the medium is moving, the speed relative to the lab would be different. Or is it?

Wait, no. The speed of light in the medium is c/n, but that's measured in the medium's rest frame. From the lab frame, which is moving relative to the medium, the speed might be different. Hmm. So perhaps I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but wait a second. The velocity addition formula applies when you have two inertial frames moving relative to each other. So let's model this. The medium (glass) is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. In the medium's rest frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n. We need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

So applying the velocity addition formula: u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c² )

Wait, but wait. The direction matters. In this case, the light is moving in the same direction as the medium's motion. So in the medium's frame, the light is moving at u' = speed in medium. Then, from the lab frame, it would be u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²)).

But wait, wait. Wait, the problem says the glass is moving towards the observer. Wait, no, the glass is moving toward the observer, but the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the light's velocity in the medium's frame is in the same direction as the medium's velocity relative to the lab.

So let's plug in u' = c/n, and v is the velocity of the medium relative to lab. So u = (
