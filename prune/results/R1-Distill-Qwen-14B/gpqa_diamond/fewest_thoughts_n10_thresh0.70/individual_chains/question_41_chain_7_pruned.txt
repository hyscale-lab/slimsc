Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I've studied a bit about this before, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Wait, wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer and in the same direction as the light beam. So the light is going through the glass which is itself moving.

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly because of the velocity addition formulas. Oh right, because the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames according to Einstein's postulate.

Wait, so the speed of light in a medium at rest is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So v_medium = c/n.

But now, the medium (the glass) is moving. So how does that affect the speed of light as measured in the lab frame?

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity here.

Wait, the standard velocity addition formula is for when you have velocities u in one frame, and the frame is moving at speed v relative to the other. So the formula is u' = (
