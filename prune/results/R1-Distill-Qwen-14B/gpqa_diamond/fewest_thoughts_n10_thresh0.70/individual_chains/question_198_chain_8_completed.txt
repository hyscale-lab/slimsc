--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand.

The problem is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are given: total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D.

Hmm, stability constants. Right, these β values represent the formation of complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So each β corresponds to a different complex, probably with different numbers of SCN- ligands attached.

Wait, the complexes are Co(SCN)_n, where n increases. So β1 would be for the first complex, maybe [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for the second, like [Co(SCN)_2]^(?), and so on up to β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait a second, β4 is lower than β3? So the fourth complex is less stable than the third. Interesting. So maybe the most stable is the third one.

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would have two SCN- ligands, I think. So that would be the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^(?), right? Because di means two.

Wait, but wait, no. Dithiocyanato might refer to a different structure. Or perhaps the blue color comes from a specific complex, maybe the one with two SCN- ions? Or maybe another number. Hmm, I might need to think about this.

Wait, the problem states that the solution has "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes"—so I think dithiocyanato means two SCN- ligands. So the complex [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ would be the one in question.

But wait, let me think about the complexes. The general formula for the formation of Co(SCN)_n complexes would be:

Co²+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n+?), depending on the charge.

Each stability constant β_n is the formation constant for the nth complex, which is the product of the previous complex and adding another SCN^-.

Wait, the formation constants (β) are for each successive addition. So β1 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]^+:

β1 = [CoSCN]/([Co²+][SCN^-])

Similarly, β2 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^0:

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co²+][SCN^-]^2)

Wait, no. Because if you start with [Co²+], then β1 is [CoSCN]/([Co²+][SCN^-]).

Then β2 is the formation constant for adding another SCN^- to the first complex, so:

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([CoSCN][SCN^-]).

But when considering the overall formation, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2] from Co²+ and SCN^- would be β1 * β2. Because each step multiplies the previous β.

Wait, no, I think that's not correct. Because the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]²- (or whatever the charge is) would be the product of β1 and β2.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify. The stability constants are given for each step. So for each step, you have:

Step 1: Co²+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+  β1 = 9

Step 2: [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]  β2 = 40

Step 3: [Co(SCN)_2] + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_3]  β3 = 63

Step 4: [Co(SCN)_3] + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_4]^2-  β4 = 16

But the overall formation constant for each complex is the product of the previous βs. So, the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] would be β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, no. Think about it: the overall K for [CoSCN]^+ is β1. The K for [Co(SCN)_2] is β1 * β2. For [Co(SCN)_3], it's β1 * β2 * β3. And for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, it's β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

Wait, but β4 is 16, which is less than β3 and others. So the product up to β3 is larger than up to β4. Hmmm.

But wait, maybe I should compute the overall K for each complex. Let's see.

So the total concentration of all Co species is the sum of [Co²+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. So if dithiocyanato is two SCN ions, then [Co(SCN)_2] is the species in question.

Wait, but wait, I'm not entirely sure whether dithiocyanato refers to two or more. Because sometimes 'dithiocyanato' might imply two SCN ligands attached. So [Co(SCN)_2], which would be the species formed after two additions.

So, to find the percentage, I need to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] compared to the total Co species.

But how do I calculate this? 

I think the problem can be approached by considering the distribution of Co between its various complexation states, given the total concentration of Co and the high concentration of SCN^-.

Wait, the initial concentrations are [Co²+] = 1e-2 M, but wait, no. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. So all Co species (Co²+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2], etc.) sum up to 1e-2 M. The [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is much higher than [Co], so the availability of SCN^- is sufficient. So the formation of complexes is mostly determined by the stability constants.

Given that, the distribution of Co among the various complexes can be found by considering the relative stability of each complex.

The key approach here is to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the most stable one, or relative to all species.

Alternatively, since the solution is such that [SCN^-] is much higher than [Co²+], the complexes will form extensively. So the majority of Co might be in the more stable complexes.

But I think the approach is to calculate the fraction of each species, then find the one corresponding to the blue dithiocyanato complex.

Wait, the blue color is associated with a particular complex. Wait, I remember that in crystal field theory, different geometries and ligand field strengths can lead to different colors. For Co(II), which has a d^7 configuration, the ligand field strength affects the splitting of d-orbitals, which in turn affects the absorption wavelengths and thus the color.

But perhaps in this problem, the exact color isn't directly needed; the question refers to the blue dithiocyanato complex as [Co(SCN)_2]^(+) or something. Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Wait, I'm a bit confused about the common complexes. Wait, I think that the complex [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is usually a blue color. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe [Co(SCN)_2] is a different color. Hmm, but the problem states that the blue complexes are dithiocyanato, so two SCN-.

Wait, the problem says "blue dithiocyanato", so maybe it's [Co(SCN)_2]^(+), which is the second complex.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about that, but perhaps I should proceed with the calculation, assuming that the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2] and that it's the one contributing to the blue color.

So, to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2], I need to calculate the fraction of Co in this form relative to all forms.

The general formula for the fraction of each species is based on the relative formation constants and the concentrations of the ligand.

The fraction f_n of the nth complex is given by (β1 β2 ... βn) * [SCN^-]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN^-]^3 + ... + (β1β2β3β4) [SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, no, more accurately, for each species [Co(SCN)_n], the fraction is:

f_n = (K_n) [SCN^-]^n / D

where K_n is the overall stability constant for the nth complex, which is the product of β1 to βn.

And D is the denominator, the sum over all K_m [SCN^-]^m for m from 0 to 4.

So, K_0 is 1 (since no complexes), K_1 = β1, K_2 = β1 β2, K_3 = β1 β2 β3, K_4 = β1 β2 β3 β4.

Wait, but for K_0, it's just [Co²+], which would have K_0 = 1, and it's not multiplied by any [SCN^-].

So, D = [Co²+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4]^2-

But since [SCN^-] is much higher than [Co²+], and the βs are such that the complexes form, the concentration of free Co²+ is much lower than the complexed forms. So, the denominator D can be approximated as the sum of all the K_m [SCN^-]^m.

Because K_m [SCN^-]^m is the numerator of each term, so D = sum_{m=0}^4 K_m [SCN^-]^m, where K_0=1, K_1=β1, K_2=β1β2, etc.

Wait, but [Co²+] is part of D, so it's [Co²+] = c(Co) * f_0, where f_0 is the fraction in the free ion form.

But when [SCN^-] is high, most of the Co is in the complexed forms, so f_0 is small. But in our case, we have [SCN^-] = 0.1 M, and [Co] = 0.01 M. So, which is more significant? Let's see.

Wait, but calculating all of this requires knowing each term in the denominator.

So let me compute each K_m [SCN^-]^m. Let's compute each term:

Given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute K_0 = 1, K_1=9, K_2=9*40=360, K_3=9*40*63= 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, K_4=22680 *16= 362880.

Now, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So each term is K_m * (0.1)^m.

Compute each term:

Term_0: K_0*(0.1)^0 = 1 *1 = 1.

Term_1: 9 * (0.1)^1 = 0.9.

Term_2: 360 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6.

Term_3: 22680 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68.

Term_4: 362880 * (0.1)^4 = 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

Now, sum all these terms:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

+3.6 = 5.5

+22.68 = 28.18

+36.288 = 64.468.

So D = 64.468.

Now, the fraction f_2, which is [Co(SCN)_2]/D.

Wait, wait, no. The fraction is (K_2 [SCN^-]^2) / D.

Because the fraction of each species is (K_m [SCN^-]^m) / D.

So for K_2 and m=2, the term is 3.6.

So f_2 = 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05556.

Wait, but wait. Wait a minute, no! Because the K_m [SCN^-]^m is in the numerator for each species, but the denominator is the sum of all these terms. So each fraction is (K_m [SCN^-]^m) / D.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: when we have a series of complexes, the fraction of [Co(SCN)_n] is (K_n [SCN^-]^n) / sum_{m=0}^4 (K_m [SCN^-]^m).

So, for each complex, the fraction is the (K_n [SCN^-]^n) divided by the sum of all K_m [SCN^-]^m.

So, for the second complex (n=2), the fraction f_2 is (K_2 [SCN^-]^2 ) / D, where D is sum of all terms.

So, K_2 [SCN^-]^2 is 360 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6.

D is 64.468, so f_2 is 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05556.

Which is approximately 5.556%.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because the options don't include 5% or anything close. The options are 16.9%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 42.3%.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of complexes or the way the stability constants are applied.

Wait, another possibility: the stability constants may not be cumulative as I thought. Maybe each β_n is the cumulative constant up to that n.

Wait, no. Stability constants are typically for each step. So, the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of β1 through βn.

Yes, that's correct. So K_1=β1=9, K_2=β1*β2=360, K3= 360*63= 22680, K4=22680*16= 362880.

But wait, the problem is that when [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and the Ks are so high, the higher complexes are favored.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, the denominator D was approximately 64.468, and the fraction for the second complex is 3.6/64.468 ≈5.5%. But the options are much higher. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering that the total concentration of Co is 1e-2 M. Because the way I calculated D, it's the sum of all K_m [SCN^-]^m, but that sum is without considering the total concentration.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me think again.

The formation of the complexes is governed by the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand. The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all species:

[Co²+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4]^2- = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But when [SCN^-] is 0.1 M and the βs are high, the majority of Co is in the highest possible complex. So [Co(SCN)_4] is the most stable, but wait, no, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 (63). So the third complex is more stable than the fourth.

Wait, that's an important point. Because β4 is 16, which is less than β3 (63), the third complex is more stable than the fourth. So the highest K is K3 = β1β2β3 = 9*40*63=22680.

K4 is K3 * β4 = 22680 *16= 362880.

Wait, but K4 is higher than K3 because β4 is 16, which is smaller than β3. Wait, no: K4 is K3 multiplied by β4. So K4 = 22680 *16 = 362880.

So K4 is larger than K3, meaning that the fourth complex is more stable than the third. So the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but β4 is 16, which is less than β3 (63). So each step's β is the log K for adding that ligand.

Wait, perhaps the overall K for each complex is the product of the βs up to that step. So for [Co(SCN)_4], K4 = β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 = 9 *40 *63 *16 = 362880.

But that’s a very large K, much larger than K3=22680.

Wait, but no. Because β4 is 16, which is smaller than β3. So the product K4 is 362880, which is larger than K3=22680. So the fourth complex is more stable than the third.

Hmm, but that contradicts my earlier thought that a lower β means less stability. But perhaps I got that wrong.

Wait, the stability constant βn is the equilibrium constant for adding the nth ligand. So βn = [Co(SCN)_n]^+ / ([Co(SCN)_{n-1}][SCN^-}).

Thus, a higher βn means that the nth step is more favorable, leading to a more stable complex.

So with β4=16, which is lower than β3=63, the fourth step is less favorable than the third. So the third complex is more stable than the fourth.

Wait, that can't be, because K3 is 22680, and K4 is 22680 * 16= 362880, which is higher. So the K4 is larger, meaning the fourth complex is more stable than the third.

Wait, but that's confusing because β4 is less than β3. How is that possible?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the concept. The β value for each step is the formation constant for that step. So, for example:

β1 = [CoSCN]/([Co²+][SCN^-]) → K1=β1=9

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([CoSCN][SCN^-}]) → K2=β2=40

β3 = [Co(SCN)_3]/([Co(SCN)_2][SCN^-}) → K3=63

β4 = [Co(SCN)_4]/([Co(SCN)_3][SCN^-}) → K4=16

So the overall K for [Co(SCN)_4] is K1*K2*K3*K4 = 9*40*63*16=362880.

But for [Co(SCN)_3], the overall K is 9*40*63=22680.

So the K for the fourth complex is larger, which implies that the fourth complex is more stable than the third, even though β4 is lower than β3. That's because each step's β is multiplied into the overall K.

So perhaps the fourth complex is the most stable.

Hmm, but why is β4 lower than β3? Because each βn is the stepwise formation constant. A lower βn suggests that adding the fourth SCN^- is less favorable than adding the third. So, the third complex is more stable than the fourth? Or is the fourth more stable?

Wait, K4 is the product of all four βs, which is higher than K3. So K4 > K3 → [Co(SCN)_4] is more stable than [Co(SCN)_3].

So, the fourth complex is the most stable.

So, the highest term in the denominator is K4 [SCN^-]^4 = 362880 * (0.1)^4 = 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

Wait, but when I calculated the sum earlier, the denominator D was around 64.468. But that was when I considered K4 [SCN^-]^4 as 36.288, which is the largest term. So, the most abundant species is the fourth complex.

Wait, but according to that sum, D=64.468, which is the sum of all terms. So the fraction of each species is (K_m [SCN^-]^m) / D.

So for the fourth complex, f_4 = 36.288 / 64.468 ≈ 0.563, which is about 56.3%. But the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is the second complex—wait, no, the problem says "blue dithiocyanato", which would be the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2], right?

Wait, but earlier, when I calculated f_2, it was 3.6/64.468≈5.5%, which doesn't match any of the given options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] when considering all possible species. But according to the calculation, [Co(SCN)_2] is 3.6/64.468≈5.5% of the total. But the options don't have this, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the total concentration is 0.01 M, but in my earlier calculation, I didn't normalize by the total concentration. Maybe I should include the total concentration in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the fraction of each species relative to the total Co, considering the sum of all species equals c(Co) = 0.01 M.

Wait, the way I calculated D earlier was without considering the total Co concentration. I think that's where the mistake is.

Let me try a different approach. The total concentration of Co is the sum of all the species:

[Co²+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4]^2- = 0.01 M.

The fraction of each species is given by (K_m [SCN^-]^m) / sum (K_n [SCN^-]^n).

Wait, no, the fractions are (K_m [SCN^-]^m) / (sum K_n [SCN^-]^n) ) multiplied by the total Co concentration.

So, the sum of all the fractions (sum (K_m [SCN^-]^m) ) equals the sum, which is D, but in reality, the sum of all the Co species is 0.01 M. So each species' concentration is (K_m [SCN^-]^m / D) * 0.01.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each species' concentration as (K_m [SCN^-]^m) / D * c(Co).

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to find the fraction f_m for each species m, which is [Co(SCN)_m] / c(Co), which is the sum of all fractions equal to 1.

So, f_m = (K_m [SCN^-]^m) / (sum_{n=0}^4 K_n [SCN^-]^n )

Then, the total Co is the sum of [Co(SCN)_m] = sum (f_m c(Co) ) = c(Co).

So, to find [Co(SCN)_2], I can compute f_2 * c(Co).

So, let's compute each term again.

Compute K_0=1, K_1=9, K_2=360, K_3=22680, K_4=362880.

[SCN^-]=0.1:

Term_0 = 1*(0.1)^0 =1.

Term_1=9*(0.1)^1=0.9.

Term_2=360*(0.1)^2=3.6.

Term_3=22680*(0.1)^3=22.68.

Term_4=362880*(0.1)^4=36.288.

Sum all terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

Now, f_2=3.6 /64.468≈0.05556.

So [Co(SCN)_2] = f_2 * c(Co) = 0.05556 * 0.01 = 5.556e-4 M.

But the question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] out of all Co species. So the percentage is (5.556e-4 / 0.01) *100% = 5.556%.

But the options are all higher than that. So either I'm misunderstanding the question, or I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, but wait a second. Perhaps the problem refers to the dithiocyanato complexes, which could be both [Co(SCN)_2] and [Co(SCN)_4], but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is the tetrathiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, which would be the fourth complex, and I'm looking for f_4.

So, f_4 = 36.288 /64.468 ≈0.563 →56.3% → the percentage would be 56.3%, which is not among the options either. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the denominator. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, K_4 is 362880, but [SCN^-]^4 is (0.1)^4=0.0001. So 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Yes, that's correct.

So D=1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288=64.468.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about whether the given βs are for the overall complex or stepwise.

Wait, the problem states the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Are these the overall Ks for each complex or the stepwise Ks?

Wait, no, the way the question states it, the stability constants are for the various complexes. So, the first complex has β1=9, the second β2=40, etc.

Wait, wait, no. The question says the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. So, I think that β1 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

Wait, but that would imply that β2 is the formation constant for the second complex, not the stepwise. So perhaps the overall K for each complex is given as β1, β2, etc.

Wait, that would change things. Because if β1 is overall K for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2], etc., then each K is given, and I don't need to multiply the stepwise βs.

Ah! That's a crucial point. If each βn is the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n], then the K values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So, in that case, K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

Then, the denominator D would be the sum of each K [SCN^-]^n plus [Co²+].

Wait, but then [Co²+] would be the uncomplexed form, which has K0=1.

So, the denominator D would be [Co²+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But each term is K_n * [SCN^-]^n.

So,

Term_0: 1*(0.1)^0 =1.

Term_1:9*(0.1)^1=0.9.

Term_2:40*(0.1)^2=4.

Term_3:63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

Term_4:16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum D=1 +0.9=1.9, +4=5.9, +0.063=5.963, +0.0016=5.9646.

So D≈5.9646.

Now, the fraction f_2 is Term_2 / D = 4 /5.9646 ≈0.6695, which is about 66.95%.

But the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which would be [Co(SCN)_2], so this would be approximately 66.95%. But that's not among the options either. The options are up to 42.3%.

Hmm, so perhaps this approach is incorrect. Maybe the initial assumption that the βs are stepwise is correct, but then why the discrepancy with the options?

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the dithiocyanato as the third complex, but that doesn't align with 'di' meaning two.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex, and the question is asking about that.

Wait, but then f_4 would be 0.0016/5.9646≈0.000268 →0.0268%, which is even smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the βs are given in a different way, such as for the entire complex, but perhaps I should assume that the βn is the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^m, so K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

Wait, but then the denominator D would be approximately 5.9646, as above.

Hmm, perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, in the problem statement, the first β is given as β1=9, which is the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^+.

So, in that case, the βs are for each step, and the overall K for the second complex is K2=β1*β2=9*40=360.

So, the initial approach was correct, but that leads to [Co(SCN)_2] being around 5.5%, which is not an option.

Wait, but perhaps the dithiocyanato complex is not the second but the fourth. But that doesn't make sense with 'di'.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the number of SCN- ions in the complex as 'di', which would be two, so the second complex.

But according to the calculation, that's 5.5%, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the denominator. Let me recalculate the terms with stepwise βs.

With stepwise βs:

K1=β1=9 → K1=9.

K2=β1*β2=9*40=360.

K3=β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680.

K4=β1*β2*β3*β4=22680 *16=362880.

Each term is K_n [SCN^-]^n.

[SCN^-]=0.1 → (0.1)^n.

So,

Term_0:1 *1=1.

Term_1:9 *0.1=0.9.

Term_2:360 *0.01=3.6.

Term_3:22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term_4:362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum D=1+0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

So f_2=3.6/64.468≈0.05556 →5.556% → about 5.6%.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the first four complexes, but perhaps the calculation involves a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using conditional formation constants, considering the presence of excess SCN^-.

Wait, another approach: the concentration of free Co²+ is very low because SCN^- is in excess. So, [Co²+] << [CoSCN]^+ << [Co(SCN)_2] << [Co(SCN)_3] << [Co(SCN)_4].

But wait, in our earlier calculation, [Co(SCN)_4] is the most concentrated, but according to the Ks, which is the case.

So, the most abundant species is [Co(SCN)_4], followed by [Co(SCN)_3], then [Co(SCN)_2], etc.

But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato, which would be [Co(SCN)_2].

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the fraction of each species in terms of the total Co.

Wait, the total Co is the sum of all species. So each species' concentration is (K_n [SCN^-]^n / D) * c(Co).

But perhaps I'm not considering that the total D is much larger than the sum of the species. Let me think.

Wait, no, D is the sum of K_n [SCN^-]^n, which represents the sum of all possible complexed and free Co.

So, [Co_total] = sum [Co species] = sum (K_n [SCN^-]^n / D ) * c(Co) = c(Co).

Which holds true, because sum (K_n [SCN^-]^n / D ) = 1.

So, [Co(SCN)_2] = (3.6/64.468) * 0.01 = (0.05556) * 0.01 = 5.556e-4 M.

The percentage is (5.556e-4 / 0.01) *100 =5.556%.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is the other way around. Maybe the stability constants are given in a different way, such as the overall K for each complex, not stepwise.

Let me try that approach. Suppose β1 is the overall K for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2], etc.

So, K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

Then, each term is K_n * [SCN^-]^n.

So,

Term_0:1 *1=1.

Term_1:9 *0.1=0.9.

Term_2:40 *0.01=0.4.

Term_3:63 *0.001=0.063.

Term_4:16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum D=1 +0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So D=2.3646.

Now, f_2= 0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169, which is 16.9%.

So, [Co(SCN)_2] is 16.9% of the total Co.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that would be the answer.

Ah! So perhaps the initial approach was wrong because I thought βs are stepwise, but perhaps the question treats βs as the overall K for each complex. That makes sense and aligns with the answer options.

So, the correct approach is to treat each β as the overall K for the respective complex, not as stepwise.

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)_2]) is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
- **Stability constants**: β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16.
- **Concentrations**: Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M; [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.
- **Interpretation**: The stability constants (β) are treated as the overall formation constants for the respective complexes, meaning:
  - β₁ = K₁ = 9 (for [Co(SCN)]⁺),
  - β₂ = K₂ = 40 (for [Co(SCN)₂]),
  - β₃ = K₃ = 63 (for [Co(SCN)₃]),
  - β₄ = K₄ = 16 (for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻).

### Approach:
1. **Fraction of Each Species**: The fraction of each cobalt species is given by:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{K_n \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 K_m \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^m}
   \]
   where \( K_0 = 1 \) (uncomplexed Co²⁺).

2. **Compute Terms**:
   - \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \),
   - \( [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1 \),
   - \( [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 0.1 \),
   - \( [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 0.01 \),
   - \( [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 0.001 \),
   - \( [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 0.0001 \).

   Using the given \( K_n \):
   - \( K_0 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \),
   - \( K_1 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \),
   - \( K_2 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \),
   - \( K_3 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \),
   - \( K_4 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \).

3. **Denominator (Total)**:
   \[
   D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

4. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]**:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{K_2 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{D} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]

5. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = f_2 \cdot 100 = 0.169 \cdot 100 = 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]) among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to **Option D**.
