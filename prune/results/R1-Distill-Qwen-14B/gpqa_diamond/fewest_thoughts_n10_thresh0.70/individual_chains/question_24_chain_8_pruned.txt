Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me go through it slowly.

The problem involves two mixtures, X and Y. Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Mixture Y is a result of a disproportionation reaction. 

Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they give only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, and Z is a constituent of Y. Z is widely used as a solvent and doesn't react further with hydrogen. Also, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.

I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the fact that mixture X decolorizes bromine water suggests that it has unsaturated bonds. Typically, alkenes and alkynes can decolorize bromine water because they undergo addition reactions. Since X is two liquids in equimolar amounts, maybe they are something like an alkene and an alkyne? But wait, wait—no, because in mixtures, each is in equimolar. Alternatively, perhaps they are two different alkenes or something else.

But wait, the reaction with platinum and heat leading to Y's formation via disproportionation. Disproportionation implies that a single species is both oxidized and reduced. For example, maybe something like H2O2 decomposing into H2O and O2, but in the context of organic chemistry, perhaps a reaction where a double bond breaks in a particular way.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X contains two dienes, but that's less likely. Or maybe they're both alkenes that upon reaction form different products.

Wait, another angle: when X is treated with platinum (Pt) under heat, it undergoes hydrogenation, but that's not the case here. Wait, no, the reaction is with Pt and heat, but X itself is such that it undergoes a reaction—maybe a di-alkene or something that can undergo some kind of rearrangement or addition?

Wait, another thought. Perhaps X consists of two alkenes that upon reaction with Pt (catalyst) and heat undergo some kind of addition. But wait, the problem says that the result is a mixture Y, which is formed via a disproportionation reaction. So, Y is a mixture of two liquids as well, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So Y must have no double bonds? Or perhaps single bonds but some other functional groups that don't react with bromine water.

Wait, but Y's mixture is formed by a disproportionation of X. So X must have a component that can disproportionate. Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. So maybe each of the two liquids in X undergoes a reaction, perhaps each undergoing a different kind of disproportionation? Or perhaps each component in X is involved in the same reaction.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the product Z. Both X and Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, give Z. So both X and Y, when fully hydrogenated, give the same hydrocarbon Z. So Z must be a fully saturated compound, like an alkane, because it's a hydrocarbon and doesn't react further with hydrogen.

Z is a constituent of Y. So Y must contain Z as one of its components. Because when Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z. So Z is more saturated than any components of Y. So Y is a mixture of two alkanes, perhaps? Because alkanes don't react with hydrogen.

Wait, but wait. Y is a mixture of two liquids, each of which when hydrogenated gives Z. So each component in Y must be a compound that can be hydrogenated to produce Z. For example, if Y had two alkenes, each would hydrogenate to the same Z. But wait,
