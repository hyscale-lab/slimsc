Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about what happens when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. I'm a bit rusty on my pericyclic reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to understand the structure of the starting molecule. The compound is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let me draw that out. Nona means nine carbons. The double bonds are at positions 2 and 6, right? So positions 2-3 and 6-7 have double bonds. And there's a butyl group attached at position 5.

Wait, no. Wait, the name is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. So the main chain is nine carbons, with double bonds starting at 2 and 6. The substituent is butyl at carbon 5.

So the structure is like: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Hmm, no, wait. Let me number the chain.

The longest chain should have nine carbons. Let me arrange it. The double bonds are at 2 and 6, so positions 2-3 and 6-7 are double bonds. The substituent is on carbon 5, which is a butyl group.

So the structure would be:

Carbon 1: CH2-
Carbon 2: CH2= (since double bond starts at 2)
Wait, no, wait. Wait, when the main chain is nona, positions 1 through 9. So the double bonds are between 2-3 and 6-7.

So:

1: CH3-
2: CH2= 
Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. For nona-2,6-diene, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, the double bonds are at 2 and 6. So the structure would be:
