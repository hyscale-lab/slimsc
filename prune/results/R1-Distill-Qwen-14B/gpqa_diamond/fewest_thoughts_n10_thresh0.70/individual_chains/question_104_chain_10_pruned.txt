Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me think. So the question says that two stars with the same mass as our Sun have each a planet with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. The shift is caused by the star moving due to the planet's gravity. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, right? Or maybe it's related to the star's movement speed.

The problem gives the shift for each planet. Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does this shift relate to the orbital period of the planet? Oh, right, the RV method measures the velocity of the star's movement. The formula I remember is that the star's velocity (v) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the period (P), and the distance from the star (a), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Wait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula for that is something like K = ( (G * P ) / (2πc) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (P/(2π))^(-1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3). But since the planet is much less massive than the star, M_p << M_star, so the denominator can be approximated as M_star.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider that the RV signal (the velocity semi-amplitude) depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I think is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) * ( ( (2π) / P ) )^(-1/3) ) * (
