Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet orbits, causing the star to move back and forth. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's motion.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the main variables are the shifts in the spectral lines: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, the orbital period of the planet relates to how fast the star moves, right? Because a planet with a longer period would cause the star to move more slowly, leading to a smaller shift. Or wait, no, I might be mixing things up. Let me think.

The RV method detects the star's velocity towards and away from us. The semi-amplitude of this velocity (K) determines the size of the shift. The formula I remember is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) )) ... Wait, maybe I should think about the simplified version when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's.

Since both stars have the same mass (like Sun) and both planets have similar masses (Neptune is less than Earth's mass, so negligible compared to the star), so M_* >> M_p. So, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, which is the same for both stars.

The formula for the semi-amplitude K is K ≈ ( (M_p * sin i) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) * ( (1) / (P^(1/3)) ) ) ... Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think about the key factors.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*)^(2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(0.5)) )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. So, simplifying, K ∝ (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait wait, maybe another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the period, and the mass of the star. But since both stars have the same mass and both planets have the same mass (since they're both Neptune-like), the only varying factor here is the period.

Wait, but the shifts are different. Planet #1 has a 5 milliangstrom shift, planet #2 has 7. So K is proportional to the shift, right? Because K is the velocity, and the spectral line shift (Doppler shift) is proportional to velocity. So K1 = 5, K2 =7? Or wait, no
