Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I need to arrange six substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer produced. The question is asking for the order from least to most yield of the para product.

Alright, let me start by recalling what I know about electrophilic substitution. The benzene ring reacts with an electrophile, and the substituents on the ring direct where the incoming electrophile will attack. The substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they can be ortho/para directors or meta directors.

So the given substances are:
1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Each of these substituents will influence the position where bromine adds. For each substituent, I need to figure out whether it's activating or deactivating, and whether it's ortho/para or meta directing.

Let me list each substituent and their directing effects:

1) CH3 (toluene): CH3 is an activating group (since it's an alkyl group) and an ortho/para director.
2) COOEt (ethyl ester): The ester group is a deactivating (electron-withdrawing) group. Esters are usually meta directors because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, for esters, like OOCR groups, they are meta directors? Or sometimes they can be ortho/para? Hmm, I think esters are deactivating and meta directing. Because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing by induction, making the ring less reactive, but the lone pairs on the oxygen can donate some electron density through resonance. Wait, no, wait. In an ester group, the oxygen is connected to the carbonyl. So the ester group is a meta director because the EWG effect dominates. So meta.

3) Cl: Chlorine is a deactivating group because it's more electronegative, but it's ortho/para directing. Because chlorine has lone pairs which can donate electrons through resonance, making the ring more reactive in certain positions. So despite being deactivating, it directs ortho and para.

4) NO2: Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta directing group. The nitro group withdraws electrons through both inductive and resonance effects, which makes the ring less reactive. The substituent directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position relative to itself.

5) C2H5 (ethyl group): Similar to toluene, ethyl is an activating group (alkyl) and thus an ortho/para director. So this is like toluene but with a longer chain.

6) COOH (carboxylic acid): The COOH group is a strong deactivating group. It's an electron-withdrawing group. So it's a meta director. Because, like, the carboxylic acid group has a carbonyl which is EW through induction, and the deprotonated form might have resonance effects, but generally, it's a meta director.

Wait, wait, but I should double-check each substituent's directing. Let me think again:

1) CH3: activating, ortho/para. So the ring is more reactive, and the incoming Br will go to ortho and para positions more than meta.

2) COOEt: Deactivating, meta director. So less reactive ring, and Br substitutes meta to COOEt.

3) Cl: Deactivating, but ortho/para director. The substituent is deactivating, but due to the lone pairs on Cl, the ring is activated in the ortho and para positions relative to Cl.

4) NO2: Deactivating, meta director. So the ring is deactivated, and Br will add meta to NO2.

5) C2H5: Activating, ortho/para. So Br adds to ortho and para positions relative to the ethyl group.

6) COOH: Deactivating, meta director. So Br adds meta to COOH.

Wait, but wait, what about the substituents' ability to direct? For example, in nitro groups, since they are meta directors, the para product would be minor. Wait, no. Wait, the major product depends on the substituent's directing, but if a substituent is meta-directing, the electrophile will add in the meta position relative to it. So for each substituent, I have to see whether the para product is a major or minor product.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, when bromine is added in excess, how much para product is formed.

Wait, but first, is the substitution under conditions where mono-substitution is the main product? Because the question says that only one monobromo derivative is formed. But wait, that's given. So each reaction forms a single product, but the position varies. So the substituent determines where the bromine adds.

Wait, but for each substituent, the bromine can add in multiple positions (ortho, meta, para) but since the substituent directs, the position depends on the substituent. So for each substituent, the para position may be major or minor.

Wait, but perhaps the substituent's directing effect determines whether the para product is a major or minor component. For example, for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para product is a major product. For meta directors, the para product would be minor or zero.

Wait, no. Let me think. For a substituent that is an ortho/para director, the incoming group can add in ortho, para, or sometimes meta (but usually ortho and para are more favored). For example, toluene (CH3) is an ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, the major products are para and ortho bromotoluene. So in the mixture, the para isomer would be a significant fraction, but the exact proportion depends on the substituent.

But wait, in the problem statement, it says only one monobromo derivative is formed. So each substituent leads to only one product? That can't be right because some substituents might have multiple possible products. Wait, perhaps the question is assuming that each substituent leads to a single product, which would be the case if there's only one position where substitution occurs. So perhaps the substituent is such that only one product is possible. Or maybe the question is considering that each substituent directs the substitution to a single position, but that might not be accurate.

Wait, but I think I might be overcomplicating. The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, what is the proportion of para product in the substitution.

Wait, for substituents that are meta directors, the para product would be minor or zero. Because the incoming group goes meta to the substituent. So for example, with nitro group (NO2), which is a meta director, the bromine would add in the meta position relative to NO2. So the para product would not be formed. Therefore, the weight fraction of para product is zero.

Wait, but let me think again. The substituent is on the benzene ring. Let me imagine the ring with substituent X. The bromine can add in positions ortho, meta, or para to X. The substituent X directs where the bromine goes. For example:

- If X is a meta director, then the main product is meta to X.

But wait, when a substituent is meta-directing, the incoming electrophile is directed to the meta position relative to X. So in this case, the para product would be a possibility only if the substituent is an ortho or para director.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit mixed up. Maybe it's better to list each substituent and the possible positions of bromine.

Wait, for substituent X at position 1 (let's say), the bromine can add to positions 2 (ortho), 3 (meta), 4 (para), 5 (meta), 6 (ortho), etc. So, the substituent X directs substitution to the ortho, meta, or para positions.

But each substituent has a certain preference. Let me think of each case:

1) CH3 (toluene): ortho/para director. So bromine can add in ortho (positions 2 and 6), para (position 4), and meta (positions 3 and 5). But the major products would be ortho and para because X directs there. So in this case, the para isomer would be a major product. So the weight fraction of para would be significant.

But wait, toluene's substitution is known to give more para product than ortho because of steric hindrance. Oh right, because the ortho positions are closer to the substituent, leading to more steric strain. So in toluene, the para product is major, and the ortho is minor. So the para isomer is the major product.

2) COOEt (ethyl benzoate): meta director. So the bromine adds meta to the ester group. So the main product is the meta isomer. So the para product is not formed, or perhaps is a very minor product. So the weight fraction of para would be negligible.

3) Cl (chlorobenzene): ortho/para director. But Cl is deactivating. So the ring is less reactive, but substitution occurs ortho and para to Cl. So in chlorobenzene, bromine would add mainly in ortho and para positions relative to Cl. But which is more favored? For chlorobenzene, the para product is more favored because steric hindrance is less compared to ortho. So the major product is para-chlorobromobenzene.

Wait, but wait: chlorobenzene's substitution gives more para than ortho, similar to toluene. So in this case, the para product is major, similar to toluene.

4) NO2 (nitrobenzene): meta director. So bromine adds meta to NO2, so para product is not formed. So the para isomer weight fraction is zero.

5) C2H5 (ethylbenzene): similar to toluene, it's an activating group, ortho/para director. So major product is para, with some ortho and minor.

6) COOH (benzoic acid): meta director. So bromine adds meta to COOH. So para product is negligible.

Now, the question is arranging the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of para-isomer. So from the lowest to highest.

So for each substituent, the para fraction is:

1) toluene (CH3): high para (major product)
2) COOEt: low (meta)
3) Cl: high para
4) NO2: zero para
5) ethyl: high para
6) COOH: low (meta)

Wait, but let me clarify each substituent's effect:

- Substituents that are meta directors (2,4,6) would not form para products (except in some cases, but I think meta directors don't produce para products). So their para fractions are zero or very low.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. If the substituent is in position 1, then adding the electrophile in position 4 (para) would be possible only if the substituent is ortho/para director. For meta directors, substitution is in positions 3 and 5 (meta relative to substituent), so para product is not formed.

So substituents that are meta directors (COOEt, NO2, COOH) don't form para products.

Substituents that are ortho/para directors (CH3, Cl, C2H5) form para products as major.

So the para weight fraction is:

Substituent → Para fraction

1) CH3: high (major)
3) Cl: high (major)
5) C2H5: high (major)
2) COOEt: low (para fraction 0)
4) NO2: low (0)
6) COOH: low (0)

Wait, but wait, what about when substituent is in such a way that the para position is not available? I don't think that's the case here because all substituents are on a benzene ring, which is symmetric.

But wait, let's think about the substituent's ability to direct the incoming electrophile. Are any of these substituents such that the para position is not a possible site? No, the benzene ring has six positions, so para is possible.

Wait, but for substituents that are meta directors, the para product is not formed. So for substituents 2,4,6, the para fraction is 0.

Wait, but wait—could there be a case where a meta director leads to some para product? No, because the substituent directs the electrophile to the meta positions. So in such cases, para product isn't formed.

So looking back, the substituents 2,4,6 don't produce para products (para fraction is 0). The substituents 1,3,5 produce para products as major (so higher fractions).

But wait, what about the substituent's activating or deactivating nature? Does that affect the amount of product formed? I think activating groups make the ring more reactive, making substitution more likely, but in this case, since it's a substitution reaction, the type (activating or deactiving) doesn't affect where the substitution occurs, just how fast. But the problem states that only one monobromo is formed, so perhaps the reaction is under conditions where the directing effect is the main factor, and the substituent's activating or deactivating nature isn't influencing the site of substitution but the rate.

Wait, but the problem says "only one monobromo derivative is formed." Hmmm. That might imply that the substituent directs substitution to only one position. But that's not the case for typical substituents except in some special cases, like in the case of certain activating groups that are strongly ortho-directing, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the question is simplifying, assuming that each substituent leads to only one product. So for ortho/para directors, the substitution could be either ortho or para, but perhaps the question is considering only the para product, or that the para is the major product.

Wait, maybe the question is written such that each substituent leads to one major product, and the para fraction is the proportion of that product.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent directs to a single position, so only one product is formed, and the para fraction is 1 for substituents that are para directors, and 0 for others.

But that's not correct because, for example, an ortho/para director would allow substitution in ortho and para positions, leading to two possible products. So perhaps the question is assuming that each substituent directs to a single position, but that's not accurate.

Wait, but the problem statement says "only one monobromo derivative is formed." So that must mean that for each substituent, substitution occurs in a single position. So perhaps each substituent directs the substitution to a specific position, either ortho, meta, or para.

So, for each substituent:

1) CH3 (toluene): ortho/para director. So substitution can be in ortho or para. But the question states only one product is formed. Hmmm. Maybe in some cases, the substituent only allows one position due to steric hindrance or other factors.

Wait, maybe the substituent is such that substitution occurs only in the para position. For example, in toluene, the para product is major, but if it's mono-substituted, perhaps the question is assuming that only para is formed. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that substitution occurs in only one position.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's position leads to only one possible substitution. For example, if substituent is in position 1, and the only possible substitution is position 4 (para) because other positions are hindered.

But that seems unlikely. So perhaps the substituent directs to a single position regardless of other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that each substituent leads to only one product, and that product is either para or not. So for substituents that are ortho/para directors, substitution occurs in para, so the para product is 100% (weight fraction). For meta directors, substitution occurs meta, so para fraction is 0. But that would make sense only if the substituent directs to a single position. But that's not the case in reality. However, given the problem statement, perhaps that's the assumption.

But that can't be correct because, for example, in nitrobenzene, substitution occurs meta, but if only one product is formed, then the para product would be 0.

Wait, but the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So for each substituent, substitution occurs in only one position. So the substituent must be such that only one possible position is possible.

Wait, but how can that be? For example, in toluene, substitution can occur in ortho, meta, or para. Unless the substituent is such that substitution occurs only in a single position, which is possible under certain conditions, like steric hindrance or strong directing.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is written in a way that each substituent leads to only the para product if it is an ortho/para director, and no para product if it's a meta director. So substituents 1,3,5: para product is 100%, substituents 2,4,6: para product is 0.

If that's the case, then the substances with substituents 1,3,5 have the highest para fractions, and 2,4,6 have zero.

But that can't be right because in reality, substituents like Cl (chlorobenzene) lead to both ortho and para products, with para being the major. So for each substituent, the para fraction is:

Substituent → Para fraction

1) CH3: high (about 50-60% maybe, but the exact value isn't given)
3) Cl: high (like 60% or so)
5) C2H5: high
2) COOEt: 0
4) NO2: 0
6) COOH: 0

So when arranging in order of increasing para fraction, the order would be 2,4,6 (0) followed by the others in some order based on their para fractions.

Wait, but the problem is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for substituents 2,4,6, it's zero, and for the others, the para fraction is higher.

Wait, but how do the para fractions compare between substituents 1,3,5?

Which substituent leads to the highest para fraction?

In toluene (1), the para product is major. Similarly, in ethylbenzene (5), the para product is major. Chlorobenzene (3) also has a major para product. But what about their relative fractions?

Wait, I think in chlorobenzene, the para product is more than in toluene. Because Cl is an ortho/para director but deactivating, so the para product is more favored (since ortho has more steric hindrance). For toluene, the para product is about 50% (I'm not exact on the percentages), while for chlorobenzene, it's higher, perhaps around 60-70%. Ethylbenzene would be similar to toluene.

Wait, I'm not exactly sure about the percentages, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps we can arrange substituents 1,3,5 in order of increasing para fraction.

Wait, perhaps the order is that substituent 4 (NO2) and 6 (COOH) have zero, substituent 2 (COOEt) has zero, and substituents 1,3,5 have varying fractions.

But how about the actual order? Let's think:

Assume that substituents 2,4,6 have 0% para.

Substituent 1 (toluene): para fraction is high, but not the highest among the ortho/para directors.

Substituent 3 (Cl): higher para fraction than 1 and 5.

Substituent 5 (ethyl): similar to 1.

So the order would be 2 <4 <6 <1 <5 <3.

Wait, but wait, the substituents with para fractions:

- 2,4,6: 0
- 1: let's say 50%
- 3: 70%
- 5: 50%

So the order from least to most para fraction would be: 2,4,6, then 1 and 5, then 3.

Wait, but the question is asking to arrange the substances in order of INCREASING weight fraction of the para-isomer. So from smallest to largest.

So substituents with 0% (2,4,6), followed by substituents with low (1,5), then substituent 3.

So the order would be: 2,4,6,1,5,3.

Looking at the options:

Options are:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

Hmm, none of the options match 2,4,6,1,5,3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the substituents don't have zero para fractions, but varying ones.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. For each substituent, the para fraction is determined by the substituent's directing effect. Let me think of each substituent:

1) toluene (CH3): ortho/para director. So para is major. So the para fraction is high.

2) ethyl benzoate (COOEt): meta director. So para fraction is low.

3) chlorobenzene (Cl): ortho/para director, so para is major.

4) nitrobenzene (NO2): meta director. Para fraction is low.

5) ethyl benzene (C2H5): ortho/para, para major.

6) benzoic acid (COOH): meta director. Para fraction is low.

So the substituents can be grouped into those with high para fractions (1,3,5) and those with low (2,4,6).

Now, within the high para group (1,3,5), which has the highest and which the lowest?

I think chlorobenzene (3) has the highest para fraction because Cl is a strong deactivating group, but being an ortho/para director, the para position is favored more than in toluene or ethylbenzene. Because in toluene, the activating group leads to para, but perhaps in chlorobenzene, due to deactivation and directing, the para product is even more dominant.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think: in chlorobenzene, the para product is about 60% or so, while in toluene it's around 50%, and ethylbenzene similar.

So among substituents 1,3,5, the order of para fraction from least to most would be 1 <5 <3.

So the overall order of para fractions would be:

Substituent 2: low (possibly lowest), substituent 4: low, substituent6: low, substituent1: medium, substituent5: higher, substituent3: highest.

Wait, but substituents 2,4,6 are all in the same boat with low para fractions.

But perhaps substituent 3 has the highest, followed by substituent5, then substituent1, but that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3 has the highest para fraction, then substituent5 and 1.

Wait, but let me think of their directing abilities.

Which substituent is a stronger ortho/para director? For example, ethyl group (5) and Cl (3): Cl is a stronger ortho/para director but is deactivating.

Wait, I'm not sure. Another approach would be to look at the substituent's activating/deactivating nature and their effect on the para product.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the substituents' effect on the ring activation. A stronger activating group would lead to more substitution, but the question is about the position, not the rate. So perhaps the actual para fraction depends only on the substituent's directing effect, not on the activation.

So, for substituents 1,3,5, their para fractions would be higher than 2,4,6.

So when arranging all six in order of increasing para fraction, the order would be:

2,4,6 (para fraction 0) first, then 1,5,3 (with increasing para fractions).

So the order is 2 <4 <6 <1 <5 <3.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

Hmm, none of these options match 2,4,6,1,5,3. Wait, perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps substituent 6 (COOH) is more deactivating than substituent 4 (NO2). Or maybe substituent 2 is more deactivating than substituent6.

Wait, perhaps the substituents 2,4,6 have varying levels of para fractions.

Wait, maybe I should consider that substituent 3 (Cl) is more activating than substituent 1 (CH3). No, CH3 is activating, Cl is deactivating but a good ortho/para director.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the substituent's effect on the reactivity and where the para product would be.

Wait, another approach: the higher the activating power of the substituent, the more the ring is reactive, but para product is major for ortho/para directors.

Wait, but perhaps the substituent's ability to direct doesn't change the order of the para fraction, but the actual product's yield. Or perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, maybe the weight fraction is determined by the relative amounts of ortho, meta, and para products. For substituents that are meta directors, the para fraction is zero. For ortho/para directors, the para fraction is higher.

So the order from least to most para fraction would be:

All meta directors (2,4,6) come before ortho/para directors (1,3,5).

Within the meta directors, which has the least para fraction? All have zero, so their order doesn't matter in terms of para fractions.

Wait, but perhaps among the meta directors, which substituent's presence leads to the least para product? But since they all don't form the para product, their order would be same.

So the order is:

Substituents 2,4,6 (para fraction 0) are the lowest, followed by substituents 1,5,3 (with higher para fractions).

So the order would be 2,4,6,1,5,3.

But looking at the options:

Option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Which is 4,6,2,1,5,3.

Wait, that's not the same as 2,4,6,1,5,3. So perhaps the order is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Wait, why would that be the case? Maybe because within the meta directors, substituent 4 (NO2) has the least para fraction.

Wait, but NO2, COOEt, and COOH are all meta directors, so their para fractions are zero.

If I have to arrange them in order of increasing para fraction, all three would be tied at 0. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the possibility of para product for meta directors as well, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's nature affects the para product's possibility beyond just directing.

Wait, another angle: steric hindrance. For example, if the substituent is bulky, perhaps the para product is more favored because it's less hindered.

Wait, but substituents like Cl, which are ortho/para directors, are less bulky than, say, an ethyl group.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps I should list each substituent's para fraction from least to most:

Lowest para fraction: substituents 4 (NO2), 2 (COOEt), 6 (COOH), then 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5), highest 3 (Cl).

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me think of each substituent's para fraction:

Substituent 4 (NO2): meta director, para fraction 0.

Substituent 2 (COOEt): meta, para 0.

Substituent 6 (COOH): meta, para 0.

Substituent 1 (CH3): para major.

Substituent 5 (C2H5): para major.

Substituent3 (Cl): para major.

So the order from least to most para fraction is 4 <2 <6 <1 <5 <3.

Looking at the options, option A is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5. So that's not matching.

Option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substituent3's position. Because Cl is an ortho/para director, the para product is major, but perhaps not as major as substituent3.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent3 (Cl) actually has a lower para fraction than substituent5 (C2H5).

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the options again.

The options are:

A) 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 → 4 first, then 2,6,3,1,5.

B)6 <2 <4 <5 <1 <3 → 6,2,4,5,1,3.

C)4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 →4,6,2,1,5,3.

D)3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4 →3,5,1,6,2,4.

Hmm. None of these fit 4 <2 <6 <1 <5 <3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent5 (ethyl) has a lower para fraction than substituent3 (Cl). So substituent3 is higher than 5, which is higher than 1.

So substituents in order of increasing para fraction: 4 < 2 < 6 <1 <5 <3.

Which would match option C if it's 4 <6 <2... No, because option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Wait, but my order is 4 <2 <6 <1 <5 <3.

Looking for an option that starts with 4 <2 <6... None of the options match.

I think I must have made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me try another approach.

Each substituent's para product:

1) CH3: ortho/para, so para is major.

2) COOEt: meta, so para is 0.

3) Cl: ortho/para, para major.

4) NO2: meta, para 0.

5) C2H5: ortho/para, para major.

6) COOH: meta, para 0.

So substituents 2,4,6 have 0 para. Then, substituents 1,3,5 have higher.

Now, the arrangement among 1,3,5: which has the highest para fraction.

Possibly, substituent3 (Cl) has the highest, substituent5 (C2H5) next, substituent1 (CH3) the lowest.

So order would be substituents 2,4,6 (0), then 1,5,3.

So the order is 2 <4 <6 <1 <5 <3.

Looking at the options, option A is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5. So that's not matching.

Option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Hmm, that's 4,6,2,1,5,3.

Which would mean that substituents 2,4,6 are in the order 4 <6 <2, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, perhaps the substituent's directing is not the only factor. Maybe steric factors influence which substituent leads to more para product.

Wait, another thought: substituents that are strongly deactivating may have lower yields of the product, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer, not the overall yield.

Wait, perhaps the question isn't about the position but about the substituent's ability to direct. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the possibility of multiple products, but the problem states that only one monobromo is formed. So perhaps each substituent leads to a single product, which could be para or not.

Wait, perhaps the substituent's position leads to only one possible substitution. For example, substituent 3 (Cl) is in a position that only allows para substitution.

But that's not correct in general.

Another angle: The question might be referring to the possibility of para product being formed. So substituents that are meta directors can't form a para product, so their para fraction is zero. Ortho/para directors can form para products, so their para fraction is non-zero.

So substituents 2,4,6 have zero para, and substituents 1,3,5 have some.

So the order of increasing para is 2,4,6 <1,5,3.

But the options don't have this. So looking at the options, perhaps the correct order is 4<6<2<1<5<3.

Which is option C.

Option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3.

So substituents 4,6,2 (all with 0 para) come first, then 1,5,3 (with higher fractions).

Thus, the correct answer is option C.


To determine the order of substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer in their electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Substituents can either be **ortho/para directors** (activating groups) or **meta directors** (deactivating groups). The para fraction of the product depends on the substituent's directing effect:

1. **C6H5-CH3 (toluene)**: The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para director. Bromine substitution occurs predominantly at the para position, making the para fraction significant but not the highest among ortho/para directors.

2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)**: The ester group is a deactivating, meta director. Bromine substitution occurs at the meta position, resulting in a para fraction of 0.

3. **C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)**: The chlorine atom is a deactivating, ortho/para director. Bromine substitution occurs predominantly at the para position, making the para fraction the highest among ortho/para directors.

4. **C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)**: The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta director. Bromine substitution occurs at the meta position, resulting in a para fraction of 0.

5. **C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)**: The ethyl group is an activating, ortho/para director. Bromine substitution occurs predominantly at the para position, with a para fraction similar to toluene but slightly lower than chlorobenzene.

6. **C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)**: The carboxylic acid group is a deactivating, meta director. Bromine substitution occurs at the meta position, resulting in a para fraction of 0.

### Order of Increasing Para Fraction:
Substituents with meta-directing groups (2, 4, 6) have a para fraction of 0, so they come first. Among the ortho/para directors (1, 3, 5), the para fraction increases in the order: **1 (toluene) < 5 (ethylbenzene) < 3 (chlorobenzene)**. Thus, the overall order is:

**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
