Okay, so I have this question about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. Wait, F is like ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ, right? So this must be a term involving the interaction between fermions and the electromagnetic field, maybe like a vertex in QED.

But wait, the term looks a bit different. In QED, the interaction term is usually something like ψ̄ γ^μ ψ A_mu. But here we have σ_{μν} and F^{μν} instead. Oh, right, this looks more like the term in a theory where the fermions are interacting with a field in a different way. Maybe it's a higher-dimensional operator.

So, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To find the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian, I should recall that the Lagrangian itself has mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because it's integrated over d^4x, so the integrand (the Lagrangian density) must have dimension 4.

The Lagrangian L_int is part of the full Lagrangian, but for finding the dimension of each term, each term must have dimension 4. So, each term in L_int must have dimension 4.

Looking at the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, I need to find the dimensions of each part.

First, what's the dimension of ψ? Fermion fields ψ have mass dimension 3/2 because in four dimensions, the Dirac equation is first order in derivatives, so the kinetic term is ψ̄ i γ^μ D_mu ψ, where D is covariant derivative. So ψ has [ψ] = 3/2.

Next, σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices. Each gamma has dimension 1 in mass terms. Wait, but σ is (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu], so it's a tensor of two gamma matrices, so σ has dimension 2 (since each gamma is dimension 1). So each σ_{mu nu} contributes dimension 2.

Then, F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is
