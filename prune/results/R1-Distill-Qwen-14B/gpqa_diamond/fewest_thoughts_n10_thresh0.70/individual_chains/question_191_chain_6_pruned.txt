Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the final product looks like after a series of reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize it. So the molecule is a cyclohexanone ring (a six-membered ring with a ketone group at position 1). At position 3 is a hydroxymethyl group, which is a CH2OH attached to the ring. At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like isopropenyl, right? So it's CH2-C(CH2)-something. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, so prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH2)- what? No, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2-C(CH2)= something? Or maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at position 1. Let me think. The structure of prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C-CH2, but wait, the substituent is at position 2. So it's CH2-C(CH2... No, wait. The structure of prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH3)-. No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2=CH-CH2- with the substituent on the second carbon. So the group is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the IUPAC name for the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl. So the parent chain is propene. The substituent is attached at position 2. So the structure is CH2=C(CH2R)-, but wait, no. Let me think: propene is CH2=CHCH3. The substituent would be attached at the second carbon. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH(R)-CH2,
