Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and based on those, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, I remember that molecular symmetry groups are about the different ways a molecule can be symmetrical. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, so I should probably think this through carefully.

First, let me parse the reactions given.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I need to figure out what each of these substances could be. Let's start with reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). Solvents are usually polar molecules, maybe something like water, ethanol, or something else. But wait, B is a gas. So B is a gas, D is another gas that reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. Hmm. Let me think about gases that could react to form solvents.

One possibility is that B is H2O, but wait, water is a liquid at room temperature. Or maybe B is CO2? But CO2 as a gas reacting with another gas to form a solvent... Alternatively, B could be H2O and D is something else, but that doesn't make sense because H2O is a liquid. Wait, maybe B is NH3? No, NH3 is a gas but it's a base, but when it reacts with something to form a solvent... Alternatively, maybe B is H2O in gaseous form, but that's not common. Alternatively, perhaps B is H2S and D is Cl2? No, that doesn't form a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe D is SO3 and B is H2O. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form H2SO4, which is a strong acid, but that's not a solvent. Or perhaps D is O2 and B is another gas. Wait, maybe D is HCl gas and B is NH3. HCl and NH3 would react to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is something else. Wait, another thought: Maybe B is O2, and D is H2. No, O2 + H2 would form H2O, which is a solvent. But that's a 1:1 ratio. So D is H2 gas, B is O2 gas. They form H2O, which is a solvent. That makes sense.

So, reaction 4: O2 + H2 → H2O. Yes, that reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, but the stoichiometry here is 1:1 for D:B. So perhaps the reaction is simplified as H2 + O2 → H2O (ignoring stoichiometric coefficients for the reaction direction). So D is H2, B is O2, and H is H2O. That makes sense.

Wait, but wait, O2 is a diatomic gas, H2 is diatomic as well. So reaction 4 yields H2O, which is a solvent.

Now, moving on to reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 equivalents of B (O2) → C (bright red product). So A is a solid reacting with O2. Let's think about what solid reacts with O2 in large amounts. Maybe something like sodium reacting with O2 to form sodium oxide, but sodium oxide is NaO2? Wait, but sodium oxide is NaO2? Or perhaps it's a metal oxide. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur, which when burned in O2 forms SO3. Hmm, but let me think. Wait, sulfur (solid) + O2 (gas) → SO2 (which is a gas, not red). Alternatively, maybe A is iron? Iron reacts with O2 to form FeO or Fe3O4. Not sure about the color.

Wait, the product C is bright red. What substances are bright red? Maybe something like Fe2O3·nH2O, which is reddish, like rust. Or perhaps it's a transition metal oxide. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that's bright red. Another possibility is that C is MnO2, which is a dark purple-black, so no. Or maybe it's a different oxide.

Wait, another approach: in reaction 3, C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is treated with water, it produces two acids. So C must be an anhydride of some sort, perhaps a metal oxide that reacts with water to form an acid.

Wait, but F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So if C is a metal oxide, perhaps it's a mixed oxide or reacts with water to produce two different acids. Hmm. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe C is a salt that when hydrolyzed produces acids. But that seems less likely.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is sodium, B is O2. Sodium reacts with O2 to form NaO2? Or perhaps C is Na2O2, which is a bright yellow solid. Wait, but the question says C is bright red. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: if C reacts with water to produce A (a metal), and two acids F and G. So, perhaps it's a metal oxide reacting with water to form a base and two acids? That doesn't make sense because metal oxides are typically basic. Wait, but if the oxide is amphoteric, then it can react with water to form both a base and an acid. Wait, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a metal carbonate, but no, because then it would react with water to form a metal hydroxide and carbonic acid, which is a weak acid. But F is a strong acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitride. For example, Mg3N2 reacts with water to form Mg(OH)2 and NH4OH (which is weak). But again, F is strong acid, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: Let's think about the reaction of a metal with O2 to form an oxide. Let's say A is sulfur. Wait, no, because sulfur is a solid, and when it burns in O
