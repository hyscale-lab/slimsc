Okay, so I need to solve this astronomy question. Let me read it carefully. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D with different powers of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle subtended by the distance to an object when observed from two points. The formula I recall is plx = 1 / distance, but wait, I think that's in parsecs. So distance (d) is 1 / plx. So d = 1/plx. That's right because the closer the star, the larger the parallax.

The question states that the number of stars (N) varies with 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. But since d = 1/plx, substituting that in, N would be proportional to d^5. Because 1/plx is d, so (1/plx)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So it's about the change in N as r increases, not N itself. So maybe I should think about the differential of N with respect to r.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr. Because when you look at a region of the sky, the number of stars at a certain distance is determined by the volume, and the volume depends on the distance.

Wait, another approach. The number of stars observed is a function of the volume of space you're looking at. The volume of a spherical shell between r and r+dr is approximately 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to r² dr, assuming a uniform density of stars.

But in this case, the number of stars isn't just proportional to the volume. The question specifically states that N varies as 1/plx^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance, substituting plx with d gives N proportional to d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, that might not
