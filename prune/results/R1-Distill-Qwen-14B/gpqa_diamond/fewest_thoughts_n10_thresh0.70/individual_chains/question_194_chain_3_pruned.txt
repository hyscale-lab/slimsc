Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Each state is a combination of the spins S1, S2, S3. Since each spin can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states.

Wait, but maybe the states can be grouped by their energies, right? Because many states have the same energy E. That would make calculating Z easier because I can find the number of states for each energy level and then sum each contribution.

So, let's think about all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3. Each is either +1 or -1. Let me list all possible states and calculate their energies.

But that might take a while; maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about the product terms in E. The energy is -J times the sum of the products of each pair.

Let me denote S1, S2, S3 as each being ±1. The product terms S1S2, S1S3, and S2S3 can each be either +1 or -1, depending on whether the spins are aligned or opposite.

Wait, but for three spins, how many of each product term can be +1 or -1? Let's think of the total sum of these products. Let me denote the sum as S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

So, the energy is E = -J * S. Therefore, each state's energy depends on the value of S. So, I need to find all possible values of S and how many states correspond to each S.

What are the possible values of S? Let's see.

Each term in S is either +1 or -1. So, S can be the sum of three ±1 terms.

The maximum possible sum is 3 (all +1), the minimum is -3 (all -1). But wait, wait. Let me compute S for different spin configurations.

Wait, for example:

If all three spins are +1: S1S2 = +1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. So S = 3 → E = -3J.

If two are +1 and one is -1, like S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1 → E = J.

Wait: wait, let me compute this again. S is the sum: +1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J * (-1) = J.

Alternatively, if two spins are -1 and one is +1, like S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

Then S1S2= (-1)(-1)=+1, S1S3= (-1)(+1) = -1, S2S3= (-1)(+1)=-1. Sum: 1-1-1 = -1 → E= J.

Wait, but sometimes S can be 1. Let me think of another case.

What if all three terms are -1? That would be when all three product terms are -1. When is that possible?

Hmm, let's see. For S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1.

So S1S2 = -1 → S1 and S2 have opposite spins.

S1S3 = -1 → S1 and S3 have opposite spins.

S2S3 = -1 → S2 and S3 have opposite spins.

So, S1 and S2 opposite, S1 and S3 opposite, so S2 should be same as S3? Wait, no. Let's see:

If S1 is +1, then S2 is -1, S3 is -1. Then S2S3 would be (+1), because (-1)(-1)=+1. But wait, that's a problem because S2S3 should be -
