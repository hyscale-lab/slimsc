Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Hmm, I remember pions are subatomic particles, right? The reaction given is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, nu is a neutrino, I think. 

The problem states that the pion is stationary, which probably means its initial momentum is zero. So when it decays, the products (muon and neutrino) must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. That makes sense because if the initial momentum is zero, the total after decay should also be zero. 

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c², and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c². Oh wait, the neutrino has a negligible mass, almost zero. I think in these cases, we can consider its mass as zero, which simplifies things. 

Wait, but the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy would be approximately equal to its kinetic energy, right? Because E = mc², but if m is zero, E is just from momentum. So for a neutrino, E = pc. 

But how do I approach this? I think I should use conservation of energy and momentum here. 

First, the initial energy is just the rest energy of the pion because it's stationary. So that's E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV. 

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. So E_final = E_mu + E_nu. 

But E_mu is its rest energy plus kinetic energy: E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. Similarly for the neutrino, E_nu = p_nu c + K_nu, but wait, since neutrino's mass is zero, its rest energy is zero. So E_nu is all kinetic. So E_nu = K_nu + 0 = K_nu. 

Wait, but wait, the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because its rest mass is zero. So E_nu = K_nu + m_nu c^2 → but m_nu is near zero, so E_nu ≈ K_nu.

Wait no, the energy of a particle with zero mass is E = pc, so E_nu = p_nu c = gamma m_nu c², but since m_nu is zero, E_nu = p_nu c. But since it's moving, its energy is due to momentum. So E_nu = sqrt( (p_nu c)^2 + (m_nu c^2)^2 ) = p_nu c. So yeah, E_nu is just pc.

But how does this help me? I think I need to set up the equations.

So, energy conservation: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

Momentum conservation: Since initial momentum is zero, the momenta of mu and nu must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since momentum is a vector, their magnitudes are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Let me denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum, so the neutrino's momentum is also p, but in the opposite direction.

So, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ), and E_nu = p c.

So, energy conservation gives:

139.6 MeV = [sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2 ) ] + p c.

Hmm, that's the equation I need to solve for p. Once I find p, I can find E_mu and E_nu, then subtract their rest energies to get their kinetic energies.

Let me denote x = p c. Then the equation becomes:

139.6 = sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x.

So, I can rearrange this equation to solve for x.

Let me subtract x from both sides:

139.6 - x = sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 )

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(139.6 - x)^2 = x² + (105.7)^2.

Expanding the left side:

139.6² - 2*139.6*x + x² = x² + 105.7².

Subtract x² from both sides:

139.6² -2*139.6 x = 105.7^2.

Calculate 139.6 squared and 105.7 squared.

139.6^2: Let's see, 140^2 is 19600. 139.6 is 140 minus 0.4
