Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? Which usually happens if the molecule has a chiral center, or maybe some other form of asymmetry like a planar chirality. But I think most of the cases here are about chiral centers.

Let me look at each compound one by one. The question lists seven compounds, so I need to check each.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structureâ€”so but-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No wait, wait. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure: Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, 1-chloro: Cl is on C1, which is double bonded to C2. So the structure is Cl-C double bond CH-CH2CH3? Or wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, butene is four carbons. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2-
