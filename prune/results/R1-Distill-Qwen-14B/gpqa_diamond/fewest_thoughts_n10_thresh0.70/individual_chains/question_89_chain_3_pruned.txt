Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage-like molecule. 1,3-dibromo would mean there are bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are provided. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, maybe an epoxide or a ketone? Wait, but wait, for epoxides, the carbonyl stretch is around 1250-1300 cm⁻¹, I think. So 1720 is more likely a ketone or maybe an ester. But considering the starting material is dibromoadamantane, heating with KOH probably leads to an elimination reaction, maybe forming an epoxide or a diene.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, KOH in such conditions might cause dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. Because when two adjacent bromides are present, elimination could form a double bond. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane—since adamantane is a bridged structure, maybe the bromines are at positions that when eliminated, form a bridgehead double bond. But wait, bridgehead alkenes are not common due to Bredt's rule, which says that bridgehead double bonds are not stable in small bridged systems. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. KOH might lead to substitution. But with two bromine atoms, perhaps it's a di-elimination, leading to a carbonyl group.

Wait, the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. So maybe a ketone or an ester.

Wait, when two adjacent bromines
