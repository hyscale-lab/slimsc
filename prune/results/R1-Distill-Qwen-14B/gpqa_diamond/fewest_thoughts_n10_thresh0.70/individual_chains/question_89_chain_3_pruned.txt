Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try my best.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to make product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by dimethylsulfide to form product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

Let me break this down into smaller steps.

First, what's happening in the first reaction? 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that KOH can act as a base or a nucleophile. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid. The molecule here has bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions.

When dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, it's probably undergoing an elimination reaction. Since there are two bromine atoms, maybe it's a double elimination. Alternatively, it might be a dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond.

Wait, when two vicinal halides (like 1,2-dibromo) undergo elimination, they form alkenes. But here it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure? Or are they across?

Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure. Let me visualize it. Adamantane has a structure similar to a diamond, with each carbon connected to four others. The 1 and 3 positions are probably on adjacent vertices. So, perhaps elimination would form a double bond between those carbons.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide. When treated with a strong base like KOH, I think it would undergo dehydrohalogenation twice, losing two HBr molecules and forming an alkene. So, product 1 is likely 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar.

Wait, but adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so forming a double bond would make it a
