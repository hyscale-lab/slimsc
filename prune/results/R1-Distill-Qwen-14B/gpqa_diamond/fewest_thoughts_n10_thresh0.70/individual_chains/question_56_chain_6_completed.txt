Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and electron transitions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. The options are about the possible transition routes and their probabilities.

First, I remember that electrons in hydrogen can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons. The transition is governed by the selection rules, right? Oh wait, the selection rules for dipole transitions (which are electric dipole transitions) are important here.

So, the selection rules for hydrogen are usually Δl = ±1 for a dipole transition. That is, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can change by +1 or -1. And Δn can be ±1, but not necessarily limited to that, wait no, wait. No, wait, actually, for hydrogen, the principal quantum number n can change by any integer as long as l changes by ±1. But wait, no, the standard selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δn = any integer (so n can change by more than 1 as long as l changes by ±1). Or wait, no, wait no—wait, no, I think I might be getting that confused. Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me think.

Wait, the standard selection rules are:
- Δl = ±1 (so l can change by +1 or -1)
- Δn can be any integer, but in practice, it's often 1 for emission or absorption in typical cases, but I think for dipole transitions, n just needs to change such that l changes by ±1.

Wait, no, wait a second. Oh wait, no, the selection rules I think are that for dipole transitions, the change in l is ±1, and the change in n can be any integer, but with the dipole selection rule, but sometimes people say Δn = ±1, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, wait, no, I think that's for the electric dipole transitions in hydrogen. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the selection rules for hydrogen in electric dipole transitions are:
Δl = ±1,
Δn ≠ 0 (so n can change by any integer, but maybe in practice, the transition probabilities are higher when Δn is ±1 because higher changes would involve higher energy differences and maybe lower probabilities? Hmm, not sure.)

Wait, but in the given problem, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So we have to go from 3,0,0 to 1,0,0 in two steps via dipole transitions.

So each step must involve a Δl of ±1, because each transition is a dipole transition.

Wait, but let's think about the possible steps.

First transition: from (3,0,0) to some intermediate state (n', l', m').

Since Δl must be ±1, so l' can be 1 (since 0 ±1 is 1 or -1, but l can't be negative, so l' can only be 1. So first transition must go to l=1.

So the first state after transition will have l=1, so the intermediate state must be |n', 1, m'>.

And for the second transition, from this intermediate state to (1,0,0), l must go from 1 to 0, so Δl = -1. That's allowed.

Now, the n values must change in each step such that we go from 3 to 1 in two steps. So possible n changes:

3 → 2 →1, or 3 →4 →1? Wait, no, because 3 can't go to 4 and then 4 to 1 in two steps because that would require Δn = -3 in the second step, which is allowed according to the selection rules (as per whether n can change by more than 1), but in practice, the probabilities may be higher when Δn is ±1 because it relates to the energy difference matching the photon's energy, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, but in the given options, the intermediate states are |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, |2,1,-1>, and another option which might be a typo.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0. Probability 1/3.

Option B: 3,0,0 →2,1,1 →1,0,0. Prob 1/4.

Option C: 3,0,0 →2,1,-1 →1,0,0. Prob 1/4.

Option D: [I think the first part of D is cut off. It says |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3.]

Wait, so all options involve a transition from 3,0,0 to 2,1, something, and then to 1,0,0.

So the first step is n=3 to n=2, l=0 to l=1. And the second step is n=2 to n=1, l=1 to l=0.

That's allowed because each step has Δl = +1 and Δl = -1, respectively.

Now, the question is about the probability of each route.

But wait, the problem says it's a two-step dipole transition. Each transition is a dipole transition, so each step must obey the selection rules.

Next, I think about the possible m values. The selection rule for m is Δm = 0, ±1. So in each transition, the change in m can be 0, +1, or -1.

So first transition: from m=0 to m' which can be -1, 0, +1.

Second transition: from m' to m=0. So m' can be 0, ±1, but the second step must have Δm = 0, ±1.

So possible m changes:

In first transition, m changes from 0 to m1 (m1 can be -1, 0, +1).

In the second transition, m1 changes to 0. So m1 must be 0, ±1 such that Δm is 0, ±1.

So if first step m goes to +1, the second step must go from +1 to 0, which is Δm = -1, allowed.

Similarly, if first step m goes to -1, second step goes from -1 to 0 (Δm=+1), allowed.

If first step m remains 0, second step m remains 0 (Δm=0), allowed.

So all three possibilities for m in first step are possible.

But wait, the initial state is |3,0,0>, and the first transition goes to a state with l=1. So the possible states are |n',1,m'> where m' can be -1, 0, +1.

So the possible intermediates are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>.

Each of these would have a certain probability of being transitioned to.

Now, the question is about the overall probability of going from 3,0,0 to 1,0,0 via two dipole transitions.

Each transition's probability depends on the transition dipole moment, which is given by the matrix element <n' l' m' | e r | n l m>, where e is the charge and r is the position operator.

The square of this matrix element determines the transition probability.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to think about the possible transitions and their probabilities.

In the first transition, from 3,0,0 to 2,1,m1. The possible m1 are -1, 0, +1.

Each of these has a certain probability.

Then, the second transition from 2,1,m1 to 1,0,0. Again, each m1 has a certain probability for this step.

The total probability is the sum over all possible m1 of the product of the probabilities for each step.

But wait, perhaps each m1 is equally probable for the first transition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the selection rules for m are such that each Δm is equally likely.

Wait, I think that the transition probabilities for m are proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or something like that. Hmm, maybe it's more straightforward.

Wait, another approach is to think about the possible transitions. Let me think about the possible m transitions.

In each dipole transition, the change in m is 0, ±1.

So for the first transition from m=0 to m1, m1 can be -1, 0, or +1.

Similarly, the second transition from m1 to m=0 requires that m1 must be 0, ±1.

So the possible paths are:

1. m=0 → m1=+1 → m=0.

But wait, for m1=+1, the second transition must have Δm = -1, which is allowed.

2. m=0 → m1=0 → m=0. Δm=0 in both steps.

3. m=0 → m1=-1 → m=0. Δm=+1 in the second step.

So each of these three possibilities is possible.

Now, the probability for each path would be the product of the probabilities of each step.

But how do we find the probability for each step?

Alternatively, perhaps each allowed transition has a certain multiplicity. For example, for the first transition, the possible m1's are three possibilities, each with a certain probability, and the same for the second transition.

Wait, another approach is to think about the possible matrix elements. The transition probability for each step is proportional to the square of the matrix element.

The matrix element for a dipole transition is proportional to <n', l', m' | r |n, l, m>.

In the case where l=0 (as in the initial state), so l=0, and the initial m=0.

So the initial state is |3,0,0>.

The position operator r can be expressed in spherical coordinates. The spherical harmonics for l=1 are Y_1^m, which are proportional to (r) multiplied by sinθ and cosθ terms.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of angular momentum addition. The transition involves the matrix element <2,1,m1 | e r |3,0,0>.

But the initial state is l=0, m=0. So r has components proportional to sqrt(4π/3) Y_1^0, Y_1^+1, and Y_1^-1? Or wait, the position vector can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics.

Wait, maybe I should recall that r is proportional to sqrt(4π/3) Y_1^0, because Y_1^0 is proportional to cosθ.

Wait, no. Wait, the position vector components are proportional to Y_1^m multiplied by r.

So r = r [ Y_1^1 (x) + Y_1^-1 (x) ) / 2i ) + Y_1^0 (z) ) ] ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach: the Cartesian components of r can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics. For example, x = r sinθ cosφ, which is proportional to (Y_1^1 + Y_1^-1)/2i. Similarly, y is proportional to (Y_1^1 - Y_1^-1)/2, and z is proportional to Y_1^0.

So when you're calculating the matrix element <2,1,m1 | e r |3,0,0>, you're essentially doing <2,1,m1 | e r |3,0,0>.

Since |3,0,0> is S-state (l=0, m=0), the only non-zero matrix elements would be when the angular part of r has components that can connect l=0 to l=1.

Hmm, perhaps for l=0 to l=1 transition, the only possible m's are m1 = m + 0 ±1. But m was 0, so m1 can be ±1, 0. Wait, no, because when you have the matrix element involving r, which has contributions from l=1, the transition can change m by 0, ±1.

So, for the first transition, from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m1>, the possible m1 are -1, 0, +1.

Each of these m1 states is a possible intermediate.

The probability for each transition is proportional to the square of the matrix element <2,1,m1 | r |3,0,0>.

But r is proportional to Y_1^0 (for z-component) and Y_1^±1 (for x and y components).

Wait, perhaps the matrix element is non-zero only for certain m1 values. Let me think: the initial state is m=0, and the matrix element for r involves spherical harmonics with m=0, ±1.

So the possible m1 are 0, +1, -1.

Wait, but since the initial state is m=0, and the operator r can cause transitions where m changes by 0, +1, or -1, the possible m1's are 0, +1, -1.

Now, the matrix element <2,1,m1 | r |3,0,0> is non-zero only for certain m1.

Wait, but when you have |3,0,0>, which is an s-state (l=0), the matrix element of r (which carries l=1) will connect to states where l'=1. So the m1 can be 0, +1, or -1.

The transition amplitude for each m1 would involve the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element can be written as:

<2,1,m1 | r |3,0,0> = something involving Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities are the same for m1=+1, m1=0, and m1=-1, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another approach: the number of possible ways to go from m=0 to m1.

The operator r has terms proportional to Y1^0, Y1^+1, and Y1^-1. So when you multiply Y0^0 (the initial state) by Y1^m (from r), you get Y1^m, since Y0^0 * Y1^m = Y1^m.

So the matrix element <2,1,m1 | r |3,0,0> is non-zero only for m1=0, +1, -1.

The amplitude for each m1 is proportional to the integral of Y2,1,m1^* Y1,m multiplied by Y3,0,0.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l'=1 is non-zero only for m1 = m + m_r, where m_r is the m of r.

But since |3,0,0> has m=0, and r has m_r = 0, +1, -1.

So for each m_r in r, the m1 = 0 + m_r.

So for m_r=0, m1=0.

For m_r=+1, m1=+1.

For m_r=-1, m1=-1.

So the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient would determine the amplitude for each m1.

The CG coefficients for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l'=1 are as follows:

For m1 = 0: CG(0,0;1,0) = 1.

For m1 = +1: CG(0,0;1,+1) = 0, because you can't have m=0 and m=0 adding to m=+1. Wait, no, because m1 is the sum of m from l=0 (which is 0) and m from r (which can be 0, +1, -1). So for m_r=+1, m1=+1.

But the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l1=0, m1=0 and l2=1, m2=+1 to get l=1, m=+1 is sqrt(2/3) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should look it up mentally.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining l=0 (s-state) with l=1 (p-state) to get l'=1.

So the possible combinations are:

For m=0:

- l=0, m=0, and l=1, m=0 → m'=0: the CG coefficient is 1, because (0,0) + (1,0) = (1,0).

- l=0, m=0, and l=1, m=+1 → m'=+1: but wait, can you combine l=0 and l=1 to get m=+1? Because l=0 can't provide m=+1. So the CG coefficient for adding (0,0) and (1, +1) to get (1, +1) is zero? No, wait, that can't be right. Because the initial state is (3,0,0) and after applying r (which has components with m=+1, 0, -1), you can have m1=+1, 0, -1.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think about the expansion.

The state |3,0,0> is an s-state.

When you apply the position operator r, which has angular part proportional to Y1^m (m=-1, 0, +1), you get a superposition of states with l=1 and m= -1, 0, +1.

So the matrix element <2,1,m1 | r |3,0,0> is non-zero only for m1 = -1, 0, +1.

The probability for each m1 is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l1=0, m1=0 with l2=1, m2=m to get l=1, m'=m.

Wait, more precisely, when combining |l1 m1> and |l2 m2>, the CG coefficient is non-zero only when m1 + m2 = m'.

In our case, l1=0, m1=0. So m' (the m of the resulting state) must be equal to m2.

So for the resulting state |2,1,m1>, m1 = m2, which is the m of the r operator. So for each m1 in |2,1,m1>, it can take m values of -1, 0, +1.

The CG coefficients for combining l1=0 and l2=1 to get l=1:

The coefficients are:

- For m1=0: the CG is 1, because l1=0 can't contribute anything but m=0.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to remember that the CG for combining l1=0 (S-state) and l2=1 (P-state) to get l'=1 is given by:

< l1=0, m1=0 | l2=1, m2 | l'=1, m' = m2 >.

So for each m2, we have a CG coefficient.

But perhaps the coefficients are as follows:

For m'=0: the state is a combination of Y1^0. The CG coefficient is 1.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about specific cases.

The matrix element <2,1,m1 | r |3,0,0> is non-zero only when m1 matches the m of the spherical harmonic component in r.

So for r's z-component (Y1^0), the matrix element for m1=0 is non-zero.

For the x and y components of r (which involve Y1^+1 and Y1^-1), the matrix elements for m1=+1 and m1=-1 are non-zero.

The probabilities for each of these m1 states are then determined by the square of the CG coefficients.

Wait, I think the CG coefficients for combining l1=0 and l2=1 to get l'=1 are:

- For m'=+1: the state is |1,1> = |1,1> (since l1=0 can't contribute to m).

So the CG coefficient is 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, wait. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling l=0 and l=1 to get l=1.

When you combine l=0 (m=0) and l=1 (m=+1), the combined state is l=1, m=+1.

The CG coefficient for this is 1 because (0,0) + (1, +1) → (1, +1).

Similarly, for m=0: combining (0,0) and (1,0) gives (1,0), CG=1.

For m=-1: (0,0) and (1,-1) → (1,-1), CG=1.

Wait, but that can't be right because when you have two angular momenta, the CG coefficients are not all 1. I think I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, no, when combining l1=0 and l2=1, the total l can be 1 or 0. But l=0 would require m=0, but since l2=1 can have m=0, perhaps.

But perhaps I should think in terms of the possible states.

The initial state is |3,0,0>. When you apply the position operator r (which has components with l=1, m=-1,0,+1), the resulting state is a sum over m1 of |2,1,m1> multiplied by some coefficients.

The probability for each m1 would depend on the square of the CG coefficients.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider that for each possible m1 (i.e., +1, 0, -1), the probability is the same. So the transition to each of these m1 states has the same probability. Then, when you go from each m1 state to the final state |1,0,0>, which has m=0, the probability for each path would be the product of the two probabilities.

Wait, but in reality, the probabilities might not be the same for each m1. For example, the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,0> might have a different probability than to |2,1,1> or |2,1,-1>.

But perhaps in this case, the probabilities are the same. So each of the three possible m1's has a probability of 1/3 for the first transition.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think about the matrix elements again.

In the first transition, the matrix element for m1=0 would involve the z-component of r, which is proportional to Y1^0. The matrix element for m1=+1 would involve the x-component of r (since x is proportional to Y1^+1), and m1=-1 would involve the y-component (proportional to Y1^-1).

The square of the matrix element would then be proportional to |<2,1,m1 | Y1^m |3,0,0>|^2.

Wait, but |3,0,0> is s-state, so when you apply Y1^m to it, you get Y1^m.

So the overlap integral (matrix element) between |2,1,m1> and Y1^m is non-zero only when m1=m.

So for m1=0, the matrix element is proportional to <2,1,0 | Y1^0>.

Similarly, for m1=+1, it's proportional to <2,1,1 | Y1^+1>, and for m1=-1, <2,1,-1 | Y1^-1>.

Now, the radial parts (n changing from 3 to 2) would contribute a factor, but since all the options have the same n change (3→2→1), perhaps the radial parts are the same for all m1 and can be factored out, leaving the angular part to determine the probability.

So the angular part's square of the matrix element would determine the probability for each m1.

The angular part is proportional to |<2,1,m1 | Y1^m>|^2.

But Y1^m is a function with certain properties.

Now, when m1 is 0, the matrix element is non-zero because Y1^0 is present.

Similarly for m1=+1 and m1=-1.

But what is the value of |<2,1,m1 | Y1^m>|^2 for each m1?

Wait, Y1^m can be written in terms of spherical harmonics, and the integral <2,1,m1 | Y1^m> is non-zero only when certain conditions are met.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the integral is non-zero when m1 = m, because the product of Y1^m and Y2,1,m1^* would have terms that can combine to give a non-zero integral only for specific m1 and m.

Wait, no, because when you multiply Y1^m and Y2,1,m1^*, the product can have terms that can be expressed in terms of associated Legendre polynomials, but the integral is non-zero only when m1 = m + m', where m' is from Y1^m.

Wait, perhaps the integral is non-zero only when m1 = m.

Wait, no, because Y1^m has m = +1, 0, -1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the addition of angular momenta. The matrix element <2,1,m1 | Y1^m> is non-zero when m1 = m + m_Y, where m_Y is the m of Y1^m.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here, but let me proceed.

Assuming that for each m1, the matrix element is non-zero, and the square is the same for each m1, then each of the three possible intermediates (m1=+1, 0, -1) would have equal probabilities.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: perhaps the selection rules for dipole transitions don't allow certain changes in m, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities for m1=+1 and m1=-1 are equal and twice that of m1=0, because of the two possible polarizations (x and y) contributing to m=+1 and m=-1, but m=0 comes only from z.

Wait, that would make sense. Since the position operator's x and y components contribute to m=+1 and m=-1, respectively. So perhaps the transition probabilities for m1=+1 and m1=-1 are each twice as likely as m1=0.

Wait, because the radial parts for x and y are the same, but perhaps the angular parts have different contributions.

Wait, but in the matrix element, the x component is proportional to (Y1^+1 + Y1^-1)/2i, and the y component is proportional to (Y1^+1 - Y1^-1)/(2). The z component is Y1^0.

So when you calculate the matrix element for each component, perhaps the x and y components contribute to m1=+1 and m1=-1, but each with a factor that affects the probability.

But wait, for each component, the matrix element would involve a specific m1.

Hmm, perhaps the probability for m1=0 is the same as for m1=+1 and m1=-1.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about this. Let's think about the possible matrix elements.

The matrix element for m1=0 would involve Y1^0, which is proportional to cosθ.

The matrix element for m1=+1 would involve Y1^+1, which is proportional to sinθ e^{iφ}.

Similarly, m1=-1 involves Y1^-1, proportional to sinθ e^{-iφ}.

When you compute the integral for <2,1,0 | Y1^0>, it would involve integrating Y210 * Y10.

Similarly for m1=+1 and m1=-1.

But I can't remember the exact values of these integrals.

Alternatively, perhaps the selection rules for the dipole transitions allow for all m1 values, but the probabilities are different.

Wait, but perhaps the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m1> is allowed for m1 = -1, 0, +1, and the probability for each m1 is the same, leading to each having a 1/3 chance.

If that's the case, then each of the three possible m1's would have a 1/3 probability.

Then, for the second transition from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0>, each m1 can transition to m=0 only if Δm = m1-0 is allowed, which it is for any m1 (since Δm can be 0, ±1).

So for each m1, the transition to the final state would have a certain probability.

But what is the probability of transitioning from |2,1,m1> to |1,0,0>?

Again, the matrix element <1,0,0 | r |2,1,m1> must be considered.

But |1,0,0> is an s-state (l=0, m=0), so r must cause a transition from l=1 to l=0, so Δl= -1.

The matrix element would be non-zero for m1=0, because r can cause a transition from l=1, m=0 to l=0, m=0.

Wait, but for m1=+1 and m1=-1, would the transition be allowed?

Because the matrix element involves Y1^m multiplied by Y2,1,m1.

Wait, to get from l=1, m=+1 to l=0, you'd need to multiply by Y1^-1, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element <1,0,0 | r |2,1,m1> is non-zero only when m1=0, because r has components with m=0, ±1.

Wait, no, because the final state has m=0, so the matrix element would require that the initial m1 plus the m of r's component equals 0.

Wait, perhaps the m1 must be 0, because r's component that has m=0 is needed to transition to m=0.

Wait, but for m1=+1, you would need r's component with m=-1 to combine to give m=0.

Similarly, for m1=-1, you would need r's m=+1 component.

So for m1=+1, the transition would require using the r component with m=-1.

Similarly, for m1=-1, using r's m=+1 component.

So the matrix element would be non-zero for all three m1's, but the probabilities would vary.

So for each m1, the probability of transitioning to the final state is proportional to the square of the matrix element <1,0,0 | r |2,1,m1>.

Now, perhaps the probabilities are the same for each m1, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from |2,1,0> to |1,0,0> has a higher probability because the m1=0 case doesn't require any change in m, but the m1=+1 and m1=-1 cases require a change in m by ±1.

But again, I'm not certain about the exact probabilities.

So putting this all together, the total probability is the sum over all possible m1 of (probability of first transition to m1) multiplied by (probability of second transition from m1 to final state).

If each m1 has an equal probability in the first transition (1/3 each), and each m1 has an equal probability in the second transition (1/3 each), then the total probability would be 3 * (1/3 * 1/3) )= 3*(1/9) = 1/3.

Wait, but that's only if all m1's are equally probable in both steps.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe the probabilities aren't the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,0> is more probable because the m1=0 case can be achieved through the z-component of r, which is larger in magnitude than the x and y components.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the radial parts.

The radial part of the matrix element for the transition from n=3 to n'=2 would be proportional to the overlap integral of the 3s and 2p orbitals.

But since the initial state is 3s and the intermediate is 2p, the radial part would involve the integral of R_30(r) * r R_21(r) * r^2 dr.

But perhaps the radial part is the same for all m1's, so the probability difference comes from the angular part.

So, if the angular parts are the same for all m1's, then the transition probabilities would be the same for each m1.

But earlier I thought that the angular parts might have different probabilities based on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities for the first step are the same for m1=+1, 0, -1.

So each would have a probability of 1/3.

Then, in the second step, from each m1 to m=0.

If the second transition's probability is the same for each m1, then the total probability would be 3 * (1/3 * 1/3) )= 1/3.

But looking at the options, option A has a probability of 1/3, which would fit this scenario.

But wait, the options are:

A) |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and 1/3.

B) ... and 1/4.

C) ... and 1/4.

D) ... and 2/3.

So if the total probability is 1/3, then option A would be correct.

But wait, what if the transition to m1=0 is more probable than the others?

If, for example, the transition to m1=0 has a probability of 2/3, and the transitions to +1 and -1 each have 1/6, then the total probability would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix elements for m1=0 are larger than for m1=±1.

Wait, perhaps the transition to m1=0 is more probable because the z-component of r (Y1^0) is larger than the x and y components in magnitude.

So the probability for m1=0 is higher, say 1/2, and for m1=+1 and m1=-1 each is 1/4.

Then, when considering the second transitions, perhaps the transition from m1=0 to m=0 is more probable.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is determined by the number of possible ways each m1 can transition to the final state.

But perhaps there's a formula or a selection rule I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that when you have two transitions, each with certain probabilities, the total probability is the product of the probabilities of each step, summed over all possible intermediates.

If each m1 has the same probability for the first step, and each m1 has the same probability for the second step, then the total probability would be 3 * (1/3) * (1/3) )= 1/3, as before.

But if the first transition's probabilities are not the same for each m1, then the calculation would differ.

Wait, another approach is to consider that the transition from 3,0,0 to 2,1,0 is allowed, and the transition from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0 is also allowed. But perhaps transitions involving m1=+1 or m1=-1 are forbidden in the second step.

Wait, but I don't think that's the case because the selection rules allow Δm=0, ±1.

Wait, but the final state has m=0, so the second transition must have Δm= -m1. So for m1=+1, Δm must be -1. For m1=-1, Δm must be +1.

But if the second transition is possible, then each m1 is allowed.

But perhaps the probability of the second transition is the same for all m1's.

In that case, the total probability would be the sum over all m1's of (probability of first step) * (probability of second step).

If each first step has probability p1, and each second step has probability p2, and there are three m1's, then total probability is 3 * p1 * p2.

But if p1 is 1/3 for each m1, and p2 is 1/3 for each, then total is 3*(1/3 *1/3 )= 1/3.

So if the overall probability is 1/3, then option A is correct.

But looking at the options, option A says the route is via |2,1,0>, and the probability is 1/3.

But the other options involve different intermediates but the same probability.

Wait, no, only option A's route goes through m1=0. The other options (B and C) have intermediates with m1=+1 and m1=-1, respectively.

Wait, but in reality, the decay could involve any of the m1's, so the correct total probability would be the sum of all possible paths.

So the correct answer should account for all possible paths, not just the one presented in the options.

But the options don't present the sum of all paths; each option seems to present a single path with a certain probability.

Wait, the question says, "the transition route and the corresponding probability are".

So the options are suggesting that the transition goes through a particular intermediate (like |2,1,0> in option A) and has a certain probability.

But in reality, the decay could proceed through any of the possible intermediates, so the probabilities would add up.

But the options seem to present only one possible path, not all.

But the question states that the decay occurs via two dipole transitions, but which particular intermediates are involved.

Hmm, perhaps the question is not about the sum of all possible paths but about the specific path taken.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct route is via |2,1,0>, and the probability is 1/3.

But I'm not fully confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the selection rules only allow the transition through m1=0.

Wait, no, that can't be right because both m1=+1 and m1=-1 are allowed.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, which has a probability of 2/3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of another approach.

In hydrogen, the transition from n=3 to n=1 is a two-photon process. But in this case, it's a two-step dipole transition, meaning each step is a single photon emission.

Wait, but in reality, the hydrogen atom's energy levels have specific transitions, but I'm not sure about the probabilities.

Wait, perhaps the probability of each possible m1 transition is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for that m1.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 are:

- For m=0: The CG coefficient is 1.

Wait, no, that's not right. The CG coefficients for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1.

For m=0: The state is |1,0> = |1,0>.

The CG coefficient is 1 because you can only combine |0,0> and |1,0> to get |1,0>.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: the number of possible ways to reach each m1.

For m1=0: only the z-component contributes.

For m1=+1: the x-component contributes.

For m1=-1: the y-component contributes.

Assuming that the x, y, and z components contribute equally, which they don't because the position vector has x, y, z, but their contributions might be similar in terms of probabilities.

Wait, perhaps each component contributes equally, leading to each m1 having a 1/3 probability.

So the first transition's probability for each m1 is 1/3.

Then, for the second transition, the probability from m1 to m=0.

Assuming each of these has a 1/3 probability, the total would be 3 * (1/3 * 1/3 )= 1/3, as before.

So if the probability for each transition is 1/3, then option A, which has a total probability of 1/3, would be correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: perhaps the correct probability is 2/3, which would mean that two of the three possible m1's contribute.

But I don't have enough information to be certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, which claims a probability of 2/3. But I don't know why.

Wait, perhaps the first transition's probability isn't uniform across m1's.

Maybe the transition to m1=0 is more probable, with a probability of 1/2, and the others have 1/4 each.

Then, the second transition from m1=0 to m=0 has a higher probability, say 2/3, while the others have 1/3 each.

But this is just speculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for each dipole transition is the same, so each step has a probability of 1/2, leading to a total probability of 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.

But none of the options have 1/4 except B and C.

Wait, no, options B and C have 1/4 as the probability, but the route involves m1=+1 and m1=-1, respectively.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first transition's probability is 2/3 (for m1=0), and the second transition's probability is 1, leading to a total of 2/3.

But I'm not sure.

At this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the options and the reasoning that the total probability would be 1/3, as in option A, but I'm not entirely certain.


The problem involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The decay proceeds through an intermediate state |n', l', m'⟩, which must satisfy the selection rules.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Final State**:
   - The initial state is |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0).
   - The final state is |1,0,0⟩ (n=1, l=0, m=0).
   - The transition occurs in two steps, with the intermediate state having l=1 (Δl = ±1).

2. **Possible Intermediate States**:
   - From |3,0,0⟩, the first transition must go to a state with l=1. The possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩ (m= -1, 0, +1).
   - From the intermediate state, the second transition must go to |1,0,0⟩, requiring Δl = -1 and Δm = -m'.

3. **Transition Probabilities**:
   - The transition probabilities depend on the overlap of the spherical harmonics and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.
   - For the first transition, the probabilities for m'= -1, 0, +1 are assumed to be equal, each having a probability of 1/3.
   - For the second transition, the probabilities depend on the overlap between the intermediate state and the final state. Assuming equal probabilities for each m', the probability for each second transition is also 1/3.

4. **Total Probability**:
   - The total probability is the sum over all possible intermediate states:
     \[
     P_{\text{total}} = \sum_{m'} P_{\text{first}} \cdot P_{\text{second}} = 3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{3}.
     \]

5. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3. This matches the calculated total probability if the decay proceeds through the m'=0 intermediate.
   - **Option B**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This does not match the calculated probability.
   - **Option C**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This also does not match the calculated probability.
   - **Option D**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 2/3. This overestimates the probability.

### Conclusion:
The correct transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a total probability of 1/3, as stated in **Option A**.
