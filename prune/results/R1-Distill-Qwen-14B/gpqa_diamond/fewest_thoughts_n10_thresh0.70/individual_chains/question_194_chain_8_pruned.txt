Okay, so I've got this question about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. The options are given, so maybe I can work it out step by step.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So for each possible state (each combination of S1, S2, S3), I calculate the energy and then sum e^(-βE) for all states.

First, I should figure out all possible states. Since each spin has 2 options, three spins give 2^3=8 possible states. Let me list them:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

For each state, I'll compute E. Let's see.

Let me compute each term S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 for each state.

I think it's easier to compute each product and then sum them.

Let me go step by step:

State 1:
S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
S1S2=1*1=1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum is 1+1+1=3. So E = -J * 3 = -3J.

State 2:
S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
S1S2=1*1=1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=1*(-1)=-1
Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

State 3:
S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
S1S2=1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=(-1)*1=-1
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J.

State 4:
S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
S1S2=1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=(-1)*(-1)=1
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E = J.

State 5:
S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
S1S2=(-1)*1=-1
S1S3=(-1)*1=-1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E=J.

State 6:
S1=-1, S2=+1, S
