Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow and think through everything carefully.

Alright, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases a gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, so B must be a solid at room temperature but just a bit above melting.

Also, the product of X reacting with a certain keto acid has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Oh, and we need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Let me break it down.

First, let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y violently. The gas W has same protons and neutrons. What's a gas with equal protons and neutrons? Well, hydrogen has one proton, but if it's a molecule, maybe something like H2O... no, wait. Wait, the molecule of W has same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule has N = P? So for example, helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. But as a gas, helium is a noble gas; maybe it's another molecule.

Wait, wait. If each molecule has equal protons and neutrons, maybe the molecule is something like O2? No, oxygen has 8 protons, 8 neutrons in O-16. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons? No, that's per molecule, so two O atoms each with 8p and 8n. So total 16 p and 16 n. So yes, that would fit. So W is O2? But wait, O2 is a diatomic gas, and I think it's produced in some reactions, maybe when something is oxidized.

But another possibility is CO2. Wait, but CO2 has C (6p, 8n) and two O (8p each, 8n each). So the molecule would have 6+16=22 p and 8+16=2
