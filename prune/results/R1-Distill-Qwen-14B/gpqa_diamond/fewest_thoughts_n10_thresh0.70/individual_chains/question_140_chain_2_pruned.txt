Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y violently, releasing a gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. Another clue is that when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Also, substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. The question asks about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's take this piece by piece. First, I'll start with the reaction between X and Y. The reaction is violent, so it's probably a strong acid-base reaction or maybe an acid reacting with a carbonate. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. That suggests W's molecule has an even number of particles because protons and neutrons are equal. For example, water has 1 proton and 1 neutron (H2O's molecule is H2O, but wait, no, that's not equal. Wait, maybe it's something else.

Wait, gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think about which gases fit this. Let's say the molecular formula is something like H2O. Wait, no, for H2O: each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's the common isotope). Each H has 1 proton. So for H2O, protons are 2 (from H) +8 (O) =10. Neutrons are 8 (from O) + 0 (H) =8. That's not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: CO2? Let's see. Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's ^12C). Oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. Each CO2 molecule would have (6+8*2) protons and (6+8*2) neutrons? Wait, no.
