Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the given options. The compound X has specific IR and NMR data provided. So, I should probably first figure out what Compound X is, and then see what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Let me look at the IR data first. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates either an alkyne (sp-hybridized carbons) or an amide, or maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, looking at the other peaks: 1720 cm-1 is a strong absorption, which is typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions might be due to aromatic C=C stretching. So, putting this together, it's probably an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group.

Now, the NMR data. Let's break it down:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm. That's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acids usually have protons around 10-12 ppm, and the broadness suggests it's not an exchange process but rather the acidic proton in the -COOH group. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm, and they're usually sharp. So, more likely a carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet in the aromatic region. This suggests two protons in a meta or para position, or perhaps a coupling with adjacent aromatic protons. Let's think, in a benzene ring, if there are two substituents, maybe para to each other. For example, a para-substituted benzene with substituents that cause two sets of two equivalent protons.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet. So, perhaps a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, and each substituent affects the neighboring protons. Wait, but how? Let's think about a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, no—if it's a single substituent, like a substituent that's an electron-withdrawing group, causing the ring protons to split into two doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with another substituent nearby. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ring is substituted in such a way that there are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That could happen, for example, in a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that makes the ring protons split into two sets. Like if the substituent is at the para position and another substituent is somewhere else? Or maybe it's a substituent that's causing the neighboring protons to be equivalent? Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring with substituents in such a way that the two protons on each adjacent carbon are equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents, each in the para position relative to each other. Wait, maybe a substituent with an electron-withdrawing group like -COOH attached to the benzene ring.

So, looking at the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm is probably the -COOH proton. Then the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm are the aromatic protons. Let's think about a benzoic acid derivative. So, if the substituent is a para-substituted benzene, then the ring protons would be in two doublets, each integrating to two protons. That makes sense. So, the structure could be para-substituted, with the substituent being -COOH.

Wait, but looking at the other NMR data points. There's a peak at 2.9 ppm, which is a multiplet integrating to 1H. That's probably a methylene or a CH group attached to something else. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which could be adjacent to the CH. Then 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) which is a triplet perhaps? Wait, it's a doublet, so maybe a CH2 group or a CH3 attached to a CH. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which is a terminal CH3.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl group (like a carboxylic acid) and another substituent which is an alkyl chain. Let me try to sketch this.

So, if the benzene ring is at the center, it's para-substituted. One substituent is a -COOH group, and the other is an alkyl group. Let's look at the aliphatic region.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to something else, maybe near an oxygen. Wait, but in this case, it's a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH connected to a carbonyl. Wait, but in a benzoic acid, the -COOH is directly attached to the ring, so unless there's a chain attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group, like CH2CH2COOH, but no, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH2COOH attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, the aliphatic region also includes 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) which could be another CH2 group, and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) which is a CH3 attached perhaps to a CH group. Let me try to think about the structure.

If the benzene ring has a substituent that's an ethyl group attached to a carbonyl, like maybe a benzene ring with a substituent that's -(CH2)2COOH. Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentanoic acid or something else? Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a benzoic acid with an ethyl group attached, but how? Let me think again
