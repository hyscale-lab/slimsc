Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because phosphate buffer solutions are a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 200 mL), and it contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate. The temperature is 25°C, and we're told the Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 values for H3PO4. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^3-?) Well, wait, actually, orthophosphate is HPO4^3-, but I'm a bit confused because KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2-? Wait no, wait. Let me get this right.

H3PO4 is phosphoric acid. It can donate three protons, so:

H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So the species in solution would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in this case because the salts provided are KH2PO4 (which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4·2H2O, which I think would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate, providing HPO4^2-).

So when you mix these two, you're creating a buffer solution. The buffer will consist of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because KH2PO4 contributes H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 contributes HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^3-? Or is it HPO4^2-? I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, I think orthophosphate refers to H3PO4, but in solution, it's more likely to be the conjugate base. Hmm. Or perhaps orthophosphate refers to HPO4^3-, but wait, that's the phosphate ion. Alternatively, maybe the question is about HPO4^2-, which is the hydrogen phosphate ion. Maybe I should clarify that because it affects the approach.

But regardless, the problem probably wants the concentration of HPO4^2-, as that's the species in the Na2HPO4. So the solution is a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in solution, I think we're looking for [HPO4^2-].

But wait, the solution is a buffer, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But here, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^- because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-.

So the pKa we should use is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. Wait, because Ka2 is the dissociation of H2PO4^- to H+ and HPO4^2-, so that's the relevant pKa for the buffer.

So the steps I think I should take are:

1. Calculate the molarity of each salt in the solution.
2. Since the solution is 200 mL, the volume is 0.2 L.
3. Find moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4
