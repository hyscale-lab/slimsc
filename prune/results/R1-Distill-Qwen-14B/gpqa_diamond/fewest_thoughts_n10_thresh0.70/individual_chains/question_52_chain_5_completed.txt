Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I remember that when stars have dark spots, it affects their overall temperature and how we observe certain elements in their spectrum. The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changing when the star has spots.

Alright, the star's parameters: 1.5 solar radius, 1.1 solar masses. When no spots, Teff is 6000K. When 40% is covered, Teff drops to 5500K. So the star is cooler when it has spots. But wait, how does that affect the photosphere's conditions?

The problem mentions the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two levels. The ratio decreases when there are spots. Wait, under LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), the number of atoms in energy levels depends on the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations N2/N1 is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights and E is the energy difference.

So when the temperature changes, the exponential term changes. Since the star's effective temperature decreases when it has spots, let's see how that affects the ratio. Wait, when T goes down, the exponent becomes more negative, so the exponential term decreases. So the ratio N2/N1 would decrease because exp(-ΔE/(kT)) is smaller.

Wait, but the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when spots are present, the observed ratio is lower. So the ratio (N2/N1) when no spots is higher than when there are spots. So we need to find the factor by which it changes—no spots vs. spots.

So the factor is (N2/N1)_no_spots / (N2/N1)_spots. Since the ratio when no spots is higher, the factor is greater than 1.

But wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Wait, but does that mean the photosphere is at 5500 K overall? Or are the spots cooler, and the rest are at 6000 K?

Wait, the question says when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500K. Hmm, but stars with spots have a lower overall luminosity. But the problem is about the photospheric effective temperature. Wait, maybe the spots are at a lower temperature, and the rest is at 6000 K. But the overall Teff is an average.

Wait, no. The problem says that the Teff is 5500K overall when 40% is covered. So the entire photosphere is now at 5500K? Or is the average? Hmm, probably, when spots are present, the photosphere is at a lower temperature. Because when the star has spots, 40% of the area is cooler, but the rest is 6000K. But the effective temperature is the average, so we can model the total flux.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at 5500K when spots are present. Because the question says the Teff decreases to 5500K, so the photospheric temperature is 5500K when spots are present.

Wait, but the star's photosphere is in LTE, which implies each region is at local T. So perhaps the spots have a lower T, and the rest are at 6000K. But the problem says the overall photospheric effective T is 5500K. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that when spots are present, the average T is 5500K, but each region (spot or not) is in LTE. Alternatively, maybe the entire photosphere is now at 5500K when spots are present. Because the question says when the surface is covered by spots, the Teff decreases to 5500K. So perhaps the spots and the surrounding areas each contribute to the overall Teff.

Wait, Teff is the effective temperature as seen from afar, which depends on the total luminosity. If 40% of the surface is cooler, and 60% remains at 6000K, then the total flux would be the sum of the two areas' fluxes.

But in any case, the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500K when spots are present. So perhaps the entire photosphere is now at 5500K. Because the Teff is a measure of the average flux per unit area, so if the star's surface has a mix of temperatures, the effective T is determined by the total luminosity divided by the surface area, as per the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Wait, Stefan-Boltzmann says L = 4π R² σ Teff^4. So when part of the star is cooler, the total luminosity would be the sum of the areas times their respective emissions. Let me compute the Teff in that case.

Suppose the star has 40% of its surface at T_spot and 60% at 6000K. Let’s assume the rest of the surface (60%) is at 6000K. Then the total luminosity would be:

L = (0.4 * A * σ T_spot^4) + (0.6 * A * σ * 6000^4)

But the effective temperature when spots are present is 5500K, so the whole star's luminosity is also:

L = 4π R² σ (5500)^4

So equate:

0.4 T_spot^4 + 0.6 (6000)^4 = (5500)^4

Wait, no. Because A is the surface area, which is 4π R². So, when you have 40% of the surface at T_spot, the total emission from that area is 0.4 * 4π R² σ T_spot^4. Similarly for the 60% area.

So total L = 0.4 * 4π R² σ T_spot^4 + 0.6 * 4π R² σ (6000)^4

Divide both sides by 4π R² σ:

0.4 T_spot^4 + 0.6 (6000)^4 = (5500)^4

Let me compute that.

Compute each term.

Compute (5500)^4: 5.5e3^4 = (5.5)^4 * 1e12 = 5.5^4 is about 5.5*5.5=30.25; 30.25^2= 915.0625. So 915.0625e12 ≈ 9.1506e14.

Compute 0.6*(6000)^4: 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12. 0.6 * 1296e12 = 777.6e12 = 7.776e14.

So:

0.4 T_spot^4 + 7.776e14 = 9.1506e14

Subtract: 0.4 T_spot^4 = 9.1506e14 -7.776e14 = 1.3746e14

So T_spot^4 = (1.3746e14) / 0.4 = 3.4365e14

Take fourth root: T_spot = (3.4365e14)^(1/4)

Let me compute that. Let's express 3.4365e14 as 3.4365 x 10^14.

Taking the fourth root, so (3.4365)^(1/4) * (10^14)^(1/4).

10^14^(1/4)=10^(3.5)=10^3 * sqrt(10)≈1e3 *3.1623≈3.1623e3.

3.4365^(1/4)—let me approximate. 3^(1/4)= about 1.316, 4^(1/4)=1.414. 3.4365 is a bit less than 3.5, so maybe around 1.36 or so.

So 1.36 *3.1623e3 ≈ 4.308e3 K. So about 4300 K.

So the spots are at ~4300 K.

But wait, the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE. So when spots are present, the photosphere comprises regions at different temperatures—40% at 4300K and 60% at 6000K. But when no spots, the entire photosphere is at 6000K.

But the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels depends on the local temperature. So when the star has spots, the observed ratio is a mix of the two regions. Hmm, but wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. But in reality, the ratio would be a weighted average of the two regions.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the overall ratio is lower than when the star has no spots.

Wait, but the ratio measured is a line formation process in the photosphere—so perhaps the line is formed in regions at different temperatures, but the equivalent width or the strength of the line depends on the temperature structure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the entire photosphere is at a single temperature when spots are present. Wait, but the star's effective temperature is 5500K when spots are present, but the actual photosphere has different regions. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that when spots are present, the average temperature of the photosphere is 5500K. So it's a single temperature for the entire photosphere. Because the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500K when spots are present.

Wait, but that doesn't make physical sense, because spots are cooler regions. Oh, but wait, the effective temperature is an average, not the actual temperature of the photosphere. So when the star has spots, the photosphere's average T is 5500K. But in reality, the photosphere has regions at 6000K and 4300K.

Hmm, but this is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to approach it from another angle.

The problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The transition is at 1448 Å, which is in the near UV or UV. The ratio depends on the temperature via the Boltzmann factor.

The ratio N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Assuming that E2 > E1, so the exponent is negative.

So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio N2/N1 decreases.

When the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower, so the ratio should decrease. Which aligns with the problem statement.

But the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000K) compared to when it does have spots (T=5500K). So we need to compute (N2/N1)_6000K / (N2/N1)_5500K.

Since N2/N1 is proportional to exp( - (E2-E1)/(kT) ), let's denote ΔE = E2 - E1. Since the line is at 1448 Å, we can compute the energy difference from the wavelength.

The energy of a photon is E = hc / λ.

So ΔE = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant: 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light: 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.

But we can also express this in terms of eV, since k is in eV/K units.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So ΔE in eV: 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that again.

ΔE = hc/λ.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

c=3e8 m/s.

λ=1448 Å = 1.448e-7 m.

So hc= 6.626e-34 *3e8= 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by λ: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Now, convert to eV.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So divide 1.372e-18 by 1.602e-19:

1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV.

So ΔE ≈ 8.56 eV.

Now, Boltzmann's constant k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, the exponent is -(ΔE)/(k T) = -(8.56 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K * T)

So let's compute this for T=6000 K and T=5500 K.

At T=6000 K:

Exponent = -(8.56)/(8.617e-5 *6000) = -(8.56)/(0.517) ≈ -16.55.

So exp(-16.55) ≈ ?

Similarly, at T=5500 K:

Exponent = -(8.56)/(8.617e-5 *5500) = -(8.56)/(0.4739) ≈ -18.07.

So exp(-18.07) ≈ ?

But wait, wait, wait. Let me compute the denominator correctly.

Wait, 8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K = 8.617e-5 *6e3 = 0.517 eV.

So 8.56 / 0.517 ≈ 16.55.

Similarly, 8.617e-5 *5500 = 8.617e-5 *5.5e3 = 8.617e-5 *5500 = 8.617 * 5.5e-2 = because 5500=5.5e3, so 8.617e-5 *5.5e3 = (8.617 *5.5) * 1e-2 = approx 47.3935 * 0.01 = 0.473935 eV.

So 8.56 / 0.473935 ≈ 18.07.

So the exponents are -16.55 and -18.07 for T=6000 and T=5500, respectively.

Now, the ratio (N2/N1)_6000 / (N2/N1)_5500 = [exp(-16.55) / exp(-18.07)] = exp( ( -16.55 + 18.07 )) = exp(1.52) ≈ 4.59.

Wait, because when you divide the two, the exponents subtract. So the ratio is exp( ( (-16.55) - (-18.07) )) = exp(1.52) ≈ 4.59.

So the factor is approximately 4.59, which is around 4.6. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is the closest.

Wait, but the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. Which aligns with our calculation: (N2/N1)_no_spots / (N2/N1_spots) ≈ 4.59.

So the factor is about 4.59, which is approximately 4.6. The closest option is C) ~4.5.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we analyze the problem using the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations \( N_2/N_1 \) is given by:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The problem specifies that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), so \( \Delta E \) can be calculated using \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \). Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \), we find:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 3 \times 10^8}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting \( \Delta E \) to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The ratio \( N_2/N_1 \) depends on the temperature \( T \) through the exponential term \( \exp(-\Delta E / kT) \). For \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (no spots) and \( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (with spots), the exponents are calculated as:

\[
\text{Exponent at } T = 6000 \, \text{K}: \quad -\frac{\Delta E}{kT} = -\frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5} \cdot 6000} \approx -16.55,
\]
\[
\text{Exponent at } T = 5500 \, \text{K}: \quad -\frac{\Delta E}{kT} = -\frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5} \cdot 5500} \approx -18.07.
\]

The ratio of the populations is proportional to the ratio of the exponential terms:

\[
\frac{(N_2/N_1)_{6000}}{(N_2/N_1)_{5500}} = \frac{\exp(-16.55)}{\exp(-18.07)} = \exp(1.52).
\]

Calculating \( \exp(1.52) \):

\[
\exp(1.52) \approx 4.59.
\]

Thus, the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately 4.59. The closest option is **C) ~4.5**.
