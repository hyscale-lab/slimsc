Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let me break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, especially under certain conditions, it's probably an example of a substitution reaction. Wait, but ketones don't typically react directly with nitriles. Oh wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. Oh right, the formation of a cyanohydrin! Cyanohydrin formation involves adding a nitrile group to a ketone. The reaction usually involves a base, but wait, in this case, the reagent is NaCN and A. Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. Oh, but for the cyanohydrin formation, I think the conditions are acidic. Because the mechanism involves protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, then the CN- attacks. So the reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+ or something else that can protonate the carbonyl.

So, looking at the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and H3O+ (if A is H3O+) to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That makes sense because the product is a cyanohydrin. So A is likely H3O+.

Now the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile plus reagent B (with H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen? I think nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. The typical hydrolysis of nitriles can be under acidic or basic conditions. If it's hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid, I believe it's done in acidic conditions.
