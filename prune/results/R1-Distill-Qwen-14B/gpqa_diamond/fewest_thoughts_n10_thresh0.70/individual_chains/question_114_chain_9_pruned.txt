Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two different reactions. Let me read the problem carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that ketones reacting with nitriles can undergo nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone, right? So when a ketone reacts with something like sodium cyanide, what happens? Oh, wait, that's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Yeah, I think that's right. Cyanohydrin formation occurs when a ketone reacts with a nitrile under specific conditions.

So, for the first reaction, the ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with NaCN and a reagent A. What's the role of A here? I think the reaction is typically acid-catalyzed. So maybe A is an acid. Like H3O+ or something else that can protonate the carbonyl oxygen.

Wait, but what's the product? 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group. That makes sense for a cyanohydrin. The mechanism would involve the ketone attacking the CN- as a nucleophile, but I think it's actually the other way around. The CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, and then the protonation occurs. Wait, no, the ketone's carbonyl is attacked by the cyanide. But the reaction is acid-catalyzed, so perhaps H+ from A protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- from NaCN attacks the carbonyl carbon.

So, the first step is adding H3O+ as reagent A. So for reagent A, looking at the options, A could be either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I'm thinking that H3O+ is a strong acid, which is suitable for this reaction.

Now, the second reaction is a nitrile group converting into a carboxylic acid. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and the product is the corresponding butanoic acid. So, how do nitriles become carboxylic acids?

I think the typical way is hydrolysis. But under what conditions? Nitrile hydrolysis can occur under acidic or basic conditions. For acidic hydrolysis, HCl is often used, and it's usually a more vigorous reaction. Alternatively, using a weak acid like CH3COOH might require longer time or heat.

Wait, but in the second reaction, re
