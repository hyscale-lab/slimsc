Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars—right, they orbit around a common center of mass. The question is asking about the mass of each system and by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The options are given as A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let me read the problem again. So, both systems exhibit eclipses, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses. The spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) variations. In system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 km/s and 10 km/s. 

Wait, radial velocity amplitudes relate to the masses of the stars. Oh right, the more massive star has a smaller velocity because it's closer to the center of mass. So, the velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass of the star. Since the total mass of the system is the sum of the two stars' masses, I think I need to find the mass ratio first.

Let me think about the formula. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by a function of the mass of the companion and the total mass. The formula I remember is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_p + M_s)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) ), but I'm not sure if I'm remembering it right. Wait, maybe a better approach is through the mass function.

Alternatively, the mass ratio q = M_secondary / M_primary. And the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses because they orbit the same center of mass. So, if star 1 has velocity v1 and star 2 has v2, then M1/M2 = v2/v1.

Wait, yes, because M1 * v1 = M2 * v2, assuming they're orbiting each other, so their momenta are equal and opposite. So M1/M2 = v2/v1.

In system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. So M1a/M2a = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1a is half the mass of M2a. So the total mass of
