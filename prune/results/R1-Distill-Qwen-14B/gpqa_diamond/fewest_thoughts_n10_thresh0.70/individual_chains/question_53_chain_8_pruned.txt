Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The clues given are from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. 

Alright, let me break this down. First, the FTIR shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a characteristic carbonyl absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹. So, that makes me think that the compound has an ester functional group, probably as a substituent on the aromatic ring.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. The user describes six signals. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think—each signal corresponds to a set of equivalent protons. So six signals mean six different types of protons.

The signals are categorized as:
1. Two signals for aromatic-H. So the aromatic ring has two sets of protons, maybe para and ortho positions? Since it's a di-substituted ring, the substituents can influence the splitting. But I'm not sure yet.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on double bonds. So perhaps there are two different double bonds? Or maybe one double bond with two different coupling scenarios. Wait, a vinyl group is CH₂=CH-, so the protons on each carbon of the double bond would typically split each other. So in a conjugated system, like an ester maybe?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The ester group is O-CO-O, but the vinyl protons are probably part of another group. Oh, maybe it's an aromatic ring with an ester substituent and another substituent that's a vinyl group. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted ring where one substituent is an ester and another is a vinyl group.

Wait, vinyl groups are typically part of double bonds. So if there's an ester group and a vinyl group attached to the ring, that would make the ring di-substituted. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are two ester groups or another combination. But the NMR has two vinyl-H signals, so I think there are two different vinyl proton environments.

Then, two signals for –CH3 groups. So two different methyl groups. But wait, the problem says the di-substituted ring has six signals in total, so each substituent must contribute some protons. Let's think about each substituent.

Wait, the substituents on the ring could be, for example, an ester group (O-CO-O-R) and a vinyl group (like a CH₂CH₂ group?), but wait, no. Because the vinyl would be part of a substituent like CH₂=CH- attached to the ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent with a double bond, like a styryl group (CH₂=CHCOO-), but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to another part. Or maybe the substituents are an ester and a propenyl group or something like that.

Wait, but the NMR has two vinyl-H signals. So perhaps the substituents have different environments. For example, one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group attached in a way that causes two different signals.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent itself has a vinyl group with two different protons. For instance, in a trans or cis configuration. But wait, in that case, perhaps the substituent would have two sets of vinyl protons. For example, in an ester group, maybe the R group is a vinyl, but that doesn't quite fit. Or perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, with two different vinyl protons.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group with a double bond, leading to two sets of vinyl protons. Let's think about the structure.

Another thought: the substituent could be something like a methacrylate group? Or maybe a substituent with a double
