Okay, so I have this physics problem about the decay of a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The question is about which partial wave isn't permitted based on Pauli statistics and conservation laws. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, the initial state is 1S0. The notation is (2S+1)L(J), right? So for 1S0, 2S+1 is 1, so S must be 0. Then L is S written in spectroscopic notation. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the spectroscopic notation is written as (2S+1)L J, where S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum, and J is the total angular momentum. So 1S0: 2S+1=1 implies S=0. Oh wait, no, because 2S+1=1 → S=0. So the spin is zero. Then L is S? No, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The term symbol is written as (2S+1)L J, where S is the total spin, L is the orbital angular momentum (like S, P, D...), and J is the total angular momentum. So for 1S0, the 1 comes from (2S+1)=1, so S=0. The L here is S, but that's the orbital part. Wait, that might not make sense. Oh, wait! No, the L in the term symbol is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. So 1S0 would mean S is 0, orbital L is 0 (since S is the orbital part? Wait, no, wait. No, the S in the term symbol is for the spin, and L is the orbital. So 1S0: S is 0, L is 0, and J is 0. Oh, wait, that can't be. Because the initial state is NN in 1S0, which probably refers to their combined spin and orbital angular momentum. So the NN system has spin S, orbital angular momentum L, and total J.

Wait, but the term is (2S+1)L J. So 1S0: S=0, L=0, J=0. So the initial state has orbital angular momentum L = 0 (so S orbital), spin S=0, and total angular momentum J=0.

Now, the system emits a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So the decay is NN → NN' + X, but wait, actually, the initial is NN, and they emit X, so the final state is just the two nucleons and X. Or perhaps it's more like NN decay into something else plus X, but I think it's a decay where the NN system splits into two particles (like neutron and proton) plus X. Hmm, wait, the question says the final NN state has T=0. Oh, maybe the decay is NN emitting X, so the final state includes the same two nucleons plus X? Or perhaps the NN system is in an excited state and emits X. I think that's the case: the initial state is NN in 1S0, and they emit a particle X, so the final state is NN (possibly in a different state) plus X.

But the problem says that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, what? Oh, wait, I think it's about the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers. So T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So the condition is T = S + L + 1 mod 2. So T + S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So for the final state, T = 0. Then, the equation becomes 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So S
