Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and finding the energy of the nucleus moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question states that the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons and usually 4 neutrons for the most common isotope, lithium-7. But this problem says 3 neutrons, so that must be lithium-6. So the mass number A is 6 (since 3 protons +3 neutrons=6). So the nucleus is ^6Li.

The problem is asking for the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. I remember that in particle accelerators, the kinetic energy is usually a significant portion of the total energy, but sometimes it's the total energy that's given. Wait, in this case, the question says "energy of the RHIC", which I think refers to the total energy, not just the kinetic. But I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, in physics, when you talk about the energy of a particle in a collider, it's the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic). So yeah, I should calculate the total energy.

So the formula for total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)). Here, v is 0.96c. So I'll compute gamma first.

Let me compute gamma. v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - v²/c² = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, sqrt(0.09) is 0.3, because 0.3^2 is 0.09. 0.0784 is a bit less, so sqrt is about 0.28. Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784. Oh, exactly! So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, no, 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Hmm, but let me double-check. 0.28 * 3.5714 = 1? Let's see: 0.28 *3.5714 ≈ 0.28 * 3.57= ~0.9996, so yeah, approximately 3.5714. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should calculate it more precisely. Let me see:

v = 0.96c → beta = 0.96.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -
