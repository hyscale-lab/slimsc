Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, I should look at the spectral data provided for Compound X. The IR and NMR data will help me determine its structure, which is necessary to figure out what reaction it undergoes.

Starting with the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610 cm⁻¹, 1450 cm⁻¹. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 usually indicates an -OH group, maybe from a carboxylic acid, or possibly an alcohol or amine. But since there's a strong peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have a broad peak around 3000-2500 because of the O-H stretch, but if it's an ester or ketone, that would be different. Wait, 1720 is more typical for an ester or a ketone. Wait, carboxylic acids have carbonyls around 1700 too. Hmm.

Wait, the 1720 is a strong peak. Another peak at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹. Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe there's an aromatic ring with substituents.

Looking at the NMR data: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – that's a pretty upfield peak. A broad singlet at 10.5 could be an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols in NMR are usually broad, but they can appear around 1-5 ppm. Wait, but 10.5 is more like a phenolic OH or a carboxylic acid. Also, the chemical shift for a carboxylic acid proton is usually around 10-12 ppm, so that's possible.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) – this looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. So in a benzene ring, two protons as doublets, each integrating to 2H. One pair at 8.0, another at 7.2. That suggests maybe a substituent on the benzene, perhaps a meta director, but in para positions. So the ring is probably para-substituted, maybe with two substituents in para positions. Wait, but looking at the substitution pattern, if you have two substituents, perhaps a substituent in the para position and another in the meta? Or maybe a single substituent that would cause that splitting.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: maybe the substituent is
