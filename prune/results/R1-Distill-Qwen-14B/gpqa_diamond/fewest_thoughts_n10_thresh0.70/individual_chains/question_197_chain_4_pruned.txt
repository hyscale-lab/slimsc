Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction. Oh right, Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. So the starting material must have a ketone group, which gets reduced.

Looking at the IR data: the peaks around 3400-2500 cm-1 suggest either an O-H stretch (like in a carboxylic acid) or an aldehyde's C-H stretch. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl signal. That usually indicates a ketone or maybe an ester or aldehyde. However, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be indicative of aromatic C=C stretching. So, maybe the compound is a ketone with an aromatic ring.

Now the NMR. Let me break it down.

The 1H NMR shows:
- 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, 1H. That's a strong upfield signal. Wait, 10.5 is usually a carbonyl proton, like a ketone (but wait, ketones don't have protons attached), or maybe an aldehyde proton. Oh wait, wait. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but if it's a ketone, then why is there a peak at 10.5? Maybe it's a carboxylic acid's -OH, but that's usually a broad peak. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic proton that's deshielded, but that's less likely. Hmm, wait the 10.5 could be an aldehyde proton. But then, looking at the other data.

The next peak is at 8.0 ppm, doublet, 2H. Then 7.2 ppm, another doublet, 2H. That's classic for a para-substituted benzene. So the structure likely has a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. Each substit
