Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term involving a boson X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ_f ψ_f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I might have misread that. Oh, right, it's probably L(y) = -λ ψ_f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f, but maybe I should parse the LaTeX correctly. Let me see: it's -λ f bar{ψ} f (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe f and ψ_f are the same? Or perhaps f is a typo for ψ. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of it as the interaction term, which seems to involve the fermion fields ψ and the boson X. 

But the key part is that this is an interaction term between the boson X and the fermions. So the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. That makes sense because in the Lagrangian, you have terms that allow for the creation and annihilation of particles. So the mass of X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

So, kinematically allowed means that the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair it's decaying into. Because in particle physics, for a particle to decay into two particles, the mass of the parent must be greater than or equal to twice the mass of the child (since each child must have at least some rest mass, and energy is conserved).

Wait, but wait. The mass of X is 6 GeV. So I need to find all fermion pairs where the sum of their masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because each fermion has a mass, say m_f, so for a pair, it's 2 m_f. So X can decay into f f-bar if 2 m_f ≤ 6 GeV.
