Okay, so I have this question about the distribution of stars in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let's try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The formula I recall is that the distance d in parsecs is equal to 1 divided by the parallax plx, so d = 1/plx. That makes sense because a larger parallax means the star is closer, right? Like, a parallax of 1 parsec would mean the distance is 1 parsec, but that can't be right because the closest star has a parallax around 0.74 or something. Anyway, the key point is that parallax and distance are inversely related.

Now, the question is about stars being uniformly distributed. So, I guess that means the number density of stars is the same throughout space. But wait, when we're observing, the number of stars we can see depends on how far away they are. Because the farther away a star is, the fainter it appears. And we can only see up to a certain distance, so the number we count depends on that.

Wait, the question is specifically about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, if I consider a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range? So, I need to find the number of stars in a thin shell of parallax around a certain value.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. Let's denote that as n. So, the number of stars in a small volume dV is n*dV.

But how does this relate to parallax? Well, parallax is related to distance. So, for a given parallax plx, the distance d is 1/plx. Consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume of this shell would be 4πd² dd, because it's a spherical shell. So, the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd.

Now, I need to express this in terms of parallax. Since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because d = 1/pl
