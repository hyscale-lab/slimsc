Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their density is the same throughout space. And the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. The options are different power laws, like 1 over plx squared, cubed, etc.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So, if something has a larger parallax, it's closer. Right, because plx = 1/distance. So a star with plx of 1 parsec is closer than one with plx of 0.5 parsecs.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit plx. So, if I have a certain range in parallax, how does the count of stars in that range change as the parallax increases?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (stars per volume) is constant. Let's think about a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dd. The volume of that shell would be the surface area of a sphere with radius d multiplied by the thickness. The surface area is 4πd², so the volume is approximately 4πd² dd.

The number of stars in this shell would be the number density (n) multiplied by the volume: n * 4πd² dd.

Now, parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that into the equation. The number of stars becomes n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But wait, dd is the change in distance, which in terms of plx is d(plx) = -d/(d²) dplx. Because d=1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. I think the negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases.

But since we're dealing with magnitudes or counts, the sign doesn't matter. So, the number of stars in a thin shell at plx is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. 

The shell at distance d has volume 4πd² dd. So, considering that plx=1/d, so d=1/pl
