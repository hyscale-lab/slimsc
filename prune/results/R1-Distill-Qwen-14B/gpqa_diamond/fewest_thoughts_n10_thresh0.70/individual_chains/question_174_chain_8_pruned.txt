Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nuclear fission. Hmm, let me read it again and think through what I know.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. I'm supposed to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, okay. So initially, the nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since the initial momentum is zero, their momenta must cancel each other out. So, the momentum of the more massive fragment (which is larger) must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the lighter fragment.

But wait, the rest masses are given in terms of their sum. The sum is 99% of M. So, let me denote the rest masses.

Let me call the masses of the two fragments m1 and m2. The problem states that m1 = 2 m2. And m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

So substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the sum equation:

2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M => 3 m2 = 0.99 M => m2 = (0.9
