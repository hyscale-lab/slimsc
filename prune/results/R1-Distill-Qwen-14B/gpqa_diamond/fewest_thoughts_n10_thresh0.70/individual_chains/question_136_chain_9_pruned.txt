Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to think it through. Hmm, the problem is about vector fields and volume integrals. Oh right, I remember some stuff from my electromagnetism class. 

The question says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R.

Wait, volume integral of the divergence. Oh, right, that's the divergence theorem. The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. So, ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ f · dA over the surface.

But wait, is that right? Yeah, the divergence theorem states that the flux through a closed surface is equal to the volume integral of the divergence inside. So in this case, I can compute either the volume integral or the surface integral and they should match.

But wait, maybe I can compute the divergence first. Let's think about the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates. Since the field is purely radial, the expression for the divergence would involve only the radial component. The divergence in spherical coords is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r) + other terms, but since f_θ and f_φ are zero, those parts vanish.

So f is radial, so the divergence is (1/r²) * d/dr (r² f_r). Let's compute that. f_r is given as 1/r², right? So substituting that in, we have (1/r²) * d/dr (r² * 1/r²) = (1/r²) * d/dr (1) because r² * 1/r² is 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin?

Wait, but wait a second. If I'm at the origin, r=0, the field isn't defined because 1/r² blows up. So the divergence is zero everywhere except r=0. Then the volume integral
