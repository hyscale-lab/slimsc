Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read through it again and try to figure out what I need to do. 

The problem says that the system's state at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a state vector. Then there are two observables, P and Q, each represented by their respective matrices. 

The matrix for P has specific elements. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The matrix for Q is diagonal: first row (1,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-1). 

The question is about measuring P first and then Q. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. 

Hmm. So I think this involves finding the eigenvectors of P and Q, then projecting the state onto those eigenvectors. But since the measurements are done sequentially, after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses to the corresponding eigenvector, and then we measure Q on that state. 

Wait, no, wait. The question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P". So the order is P first, then Q. But it's about the probability of getting 0 in P and -1 in Q. So the combined probability.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q.

Starting with operator Q since it's diagonal, which might be easier. The Q matrix is diagonal with entries 1, 0, -1. So the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1. The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors because Q is diagonal. So for eigenvalue 1, the eigenvector is (1,0,0), for 0 it's (0,1,0), and for -1 it's (0,0,1).

Wait, but wait, the state after measuring P might affect the subsequent measurement of Q. So perhaps I need to find the eigenvectors of P first.

So let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. P's matrix is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Hmm, finding the eigenvalues of P. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λ I) = 0.

So let's set up the matrix (P - λ I):

[ -λ     1/√2      0    ]
[1/√2   -λ    1/√2  ]
[ 0     1/√2    -λ ]

To find the determinant of this matrix. Let me write the matrix:

| -λ       1/√2        0       |
|1/√2     -λ        1/√2     |
| 0        1/√2      -λ       |

Calculating determinant:

Expanding along the first row:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Let me compute each part.

First term: -λ * [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: -(1/√2) * [ (-λ /√2 ) - 0 ] = -(1/√2) * (-λ /√2) = (λ) / 2 

Third term is zero.

So determinant equation:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) = 0

Let me expand that:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ^3 + λ = 0

Factor: λ (-λ² + 1) ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ²) = 0

So eigenvalues are λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

Wait, wait, because 1 - λ² =0 → λ²=1 → λ=±1. So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check that. Because the determinant expansion might have a mistake.
