Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a meson resonance and its decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And resonance has to do with their short-lived nature, maybe because they decay quickly. The question gives me some numbers: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance from the given options.

Wait, I think the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime. Oh right, the formula probably involves the lifetime of the meson. So the mean distance would be the velocity multiplied by the lifetime, I guess. Because distance is speed times time. 

But wait, how do I find the lifetime? Oh yeah, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (Γ, the width) and the time uncertainty (τ, the lifetime) is about ħ (h-bar). So Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but since Γ is given in MeV, I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Let me think about units. ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because ħ is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm, but I'm more familiar with the value in GeV·s. So 6.582e-25 GeV·
