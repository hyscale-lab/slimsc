Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. Hmm, let's see what I remember about particle physics and decay processes. 

The question gives me some parameters: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. And I need to find the mean decay distance from the options provided.

Wait, I think the mean decay length depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I remember is something like L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime. 

So first, I need to find gamma. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, calculated as E divided by m, right? Because E is the total energy, so E = gamma * m * c². But since the units are in GeV and mass in GeV, maybe the c² will cancel out. Let me think: if E is 8 GeV and m_X is 1.2 GeV, then gamma is E/(m c²) but in units where c=1, it's E/m. So gamma = 8 / 1.2. Let me calculate that: 8 divided by 1.2 is like 6.666... So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

Next, I need beta. Beta is v/c, and it can be found using beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Wait, no, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), so beta squared is 1 - 1/gamma squared. Let me compute that: 1 - (1/(6.6667)^2). Let me calculate 6.6667 squared: 6.6667 squared is approximately 44.444. So 1/44.444 is about 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute that. The square root of 0.9775 is about 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

Wait, but another way to calculate beta is using the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). Alternatively, beta can be found from gamma and mass. Alternatively, maybe using the relation between energy, mass, and momentum. Oh, right, because E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4)/(c). But since we're dealing in units where c=1, it's p = sqrt(E² - m²).

So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV, so E² is 64 GeV², m² is 1.44 GeV². So p² = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 GeV². So p = sqrt(62.56) GeV. Let me compute that: sqrt(62.56) is approximately 7.91 GeV. Then, since beta is p c / E, but again, since c=1, beta = p/E. So 7.91 / 8 = about 0.98875. Which matches what I got earlier. So beta is around 0.98875.

Now, I need the lifetime tau. The width Γ is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime. The formula is tau = hbar / Γ. But wait, I need to make sure about the units.

Wait, the width Γ is given in MeV. So 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV. Now, in natural units where hbar c is 197.3 MeV fm (I think that's the value), but wait, I might want to calculate it in terms of seconds.

Alternatively, the proper lifetime tau is hbar divided by the total decay width. But I need to be careful with the units.

Wait, the Planck constant hbar is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. So hbar = 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Then, tau = hbar / Γ.

So Γ is 0.32 GeV. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) )= approx 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, let me calculate that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, no: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So tau is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the mean decay length L is gamma * beta * c * tau.

Gamma is about 6.66667, beta about 0.98875. So multiplying gamma and beta gives 6.66667 * 0.98875 ≈ 6.6.

Wait, let me calculate that accurately. 6.6666667 * 0.98875: 6 * 0.98875 is 5.9325, 0.6666667 * 0.98875 is approximately 0.66047. So adding together: 5.9325 + 0.66047 ≈ 6.59297. So about 6.593.

Now, c is the speed of light, which is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So L = 6.593 * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s).

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute 6.593 * 3e8: that's 1.9779e9.

Then multiply that by 2.056875e-24 s.

1.9779e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9779 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

Calculate 1.9779 * 2.056875:

Approximating 2 * 2 is 4, but let me be precise.

1.9779 * 2.056875:

Let me compute 2 * 1.9779 = 3.9558.

Then, 0.056875 * 1.9779. 0.05 is 0.098895, 0.006875 is approx 0.01349.

So total is about 3.9558 + 0.098895 + 0.01349 ≈ 4.068.

So 4.068e-15 meters.

Wait, so 4.068e-15 m. Looking at the options:

Options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B) 4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, so
