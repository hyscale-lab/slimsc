Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. Hmm. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, the FTIR data: there's a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since the compound is a carboxylic acid (because the options all end with COOH), that makes sense. The broad peak is probably from the -OH group in the carboxylic acid.

Then, there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm-1. That's a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have a strong peak around there, so that fits with the first part.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data: several signals, none corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So the structure doesn't have any double bonds, which makes sense because the options don't have any. The options are all substituted carboxylic acids with branching, I think.

In the NMR, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Wait, those are complex splitting patterns. Let me think about what that implies. Each splitting is due to neighboring protons.

Let's look at the options. All the compounds are substituted with various groups. Let's see:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure around the central carbons is two CH groups each attached to a C2H5 (ethyl) group. The ends are CH3 and CH2COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. The central CH groups each have a C2H5 and a CH2CH3 (ethyl). The ends are CH3CH2 and COOH.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. The central CH groups each have two methyl groups. Ends are CH3 and CH2COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. Central CH groups with a methyl and a ethyl (CH2CH3). Ends are CH3CH2 and COOH.

Wait, so the substituents on the CH groups vary. The NMR shows some complex splitting, which suggests that certain protons are next to others with different numbers of neighboring Hs.

In the NMR, we're told about two signals:

1. A doublet of triplets of quartets.
2. A doublet of triplets of triplets.

What does that mean? Let's break it down.

A doublet (two peaks) comes from coupling with one neighboring proton. A triplet (three peaks) comes from two neighboring protons. A quartet is four peaks, from three neighboring Hs.

So a doublet of triplets means that each of the two peaks in the doublet is split into a triplet. So the overall splitting is first by two Hs (doublet), then each of those splits into triplet. So the first splitting is from one neighboring set, and the second from another set.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as each peak in the first coupling is split by another coupling. So a doublet of triplets would be each peak in the doublet further split into a triplet due to another set of neighboring Hs. Similarly for the other signal.

This kind of splitting suggests that the proton
