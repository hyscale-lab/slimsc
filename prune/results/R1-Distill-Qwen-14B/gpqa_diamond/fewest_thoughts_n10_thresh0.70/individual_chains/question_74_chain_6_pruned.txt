Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about radioactive decay probabilities. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process and each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. But wait, what's the exact model here?

The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, does that mean the probability of decaying in 100 minutes is 32%, or is it the half-life or something else? Oh right, the decay probability is often modeled using an exponential decay function. So the probability of decay is related to the time elapsed.

I think the formula for the probability of decay is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time. But wait, some sources say that the probability of decay by time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). Alternatively, the activity or the decay constant λ is given by ln(2) divided by the half-life. But here, we don't have a half-life given directly. Instead, we have a probability over 100 minutes.

So, let me parse the given data. The decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. So P(100) = 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). I can rearrange that to find λ.

Let me compute that. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). That implies e^(-100λ) =
