Okay, so I need to figure out the ratio of the flux of neutrinos between two energy bands after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops suddenly. Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production happens in different layers. There's the pp chain (proton-proton chain) and the CNO cycle (Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen cycle) in the core. Oh wait, the pp chain itself has different branches. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. I think pp-III is one of the higher energy parts.

So the question says the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Hmm, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. That makes sense because neutrinos also travel at almost the speed of light, so if a process stops, we might see the effect here quickly. But neutrinos are affected by the Sun's conditions, so stopping the pp-III branch would change their production.

Solar neutrinos are produced in various processes. The main ones are the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle. The pp chain produces neutrinos via the beta decay steps. The pp-I branch is the main one, I think, which is the dominant source of neutrinos, especially for the 8B neutrinos that have higher energies. Wait, no, 8B neutrinos are from the CNO cycle. Or wait, maybe the pp chain produces lower energy neutrinos, and the CNO produces higher?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The proton-proton chain's main branch (pp-I) produces a positron and a neutrino when two protons fuse. The neutrinos from the pp chain are lower energy than those from the CNO cycle. The CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos, like the 8B neutrinos, which have energies around 15-20 MeV or so. But the pp-III branch is a part of the pp chain, I think, which might produce higher energy neutrinos than the main pp-I branch.

So if the pp-III branch stops, what does that mean for the neutrino flux? Well, the pp-III branch is a minor contributor compared to the main pp-I, but it's a part
