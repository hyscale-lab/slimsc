Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how the flux changes when a certain reaction stops. Hmm. Let me think through this.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. I remember that the pp chain is one of the main ways the Sun produces energy, and it has several branches. The pp-III branch must be a specific part of that process. Oh right, the proton-proton chain has different branches. I think pp-I and pp-II are lower-energy processes, while pp-III involves higher energies, maybe with more protons involved. So if pp-III stops, that affects the production of neutrinos.

Wait, neutrinos are produced when protons fuse, right? Specifically, in the proton-proton chain, one of the steps produces a positron, a neutron, and a neutrino. So each proton-proton fusion step releases a neutrino, but the exact number depends on which branch we're talking about.

If the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrino production? I think the pp-III branch might produce a certain type or energy of neutrinos. Oh, right, the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the other branches. Because pp-III involves more steps, maybe higher in energy, so the neutrinos from there have higher energies.

So if pp-III stops, the Sun is no longer producing as many high-energy neutrinos. But the other reactions are still going on, like the pp-I and pp-II branches. Wait, but if all other reactions remain the same, then the lower-energy neutrinos (from pp-I and pp-II) are still being produced. So the flux of lower-energy neutrinos wouldn't change much, but the high-energy ones from pp-III would drop.

The question is about the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So band 1 is lower than band 2. If pp-III stopped, which contributes more to the higher energy neutrinos, band 2 would be affected more.

Wait, neutrinos from the pp-III branch are in higher energy. So before the pp-III stopped, band 2 (800-900 keV) had a certain flux, mostly
