Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Wait, di-substituted aromatic ring means it has two substituents attached. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the compound has both a carbonyl (like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

So, the molecule has a benzene ring (6-membered), two substituents, and the total number of carbons is 8. Let me think about the structure. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 more carbons in total. Because it's di-substituted, each substituent probably has one carbon each. Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a larger group.

Wait, but let's think about the substituents. Since it's an aromatic ring, and the substituents are attached to the ring. The FTIR shows carbonyl, so maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or a nitro group? Wait, no, nitro doesn't have a carbonyl. Wait, a carbonyl group would be something like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, amide, or maybe an acyl group.

Wait, but wait. The substituents could be a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a halogen. But wait, the ring itself is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 more. So each substituent is one carbon? Because 6 (ring) + 2 (substituents) = 8.

Wait, but substituents can be more. Like, for example, if one substituent is a -OCH3 group, that's 1 oxygen and 3 carbons (but not sure if that's relevant here). Wait, but wait, the substituents are attached to the ring, so each substituent would have a certain number of carbons.

Wait, perhaps the compound is something like benzene with a ketone group attached and a halogen. So, the substituents would be a carbonyl (like a ketone, R-CO-) and a halide (like Cl or Br). Wait, but the carbonyl group would be part of the substituent. For example, if the substituents are a -COCH3 and a -X (where X is Cl, Br, etc.), then each substituent has one carbon (from COCH3, the CO is attached to a CH3). So the total carbons would be 6 (ring) + 2 (COCH3 and X are one each, but wait, COCH3 is two carbons: the CO is attached to CH3. So 6 (ring) + 2 (COCH3 substituent) + 1 (X substituent, which is just X, no carbons) = 9? Wait, but the total is 8. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. The compound has 8 carbons in total. The benzene ring is 6 carbons. So the two substituents must add 2 more carbons. So each substituent must have one carbon each. So substituent 1 is one carbon, substituent 2 is one carbon.

But wait, substituents can be more complex. Wait, let's see. Let's think about possible substituents. One substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone. So, a ketone would be something like a carbonyl attached to another carbon. So for example, a substituent like -COCH3 would add two carbons (the CO and the CH3). That's two carbons, but if that's the case, then the other substituent must add zero carbons, which is impossible because a substituent like X (Cl, Br) is just an atom, not a carbon.

Ah, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify. The substituents are attached to the benzene ring. Each substituent can be a single atom or a group with multiple carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. For example, one substituent is a carbonyl group (like -CO-R) and the other is a halogen atom (like Cl, Br).

Wait, the total number of carbons in the molecule is 8. So benzene (6 C) + substituents (total 2 C) = 8.

So substituents must contribute 2 C in total.

So, one substituent is a carbonyl group. Let's see, a carbonyl group is R-C=O. So if, say, one substituent is -CO-, but that's not possible. No, substituents are attached as R-groups. So perhaps one substituent is a -COCH3 group, which brings two carbons (the CH3 and the CO). Then, the other substituent is a halogen (like Cl), which is zero carbons. So total carbons would be 6 (ring) + 2 (COCH3) + 0 (Cl) = 8. That adds up.

But wait, the substituents are on the benzene ring. So the structure would be benzene with a -COCH3 group and a -X (halogen) group.

But wait, a di-substituted benzene with -COCH3 and -X substituents.

Alternatively, another substituent could be a -CHO group (aldehyde), which is one carbon (the aldehyde is CHO, so one carbon in addition to the ring). But then the other substituent would have to be another carbon, perhaps -Cl (but Cl is zero carbons). Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group and a methoxy group (OCH3), but that would add more than two carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group with two carbons, and the other substituent is a methyl (CH3), but that would add three carbons, which would make 6+3=9, which is over.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible structures that fit the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl group is part of an acyl group attached to the benzene. For example, benzaldehyde has a benzene ring and a -CHO group. But that's one substituent. If the other substituent is a halogen, say Cl, then the molecule would be benzaldehyde with a Cl substituent. That would be 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 1 (Cl) = 8? No, because CHO is one substituent, but the Cl is another. Wait, the CHO substituent has a carbon (the aldehyde). So 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 0 (Cl) = 7, which is less than 8. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but the total number of carbons is 8. So the substituents must add up to 2 carbons.

So substituent one: -COCH3 (which is two carbons) and substituent two: -Cl (no carbons). That gives 6 + 2 = 8. That works.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with a -COCH3 group and a -Cl substituent.

Alternatively, substituent one could be a -CH2CO- group, but that would be more complicated and perhaps have more carbons.

Wait, but wait, if the substituent is -COCH3 (acetophenone derivative), then the structure would be something like 4-chloroacetophenone. Or maybe the substituents are in a different position.

But wait, the question says it's di-substituted. So two substituents on the ring. Now, what about the NMR data?

The options are:

A) 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)
B) 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)
C) 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)
D) 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)

Wait, let's think about the NMR signals.

The compound has a carbonyl group (like a ketone, so maybe around 2.1 ppm for a CH3 attached to CO). Also, an aromatic halogen (like Cl) which would deshield the ring and affect the aromatic protons.

In the NMR, we need to see peaks for aromatic protons, the CH3 attached to CO, and possibly other groups.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). So two doublets in aromatic region, and a singlet at 2.3 which is probably a methyl group attached to something deshielded. So perhaps a ketone (COCH3).

So that would fit. The aromatic doublets could be from a para-substituted ring. Wait, if the substituents are in the para position, then the ring would have two sets of doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons are typically two doublets. So if the substituents are in para positions, then the protons on each side would be equivalent.

Wait, but in para substitution, the ring would have two sets of doublets (each with two protons), and maybe the integration adds up to 4H. But in option C, the integrations are 2H each, so that adds up to 4H. The 3H singlet would be the methyl attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, but the molecule has two substituents: a Cl and a COCH3. If COCH3 and Cl are in para positions, then the aromatic protons would be ortho to substituents. So for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, that would make a 1,4-disubstitution. But wait, that's not possible because substituents are on adjacent carbons in that case. Wait, no, 1,4 are para. So if substituents are at positions 1 and 4, the ring would have symmetry, so the protons would be in two sets of doublets.

Alternatively, substituents could be meta. Hmm, but in that case, the symmetry would be lower, leading to more complex splitting in the NMR.

But in the options, option C has two doublets, each 2H. That suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, like para substitution. So the substituents would be at para positions.

But wait, in option C's NMR, the aromatic protons are at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm. That suggests perhaps some de-shielding due to substituents. For example, if one substituent is electron-withdrawing (like Cl or COCH3), the ring's protons would be deshielded and appear downfield.

So the singlet at 2.3 ppm is likely the COCH3 group. So this fits.

Looking at the other options:

Option A: 9.9 ppm is a singlet. That's a very downfield shift, maybe an aldehyde (CHO) proton. But the question says FTIR shows a carbonyl, which could be a ketone or aldehyde. Wait, but then the other substituent is a halogen. So if the structure is an aldehyde and a halogen, then the aldehyde would show a peak around 9-10 ppm as a singlet because there's only one proton. The other protons would be from the aromatic ring.

But in option A, there's a singlet at 9.9 (probably aldehyde), then two doublets, and a singlet at 3.7 ppm. The 3.7 ppm could be a CH2 group attached to something electronegative. But wait, why would there be a CH2 group? Maybe as part of an ether or ester. But the molecule has 8 carbons. If the substituents are CHO (1 C) and OCH2 (something), but maybe that's not adding up.

Wait, the substituent with the CH2 group—like if it's an aldehyde and a methoxy group (OCH3), but then that would add up to 6 (ring) +1 (CHO) +1 (OCH3) = 8? No, OCH3 is one C, CHO is one C. So that's 6+2=8. So that could fit. But then the substituents are CHO and OCH3. But the question says the FTIR has a carbonyl (so aldehyde is a carbonyl) and an aromatic-halogen bond. Wait, but OCH3 doesn't have a halogen. So that can't be. The substituents need to be a carbonyl and a halogen.

Ah, so option A might not be correct because the substituents would be CHO and another group, which may not include a halogen. So unless the substituent is a -CH2O- group, but I'm not sure.

Option B: Peaks at 4.8 and 4.6, which are both doublets. Those are typically around the region for protons attached to oxygen, like in an ether or maybe an epoxide. The 1.3 ppm is a singlet, maybe a methyl group. But this doesn't align with the presence of a carbonyl group. Unless the substituents are something like -OCH2CH3 or similar, but that doesn't include a carbonyl. So probably not the right option.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 1H singlet at 6.9 could be an aromatic proton in a meta-substituted ring. The 4.8 and 4.6 are doublets, perhaps from a CH2 group next to an oxygen. But where's the carbonyl? There's no peak in the 2 ppm region which would suggest a COCH3. So maybe this option doesn't fit the presence of a carbonyl group.

So going back to option C, which has a 2.3 ppm singlet (COCH3) and two doublets in the aromatic region. That seems to fit a para-substituted benzene with a COCH3 and a Cl substituent. Wait, but wait, the Cl would be a substituent as well. But in the NMR, we don't see a peak for the Cl because Cl is a substituent on the ring, not a proton. So the aromatic protons would be influenced by the substituents.

Wait, but wait a second. If the substituents are in the para positions, then the ring would have two sets of doublets. Each doublet would be two protons. For example, in para-dichlorobenzene, the aromatic protons are in two doublets, each integrating to 2H. Similarly, in para-substituted acetophenone derivatives, the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets. But wait, would a para-substituted ring with a COCH3 and a Cl have four aromatic protons? Because in para substitution, the substituents are opposite each other, so the ring would have four equivalent protons, in two sets of doublets. So a peak at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H, which matches option C.

Additionally, the COCH3 group would give a singlet at around 2.3 ppm, which is what option C shows.

So that seems to fit. So the correct NMR data would be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure. The substituents are COCH3 and Cl. So the structure would be, for example, 4-chloroacetophenone.

In this structure, the benzene ring has substituents at the 1 and 4 positions (assuming COCH3 is at position 1 and Cl at position 4, or vice versa). The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. These would be equivalent in pairs, leading to two doublets in the NMR.

The COCH3 group would have a singlet around 2.3 ppm because the three protons are equivalent and not split by neighboring protons.

So that's consistent with option C.

I think that makes sense. So the answer should be option C.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. This suggests the molecule has a benzene ring with two substituents: one containing a carbonyl group (e.g., -COCH₃) and the other a halogen (e.g., -Cl). The total carbon count is satisfied as follows: 6 carbons from the benzene ring, 2 carbons from the -COCH₃ group, and 0 carbons from the halogen, giving a total of 8 carbons.

The NMR data must reflect the presence of aromatic protons, the methyl group attached to the carbonyl, and the halogen substituent. In a para-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets due to the symmetry of the molecule. The methyl group attached to the carbonyl appears as a singlet around 2.3 ppm. 

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: A singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton, but the FTIR indicates a carbonyl group, which could be a ketone or aldehyde. However, the presence of a halogen is not evident in this option, and the aromatic splitting pattern does not match the expected para-substitution.
- **Option B**: Peaks in the 4.8 and 4.6 ppm regions are characteristic of protons attached to electronegative atoms (e.g., oxygen), and the singlet at 1.3 ppm suggests a methyl group. However, this option does not include a carbonyl group, which is required by the FTIR data.
- **Option C**: Peaks at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d) correspond to aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene. The singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H, s) matches the methyl group attached to the carbonyl. This option aligns with the expected structure of a para-substituted benzene with a -COCH₃ and a halogen substituent.
- **Option D**: The singlet at 6.9 ppm (1H, s) suggests an aromatic proton in a meta-substituted benzene, but the splitting pattern does not match the expected para-substitution. Additionally, there is no peak corresponding to a carbonyl group.

### Conclusion:
Option C is the only choice that matches the expected NMR data for a para-substituted benzene with a -COCH₃ and a halogen substituent, consistent with the FTIR and carbon count.

Answer: C
