Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage structure. So 1,3-dibromo probably has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons of the adamantane structure.

First reaction: heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I think this is an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with strong base, they usually undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules and form an alkene. The product would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, but adamantane is a diamondoid, so the structure might not form a diene but maybe a bridged diene? Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination, but wait, two bromines are on adjacent carbons. So the product would probably be 1,3-diene, but considering the structure, perhaps it's a bridge structure. But wait, the NMR data is given for product 1.

The NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That seems like a CH2 group, maybe adjacent to an oxygen because that's a higher ppm. Wait, but then the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, wait. If the reaction of a dihalide with KOH would form an epoxide, but no, wait, elimination forms an alkene. Oh wait, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe the KOH in such conditions could cause a substitution, but with two bromines, perhaps it's a double substitution. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH might form a gem-diol if it's a substitution, but that doesn't seem right with KOH. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would give a diol. But then the IR would have O-H stretches, which might not match the given data. Alternatively, maybe it's an E2 elimination, forming a double bond. So product 1 would be a diene, but how does that match the NMR?

Wait, the NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 (2H), which could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen. Another possibility is an epoxide, but then the IR would show an epoxide's C-O-C, which is around 1200-1300 cm-1, not 1720. 1720 is a strong carbonyl, perhaps an ester or ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where the two bromines are on adjacent carbons. Maybe it's a vicinal dihalide undergoing a substitution to form a diol. But wait, KOH isn't a strong enough nucleophile for that? No, usually you need something like aqueous KOH in an SN2, but with two adjacent leaving groups, perhaps elimination is more likely.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the IR. 1720 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone. So maybe the product is a ketone?

Wait, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a double elimination, but that wouldn't form a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the base causes a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl via oxidation. Wait, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another possibility: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group. But that would form a diol, 1,3-adamantanediol. But the IR doesn't show O-H stretches, because maybe the diol is in a different form. Alternatively, perhaps there's something else. Wait, but the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone? How?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, forming a carbonyl. For example, if two adjacent Br atoms undergo elimination, perhaps the two CH2Br groups lose Br and form a triple bond? No, that would need more. Alternatively, maybe it forms a carbonyl via a different mechanism. Wait, perhaps it's a di-elimination to form a ketone. But I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't a diene but a diol, but then where's the carbonyl in the IR? Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a high chemical shift, perhaps an oxygen-bearing CH2 group, like an ether or ester. But the IR has a carbonyl, which suggests an ester or ketone. So perhaps the 2H are adjacent to a carbonyl, like in an ester group, such as CH2COOR. But how does that come from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a peroxide, but that doesn't fit with the IR.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by an OH, making a diol. But the IR doesn't show O-H absorption, so perhaps the diol is deprotonated. But then, the NMR would show OH signals, but maybe they're missing because they're exchanged with the solvent. But the problem says to exclude those that exchange, so maybe the 4.79 ppm is something else.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane could, under strong basic conditions, form an epoxide. Wait, but epoxide formation usually requires a peracid or something else. Alternatively, maybe the KOH isn't the right reagent for that.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclic ether. Wait, but again, the IR doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the reaction steps again.

1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid, which probably isn't an alkene because alkenes are usually clear or have different colors. Wait, maybe it's an epoxide. Wait, if it's an epoxide, the IR would show C-O-C around 1200-1300, but the given IR is at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe not.

Wait, thinking again: maybe the product is a diketone. But how would that happen? Diels-Alder maybe? No, that's a cycloaddition, which isn't applicable here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the KOH isn't acting as a base but as a nucleophile, leading to substitution. But two substitutions would form a diol, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone where one of the Br has been replaced by an OH, but that would be a substitution, but the other Br might have been eliminated. But that doesn't seem to fit either.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules and forming a triple bond. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonyl from oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a reaction. Maybe when two adjacent Br atoms are present, heating with a base can cause a ring-opening or some other process. But I'm not recalling that.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone because each Br is replaced by an O- group. Wait, like a geminal di-substitution. For example, if both Br atoms are on the same carbon, but wait, the structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which are on different carbons.

Hmm. Maybe I should look at the NMR data more closely. The peaks are at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H).

The 4.79 ppm is likely a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, maybe O. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative group or part of a ring.

Wait, considering the product after KOH is a light yellow solid, perhaps it's a diol or an epoxide. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone. If it's a ketone, then the NMR would show a carbonyl, but the 4.79 ppm is likely not the carbonyl, but maybe an adjacent CH2.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclohexanone derivative, but in the adamantane structure. So perhaps, one of the Br atoms is replaced by a carbonyl group.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide. Then the 4.79 ppm would be the CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen. But then the IR should have the C-O-C peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, but the IR shows a carbonyl. Hmm, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. Let's say the two Br's are on adjacent carbons, and when KOH is present, one Br is replaced by an OH, and the other is eliminated as Br- with a proton, forming a double bond. Wait, but then we would have an alkene, not a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl. How?

Wait, I'm starting to think that maybe I'm missing a step here. Let's consider the possibility that the product after KOH is an epoxide, which would have the O in a ring. But that doesn't explain the IR carbonyl peak.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol, and then another reaction is happening. But no, the second step is with aluminum isopropoxide.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the second reaction. Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid catalyst. That's often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But what's the structure of product 1?

Wait, so after product 1 is formed, it's heated with Al isopropoxide. Then product 2 is formed. Then, O3 is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to form product 3. The NMR of product 3 is to be analyzed.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

So perhaps I should think about each step in order.

First step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

Assuming product 1 is a diol: 1,3-adamantanediol. But then product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide.

Wait, but Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid. If product 1 is a diol, maybe it can act as a nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, which would make sense with the IR peak. So if product 1 is a ketone, then the next step with Al isopropoxide would be Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But the ketone is an electron-deficient group, so maybe it undergoes some kind of acylation. Wait, but product 1 is a solid, so maybe it's a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diepoxide. But again, the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone. Let's say that in the first step, one Br is replaced by an O group. But why would that happen? Maybe via a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form a triple bond. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form a triple bond between carbons 1 and 3, but that would require the carbons to be adjacent, which they are not in adamantane. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads, but perhaps not directly bonded. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bridged cyclopropane, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe product 1 is a gem-diol. When two adjacent Br's are present, and KOH is used, the base could deprotonate and cause a substitution. But how would that form a gem-diol? Each Br would be on adjacent carbons, so substitution would give adjacent OH groups, not gem.

Wait, perhaps the product is a peroxide. If two Br atoms are replaced by O, but that seems unlikely with KOH.

Hmm. Maybe I should move to the next step to get some clues. So product 1 is treated with excess Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid. This might induce some kind of acylation or alkylation. If product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps it undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation, but where? If the ketone is part of a ring system, perhaps it can form an enol ether or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Then, with Al isopropoxide, which is used as a catalyst in some ring-opening reactions. Epoxides can ring-open with nucleophiles, but Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid that can help in such reactions.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and then in the second step, it undergoes ring-opening under Friedel-Crafts conditions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and then product 2 is an enolate or something else.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an ester or another compound after reaction with Al isopropoxide.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the ozonolysis step. Product 2 is ozonolyzed at -78°C, then worked up with dimethylsulfide to form product 3.

Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it, and the fragments would form carbonyl compounds.

So, perhaps product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product, which would have carbonyl groups.

Wait, but then what's product 2? It's the product of product 1 treated with Al isopropoxide. So if product 1 is a diol, perhaps product 2 is an ether. Or if product 1 is a ketone, product 2 might have an acylium ion or something.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a diol or another structure.

But I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the first step again. Maybe the product is an epoxide. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-epoxyadamantane. Then, the IR would have C-O-C. But according to the IR data, the peak is at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the first step forms a ketone. How?

Wait, another reaction possibility. The base KOH could dehydrohalogenate vicinal dihalides to form a carbonyl group. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, elimination of HBr twice from a vicinal dihalide would form a double bond, not a carbonyl. Unless there's an oxidizing agent present, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the dihalide undergoes a double substitution with KOH, leading to a diol, which then, under some conditions, dehydrates to form a ketone. But that would require dehydration, and KOH could act as a base for that. So, perhaps product 1 is a diol that dehydrates to form a ketone.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → diol → dehydration → ketone.

If that's the case, then the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 would be the carbonyl of the ketone.

The NMR of product 1 would then show the ketone's environment.

But wait, product 1 is formed by heating to 240°C with KOH. So perhaps the diol is formed first, and then it dehydrates to form the ketone.

But how does a diol form a ketone? Unless it's a cyclic hemiacetal or something, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the product is a diketone. But then, how would that form from a dihalide?

I'm really stuck here. Let's try to think of what product 1 could be that would match the NMR and IR data.

IR: 1720 cm-1 → strong carbonyl, likely a ketone or ester.

NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H) → perhaps a methylene adjacent to an oxygen (like a CH2-O group) or an aromatic ring (but adamantane is already a polycyclic structure), but in a ketone, maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, in a ketone, the carbonyl is flanked by R groups. The 4.79 ppm could be a CH2 next to a carbonyl group. So perhaps the molecule has a structure like R-CO-CH2-CH2-R, or something similar.

The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group, perhaps closer to the carbonyl.

Putting this together, maybe product 1 is a ketone with a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl and another CH2 further away.

But how does that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclic ketone. For example, the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and eliminating two HBr forms a ring with a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's a ring-opening. Maybe the initial structure is a bicyclic compound, and upon elimination, a carbonyl forms.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a bridged ketone.

Wait, considering that the NMR shows 10H in the range 2.41-2.23 ppm. Those are likely to be in a more shielded environment, perhaps in a ring structure, maybe as methylene groups attached to carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10H are from a bridge structure, like in adamantane itself.

So, putting this together, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, with a structure where the two Br atoms were replaced by a carbonyl and a CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the two CH2Br groups (from 1,3-dibromoadamantane) lose HBr each, forming a carbonyl. Wait, but how would two eliminations lead to a single carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a different carbon. So each Br is on a CH2 group. Upon elimination, each CH2Br could lose HBr, but that would form a double bond between the two carbons, not a carbonyl.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but instead of forming a double bond, it forms a carbonyl. How?

Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination where the two CH2Br groups lose HBr and form a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination, but that would produce an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Hmm. I'm not making progress on this first step. Let me try to think about the possible structures.

Adamantane has a structure of four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two bridgehead carbons.

When heated with KOH, perhaps each Br leaves, and the two adjacent carbons each lose a Br and a H, forming a double bond. So the product would have a double bond between the two bridgeheads, making 1,3-adamantadiene.

But then the IR would show a peak around 1600 cm-1 for the C=C. But the given IR is at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the base isn't causing elimination but substitution. So each Br is replaced by an OH group, forming a diol. Then, the diol could undergo some reaction. But the IR doesn't show O-H stretches, so perhaps it's a different structure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the diol undergoes a dehydration reaction, forming a ketone. But diols can form ketones only if they lose water from adjacent OH groups. But 1,3-diol would have OH groups on non-adjacent carbons, so dehydration would form a double bond, not a ketone.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should move to the second step and see if that helps.

Product 1 is treated with excess Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts acylation or alkylation. So if product 1 has a carbonyl group, perhaps it can undergo a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but where would the acyl group come from?

Alternatively, if product 1 is an epoxide, Al isopropoxide could catalyze ring-opening. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it forms an enol ether. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and Al isopropoxide is acting as a catalyst for some kind of elimination, forming a carbonyl. But this is getting too speculative.

Let me think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, so product 2 must have a double bond. So product 2 is an alkene.

So after product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide, it forms product 2, which is an alkene.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 gives product 3, which would be carbonyl compounds.

So, the key is to figure out the structure of product 3's most deshielded hydrogen.

Assuming that product 2 is an alkene, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups if it's a simple alkene. The NMR of product 3 would then show the new protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an alkene formed from product 1, which was a diol or ketone.

Hmm. Maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or another structure that can form an alkene upon treatment with Al isopropoxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and Al isopropoxide induces a dehydration to form an alkene. So product 2 would be an alkene.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

But considering the steps, perhaps product 3 would have carbonyl groups and new protons adjacent to them.

But I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should consider the options for the NMR coupling pattern.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H is probably adjacent to electronegative groups, like carbonyl. So, perhaps it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

In such a scenario, the hydrogen would couple with adjacent Hs. Let's say the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R'. The CH2 next to the carbonyl would have two adjacent Hs (on the same CH2), but also possibly coupled with Hs on adjacent carbons.

Wait, if the structure is a ketone with a CH2 adjacent to it, and perhaps another CH2 group next to that, the H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be split by the Hs on the adjacent CH2.

For example, if the structure is (R)COCH2CH2X, then the Hs on the COCH2 would be split by the Hs on the CH2 next to them.

In such a scenario, each H on the COCH2 would have two neighboring Hs (on the same carbon and on the adjacent carbon). So each H would have coupling with two sets: the two Hs on the same carbon (geminal coupling, but usually not observed in 1H NMR) and the Hs on the adjacent carbon (vicinal coupling).

Wait, geminal coupling is usually not seen because the two Hs are equivalent and split each other into a singlet. So, in the case of a CH2 group next to another CH2, each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have two neighbors, leading to a triplet.

But wait, if each H on the first CH2 is coupling with two Hs on the next CH2, then the splitting would be a triplet.

But if the adjacent CH2 is itself split by another group, perhaps the coupling becomes more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the Hs are on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and the CH2 is between two carbonyls. So each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same carbon and two on the next, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like (R)COCH2CH2CO(R'). Then, the CH2 between the two carbonyls would have each H coupling with the two Hs on the same CH2 (which gives a quartet) and the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (which gives another quartet). But this would result in a more complex splitting pattern, like a doublet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, if the Hs are on a CH2 next to a CH group, the coupling would be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the Hs are on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl and also next to another CH2 group that is adjacent to another group with two Hs. So each H would have coupling with two Hs from their own group and two from the next, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but how would that happen?

Alternatively, maybe the Hs are on a CH2 that is adjacent to a CH group which is itself adjacent to another CH2. Then, each H on the CH2 would couple with the two Hs on their own group and the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, as well as any Hs on the next group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and also next to a CH group. The Hs on the CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the same CH2 (but that's a singlet) and the Hs on the adjacent CH (which has one H), leading to a doublet. But that doesn't match the options.

Hmm.

Wait, considering the options, the most likely is a triplet, perhaps from coupling with two adjacent Hs. Or a triplet of triplets if each H is coupled with two sets of two Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH2 group next to a CH2CH3 group. Then, each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but that would be a triplet. So option A is triplet.

Alternatively, if the H is part of a CH2 group next to a CH that is next to another CH2, then each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH and the two Hs on the next CH2, leading to a more complex splitting.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, let me try to summarize:

Product 1: formed from 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH. IR has a carbonyl (1720 cm-1), NMR shows 4.79 (2H), possibly a CH2 next to O or carbonyl. Product 1 is a solid, light yellow.

Product 2: product 1 treated with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, perhaps inducing formation of an alkene.

Product 3: product 2 is ozonolyzed, which cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups.

So, product 2 is likely an alkene, product 3 is the ozonolysis product, which would have carbonyl groups.

In product 3, the most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl.

Assuming product 3 is a diketone, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded.

In a structure like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R', the Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would each be coupled with two Hs on their own CH2 (but that's a singlet) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (giving a triplet).

Wait, but in that case, each H on the middle CH2 would be next to two Hs on the same carbon (so they're a singlet) and two on the adjacent carbon, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that each H is coupled with two on the same and two on the adjacent, but the same as a triplet.

Wait, but wait. If the Hs are on a CH2 group, each H is adjacent to two Hs on the same carbon (which would cause a triplet due to coupling with two neighboring Hs), but that's not the case because geminal coupling is usually not observed as they are equivalent and split into a singlet.

Wait, perhaps the coupling is with two different sets of Hs. For example, if the CH2 group is next to a CH2CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the same CH2 (but that's a singlet) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the adjacent group is a CH with two Hs, then each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs, giving a triplet.

In that case, the most deshielded H would be a triplet.

So looking at the options, A is triplet.

But wait, another possibility: if the H is on a CH2 group that is adjacent to another CH2 group, which is itself adjacent to another CH2 group, the coupling could be a triplet of triplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's difficult.

Alternatively, maybe the H is on a CH group adjacent to two CH2 groups, each with two Hs. Then, each H would couple with two from one CH2 and two from another, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, that would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: in ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and the products are carbonyl compounds. So if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls, possibly with some substituents.

Assuming product 2 is 1,3-adamantadiene, ozonolysis would break the double bonds and form two ketones. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a mono-alkene, ozonolysis would form a diketone or similar.

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. The Hs adjacent to the carbonyls would be deshielded and appear downfield.

The coupling pattern of these Hs would depend on their neighboring Hs.

If the structure is (CH2)2CO, then the Hs on the CH2 next to CO would each have two neighboring Hs (on the same CH2) and another two on the adjacent CH2. Each H would thus have coupling with two Hs (from the same CH2, but that's a singlet) and two from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if the adjacent CH2 is part of a longer chain, perhaps the coupling would involve more Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are on a CH2 next to a carbonyl and also next to a CH2 that is next to another CH2. So each H would couple with two Hs on their own CH2 (singlet) and two on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Thus, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

So the answer would be A) triplet.


The problem involves analyzing a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and determining the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the final product (product 3). Here's the breakdown:

1. **First Reaction (1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH):**  
   The reaction likely involves elimination of two molecules of HBr, forming a carbonyl-containing compound. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. The NMR data (4.79 ppm for 2H, 2.41-2.23 ppm for 10H, and 1.94 ppm for 2H) suggests a structure where the carbonyl is adjacent to a CH₂ group, which is further connected to a larger adamantane-like framework.

2. **Second Reaction (product 1 + Al isopropoxide):**  
   Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely induces further reaction. Given the formation of product 2, which is later subjected to ozonolysis, product 2 is inferred to be an alkene. This suggests that product 1 undergoes a transformation to form an alkene-containing compound.

3. **Third Reaction (product 2 + Ozonolysis):**  
   Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyl groups deshield nearby hydrogens. The coupling pattern of this hydrogen depends on its neighboring hydrogens.

4. **Analysis of Coupling Pattern:**  
   If the most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, it would couple with the two hydrogens on the same CH₂ group (geminal coupling, which typically appears as a singlet) and the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group (vicinal coupling, which would split the signal into a triplet). This results in a **triplet** coupling pattern.

Given the options, the most likely coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

**Answer: A**
