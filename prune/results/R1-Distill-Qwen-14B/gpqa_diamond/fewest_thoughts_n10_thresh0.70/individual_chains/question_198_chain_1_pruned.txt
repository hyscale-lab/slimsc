Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in a solution. Hmm, stability constants and all that. Let me think.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2] or maybe [Co(SCN)_n] with n=2 or 4? Wait, wait, the options are about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato, which I recall is the tetra or maybe a different one. Hmm, I need to clarify.

Wait, I think the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, but I'm not entirely sure. But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato, which might be [Co(SCN)_2]^−. Wait, maybe I should think about the possible complexes. The stability constants are β1 to β4, so probably they follow the order of the number of SCN- attached.

Stability constants (β) are for the formation of complexes. For a metal ion M, the complexes would be M, M(SCN), M(SCN)_2, M(SCN)_3, M(SCN)_4, each with their own β values. So, β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

Wait, the general formula for the nth complex is M(SCN)_n, and the stability constant βn is the formation constant for that complex. So, βn = [M(SCN)_n]/([M][SCN]^n).

So, the four complexes here are:

1. Co^2+ (free ion) → β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+ maybe.
Wait, wait, let me think. The first complex would be Co(SCN)^+. Because each SCN- is a -1 charge. Co is +2. So each SCN adds -1. So the first complex Co(SCN) would have +2 + (-1) = +1 charge. So the complex is [Co(SCN)]^+.

Similarly, the second complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (neutral), because 2*(-1) = -2, so Co^2+ plus two SCN^- gives neutral. The third would be [Co(SCN)_3]^- and the fourth [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

But wait, the stability constant for the nth complex is the product of the β1 to βn divided by the product of the previous βs, or is each βn independent? Wait, no, each βn is the formation constant for
