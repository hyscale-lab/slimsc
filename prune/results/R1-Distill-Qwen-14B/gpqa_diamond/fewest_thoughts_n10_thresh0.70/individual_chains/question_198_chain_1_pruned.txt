Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, let me read the question again.

So, the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. They're asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Wait, what's the structure here? I remember that for metal-ligand complexes, the stability constant (β) tells us how stable the complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form.

Cobalt can form complexes with thiocyanate. The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^m+. The number n varies, and each has a different stability constant. So for each complex, the β is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from Co²+ and SCN-.

The problem is to find out what percentage of the Co species are the dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, but how many SCN- are in each complex? Like, the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+, the second [Co(SCN)_2]^0, third [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and the fourth [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? I'm not sure, but I think each step adds a SCN ligand.

The question mentions "blue dithiocyanato" complexes. Dithiocyanato means two SCN groups. So maybe the blue color is the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, which is the one with n=2, so β2=40. But wait, the β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. Hmm, but I'm not sure. I'll have to think about how the complexes form.

The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. So all the Co species (free Co²+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-) sum up to 1e-2 M.

We need to find
