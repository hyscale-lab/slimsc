Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z. 

First, let's recap what I remember. The uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²), right? So in this case, A is P_z, so ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Wait, but wait, since P_z is an operator, I think we can just use ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). But wait, maybe I should double-check that. Oh yeah, right, that's correct.

So I need to compute both ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. But wait, wait, no, wait a second. Wait, because P_z is Hermitian, so its expectation value is just ⟨ψ|P_z|ψ⟩, and the square would be ⟨ψ|P_z²|ψ⟩. So yeah, that's right.

But wait, the state given is already an eigenstate of P_x. So I'm not in an eigenstate of P_z, which means there will be some uncertainty. The state is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write that down as a vector:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

I think the basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the matrix for P_z is diagonal, as given. Let me check the matrix for P_z: it's diag(ħ, 0, -ħ). So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. So the basis states are the eigenvectors of P_z, which are presumably the standard basis vectors, maybe like |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩, each corresponding to the eigenvalues. So the state ψ is expressed in this eigenbasis.

So to find the expectation values, I can compute them directly because the basis is in terms of P_z's eigenstates.

Wait, but how? Let me think. The expectation value of P_z is ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. Because P_z is diagonal in this basis, it's easy to compute. The matrix elements of P_z are (ħ, 0, 0) in first row, (0,0,0) in the second, and (0,0,-ħ) in the third. So when you apply P_z to |ψ⟩, it scales each component by the corresponding diagonal element.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ would be the sum of the components of ψ multiplied by the corresponding diagonal elements and then the conjugate. Wait, but ψ is given as a column vector. Let me write the components as ψ₁, ψ₂, ψ₃.

So ψ₁ is -1/2, ψ₂ is 1/sqrt(2), ψ₃ is -1/2.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = |ψ₁|² * (ħ) + |ψ₂|² * 0 + |ψ₃|² * (-ħ).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, because for a diagonal matrix, when you compute ψ† P_z ψ, each term is ψ_i^* * (P_z)_ii * ψ_i. But since the basis is orthonormal, and assuming ψ is normalized, which it should be, right? So let's check if ψ is normalized. The sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the components.

|ψ₁|² = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.
|ψ₂|² = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.
|ψ₃|² = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.
Sum is 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1/4 + 2/4 + 1/4) = 4/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ₁^* * ψ₁ * ħ + ψ₂^* * ψ₂ * 0 + ψ₃^* * ψ₃ * (-ħ).

But since all the ψ's are real, it's just (-1/2)^2 * ħ + (1/√2)^2 * 0 + (-1/2)^2 * (-ħ).

Wait, no, because ψ is a vector, and when you compute ψ† P_z ψ, each term is the product of the component, the eigenvalue, and the same component again. So for each component i, it's ψ_i * (P_z)_ii * ψ_i. So the first term is (-1/2)^2 * ħ, the second is (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0, and the third is (-1/2)^2 * (-ħ).

So let's compute each term:

First term: (1/4) * ħ → ħ/4.
Second term: (1/2) * 0 → 0.
Third term: (1/4) * (-ħ) → -ħ/4.

So sum is ħ/4 - ħ/4 = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. Hmm, interesting.

Now for ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared would be diag(ħ², 0, (ħ)^2?), wait no, (P_z)² is each diagonal element squared. So if P_z is diag(ħ, 0, -ħ), then (P_z)² is diag(ħ², 0, (ħ)^2). Wait, (-ħ)^2 is ħ², so yes.

So when you compute ⟨P_z²⟩, it's the sum of |ψ_i|^2 * (P_z)²_ii.

So let's compute each term:

First term: (1/4) * ħ² → ħ²/4.
Second term: (1/2) * 0 → 0.
Third term: (1/4) * ħ² → ħ²/4.

So sum is ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = (2ħ²/4) = ħ²/2.

So now, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) → sqrt( (ħ²/2) - 0^2 ) = sqrt(ħ²/2) → (ħ)/sqrt(2).

Wait, looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which would be the answer.

But wait a second, let me double-check my computations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in signs or terms.

Wait, when I computed ⟨P_z⟩, it was (1/4)ħ - (1/4)ħ, so indeed zero.

⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/4)ħ² + (1/4)ħ² = 2*(1/4) ħ² = 1/2 ħ². So yes, that's correct.

So ΔP_z is sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) ) = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix $P_z$ is diagonal with elements $\hbar, 0, -\hbar$ along the diagonal. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi_1^* \cdot \hbar \cdot \psi_1 + \psi_2^* \cdot 0 \cdot \psi_2 + \psi_3^* \cdot (-\hbar) \cdot \psi_3.
\]

Substituting the components of $\psi$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is also diagonal with elements $\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2$ along the diagonal. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi_1^* \cdot \hbar^2 \cdot \psi_1 + \psi_2^* \cdot 0 \cdot \psi_2 + \psi_3^* \cdot \hbar^2 \cdot \psi_3.
\]

Substituting the components of $\psi$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
