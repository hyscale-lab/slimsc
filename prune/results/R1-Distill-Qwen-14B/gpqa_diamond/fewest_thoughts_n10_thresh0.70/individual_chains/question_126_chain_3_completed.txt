Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question involves two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II, each producing some products. Then, these products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and chiral stationary phase. The question is about the number of peaks observed in each case.

Let me start by understanding each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the starting material is a ketone. Hexan-3-one means the ketone is on carbon 3. And there's a methoxy group on carbon 5.

So, when LAH reduces the ketone, the carbonyl group (C=O) becomes a CH-OH group. Wait, LAH typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the product after LAH would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, what about the configuration? The starting material is an S configuration. When you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the stereochemistry at that carbon depends on whether the starting material was a chiral center.

In (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, carbon 3 is the carbonyl carbon. So, carbonyl carbon isn't a chiral center because it's double bonded. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one is: CH2CH2-CO-OCH3? Wait, no. Let's draw it.

Hexan-3-one is CH3CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait no, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, hexane has six carbons. So 3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, more accurately, it's CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, perhaps I should number from the other end. Oh wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CH2-CO-CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me think. The formula is C6H11O. The structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? No, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? Or perhaps another arrangement. Wait, hexan-3-one is actually CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? So the carbonyl is at position 3.

So, the structure is: 

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, that's six carbons. Wait, position 1 is CH3, position 2 is CH2, position 3 is C(O), then position 4 is CH2, position 5 is CH2, position 6 is CH3? No, wait, maybe it's:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C(O)-

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3

Wait, that's not six carbons. Wait, perhaps it's:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C(O)-

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, that's actually 6 carbons. So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, that can't be right because that would make the carbonyl at position 3, but the substituents would be CH2CH2 on one side and CH2CH2CH3 on the other. Hmm.

But wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the carbonyl is on carbon 3, and carbon 5 has a methoxy group.

So, position 5 is CH2-OCH3? Because hexan-3-one is:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C(O)-

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)-

6: CH2CH3?

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write the full structure.

The compound is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

Hexan-3-one: the carbonyl is on C3.

So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3?

Wait, no, wait. Let me count. Hexan-3-one would have the carbonyl on C3. So:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C(O)-

4: CH2-

5: CH2-

6: CH3

Wait, that's hexan-3-one, but in the problem, it's 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the 5th carbon has a methoxy group. So, carbon 5 is CH2-OCH3?

Wait, maybe the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3?

No, wait, wait. Let me think. Hexane has six carbons. So, numbering from left to right, the carbonyl is at position 3.

So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, that's seven carbons. Wait, no, hexan-3-one has a carbonyl at position 3, so the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to think about the structure as:

The carbonyl is at position 3. So, the molecule is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? But that's six carbons only if the carbonyl is in the middle.

Wait, hexan-3-one: the formula is C6H10O. Structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that would be:

CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's only six carbons in total. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. So the carbonyl is at position 3.

Now, the 5-methoxy group would be on the fifth carbon. Let's number from the left.

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C(O)-

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-OCH3-

Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, but that would place the OCH3 on carbon 5, which is a CH2 group. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3. Hmm, okay.

So, when LAH is used to reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol. LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the product would be 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, but the configuration of the alcohol will be determined by the starting material.

Wait, the starting material's configuration is S. So, the starting compound is an S enantiomer. When it's reduced, the configuration at the new chiral center (the former carbonyl carbon) will depend on the reaction's stereochemistry.

Wait, wait. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The carbonyl is at C3, which is not a chiral center because it's double-bonded. So, when the ketone is reduced to an alcohol, the C3 becomes a chiral center. So, the product would be (R) or (S) configuration, depending on the starting material.

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically gives retention of configuration when reducing ketones to alcohols. Because when the carbonyl is attacked by the hydride, the hydride comes from the same face, leading to a specific configuration.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think: in the ketone, the carbonyl is planar. LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) typically does a nucleophilic attack from the less hindered side. Wait, but in the case of a chiral ketone, the existing configuration could influence the attack.

Wait, in this case, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. Does that affect the reduction at C3? I don't think so, because the C5 is a different chiral center.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the molecule has a chiral center at C5 (since it has four different groups: a methoxy, two CH2 groups, and a CH2-C(O)- group). When we reduce the ketone at C3 to an alcohol, the C3 becomes a new chiral center. So, the product will have two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

So, the product of Reaction I is (R or S configuration) at C3 and S at C5.

Wait, but how does the reduction affect the configuration at C3?

In the ketone, the carbonyl group is trigonal planar. When LAH reduces the ketone, the hydride ion (H-) attacks the carbonyl carbon from the less hindered side. The hydride comes in, and the oxygen then becomes an -OH group after acidic workup.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a chiral ketone. So, the existing chiral center at C5 could influence the approach of the hydride.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction proceeds with inversion or retention of configuration, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think the stereochemistry at C3 (the new chiral center) would be determined by the approach of the hydride. Since the starting material is S at C5, that might set up a certain spatial arrangement that affects where the hydride comes from.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is stereospecific but not stereoselective, leading to a racemic mixture. But LAH is a strong reducing agent and can cause some stereochemical changes.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a single enantiomer. So, when you reduce it, the product would have a specific configuration at C3, leading to a diastereomer or a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mechanism. The ketone is attacked by the hydride from the less hindered side. The starting material has a specific arrangement around C5, which could influence the approach of the hydride from the opposite side.

But honestly, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Maybe it's better to proceed and see if it matters for the rest of the problem.

So, moving on to Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3CO)CH2(CO)CH3. So, it's a diketone: two ketone groups on adjacent carbons.

When NaBH4 is used, which is a milder reducing agent, it typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. But in the case of a diketone, each ketone group can be reduced.

In pentane-2,4-dione, each of the two ketone groups (at C2 and C4) can be reduced. So, each would become a secondary alcohol.

But wait, NaBH4 is not as strong as LAH, but in this case, since it's a diketone, maybe two equivalents of NaBH4 would be needed.

Wait, the problem says excess NaBH4 is used, so both ketones would be fully reduced.

So, the product would be pentane-2,4-diol (assuming both ketones are fully reduced).

Wait, but wait: pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups on carbons 2 and 4. So, when both are reduced, the product would be HOCH2CH(OH)CH2OH?

Wait, no. Let me think: pentane-2,4-dione structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pentane has five carbons. So, the structure is: O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, no. Let me write it correctly.

Pentane-2,4-dione: the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, that can't be because that's six carbons. Wait, no, pentane has five carbons, so the structure is: O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? Hmm, that's five carbons? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So, the molecule is:

CH3-CO-CH2-CO-CH3. That is, two ketone groups on carbons 2 and 4, with CH2 in between. So, both ketones are at positions 2 and 4 of a five-carbon chain.

When NaBH4 is added, each ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol. So, the product would be CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So, both positions 2 and 4 become hydroxyl groups.

So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

Now, considering the stereochemistry: each hydroxyl group addition could create a chiral center if the carbon was not already a chiral center.

In pentane-2,4-dione, the carbons at positions 2 and 4 each have two carbonyl oxygens, a CH2 group, and a methyl group (I think that's the case). Wait, no, in pentane-2,4-dione, the carbonyl groups are on C2 and C4.

So, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, that's not possible because that's more than five carbons. Let me think again. No, correct structure is: 

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So, both carbonyl groups are on carbons 2 and 4, with CH2 in between. So, each of these carbonyls is attached to two CH2 groups, a methyl (CH3), and the carbonyl O.

Wait, but that would make each of these carbonyl carbons (C2 and C4) have two CH2 groups? No, each has:

C2: attached to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and two O's (from the ketone).

Wait, so each of the C2 and C4 is a carbonyl group. When they are reduced, each becomes a secondary alcohol.

So, the product is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. Each of the CH(OH) groups is on a carbon that is connected to two CH2 groups and a methyl group. So, are these carbons chiral centers?

Each of the C2 and C4 in the product is connected to:

- CH3 (from C1 or C5),

- Two CH2 groups,

- And the OH group.

Wait, but wait: for a carbon to be chiral, it needs four different substituents.

In the product, each of the OH-bearing carbons has:

- CH3 (from the adjacent carbon),

- Two CH2 groups (which are same),

- And the OH.

Wait, so each OH-bearing carbon has the following substituents:

- CH3 group,

- Two CH2 groups (same),

- OH.

So, two substituents are same (the two CH2 groups are identical), so the carbon is not a chiral center. Thus, 2,4-pentanediol is actually a meso compound because it has two identical stereocenters that are mirror images of each other. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

So, when NaBH4 reduces the diketone, the product is a meso compound, meaning it's achiral. So, Reaction II gives a single product: 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound and thus not chiral.

Now, let's go back to Reaction I. The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The starting material was (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, and after reduction, the C3 becomes a new chiral center.

The configuration at C3 depends on the approach of the hydride during the reduction. Since the starting material is S at C5, how does that affect the configuration at C3?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about this as a single chiral center problem. The starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product will have a specific configuration at C3.

In the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon from the less hindered side. The existing groups around the carbonyl could influence where the hydride comes from.

But I'm not entirely confident about this part. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is stereoselective, leading to a specific configuration.

Assuming that the reaction proceeds with inversion, or perhaps it's racemic. Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product should also be a single enantiomer.

Wait, no, because the starting material's configuration is at C5, not at C3. So, the attack on C3 by the hydride would be influenced by the groups around C3, including the C5's configuration.

Hmm. It's possible that the configuration at C5 would influence the approach of the hydride, leading to a specific configuration at C3. So, the product would be a single enantiomer, giving a chiral alcohol.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's proceed. So, the product of Reaction I is a single enantiomer (a chiral molecule) because it has two chiral centers, C3 and C5.

Wait, no. Wait, the product after Reaction I is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The starting material was (S) configuration at C5. After reduction, the C3 becomes a new chiral center. So, the product has two chiral centers now: C3 and C5.

But wait, the C5 in the product is same as the starting material, right? Because the methoxy is still there, and the groups around it remain the same. So, C5 remains an S configuration. C3, which was not a chiral center before, becomes R or S.

So, the product now has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

But wait, the question is how many peaks are observed in the HPLC columns after combining the products from both reactions.

So, let's look at the products:

Reaction I gives one product: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two chiral centers, making it a diastereomer if any.

Reaction II gives a single product: 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, hence not chiral.

Wait, wait. No, 2,4-pentanediol is a meso compound, so it's a single compound, not chiral, so it won't show peaks in the chiral HPLC column. Let me think about that.

So, when the two products are combined:

From Reaction I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (with two chiral centers, so it's a chiral molecule).

From Reaction II: 2,4-pentanediol (a meso compound, so it's not chiral).

So, what happens when we run these on HPLC columns?

First, normal-phase HPLC separates based on polarity. So, it would separate compounds based on their polarity, regardless of chirality. So, if both products are different in polarity, they would elute at different times, but if they are similar, they might elute together.

But wait, Reaction I gives one product, and Reaction II gives another. Each is a distinct compound. So, on normal-phase HPLC, each would be a separate peak, right?

Wait, but wait, the normal-phase column (like silica) has a polar stationary phase. It separates based on the polarity of the compounds. So, if two compounds are present and they are different, they would have different retention times, leading to two peaks.

But wait, the products from each reaction are:

- 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (which is a diastereomer, but as a single enantiomer? Or maybe it's a racemic mixture?)

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. Reaction I starts with (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. When reduced with LAH, which is a strong reducing agent, the product would be the (R) or (S) configuration at C3. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would be a single diastereomer, not a racemic mixture.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is (S) configuration at C5, and the reduction is at C3. So, the product would have a new chiral center at C3 with a specific configuration, making it a single enantiomer. Because the hydride attack would be influenced by the existing configuration, perhaps leading to a specific diastereomer.

Wait, but perhaps the product is a single enantiomer, so it's one compound. So, the product is a single compound, meaning it's a single peak on normal-phase HPLC.

Reaction II's product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a single meso compound, so it's another single compound. Thus, when combined, there are two compounds, leading to two peaks on normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, but let me think again. Wait, no. The product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, so it's a single compound. The product from Reaction II is a single compound (meso). So, when combined, there are two different compounds. So, in normal-phase HPLC, they would elute as two separate peaks.

But wait, what about the possibility of diastereomers? Let me think. The product from Reaction I is a diastereomer with two chiral centers, but it's a single enantiomer. So, it's a single compound. So, on normal-phase HPLC, it would be one peak. The product from Reaction II is a meso compound, a single compound, so another peak. So, normal-phase would show two peaks.

But wait, the question is about the combined products. Let me double-check.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → reduced to 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It has two chiral centers (assuming the reduction leads to a new chiral center, making it a diastereomer).

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → reduced to 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, so not chiral.

So, the products are:

1. 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (single compound, since it's a single enantiomer).

2. 2,4-pentanediol (single compound, meso).

So, combining both, there are two distinct compounds.

Therefore, on normal-phase HPLC, which separates based on polarity, each compound would elute as a separate peak. So, two peaks.

Wait, but what about the possibility of diastereomers or enantiomers? Let's think: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is a diastereomer if there were another form, but in this case, it's a single product.

Wait, no. Reaction I gives a single product: the reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one to 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two chiral centers, but as a single enantiomer. So, it's one compound.

So, in normal-phase HPLC, two compounds → two peaks.

Now, for the chiral HPLC column. Chiral columns separate enantiomers.

The product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer (since it's a single diastereomer?), or is it a racemic mixture?

Wait, no. The starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product of the reduction would be a single enantiomer as well, assuming the reduction is stereoselective. So, in this case, the product of Reaction I is a single chiral molecule, which is a diastereomer but not a meso compound.

So, on a chiral HPLC column, if the molecule is chiral, it will have two peaks (enantiomers), but here it's a single enantiomer, so only one peak.

Wait, but if the compound is a single enantiomer, then on a chiral column, it will have one peak. Because the column can't distinguish between enantiomers if the mobile phase isn't chiral, but wait, no. Wait, no, chiral columns are designed to separate enantiomers. So, if the molecule is chiral, you can get two peaks (if both enantiomers are present), but in this case, it's a single enantiomer, so you get one peak.

Wait, no. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Chiral HPLC columns are used to separate enantiomers. So, if the compound in the mixture is a racemic mixture, you'll get two peaks. If it's a single enantiomer, you'll get one peak. If the compound is achiral, no peak (doesn't interact) or maybe it just passes through.

So, Reaction I's product is a single chiral molecule (single enantiomer), so on chiral HPLC, it would give one peak.

Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is achiral. So, on chiral HPLC, it would not elute as a peak because it doesn't have a chiral center to interact with the stationary phase. Alternatively, maybe it would elute as a single peak if it's polar, but I think for the purpose of the question, a meso compound (achiral) would not show up on a chiral column in a way that causes a peak.

Wait, but the column is chiral stationary phase. If the compound is achiral, it will not interact with the stationary phase in a way that causes separation, so it might elute quickly, but it's probably considered to not produce a peak, or maybe it's considered as a single peak but not because of chirality.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the total products.

So, the combined products are:

1. 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (single enantiomer, chiral).

2. 2,4-pentanediol (meso, achiral).

Now, on a normal-phase HPLC, both are polar compounds, but they are different, so two peaks.

On a chiral HPLC, the 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol would produce one peak (since it's a single enantiomer), and the 2,4-pentanediol would not produce any peak because it's achiral. So, total peaks on chiral HPLC: one.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the products are combined and run on both columns. So, for the normal-phase, two compounds → two peaks.

For the chiral column: only one compound (the chiral one) would produce a peak. So, one peak.

But wait, the answer options don't have that. Let's look at the options.

Options:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC.

Hmm, none of the options match my current understanding. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong in considering the product of Reaction I as a single enantiomer. Let me rethink that.

In Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → reduced to 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

The starting material is a single enantiomer (S configuration at C5). When the ketone is reduced, a new chiral center is formed at C3.

The reduction could lead to either R or S configuration at C3. But whether it's R or S depends on the approach of the hydride.

Wait, perhaps the configuration at C5 (S) affects the approach of the hydride to C3. So, the product would have a specific configuration at C3, making it a single enantiomer.

So, the product would have two chiral centers: C3 and C5, but as a single diastereomer.

Wait, but the question is about the number of peaks on the chiral HPLC. Since the product is a diastereomer (two chiral centers), but as a single enantiomer, how would it behave on a chiral column?

Wait, no, wait. Chiral columns are designed to separate enantiomers. Diastereomers would elute at different times on a chiral column because their interaction with the stationary phase is different. But wait, no, chiral columns are for enantiomers. Diastereomers would have different physical properties and would separate on any column, including normal-phase, regardless of chirality.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let's think about the product.

Product from Reaction I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It has two chiral centers: C3 and C5. The C5 is S, and C3 is either R or S. So, is this molecule chiral? Yes, because it has two chiral centers. So, it's a diastereomer, but as a single enantiomer, it is one compound.

So, when run on a chiral column, which is designed to separate enantiomers, this compound would be a single enantiomer, so it would elute as a single peak.

But wait, if the molecule has two chiral centers, and is a single enantiomer, would it have any other stereoisomers? For example, if there's another stereoisomer possible, but if the reaction only produces one, then the product is a single stereoisomer.

Wait, no, the product is a single stereoisomer. So, on a chiral HPLC, it would elute as one peak.

So, in the combined products, you have two compounds: one chiral (from Reaction I) and one achiral (from Reaction II).

So, on normal-phase HPLC, two peaks (each compound is a separate peak).

On chiral HPLC, only the chiral compound would produce a peak, so one peak.

But again, looking at the options, none of them have 1 and 2. So, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture. No, that's not possible because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction under specific conditions (LAH) would proceed with some stereoselectivity, leading to a single enantiomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Let me think about the structure again.

5-methoxyhexan-3-ol has the structure: 

(CH3)CH2-C(OH)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, no, the structure is more accurately:

HO-CH2-C(OH)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

Wait, I'm going back to the structure:

Starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. After reduction, it becomes (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(OH)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me see:

If the molecule is symmetric around the C3-C4 bond, then it would be a meso compound. But with the methoxy at C5, which is in a specific position, perhaps not.

Wait, for a molecule to be meso, it must have two or more chiral centers, and an internal plane of symmetry that makes the molecule achiral.

In this case, the product has two chiral centers (C3 and C5). Let's imagine the structure:

At C3: -OH, CH2-CH2-CH3 (or similar groups), and perhaps the groups are arranged such that there's a plane of symmetry.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a meso compound, making it achiral.

Wait, if that's the case, then the product from Reaction I would be achiral, and the product from Reaction II is also achiral. Then, both are achiral, leading to two peaks on normal-phase and none on chiral.

But the options don't have that either.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the products again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → reduced to 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

If the product is a meso compound, then it's not chiral.

But for that, it would need a plane of symmetry. So, let me imagine the structure:

HO-CH2-C-O-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a plane of symmetry through the C3 and C5, making it a meso compound.

Wait, but I'm not sure. If the product is a meso compound, then it's achiral, and would not show up on a chiral column.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach.

Looking at the answer options, perhaps the correct answer is B) 3 in chiral, 2 in normal.

But how?

Wait, perhaps Reaction I gives two products. Wait, but I thought it gives a single product.

Wait, another possibility: the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture.

No, that can't be, because the starting material is a single enantiomer. So, the product would not be racemic.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a diastereomer, which itself is a pair of enantiomers. Or perhaps it's a new chiral center that leads to two possible configurations, but the starting material's configuration ensures only one forms.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that Reaction I's product is a single enantiomer. Maybe it's a diastereomer with two chiral centers, leading to multiple possibilities.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of stereoisomers for each product.

Product I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It has two chiral centers, so potentially four stereoisomers (2^2=4). But the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would have two chiral centers, but only two possible stereoisomers, but perhaps only one is formed.

Wait, no, the product from Reaction I is based on the starting material which is a single enantiomer.

Wait, but perhaps the product could have two diastereomers, each of which could have two enantiomers, but under the reaction conditions, only one is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, leading to only one compound, thus one peak on normal-phase and one on chiral.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the answer options again.

The options suggest that the chiral column gives more peaks than the normal-phase. So, perhaps the products have multiple chiral centers leading to multiple peaks.

Another approach: let's count the possible chiral centers and see.

Reaction I product: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

It has two chiral centers (C3 and C5), each with possible R/S configurations.

But the starting material is (S) at C5, and upon reduction, C3 becomes a new chiral center. So, the product has two chiral centers, but as a single diastereomer.

Wait, so when you have two chiral centers, and it's a single diastereomer, it's a single compound, so one peak on normal-phase and one on chiral.

Reaction II product: 2,4-pentanediol (meso), so one compound, one peak on normal-phase.

So, total products: two compounds, so two peaks on normal-phase.

Chiral HPLC: only the product from Reaction I is chiral, so one peak.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in Reaction I's product.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product is a racemic mixture, but that doesn't make sense because the starting material is a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a new chiral center, but the existing C5 is still S. So, the product would have two chiral centers, but the molecule is not meso.

So, the product would have two chiral centers, but is a single diastereomer. So, it would be a single compound, leading to one peak on normal-phase and one on chiral.

But let's think about the chiral HPLC again. The product from Reaction I is a single chiral molecule, so it would elute as a single peak. The product from Reaction II is achiral, so no peak on chiral HPLC.

So, total peaks: normal-phase → 2, chiral → 1.

But none of the options match. So I'm either missing something or made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer that has two enantiomers. No, that can't be because the product is a single diastereomer.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, and the product from Reaction II is a meso compound, but when combined, they have more than two compounds.

No, each reaction gives a single product.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I has more than one stereoisomer.

Wait, no. Reaction I starts with a single enantiomer and gives a single product. So, the product has two chiral centers, but as a single diastereomer, so one compound.

Thus, on normal-phase, two peaks.

On chiral column, one peak.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is not a meso compound, but it's a chiral molecule with two chiral centers, leading to four possible stereoisomers. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, it would give a single stereoisomer.

Thus, on normal-phase, two peaks, and on chiral, one.

But the options don't match. So perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps Reaction II's product is not a meso compound.

Wait, Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione reduced with NaBH4. The product is 2,4-pentanediol.

Let me think about the structure.

Pentane-2,4-dione is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

After reduction, it becomes:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

This molecule has two OH groups on C2 and C4.

Each of these OH groups is attached to a carbon that has:

- Two CH2 groups (same),

- A CH3 group,

- An OH group.

So, each of these carbons has four substituents: CH3, two CH2 groups, and OH.

Wait, but for a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different groups.

In this case, each OH-bearing carbon has:

- CH3,

- two CH2 groups (same),

- OH.

So, two substituents are the same (the two CH2 groups), meaning that these carbons are not chiral. Thus, 2,4-pentanediol is a meso compound because it has two identical stereocenters arranged symmetrically, making the molecule achiral.

So, Reaction II's product is a single meso compound, meaning it's a single compound and not chiral.

So, when combined, the products are:

1. 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral, single compound).

2. 2,4-pentanediol (achiral, single compound).

Thus, on normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, only the chiral compound would produce a peak, so one peak.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of Reaction I's product.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product is a meso compound.

Wait, for 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, perhaps it has a plane of symmetry.

If the molecule is symmetric, it would be a meso compound, making it achiral.

But in that case, it would not produce a peak on the chiral column.

So, if both Reaction I and Reaction II's products are achiral, then on chiral HPLC, no peaks, and on normal-phase, two peaks.

But the options don't have this either.

Hmm. Another angle: perhaps Reaction I's product is a diastereomer, and it's a pair of enantiomers, but that would require the product to be racemic, which it's not, as the starting material is a single enantiomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, and the product from Reaction II is a meso compound. So, when combined, they have two compounds: one chiral and one achiral.

Thus, on normal-phase: two peaks.

On chiral: one peak.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the chiral centers in Reaction I's product.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is not chiral. Let me think again.

The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Structure:

HO-CH2-C-O-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(OH)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is:

CH2-CH2-C(OH) - CH(OCH3) - CH2-CH3.

Wait, I'm not getting the correct structure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a secondary alcohol with a single chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me think: the starting material is a ketone at C3. Upon reduction, the C3 becomes a secondary alcohol. Is C3 a chiral center?

Yes, because after reduction, C3 will have four different groups: the OH group, the adjacent carbonyl (now alcohol), and two different substituents from the adjacent carbons.

Wait, no. Let me think: the structure after reduction is:

CH2-CH2-C(OH)H-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but for C3 to be a chiral center, it must have four different substituents.

So, the groups attached to C3 would be:

- CH2-CH2 (from C2),

- OH,

- CH(OCH3) (from C4),

- CH2-CH3 (from C5? Wait, perhaps not. Let me structure it correctly.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CHOH-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that would make C3 have:

- CH2-CH2 group,

- OH,

- CH(OCH3) group,

- CH2-CH3 group.

Wait, but that's four different substituents. So, C3 is a chiral center.

C5 also has a methoxy group, but is it a chiral center?

In the starting material, C5 is a chiral center because it's attached to a methoxy, two CH2 groups, and a CH(OH) group.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, C5 has four different groups: two CH2 groups (from the chain), a methoxy, and a carbonyl group (through the C3 ketone). So, yes, it's a chiral center.

After reduction, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which will have:

- C3: OH, CH2-CH2, CH(OCH3), and CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(OH)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's six carbons. So, C1: CH3, C2: CH2, C3: C(OH), C4: CH(OCH3), C5: CH2, C6: CH3?

No, perhaps not. Alternatively, the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that's not right because the alcohol is at C3.

Wait, perhaps it's:

CH2-CH2-C(OH)H-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, C3 has:

- CH2-CH2 (from C2),

- OH,

- CH(OCH3) (from C4),

- CH2-CH3 (from C5 and C6).

Wait, I'm not seeing it clearly. Alternatively, perhaps C3 has four different substituents: CH2-CH2, OH, CH(OCH3), and CH2-CH2-CH3.

If that's the case, then C3 is chiral. C5 has a methoxy group, and perhaps it's also a chiral center.

Wait, no, after reduction, C5 hasn't changed. So, C5 is still attached to a methoxy group and other groups, so it remains a chiral center.

Thus, the product has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

But whether the molecule is chiral depends on whether it's a meso compound.

If the molecule is symmetric, it could be a meso compound. Let me imagine the structure:

If the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C3 and C5, making the two chiral centers mirror images, then it would be a meso compound and hence achiral.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the substituents.

At C3: groups are CH2-CH2, OH, CH(OCH3), and CH2-CH2-CH3.

At C5: groups are CH(OCH3), CH2-CH3, and two CH2 groups (maybe?).

Wait, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetric, so it's not a meso compound. Thus, the product is chiral and has two chiral centers.

If that's the case, then on a chiral column, it would produce two peaks (for the two enantiomers), but since the product is a single enantiomer, it would produce one peak.

But this line of thinking isn't leading me to the options provided.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces more than one product.

Wait, no. Reaction I is a reduction, which should produce a single product. Reaction II produces a single product.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the answer options again.

Option B says 3 peaks on chiral and 2 on normal.

How could that happen? If Reaction I's product is a pair of enantiomers (racemic) and Reaction II's product is a meso compound.

But Reaction I's product is a single enantiomer, not racemic.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I's product is a diastereomer, but I'm not sure.

Another possibility: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer with multiple stereocenters, leading to multiple peaks on the chiral column.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think differently.

Assuming that the product from Reaction I is a single chiral molecule, and the product from Reaction II is a single meso compound.

So, when combined, there are two compounds: one chiral, one achiral.

On normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

On chiral HPLC: only the chiral compound would produce a peak, so one peak.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a meso compound, making it achiral, and the product from Reaction II is also achiral. Thus, on chiral HPLC, no peaks. On normal-phase, two peaks.

But I don't see an option that matches this.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I's product is a diastereomer, leading to two peaks on normal-phase and two on chiral.

But I'm not seeing this clearly.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong in considering that the product from Reaction I is a single compound. Maybe the product is a pair of enantiomers, leading to two peaks on normal-phase and two on chiral.

But I don't think that's the case because the starting material is a single enantiomer and the reaction is stereoselective.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture. But that would require the reaction to proceed without any stereoselectivity, which is unlikely with LAH.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about the answer options.

Option B says 3 peaks on chiral and 2 on normal.

How could that happen?

Maybe Reaction I's product is a pair of enantiomers, and Reaction II's product is a meso compound.

So, in Reaction I, two enantiomers are formed (racemic), and Reaction II gives a meso compound, which is one compound.

So, total products: three compounds.

Wait, no. Reaction I would give two enantiomers (racemic), but that's a single product.

Wait, but if Reaction I's product is racemic, it would produce two peaks on normal-phase (but they are enantiomers, which have the same polarity, so would elute together as one peak on normal-phase? Or would they elute as two peaks? No, on normal-phase, enantiomers have the same physical properties except for chirality, so they would elute together as a single peak.

Wait, that's an important point. On normal-phase HPLC, enantiomers have the same retention time because they have the same physical properties. So, if Reaction I's product is a racemic mixture, it would appear as a single peak on normal-phase.

But I thought Reaction I's product is a single enantiomer, not racemic.

So, putting it all together:

If Reaction I's product is a single enantiomer, and Reaction II's product is a meso compound.

On normal-phase: two peaks.

On chiral: one peak (from Reaction I) + none from Reaction II.

So, total peaks: 1 on chiral, 2 on normal.

But options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I has two chiral centers, leading to four possible stereoisomers, but only two are formed.

But I don't think that's the case.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should go with the initial analysis and choose the option that fits, even if it's not matching exactly.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 peaks on chiral and 2 on normal.

But I can't figure out how that would happen.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Reaction I's product is a single compound with two chiral centers, which would be a diastereomer. So, when run on a chiral column, it would split into two peaks (if the column can separate the diastereomers). But that's not how chiral columns work. Chiral columns are for enantiomers, not diastereomers.

Wait, no, diastereomers are separated on normal-phase columns, not chiral columns. So, on a chiral column, only enantiomers would split.

Thus, the product from Reaction I (single diastereomer) would be one peak on normal-phase and one on chiral.

Reaction II's product is a meso compound, so one peak on normal-phase.

So, normal-phase: two peaks, chiral: one peak.

But the options don't have this.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude and choose the option that best fits, which would be option B: 3 peaks on chiral and 2 on normal.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single chiral molecule, and Reaction II's product is a diastereomer, leading to more peaks.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: how many stereoisomers are possible in each product.

Reaction I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Two chiral centers: C3 and C5, each can be R or S.

So, four possible stereoisomers.

But if the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have a specific configuration, leading to a single stereoisomer.

Thus, Reaction I's product is a single stereoisomer, leading to one peak on normal-phase.

Reaction II's product is a meso compound, one peak on normal-phase.

So, total peaks on normal-phase: two.

On chiral: only the product from Reaction I is chiral, so one peak.

But again, the options don't match.

I think I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 peaks on chiral and 2 on normal.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not confident.


The problem involves analyzing the products of two reactions and determining the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms when the products are combined and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and a chiral stationary phase HPLC column.

### Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH
- **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which has a ketone group at C3 and a methoxy group at C5. The starting material is a single enantiomer with an S configuration at C5.
- **Reaction**: LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol, forming 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. This introduces a new chiral center at C3, in addition to the existing chiral center at C5. The product is a single enantiomer due to the stereoselectivity of the reduction.
- **Product**: A single chiral compound with two chiral centers (C3 and C5). This compound is not a meso compound because it lacks an internal plane of symmetry.

### Reaction II: Reduction of pentane-2,4-dione with NaBH4
- **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione, a diketone with ketone groups at C2 and C4.
- **Reaction**: NaBH4 reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming 2,4-pentanediol. The product is a meso compound because it has two identical stereocenters (C2 and C4) that are mirror images of each other, resulting in an achiral molecule.

### Combined Products
1. **From Reaction I**: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral, single enantiomer).
2. **From Reaction II**: 2,4-pentanediol (meso compound, achiral).

### Analysis of HPLC Results
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:
   - Separates compounds based on polarity.
   - The two products (5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and 2,4-pentanediol) are distinct compounds with different polarities.
   - **Expected Peaks**: 2 peaks (one for each compound).

2. **Chiral HPLC**:
   - Separates enantiomers. A meso compound (2,4-pentanediol) is achiral and will not interact with the chiral stationary phase, resulting in no peak.
   - The product from Reaction I (5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) is chiral and will elute as a single peak because it is a single enantiomer.
   - **Expected Peaks**: 1 peak (from 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol).

### Evaluation of Answer Options
- **Option A**: 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.  
  - Incorrect. Only two products are formed, so this option overestimates the number of peaks.
- **Option B**: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.  
  - Incorrect. Only one peak is expected on the chiral HPLC, not three.
- **Option C**: 4 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.  
  - Incorrect. Only one peak is expected on the chiral HPLC, not four.
- **Option D**: 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC.  
  - Incorrect. Only two peaks are expected on the normal-phase HPLC, not three.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is not explicitly listed in the options. Based on the analysis, the expected results are:
- **Normal-Phase HPLC**: 2 peaks.
- **Chiral HPLC**: 1 peak.

However, if forced to choose the closest option, **Option B** (3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC) is selected, despite being inconsistent with the reasoning.

ANSWER: B
