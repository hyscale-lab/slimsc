Okay, so I have this problem about a metric and I need to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit unusual. So, first, I should probably figure out what kind of geometry this metric represents. Pseudospheres are usually associated with negative curvature, right?

So, the general form of a metric in 2D can be written as ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²), which suggests it's conformally flat. Conformal metrics are like scaling the Euclidean metric by some factor. Here, the scaling factor is 32 divided by (4 - x² - y²). 

Wait, 32 is a constant, and the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Let me think about the denominator. If I set 4 - x² - y² = r², then maybe it's something like a sphere? But wait, in a sphere, the denominator might be (a² - x² - y²), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering this might be a hyperbolic space because of the negative curvature? Wait, no, maybe it's a sphere of some kind.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere. Oh wait, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. So perhaps this metric represents a pseudosphere. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sphere because the metric looks similar to the metric for a sphere.

Wait, the metric for a 2D sphere of radius a is usually written as ds² = a² (dx² + dy²)/(x² + y²), but that's in polar coordinates where x² + y² = r². Hmm, no, wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Or perhaps I'm confusing it with something else.

Wait, another thought: The metric given might be similar to the metric of a sphere embedded in 3D, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the metric of a hyperbolic plane, which has negative curvature.

Wait, let's try to find the Gaussian curvature of this metric because the area of a sphere is related to its curvature. The Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = f(x,y)(dx² + dy²) is given by K = - (1/(2f)) * Laplacian of ln(f), I think. Alternatively, maybe I should look up the formula for Gaussian curvature for a conformal metric.

Alternatively, I remember that for a metric ds² = e^{2λ(x,y)}(dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature K is -e^{-2λ} [ (d²λ/dx²) + (d²λ/dy²) ) ].

Wait, so in this case, f(x,y) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So λ would be ln(32/(4 - x² - y²)).

Wait, so let's compute λ. λ = ln(32) - ln(4 - x² - y²). Hmm.

Then, the Laplacian of λ is the sum of the second derivatives with respect to x and y.

So first, compute the first derivatives. Let me think: dλ/dx = [ (0) - ( -2x )/(4 - x² - y²) ) ] * 1/(32/(4 - ... ))? Wait, no, wait. Since λ is ln(32) - ln(4 - x² - y²), the derivative with respect to x is [ derivative of ln(4 - x² - y²) ] multiplied by -1. So:

dλ/dx = [ ( -2x ) / (4 - x² - y²) ) ] * (-1) = 2x/(4 - x² - y²)

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute correctly. The derivative of ln(4 - x² - y²) is [ ( -2x ) / (4 - x² - y²) ].

So since λ = ln(32) - ln(4 - x² - y²), then dλ/dx = 0 - [ (-2x)/(4 - x² - y²) ) ] = 2x/(4 - x² - y²).

Similarly, dλ/dy = 2y/(4 - x² - y²).

Now, the second derivatives. Let's compute d²λ/dx².

d²λ/dx² = [ 2*(4 - x² - y²) - 2x*( -2x ) ] / (4 - x² - y²)^2 

Wait, using the quotient rule: derivative of (2x)/(denominator) is [2*(denominator) - 2x*(derivative of denominator) ] / denominator squared.

Denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So derivative of denominator w.r. x is -2x.

So, numerator is 2*(4 - x² - y²) - 2x*(-2x) = 2(4 - x² - y²) +4x² = 8 - 2x² - 2y² +4x² = 8 +2x² -2y².

So, d²λ/dx² = (8 + 2x² - 2y²) / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Similarly, d²λ/dy² is the same but with y terms.

d²λ/dy² = [ 2*(4 - x² - y²) - 2y*( -2y ) ] / (denominator)^2.

Which would be 2*(4 - x² - y²) +4y² = 8 - 2x² -2y² +4y² = 8 -2x² +2y².

So sum of the second derivatives is [ (8+2x² -2y²) + (8 -2x² +2y²) ] / denominator squared.

Adding those together: 8 +8=16, 2x²-2x²=0, -2y²+2y²=0. So sum is 16 / (denominator)^2.

Wait, denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So denominator squared is (4 - x² - y²)^2.

So Laplacian of λ is 16/(4 - x² - y²)^2.

Now, the Gaussian curvature K is given by -e^{-2λ} * (Laplacian of λ). Because in the formula, K = -e^{-2λ} [ Laplacian of λ ].

Wait, let's plug in λ. λ= ln(32/(4 - x² - y²))= ln(32) - ln(4 - x² - y²).

So e^{2λ} = e^{2 ln(32)} * e^{-2 ln(4 - x² - y²)}.

e^{2 ln a} = a², so e^{2λ}= (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

So e^{2λ}= 1024/(4 -x² - y²)^2.

Wait, so K = -e^{-2λ} * (16/(4 -x² - y²)^2 )

Wait, e^{-2λ} is 1/e^{2λ} which is (4 -x² -y²)^2 / 1024.

So K = - [ (4 -x² -y²)^2 / 1024 ] * (16/(4 -x² - y²)^2 )

Simplify this: the (4 -x² -y²)^2 terms cancel out. So K= - (16 / 1024 ) = - (1/64).

Hmm, so the Gaussian curvature is negative, which suggests that this is a hyperbolic geometry. Because Gaussian curvature is negative in hyperbolic spaces.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere. A pseudosphere is a surface in 3D with constant negative curvature, but perhaps here we're considering a 2D hyperbolic space embedded in some way.

Wait, the Gaussian curvature is K = -1/64. So it's a hyperbolic plane with curvature K = -1/64.

But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, what's the relation between the radius and the curvature?

In 2D hyperbolic geometry, the radius R is related to the curvature K by R² = -1/K. So R is the radius of curvature.

So R² = -1/K = 64. So R=8. So the radius of curvature is 8? But the question is asking for a pseudosphere of radius r=2.

Wait, perhaps my understanding is a bit off. Alternatively, in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle of radius r is π r² (1 - (r/R)^2 ), but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the metric given is for a pseudosphere of radius 2. Let me think about the metric for a pseudosphere. Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface, but in this problem, the metric is 2-dimensional, perhaps representing a 2D space with constant negative curvature.

Wait, another approach: the area of a sphere in 3D is 4πr². But a pseudosphere is a different kind of surface. Alternatively, perhaps it's the area of a surface with constant negative curvature, which would be a hyperbolic plane. Wait, but the hyperbolic plane is infinite, so its area is infinite. Oh, but the question says 'pseudosphere of radius r=2.' Maybe it refers to a finite area, like a portion of the hyperbolic plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents a 2-sphere, but with a different radius. Wait, but the curvature is negative, so I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's think about the metric again. ds² = [32 / (4 -x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me see what the domain of x and y is. The denominator 4 -x² - y² must be positive, so x² + y² <4. So the region is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So this metric covers a disk of radius 2. 

Wait a second, because if x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, making the metric blow up. So this is a metric on a disk of radius 2, which is like the Poincare disk model of hyperbolic geometry, perhaps. Because the Poincare disk model has a metric that becomes singular at the boundary radius R.

In the Poincare disk model, the metric is usually written as ds² = [ (2R)/(R² -x² - y²) ]² (dx² + dy²). Wait, let me confirm. Hmm, I think the Poincare disk model has curvature K = -1/R². So the metric is often written as ds² = (4 R²)/( (R² - x² - y²)^2 ) (dx² + dy²). 

But in our case, the metric is 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me compare. Let's factor 32 as 2^5. Hmm, 32 is 16*2. Wait, 4 is 2², so 4 -x² - y² = 2² - (x² + y²). 

Wait, perhaps the model is similar to the Poincare disk where R is 2. So R =2, then the metric would have a denominator (R² -x² - y²) = (4 -x² - y²). Then, the Poincare metric is (4 R² )/(denominator)^2, as I thought. So 4 R² is 4*(2)^2 =16. So denominator squared is (4 -x² - y²)^2, so 16/(denominator)^2 would make (4 R²)/(denominator)^2 = 16/(4 -x² -y²)^2.

But in our given metric, the coefficient is 32/(4 -x² - y²). So that's 32/(4 -x² -y²) = (32) / (4 - x² -y²) = 8 * [4/(4 - x² - y²)].

Wait, but in Poincare disk, the coefficient is 4 R² / (R² - x² - y²)^2. Which for R=2, it's 16/(4 - x² - y²)^2. But our metric is 32/(4 -x² - y²) = 32/(4 -x² -y²).

So it's not the same as the Poincare disk metric. Wait, perhaps it's a different model, like the Beltrami-Klein model, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the metric is similar to a sphere. Wait, the standard sphere metric in 2D is ds² = (R²/(x² + y²)) (dx² + dy²), but that's in polar coordinates, I think. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's better to consider spherical coordinates.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. So, if this metric represents a pseudosphere, what's its area?

Wait, area of a pseudosphere. Wait, in 3D, a pseudosphere has finite area. But perhaps in 2D, a hyperbolic space is infinite, but a pseudosphere might be a finite area surface. Wait, wait, no. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature in 3D, but it's a surface embedded in 3D space. But the metric given here is 2D, so perhaps it's a model of hyperbolic space.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere. Oh wait, perhaps the 'pseudosphere' here refers to the surface represented by the metric, which is a 2D surface with constant negative curvature. But if that's the case, then the area depends on the model.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let's think about the given metric again: it's ds² = [32/(4 -x² -y²)] (dx² + dy²), and the domain is x² + y² <4.

So it's a 2D space that's topologically a disk of radius 2. Now, the area of this space can be found by integrating the area element over the entire space.

The area element in 2D for a metric ds² = f(dx² + dy²) is dA = (1/f) dx dy. So here, dA = (4 -x² -y²)/32 dx dy.

So the total area would be the integral over x² + y² <4 of (4 -x² -y²)/32 dx dy.

Let me compute this integral. It's easier in polar coordinates. So let's switch to polar coordinates: x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then, dx dy = r dr dθ, and x² + y² = r².

So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [ (4 - r²)/32 ] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute that.

First, factor out constants.

A = (1/32) ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 (4 - r²) r dr.

Compute the θ integral first: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So, A = (2π /32) ∫0^2 (4r - r^3) dr.

Simplify 2π/32 to π/16.

Now compute the radial integral:

∫0^2 (4r - r^3) dr = [ 2r² - (r^4)/4 ] from 0 to 2.

At r=2: 2*(4) - (16)/4 = 8 -4 = 4.

At r=0: 0.

So the integral is 4.

So A = (π/16) *4 = π/4.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the area is π/4? But that's a very small area. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the area element is (4 - r²)/32 * r dr dθ.

Wait, the integral over r is ∫0^2 (4 - r²) r dr. Let me recompute this.

Expand (4 - r²)*r =4r - r^3.

Integral of 4r dr from 0 to 2 is 2*(4) =8.

Integral of r^3 dr is (r^4)/4 from 0 to 2 is (16)/4=4.

So ∫ (4r - r^3) dr from 0 to2= 8 -4=4.

So the area is (2π/32) *4 = (π/16)*4= π/4.

Hmm, that's 0.785... but that seems small. Did I make a mistake in the area element?

Wait, the area element is dA = (1/f) dx dy, where f is the coefficient of dx^2 in the metric. Wait, let me confirm.

The metric is ds²= f (dx² + dy²), so the area element is (1/f) dx dy. So here, f=32/(4 -x² -y²), so 1/f is (4 -x² -y²)/32.

So yes, that's correct. So the area is π/4.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C)4π(x² - y²)

D)+infinite

Wait, none of the options is π/4. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says, 'what is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?'. But in my calculation, the area is finite, π/4. But none of the options matches that. So perhaps I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, maybe I misread the metric. Let me check again. The metric is ds²= [32/(4 -x² -y²)] (dx² + dy²). So f=32/(4 -x² -y²). So 1/f is (4 -x² -y²)/32.

So area element is (4 -x² -y²)/32 dx dy.

Wait, but the integral over x² + y² <4 of (4 -x² - y²)/32 dx dy is π/4 as I found.

Hmm, but perhaps the question is about the entire pseudosphere, which in this model is the entire hyperbolic plane. But the hyperbolic plane has infinite area. Because when you integrate from r=0 to R=2 in the Poincare disk model, you get finite area, but the hyperbolic plane is the whole space, but in this case, the domain is x² + y² <4, so the area is finite.

Wait, but the question says 'pseudosphere of radius 2', perhaps it's referring to a surface with finite area, like a 2D surface with a boundary, so the area is finite.

But the options don't have π/4. So perhaps I messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let me re-do the integral.

The area element is (4 - r²)/32 * r dr dθ.

Integral from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π:

(1/32) ∫0^{2π} ∫0^2 (4r - r^3) dr dθ.

Compute the inner integral first:

∫0^2 (4r - r^3) dr = [2r² - (r^4)/4] from 0 to 2.

At r=2: 2*(4)=8, r^4=16, 16/4=4, so 8-4=4.

Multiply by ∫0^{2π} dθ=2π.

So 2pi *4=8pi.

Multiply by 1/32: 8pi/(32) = pi/4.

No, same result. So the area is pi/4.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, wait, perhaps the metric is that of a sphere with radius 2. Because when I computed the Gaussian curvature, I found K =-1/64, which is negative, implying hyperbolic space, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the metric represents a sphere, not a pseudosphere. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: calculate the Ricci scalar for a 2D manifold. For a 2D metric, the Ricci scalar is equal to the Gaussian curvature. So if the Gaussian curvature is positive, it's a sphere; negative, it's hyperbolic.

Earlier, I found K = -1/64, which is negative, so hyperbolic. So that's a pseudosphere? Or perhaps the metric is for a sphere embedded in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about curvature but about the area of the metric's space.

Wait, the metric given is for a space that looks like a hyperbolic disk of radius 2, but the area I computed is finite, π/4. But the options don't have that.

Looking back at the options:

A) 0 → area can't be zero unless the space is a point.

B)4π(x² + y²) → that's a function, not a number. The area should be a number, not dependent on x and y.

C)4π(x² - y²) → same problem.

D)+infinite → perhaps the area is infinite.

Wait, but earlier, I found the area as π/4, which is finite. So why would the area be infinite?

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the geometry. The given metric is defined for x² + y² <4, which is a finite region. So the area should be finite as well.

But the options don't have π/4. So perhaps the question is about a different measure, or perhaps the metric describes a pseudosphere with infinite area.

Wait, but the integral I did gives a finite area. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is that of a 4-dimensional sphere? No, the metric is in 2D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Gaussian curvature. Let me recalculate K.

We have:

λ = ln(32/(4 -x² -y²)) = ln(32) - ln(4 -x² -y²).

Then, first derivatives:

dλ/dx = (2x)/(4 -x² -y²).

dλ/dy = (2y)/(4 -x² -y²).

Second derivatives:

d²λ/dx² = [ 2*(4 -x² -y²) +4x² ] / (4 -x² -y²)^2.

Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me redo the calculation.

So for ∂²λ/∂x²:

The first derivative is (2x)/(4 -x² -y²).

Using quotient rule, the derivative is [2*(4 -x² -y²) + (2x)(2x) ] / (4 -x² -y²)^2.

Wait, no. Wait, the function is (2x)/(denominator). So f =2x, g=4 -x² -y².

df/dx =2, dg/dx= -2x.

So d²λ/dx² = [ (2)(4 -x² -y²) - (2x)(-2x) ] / (4 -x² -y²)^2.

Which is [ 8 -2x² -2y² +4x² ] / denominator².

Which simplifies to [8 +2x² -2y² ] / denominator².

Similarly, ∂²λ/∂y² is [8 -2x² +2y² ] / denominator squared.

Adding them together: (8+2x² -2y²) + (8 -2x² +2y²) ) =16.

So ∂²λ/∂x² + ∂²λ/∂y² = 16/(4 -x² -y²)^2.

Now, K = -e^{ -2λ } [ ∂²λ/∂x² + ∂²λ/∂y² ].

We have λ = ln(32/(4 -x² -y²)).

So e^{λ} = 32/(4 -x² -y²).

Then, e^{-2λ} = [ (4 -x² -y²) /32 ]^2.

So K = - [ (4 -x² -y²)^2 / 32^2 ] * [16/(4 -x² -y²)^2 ) ].

The (4 -x² -y²)^2 terms cancel.

So K= - [ 16 ] / (32^2 ) = -16/(1024) = -1/64.

So K is -1/64, as before. So the curvature is negative. So it's a hyperbolic space. So the area is finite as I calculated, π/4.

But the options don't match. So perhaps the area is infinite, but I'm not seeing why. Wait, maybe the metric actually covers an infinite space, but that doesn't make sense because the denominator is 4 -x² -y², which restricts x² + y² <4.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is that of a 4-dimensional sphere, but the question says 'pseudosphere', which is a 2D surface.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the area of a pseudosphere in this context is infinite. Because the pseudosphere in 3D has finite area, but perhaps in the metric given, it's a different kind of surface with infinite area.

Wait, but in 2D, the hyperbolic plane has infinite area, but the metric given is only defined over x² + y² <4, so it's a finite area.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. 

Wait, in the options, option D is +infinite. So perhaps the area is infinite. How could that be?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me compute it again.

The area is the integral of (4 -x² - y²)/32 dx dy over x² + y² <4.

Switching to polar coordinates:

A = ∫0^{2π} ∫0^2 [ (4 - r²)/32 ] * r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes (1/32) * ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 (4r - r^3) dr.

Compute ∫0^2 (4r - r^3) dr.

Integral of 4r is 2r² evaluated from 0 to2: 2*(4) =8.

Integral of r^3 is (r^4)/4 from 0 to2: (16)/4=4.

So ∫ (4r -r^3) dr=8 -4=4.

Multiply by ∫ dθ=2π: 4 *2π=8π.

Multiply by 1/32: 8π/32=π/4.

So the area is π/4, which is approximately 0.785. But the options don't include this.

Looking again at the options:

A) 0 → impossible.

B)4π(x² + y²) → no, depends on x and y.

C)4π(x² - y²) → same problem.

D)+infinite → No, area is finite.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that can't be, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the metric is not conformally flat as I thought. Wait, perhaps the area is not finite because the integration is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the space is a sphere with infinite area, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the metric represents a sphere with a different radius. Let me think about the sphere metric.

In 2D, the metric of a sphere of radius a is given in polar coordinates as ds²= a² (dθ² + sin²θ dφ² ), but in isothermal coordinates, perhaps.

Alternatively, another form of the metric for a sphere is ds² = (R²/(x² + y²)) (dx² + dy²), but that would only cover the sphere outside a certain radius. But in our case, the denominator is 4 -x² -y², which suggests the region is inside a circle of radius 2.

Wait, but that's for a sphere? No, because a sphere's metric would have the denominator as x² + y², but in our case, it's 4 - (x² + y²), which is more like the Poincare disk model.

But regardless, the area calculation I did earlier suggests a finite area, π/4.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the area is zero. But that's not possible unless the space is a single point, which it isn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere in this question refers to a 4-dimensional object, but that's not likely.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. The options don't match my calculation. So perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the given metric is that of a 4-sphere or some higher dimension. But the question says 'pseudosphere of radius 2', which is a 2D surface.

Wait, perhaps the area is 4πr², but with r=2, that would be 16π. But that's not an option either.

Wait, the options have 4π multiplied by something. Option B is 4π(x² + y²), which is a function, but if x and y are variables, perhaps on the boundary.

Wait, but the area is a number, not a function. So if the area is 4π(x² + y²), that would be a function, not an area.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the circumference, but the question says area.

Hmm... Perhaps I should consider the possibility that the area is zero, but that doesn't make sense because the space is a disk of radius 2.

Wait, I'm going to think about the answer options again.

Option D is +infinite. Maybe the area is infinite because the integral diverges. But wait, in our calculation, the integral converges to π/4. So why would it be infinite?

Wait, perhaps the metric is written incorrectly. Let me look again.

The metric is ds²= [32/(4 -x² -y²)] (dx² + dy²). So as (x² + y²) approaches 4, the coefficient blows up, implying that the boundary at x² + y²=4 is infinitely far away in this metric.

Wait, in the Poincare disk model, the boundary at r= R (in this case, R=2) is at infinite distance, so the entire hyperbolic plane is represented within a finite disk. But the area of the whole hyperbolic plane is infinite. But the metric given is only over x² + y² <4, which would represent a finite portion. Or wait, no, the Poincare disk model has the entire hyperbolic plane within a finite disk, implying that the area is infinite.

Wait, no, wait. The Poincare disk model represents the entire hyperbolic plane within a finite disk, but the area is still infinite because the metric becomes singular at the boundary. So the whole hyperbolic plane has infinite area.

But in our case, the domain is x² + y² <4, which suggests that our metric represents a portion of the hyperbolic plane, not the entire plane.

Wait, but perhaps the given metric is for the entire hyperbolic plane, and the domain x² + y² <4 is just a coordinate representation, but in reality, the space is infinite.

Wait, no, because in the Poincare disk model, the entire hyperbolic plane is represented within the disk of radius R. So if R=2, the whole hyperbolic plane is within x² + y² <4, but the area is infinite because the hyperbolic plane is a non-compact space.

So, in that case, the area of this pseudosphere (which is the entire hyperbolic plane) would be infinite. So the correct answer would be D) +infinite.

Ah, because I was integrating only over x² + y² <4, which is a finite region, but perhaps that's just a coordinate chart, and the actual space is the entire hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area.

So, now I'm getting that the area is infinite, which would correspond to option D.

So why did my earlier integration give a finite area? Because I integrated over the coordinate domain. But the actual space is the entire hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area.

So, the correct answer would be D) +infinite.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a conformal metric, where the scaling factor is \( f(x, y) = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The domain of the metric is restricted to \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. The metric resembles the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, where the curvature is negative. The Gaussian curvature \( K \) of the metric was calculated to be \( K = -\frac{1}{64} \), confirming that this is a hyperbolic space.

The question asks for the area of the "pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \)." In this context, the pseudosphere likely refers to the entire hyperbolic plane represented by the metric. While the domain \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \) suggests a finite region, this is merely a coordinate representation. The actual hyperbolic plane is non-compact and extends to infinity, meaning its total area is infinite.

To confirm this, the area element for the metric is \( dA = \frac{4 - x^2 - y^2}{32} \, dx \, dy \). Integrating this over the entire domain \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \) gives a finite result, \( A = \frac{\pi}{4} \). However, this calculation only accounts for the finite coordinate representation and does not reflect the infinite nature of the hyperbolic plane itself.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere (the entire hyperbolic plane) is infinite.

**Critical analysis of the options:**

- **A) 0:** This is incorrect, as the area of a pseudosphere is not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \):** This is a function, not a numerical value, and does not represent the area.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \):** Similar to option B, this is a function and not a valid area.
- **D) \( +\infty \):** This is correct, as the hyperbolic plane has infinite area.

**Answer: D**
