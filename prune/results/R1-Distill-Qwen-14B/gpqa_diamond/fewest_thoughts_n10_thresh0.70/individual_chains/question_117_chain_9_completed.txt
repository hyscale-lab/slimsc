Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism, right? That's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. So, they must have chiral centers or some kind of stereogenic elements.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which show optical isomerism. Let's go through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. 
Wait, biphenyl structures can show stereoisomerism if there's a possibility of the rings rotating. But if the substituents are in positions that allow for free rotation, maybe not. But if the substituents are such that the molecule can't rotate into a plane that would make the mirror image, then maybe they can't be superimposed. Wait, in biphenyls, the single bond between the two benzene rings allows for rotation. But wait, the substituents here are 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, if the substituents are in positions that create asymmetry, perhaps there's a possibility of being non-superimposable. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are in positions that are symmetric, like in para positions, then it might not be chiral. Let me think: the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Wait, the main chain is 1,1'-biphenyl, meaning the two phenyl rings are connected at position 1 of each. Then, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetric across the central bond. Wait, because each substituent is on either ring in the same position relative to the connecting point. So, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. If that's the case, it might not have a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of a planar molecule with a plane of symmetry. But wait, sometimes in biphenyl systems, if there are substituents on each ring that are not mirror images, the molecule can be chiral because of the restricted rotation. Oh wait, but wait, if the substituents are in such a way that flipping the rings would produce a non-superimposable mirror image. But I'm a bit confused. Let me try to visualize. If each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, and the other ring has similar substituents, the molecule could be symmetric, making it not chiral. Or maybe the two substituents on each ring are in positions that create a chiral environment. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I'll come back to this one.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, that's the structure of a beta-hydroxy ester. Let's see: the hydroxy group is on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the molecule has a hydroxyl group, a methyl group adjacent, and an ester group. Wait, the carbon chain is CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to CH3, COOCH3, and two other groups. Wait, no, wait: it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, so structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COO- as the anion. So when the ester is formed, it's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH3O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. As the ester, it's methyl ester, so it's CH3O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, maybe it's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3OCO-CH(OH)-CH3. Oh wait, the structure would be: the central carbon (carbon 2) has OH, connected to CH3 and COOCH3 groups. So it's CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, no, propanoate is three carbons. So propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that's not correct because propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3. No, wait, no. Let me think again. The formula is CH2CH2COOCH3, but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, in that case, the carbon with the hydroxyl (C2) is attached to CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Or wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? No, I'm getting confused. Another approach: if the molecule has a hydroxyl group on a carbon that is attached to three different groups, then that carbon is a chiral center. So, in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate. Let me draw it out mentally. The propanoate is CH2-CH2-COO- but with OH on the second CH2. So the structure would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, but that would make the second carbon (where the OH is) attached to two CH2 groups, an OH, and a COOCH3. Wait, so the groups are CH2CH2COOCH3, OH, and two CH2 groups. Oh wait, no, wait: the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and the adjacent carbon. Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to the following groups: CH3 (from the previous carbon?), COOCH3 (from the next carbon), OH, and the next carbon. Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2(OH) connected to COOCH3 and two CH3 groups. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the connectivity. Propanoate is O-CO-O- with three carbons. So the structure of propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. For 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO- as the anion. As the methyl ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, which is connected to two CH2 groups, a hydroxyl, and the COOCH3 group. Wait, so the groups attached to the C with OH are: two CH2 groups (from either side), the COOCH3, and the OH. So that would be four different groups? No, because the two CH2 groups are attached to the same carbon. Wait, no, the central carbon with OH is CH2(OH), connected to the CH2 group on one side and the COOCH3 on the other. So the groups are: CH2CH2 (wait, no, perhaps it's the previous and next carbons). Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to the first CH2 (left), another CH2 (right), the OH, and the COOCH3. Wait, that would make four different groups: left is CH2 (which is connected to another CH2 and maybe the first carbon), right is CH2 connected to COOCH3, and the COOCH3. Hmm, perhaps the central carbon is connected to CH2 (left), CH2 (right), COOCH3, and OH. So that's four different substituents, which would make it a chiral center. Therefore, this compound would have optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Structure is (Ph)2CO. So two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. The molecule is symmetric around the ketone. Since it's a planar molecule and has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. So no optical isomerism here.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Wait, maleic acid has the two carboxylic acid groups on adjacent carbons (trans), while fumaric acid has them on opposite sides (cis). Wait, no, wait: wait, fumaric acid is the cis isomer, and maleic acid is the trans. So when you make the dimethyl ester, the substituents (the esters) are on adjacent carbons in a cis configuration. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2(COOCH3)2, but with the two groups on the same side. So the molecule has two ester groups on adjacent carbons with the same configuration. So the molecule is trans or cis? Wait, fumarate is the cis isomer. So dimethyl fumarate would have the two ester groups on the same side. Wait, no, wait: Fumaric acid is the cis isomer, so the two COOH groups are on the same side. So dimethyl fumarate would have the two COOCH3 groups on the same side. So the structure is (Z)-1,2-dicarboxyethyl dimethyl ester. So, the molecule has double bond geometry. So the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are COOCH3, CH2CH3 (wait, no, wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2). So, the structure would be CH2(COOCH3)2 with the substituents on the same side. Wait, no, the structure is CH2CH2 with each CH2 attached to a COOCH3 group, but the two COOCH3 are on the same side. So the molecule has a double bond, so the structure is (E) or (Z)? Fumarate is the (Z) isomer. So dimethyl fumarate has a cis configuration on the double bond. Now, does this lead to optical isomerism? Or does it have geometric isomerism? Wait, in this case, the molecule has a double bond, so the substituents are arranged in a way that creates E/Z isomerism, but not optical isomerism. Wait, but wait: can the molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the two substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, then the molecule might not be chiral. Oh wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each side are both COOCH3, so each carbon of the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So, the molecule is symmetric. So, does that make it not chiral? Hmm, wait, because if the two substituents on each carbon are the same, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is not chiral. So, no optical isomerism here. Wait, but wait, another thought: Fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. Alternatively, maybe dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Let me think again: the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-Ph? No, wait, dimethyl fumarate is (Z)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So, structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but wait, no, the actual structure is CH2CH2 with each CH2 connected to a COOCH3. No, wait, no: fumaric acid is HO2CCH2CH2CO2H, but in the cis configuration. When esterified, it becomes CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but with the two substituents on the same side. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So the dimethyl ester would be (CH2COOCH3)2C=C. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(COOCH3)2C=C. No, perhaps it's CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look for another approach. Maybe dimethyl fumarate has the structure CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each carbon of the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So, each carbon has two identical groups. Then, the molecule is symmetric, and thus not chiral. So, no optical isomerism. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong because the substituents on each double bond are the same, leading to no possibility of enantiomers.

Wait, another thought: in which cases do double bonds contribute to optical isomerism? Only if the substituents are different on each carbon, making it possible for the molecule to have a chiral center. But in dimethyl fumarate, each carbon of the double bond has two identical substituents, so no, it can't be chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, I might be making a mistake. Let's see: the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (Z)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester, which has the structure CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So each carbon of the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So, the molecule is symmetric across the double bond. So, it's not chiral, meaning no optical isomerism. So, compound 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not so sure about that. Maybe there's another possibility. Let me think again. If the substituents are on the same side, as in cis, then the molecule is symmetric. So, no, it's not chiral. So, no optical isomers.

Wait, but another approach: optical isomerism requires the presence of a chiral center or a plane of asymmetry. So, in dimethyl fumarate, are there any chiral centers? No, because each carbon in the double bond has two identical substituents. So, no chiral centers. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, going back to the list:

1. I'm not sure about this one. Let me think again. The compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, the two phenyl rings are connected at position 1. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester (as methyl ester) at position 2. So, the structure would have two nitro groups at 6 on each ring and two methyl esters at 2 on each. Now, the question is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule might not be chiral.

Wait, but if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then it has optical isomerism. Let me visualize the structure. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. The 1 position is where the two rings are connected. So, perhaps each ring has a nitro at 6 (which would be para to the connecting point) and a methyl ester at 2 (ortho to the connecting point). Wait, that would mean that the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically. So, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But perhaps if the substituents are in a way that makes the molecule non-symmetrical, it could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement leads to each ring having substituents in such a way that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are in positions that don't mirror each other, the molecule could be chiral. But in this case, both rings have a nitro at 6 and a methyl ester at 2, which are in the same relative positions on each ring. So, the molecule would have mirror symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but another possibility: the biphenyl system can have a diastereomeric form if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule cannot rotate to a position that would make it superimpose on its mirror image. For example, if the substituents are such that the rings adopt a certain conformation that's not mirror-symmetrical, then the molecule could be chiral. But in this case, since each ring has the same substituents in the same positions, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral.

So, for compound 1, I think there's no optical isomerism.

Now, going back to the options:

Which compounds show optical isomerism?

Compound 1: No.

Compound 2: Yes, because the central carbon has four different substituents (CH3, COOCH3, OH, and the adjacent carbon). So, it's a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Compound 3: No.

Compound 4: No, because the substituents on each double bond carbon are same (COOCH3), so no chiral centers.

Wait, but wait, I'm confused about compound 4. Because dimethyl fumarate is (Z)-1,2-dicarboxyethene dimethyl ester. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)2 connected by a double bond. So each carbon is CH2(COOCH3)2, but with the substituents on the same side. Wait, but each carbon of the double bond has two COOCH3 groups, making the molecule symmetric. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but another thought: if the two ester groups are on opposite sides, then maybe it's the trans isomer, which would have a different configuration. But in any case, whether cis or trans, I don't think it leads to optical isomerism because the molecule is symmetric.

Wait, another possibility: if the substituents are different, then the molecule might be chiral. But in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each carbon are the same (two COOCH3 groups), so the molecule isn't chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, which compounds show optical isomerism? Only compound 2.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are:

A) 1, 2, and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Wait, earlier I thought compound 2 has optical isomerism, and the others don't. So, the only one is compound 2. But looking at the options, none have only 2. Let me check again.

Wait, compound 4 is dimethyl fumarate. Another approach: dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with substituents on each end. If the substituents are different, then it could be a case for E/Z isomerism, but not optical isomerism. Since the substituents are the same on each end, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is compound 2.

Looking at the options, option A says 1,2,4. But I thought only 2 was correct. But option A includes 1 and 4, which I don't think are correct. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about compound 1. Let me reevaluate.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a methyl ester at position 2.

So, the structure is two phenyl rings connected at position 1. Each has substituents at 2 (methyl ester) and 6 (nitro). Let's imagine the two rings: phenyl ring A is connected at position 1 to ring B. Ring A has a nitro at position 6 and a methyl ester at 2. Ring B has a nitro at position 6 and a methyl ester at 2. So, assuming the rings are attached at position 1, then position 2 is adjacent on each ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that don't mirror each other, leading to a chiral molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement creates a situation where the molecule has no plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, but if each ring has the same substituents at the same positions relative to the connecting point, then the molecule would be symmetrical. So, no optical isomerism.

So, perhaps compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that has optical isomerism is compound 2.

But looking at the options, none have only 2. Let me see the options again.

Options:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (Z)-1,2-difumaroyldimethyl ester, which has the structure CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Each carbon of the double bond has two COOCH3 groups, making the molecule symmetrical. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake about compound 4. What if the structure isn't symmetric? Or perhaps I'm wrong about the substituents.

Wait, another approach: optical isomerism can also occur in allenes or other structures with stereogenic elements. Wait, dimethyl fumarate is a diester of fumaric acid, which is a diene with two ester groups. But each carbon in the double bond is attached to two ester groups, which are same. So, each carbon has two identical substituents, so no chiral centers. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the options. Only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, I don't see an option that only includes 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with another compound.

Wait, what about compound 4? Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, but maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, no, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is (CH2COOCH3)2 across a double bond. Each carbon is CH2 with two COOCH3 groups. So, no chiral centers.

Hmm. So, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think again. What if the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that the substituents are on opposite sides, making it a trans configuration, which would imply that the molecule has a certain symmetry. But no, that's about E/Z isomerism, not optical isomerism.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about compound 1. Let me imagine the structure. The substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. So, the arrangement is such that the two substituents on each ring are in positions that are not symmetric. Wait, perhaps the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Hmm. For example, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image.

Wait, how about this: the two rings are connected at position 1. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, on ring A, substituent at 2 is methyl ester, at 6 is nitro. On ring B, same. Now, if the substituents are in certain positions, the molecule could lack a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that the entire molecule is chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the two substituents on each ring are in positions that create a chiral environment when considering the biphenyl structure.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: biphenyls can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule cannot be rotated to mirror the other configuration. For example, if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule non-symmetrical.

Wait, in biphenyls, when the substituents are in positions that do not allow for free rotation to a mirrored position, the molecule can exhibit axial chirality. So, for example, if the substituents are in positions that would prevent the molecule from being a meso compound, then it could be chiral.

In this case, the substituents are in 2 and 6 positions. If each ring has a methyl ester at 2 and a nitro at 6, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the molecule is chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical across the central bond, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another approach. Let's look up which of these compounds exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is known to have a chiral center, so it does show optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate, as I thought earlier, doesn't have a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Benzophenone is symmetric, so no optical isomerism.

Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: I'm not sure, but perhaps it's a case of a chiral biphenyl system. For example, if the substituents are in positions that create a chiral axis.

Wait, in the case of 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate on a biphenyl system, perhaps the molecule has a central plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule chiral.

Wait, another way to think: the molecule is symmetrical if each substituent has a mirror counterpart. So, in this case, both rings have the same substituents in the same positions, so the molecule is symmetrical, meaning it's not chiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A, which also includes 1 and 4. But I thought 1 and 4 don't have optical isomerism. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (Z)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So, the molecule is symmetrical, right? But wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituents on each end are different. No, they're the same. So, no, it can't be chiral.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me recap.

The possible optical isomerism compounds are:

1. ?

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. No.

But the options don't have any that include only 2. Let me see the options again.

Option A: 1,2,4.

Option D: 1 and 2.

If compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism, then option D isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 1. Let me think again.

If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. For example, if the substituents are arranged so that the molecule doesn't have a mirror plane.

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. So, perhaps the arrangement is such that the molecule lacks symmetry. Let's imagine the two rings connected at position 1. The substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6.

If we consider rotation around the single bond between the rings, can the molecule rotate in such a way that a substituent from one ring aligns with the other? For example, if the nitro groups on each ring are in such a way that their positions can't be mirrored, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has the same substituents in the same positions relative to the connecting point, so the molecule should have a plane of symmetry. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound with optical isomerism is 2.

Wait, but looking back at the options, none include only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with compound 4. Let's think again: dimethyl fumarate is (Z)-配置, which means the two methyl ester groups are on the same side. But does this create any chiral centers? No, because each carbon is attached to two ester groups and two CH2 groups. So, no chiral centers.

Wait, another approach: maybe compound 4 has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound with optical isomerism is 2.

Looking at the options, option A includes 1,2,4. But I don't think 1 and 4 are correct. Option D includes 1 and 2, but I don't think 1 is correct. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis of compound 1.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about compound 1. Let's think again.

Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are adjacent and opposite positions relative to the connecting point.

In this case, perhaps the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions create a chiral axis. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that do not mirror each other, leading to a lack of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has axial chirality. For example, if the positions of the substituents on each ring are such that the molecule can't be rotated to match its mirror image.

In this case, if the substituents are in positions that create a chiral axis, the molecule would exhibit optical isomerism.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about this structure. If the two rings are connected at position 1, each has a substituent at position 2 and 6. So, for each ring, position 2 is adjacent to the connecting point, and 6 is across from it (para position). So, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, the substituents on each ring are mirrored across the central bond.

In that case, the molecule would be achiral, having a plane of symmetry. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

But if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has no symmetry, then it would be chiral.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the actual structure. Let me imagine the two phenyl rings connected at position 1. Ring A has a nitro group at position 6 and a methyl ester at position 2. Ring B has the same substituents. Now, looking at the molecule, substituents on ring A at 2 and 6 are mirrored on ring B. So, the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the central bond, making it achiral.

So, compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, the only compound with optical isomerism is 2. But looking at the options, there's no option that includes only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps I overlooked another compound. Let me check compound 4 again. Dimethyl fumarate: perhaps it has a chiral center. No, because each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups, making them identical. So, no.

Another thought: maybe compound 4 is a diastereomer, but that's about E/Z isomerism, not optical. So, no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 2. Let me check.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (with OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the adjacent carbon),

- COOCH3 (from the ester),

- OH,

- and another CH group (from the adjacent carbon).

Wait, no, the structure is more like:

The propanoate is CH2-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH2 (which is connected to another CH2 group and the ester),

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting this right. Another approach: the central carbon (the second carbon) has the following groups:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),

- COOCH3 (from the third carbon),

- OH,

- and the bond to the first carbon (which is CH2).

Wait, so the groups are: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and the adjacent CH2 group. So, four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, compound 2 has optical isomerism.

So, the only compound showing optical isomerism is 2. But looking at the options, none have only 2. So, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (Z)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Each carbon of the double bond has two ester groups. Could this lead to a planar molecule that's not chiral? Yes, because it's symmetric. So, no optical isomerism.

But wait, another possibility: if the substituents are on opposite sides, making it a trans configuration, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. So, no optical isomerism either way.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, the only one that includes 2 is option A and D. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 1,2,4.

Option D:1 and 2.

If I thought compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism, then option D isn't correct. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the biphenyl compound has a substituent arrangement that's not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are on the same side of each ring, making the molecule asymmetrical.

In that case, the molecule would have no plane of symmetry, leading to optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in a configuration that doesn't mirror each other, the molecule could be chiral.

I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps in this case, the molecule is chiral, so it shows optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then compound 1 would have optical isomerism.

So, compounds 1 and 2 would have optical isomerism.

Looking at the options, option D includes 1 and 2.

But I'm not sure about compound 1. Another way: perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

In that case, compound 1 would show optical isomerism.

So, with that, the answer would be option D: 1 and 2.

But I'm not completely confident. Alternatively, perhaps only compound 2 is correct, but since the options don't have that, I might have to choose the best available option.

Wait, but looking back, the question lists four compounds, and the options are A to D. Among them, only option A includes 2 and 4, but I thought 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Hmm. I think I'm going to have to make a decision based on my analysis.

Final conclusion:

Only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But since none of the options include only 2, I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I overlooked that compound 4 has a different structure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate: if the substituents are on opposite sides, it's the trans isomer (maleate), which is different from fumarate (cis). But in any case, the molecule would have symmetry, not a chiral center.

So, perhaps compound 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

In that case, only compound 2 is correct. But the options don't have that, so perhaps the intended answer is option A, which includes 2 and 4, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about compound 1. If the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral, then option D would be correct.

But I'm not certain. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to the conclusion.


To determine which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound based on the presence of chirality, which requires a chiral center or a lack of symmetry that prevents the molecule from being superimposable on its mirror image.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two phenyl rings connected at position 1, with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a methyl ester at position 2. The molecule appears to have a plane of symmetry due to the identical substituents on each ring, making it achiral. Therefore, **no optical isomerism**.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is attached to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and the adjacent CH group. This creates a chiral center, allowing the molecule to exist as non-superimposable mirror images. Therefore, **optical isomerism is present**.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂CO, where two phenyl groups are attached to a ketone. The molecule is symmetric around the ketone group, and no chiral centers are present. Therefore, **no optical isomerism**.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂=C(COOCH₃)₂. Each carbon of the double bond is attached to two identical groups (COOCH₃), making the molecule symmetric. This symmetry prevents the formation of non-superimposable mirror images. Therefore, **no optical isomerism**.

### Conclusion:
Only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2)** exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. None of the other compounds analyzed show optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options correctly reflect this conclusion. Based on the reasoning, **only compound 2** is correct.
