Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's a harmonic oscillator potential because it's quadratic in r. So the particle is like a 3D quantum harmonic oscillator. 

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in three dimensions, the quantum harmonic oscillator can be treated as three independent one-dimensional oscillators in each spatial dimension (x, y, z). The energy levels for each 1D oscillator are quantized as E_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the quantum number (n=0,1,2,...). 

In three dimensions, the total energy would be the sum of the energies in each direction. So E = E_x + E_y + E_z. But wait, another way to express the energy levels for 3D isotropic harmonic oscillators is in terms of the principal quantum number N, which is the sum of the individual quantum numbers. So N = n_x + n_y + n_z. And the energy levels are E_N = (N + 3/2) ħω. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding them up gives (N + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me check. For 3D isotropic, the energy levels depend on N, which is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. So each state is characterized by (n_x, n_y, n_z), and N is their sum.

So the energy is (N + 3/2) ħω. So the ground state is N=0, energy (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be N=1, energy (5/2) ħω. Second excited, N=2: (7/2) ħω. Third excited, N=3: (9/2) ħω. Oh, wait, so the third excited state is when N=3.

So the energy value is (9/2) ħω. Looking at the options, options A and C have that energy. So options B and D can be eliminated because their energy expressions don't match. 

Now, the second part of the question: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue. That is, what is the degeneracy of the third excited state (N=3).

The degeneracy for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator at level N is given by the number of ways to write N as the sum of three non-negative integers (n_x, n_y, n_z). So we need to find the number of solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3, where each n_i is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,3,...).

This is a combinatorics problem. The number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = N is (N + 2) choose 2. So for N=3, it's (3 + 2) choose 2 = 5 choose 2 = 10. So the degeneracy is 10.

Looking back at the options, option A says energy (9/2) ħω and 10 eigenfunctions, which matches. Option C says 3 eigenfunctions, which doesn't make sense because when N=3, the degeneracy is higher.

So the correct option should be A. Let me double-check the options. Option A: (9/2) ħω, 10. Yep, that's right.


The problem involves a quantum harmonic oscillator in three dimensions, where the potential is \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are determined by the total quantum number \( N = n_x + n_y + n_z \), where \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are the quantum numbers in the \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) directions, respectively. The energy eigenvalues are given by:

\[
E_N = \left(N + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega,
\]

where \( N \) is a non-negative integer (\( N = 0, 1, 2, \dots \)).

### Step 1: Energy of the third excited state
The ground state corresponds to \( N = 0 \), with energy \( E_0 = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega \). The first excited state corresponds to \( N = 1 \), with energy \( E_1 = \frac{5}{2} \hbar \omega \). The second excited state corresponds to \( N = 2 \), with energy \( E_2 = \frac{7}{2} \hbar \omega \). The third excited state corresponds to \( N = 3 \), with energy:

\[
E_3 = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \).

### Step 2: Degeneracy of the third excited state
The degeneracy of a given energy level \( E_N \) corresponds to the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions associated with the same energy eigenvalue. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy is determined by the number of ways to write \( N \) as the sum of three non-negative integers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \). This is a combinatorial problem, and the degeneracy is given by:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{N + 2}{2}.
\]

For \( N = 3 \), the degeneracy is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \) — This matches the calculated energy and degeneracy.
- **Option B**: \( \frac{11 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m r^2}, 10 \) — The energy expression is incorrect.
- **Option C**: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 3 \) — The degeneracy is incorrect.
- **Option D**: \( \frac{11 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m r^2}, 3 \) — Both the energy and degeneracy are incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.
