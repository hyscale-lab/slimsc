Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about gene interactions in plants and their resistance to a fungal disease called anthracnose. We've got three genes, G1, G2, G3, and their knockout mutants, as well as some double mutants.

The main goal is to determine the relationship between these genes based on the resistance levels shown in the experiment. I remember that in genetics, the concept of epistasis comes into play, which is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. Also, transcription factors are proteins that help regulate the expression of other genes, so that's probably relevant here because one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream.

Looking at the data:

- Wild type resistance: 100%
- g1: 75% → less resistance than wild type
- g2: 0% → no resistance
- g3: 50% → half resistance
- g1g3: 10% → really low
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2

Hmm. So the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance. That suggests that when G2 is knocked out, even if another gene (G1 or G3) is also knocked out, the resistance is as bad as just knocking out G2 alone. Wait, but when G2 is alone, it's 0% resistance. So maybe G2 is the key here.

Wait, but what's the role of a transcription factor? Since it's upstream, it probably activates other genes. So if G2 is a transcription factor, knocking it out would stop the expression of the genes it controls, leading to lower resistance.

Looking at the data, g2 has 0% resistance. So without G2, the plant can't resist the fungus at all. That suggests that G2 is critical, maybe a master regulator.

Now, looking at the double mutants: when both G2 and G1 are knocked out (g1g2), the resistance is still 0%. But the g1 single mutant has 75% resistance. So the presence of G2 is masking the effect of G1? Or perhaps G2 is epistatic to G1. Epistatic means that the effect of G1 is dependent on G2. So when G2 is not working, the effect of G1 doesn't matter anymore because the downstream process is already compromised.

Wait, when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is the same as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the phenotype (resistance) of G1's knockout doesn't show when G2 is also knocked out. So G2 is epistatic to G1. Because in the double mutant, G2's effect is overriding.

Similarly, in the g2g3 double mutant, the resistance is 0%, same as G2 alone. So G3 doesn't add anything when G2 is already knocked out.

Now, looking
