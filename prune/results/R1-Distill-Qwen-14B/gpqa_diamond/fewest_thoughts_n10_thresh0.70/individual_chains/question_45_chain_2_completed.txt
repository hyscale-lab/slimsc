Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

Hmm, the question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, so maybe I can figure it out step by step.

Wait, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula is E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), right? Oh wait, the problem says E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), which is the ground state energy for n=1. So E is E_1.

So each particle in the well will have an energy level depending on the quantum number n. But wait, there are four particles here. Oh, but wait, the particles are identical fermions, right? Because they're spin-1/2. So they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers.

In a 1D well, each particle's state is determined by their quantum number n. But wait, each state can have two particles because of spin. Oh yeah, for spin-1/2, each spatial state can hold two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, so for each n, you can have two particles. So the ground state would be the lowest possible configuration where each spatial state is filled with two particles.

So let me think: How does the filling work for four particles?

The first level n=1 can hold two particles. Then n=2 can hold another two. So with four particles, the first two go into n=1, spins up and down. The next two go into n=2, same thing.

Wait, but that would make them each in different spatial states. So the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, but wait, no. Each particle in the same n has same energy, but each has a different spin state. So for n=1, two particles with energy E_1= E. For n=2, two particles with energy E_2= (2²)E=4E.

So the total energy of the system is E_total= 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E.

Wait, that's the ground state. But wait, the question is about the ground state, first excited, and second excited states.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the possible arrangements of the particles in the energy levels. Since the particles are fermions, each must have a unique set of quantum numbers, but in 1D, the only quantum number is n. So each state is n, and each can hold two particles (spin up and down).

So the ground state is when the first two particles are in n=1 (each with spin up and down). The next two go into n=2. So the total energy is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E= 10E. Wait, but wait, no. Each particle in n=1 has energy E, and n=2 has 4E. So 2 particles in n=1: 2E. 2 in n=2: 8E. Total 10E. So ground state is 10E?

Wait, but wait, the options given include options with 4E and 10E. Let me look at the options.

Option B says 4E,10E,50E. Option C starts with 4E,10E,15E. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. For four particles, the ground state is when the lowest possible n's are filled, each with two particles.

So n=1: two particles, each with energy E_1 = E. Then n=2: two particles, each with E_2 =4E.

So the ground state energy is 2E + 2*4E=2E+8E=10E.

But wait, the question says "calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state". So ground state is 10E? Then first excited state would be when one of the particles is promoted to the next available state.

Wait, but wait, how do the excited states work for fermions? Since each state is filled, the next available state is n=3.

Wait, but let me think. The current configuration is n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles). The next possible state is n=3. But since each n can have two particles, can any of them be promoted? Let me think.

Wait, no. Because the particles are in the lowest possible states. To get the first excited state, one of the particles would have to move to a higher energy level. But since each n can hold two, perhaps the first excited state would have one particle promoted from n=2 to n=3. But wait, no: because in the ground state, the first two are in n=1, and the next two are in n=2. So the total is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) =10E.

The first excited state would be when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So let's see: three particles at n=1, and one at n=2, and one at n=3? Wait, no, because each n can only hold two particles. Wait, no, because n=1 and n=2 are filled. So to make an excited state, we have to have one of the particles in n=2 move up to n=3.

But let me count the particles. Each n can hold two. So in ground state, n=1 (2) and n=2 (2)—so all filled. To make the first excited state, we need to promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. So now, n=1 has 2, n=2 has 1, and n=3 has 1. But that's only three particles. Wait, but we have four. Hmm. Oh wait, no. Because each promotion must come at the expense of another. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should consider the possible ways to arrange four particles in the well, considering that each n can have two. So the ground state is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles) → total energy 10E.

The first excited state would involve the lowest possible energy increase. So perhaps, instead of having two in n=2, you have one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, but how would that work?

Wait, perhaps the first excited state would be when the highest occupied energy level is n=3. Because maybe you can't promote all of them, but perhaps one. Let me think: if we have four particles, the possible arrangements are:

Ground state: n=1 (2) and n=2 (2) → E=10E.

First excited state: perhaps n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So total is 2E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, but that's three particles. Wait, no, because each n can hold two, so maybe I can't have just one in each. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Another approach: The energy levels for each particle are E_n = n² E, since E is E_1.

So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each with E), the next two go into n=2 (each 4E). So the total energy is 2E + 2*(4E) = 10E.

Now, for the first excited state, one of the particles in n=2 must move to n=3. But each n can hold two. So perhaps in the first excited state, one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So now, n=1 has 2, n=2 has 1, n=3 has 1. So the total energy is 2E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, but that's three particles. Oh wait, that can't be right. Because we have four particles. So how?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of the particles' configuration.

In the ground state: two particles in n=1 (each with E) and two in n=2 (each 4E). So 2E + 8E=10E.

Now, the first excited state: perhaps one particle from n=2 is promoted to n=3. So now, n=1 has 2, n=2 has 1, and n=3 has 1. But that's only 4 particles (2+1+1=4) ? Wait, no, 2+1+1=4? No, that's 4? No, 2+1+1=4? Wait, 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → 4 particles. Yes. So the energy is 2E (from n=1) + 4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) → 2E+4E+9E=15E. So first excited state is 15E.

Then what about the second excited state? That would be the next possible configuration. Let's see. Now, perhaps another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. But wait, n=2 can hold two. So if I have two in n=2, but in the first excited state, we have one in n=2 and one in n=3. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2 and one in n=1. But wait that's possible? Let me think. Let's think about the filling.

Wait, in the first excited state, after promoting one particle to n=3, we have 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. Now, the next possible promotion could be another particle moving from n=2 to n=3. So then, n=2 has 0 particles, n=3 has 2, and n=1 has 2. So the energy would be 2E (n=1) + 0*4E + 2*9E = 2E +18E=20E.

But wait, another way: Or maybe another way to arrange the particles for higher energy. Maybe one particle in n=3, and another in n=4. Let me see.

Wait, another approach: The possible energy levels for four particles could be:

Ground state: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2 → E=10E.

First excited state: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → E=2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → E=2E +0*4E + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but that's not possible because each n can hold 2, but perhaps in the second excited state, another configuration is possible.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. Let's see, but that's higher in energy.

Wait, let's think of the possible orderings. Each particle must be in a higher or equal n.

Wait, the possible states in order of increasing energy would be:

- 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2 → 2+2=4 particles → E=10E (ground state).

- Next possible is when one particle is promoted to n=3, so 2 in 1, 1 in 2, 1 in 3 → E=2E +4E +9E=15E (first excited state).

Then, another promotion could be another particle from n=2 to n=3, leading to 2 in 1, 0 in 2, 2 in 3 → E=2E + 0 + 18E=20E. So this would be the second excited state. But wait, the options don't have 20E.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B: 4E,10E,50E.

Option C: 4E,10E,15E.

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

Option A:30E,39E,50E.

Wait, none of the options have 20E. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, maybe the first excited state isn't 15E. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the third particle is in n=3, but wait, no, because for four particles, the ground state is n=1 (2), n=2 (2). So first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. So the configuration is 2, 1,1. So the total energy is 2*E +1*4E +1*9E =15E.

Then the second excited state would be when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, making it 2,0,2. So the energy is 2E + 0 + 2*9E = 2E +18E=20E.

But none of the options have 20E. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the order wrong. Maybe the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but that's for higher energy. Wait, but that would be higher than 15E.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when n=1 has two, n=3 has two. So E=2E + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E. But that's higher than 15E, so it can't be the first excited state.

Hmm. Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let's think about the possible excited states in order.

Ground state is 10E.

First excited state would be the configuration where the highest possible n is as low as possible. So after the ground state, the lowest possible next energy is 15E as I thought before.

But the options don't have 15E for the first excited state. Wait, looking at the options:

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

Wait, but how does that happen? Let me think.

If the second excited state has another configuration. Let me try to figure out possible configurations and their energies.

Another way: maybe the first excited state is when you have one particle in n=3, but another in n=2, but maybe another arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another is in n=4. No, that can't be because that would have higher energy than 15E.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=1? No, that's not possible because n=1 is already filled.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state isn't 10E, but another configuration. No, I think the ground state is 10E.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but then another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=4. So the configuration is 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4. Then the energy would be 2E + 0 +9E +16E=2+9+16=27 E? No, that's even higher.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is 18E, which would be when the configuration is 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. So 2E + 0 + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E. But 20E isn't an option.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I'm not considering the correct filling order.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one of the particles from n=2 moves to n=3, but also another from n=2 moves to n=3. So that would require four particles: 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. So energy is 2E + 0 +18E=20E. That's the first excited state.

Then the second excited state would be when one particle moves to n=4. So configuration becomes 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4. Energy is 2E + 0 +9E +16E=27E. But that's not an option either.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible total energies.

The ground state is 10E.

The first excited state would be the next possible energy, which is when one particle is promoted to n=3. So the energy is 2E (n=1) +1 *4E (n=2) +1 *9E (n=3) =15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle is promoted to n=3, making it 2 in n=3 and 0 in n=2. So energy is 2E + 0 + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the way the particles are arranged in the excited states is different.

Another possibility: The first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but that would be higher than 15E.

Wait, let me think differently. Perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and another in n=4. So the configuration would be 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. So the energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, that's the same as before.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, so the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=4. So the energy would be 2E +4E +16E=22E.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3, so 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. That gives 2E + 0 + 18E=20E.

Then the second excited state would be when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4: 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4. So energy 2E +0 +9E +16E=27E.

But again, not matching the options.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me look at the options again.

Option D says: 10E,15E,18E.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

How can the second excited state be 18E?

18E would be 2*9E, which is 2 particles in n=3 (each with 9E), but 2E from n=1. So 2E + 18E=20E. But that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=2. Wait, but that would be 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Which is 2E +4E +9E=15E. That's the first excited state.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, and another in n=4. So 2E (n=1) + 0 (n=2) + 2*9E (n=3) +1*16E (n=4) → 2E + 18E +16E=36E. Higher than any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing the correct approach. Maybe the particles are not all filled in the same way I thought.

Wait, another approach: For four spin-1/2 particles, which are fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle says that each spatial state can have two particles (with opposite spins). So the spatial wavefunction must be anti-symmetric, but perhaps that's beyond what I need here.

But the main point is that each n can have two particles.

So the ground state is filled as n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → E=10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3. So the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Total energy: 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would be when another n=2 particle moves to n=3. Now, n=1 has 2, n=2 has 0, and n=3 has 2. So the energy is 2E + 0 + 18E=20E.

But again, 20E isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. So the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. So total energy is 2E +4E +16E=22E. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Looking at the options again, option D has the second excited state at 18E. 18E would be 2 *9E, which would require two particles in n=3. So 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → 2E + 0 + 18 E=20E. So that's not 18E.

Wait, unless the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. No, that would be higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=5, but that's even higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question is looking for the sum of the individual energies for each particle in the state.

Wait, but no, that's what I've been doing.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and another in n=2 (but that's same as the ground state).

Alternatively, maybe the particles are arranged such that the first excited state has three particles in n=1, but that's impossible because n=1 can only hold two due to spin.

Wait, so maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, making the configuration 2,1,1. So total E=15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle is promoted to n=3, making 2,0,2 → E=20E.

But again, the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the question is considering the energies as the sum of the individual energies, but in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state isn't 15E, but something else. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm filling the levels.

Wait, another approach: The energy levels for each particle are E, 4E, 9E, 16E, etc.

Since there are four particles, the ground state is when they all are in the lowest possible levels, which are n=1 and n=2.

So:

n=1: 2 particles (each E) → total E1 = 2E.

n=2: 2 particles (each 4E) → total E2=8E.

Total ground state energy: E1 + E2=10E.

First excited state: promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. So:

n=1: 2E.

n=2: 1E (4E).

n=3:1E (9E).

Total E=2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: promote another particle from n=2 to n=3.

Now, n=2 has 0, n=3 has 2.

So total E: 2E + 0 + 18E=20E.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4.

In that case, the configuration would be:

n=1:2E.

n=2:0.

n=3:1E (9E).

n=4:1E (16E).

Total E=2E +9E +16E=27E.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the sum of the squares of the principal quantum numbers, but I think I've been doing that correctly.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E.

Hmm, 18E would be 2*9E, which is two particles in n=3. So the configuration is 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2,2 in n=3.

Which would sum to 2E +18E=20E. So that doesn't match. Unless I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. But that's not possible because n=1 is filled. Or wait, no, because each n can have two, so n=1 has two, n=3 has two. So total E is 2E +2*9E=2E +18E=20E. So that would be the first excited state. Then the second excited state would be when one particle is promoted to n=4, leading to 2 in n=1, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4 → 2E +9E +16E=27E.

But again, not matching any options.

Hmm. Maybe I'm not considering the correct possible states.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when all four particles are in the same n. But no, because each n can hold only two, so that's impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So 2E + 18E=20E. But that's higher than 15E.

Wait, but then why would the first excited state be higher than the second? That can't be.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Another thought: The energies for the system are the sum of each particle's energy. So for four particles, the ground state is when their n's are as low as possible, considering Pauli exclusion.

So in the ground state, two in n=1, two in n=2. So E =2E + 2*(4E)=10E.

The first excited state is when the two particles in n=2 are promoted to n=3 and n=4? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps one particle is promoted to n=3, and the other stays in n=2. So configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Energy:2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then the second excited state would be when the second particle in n=2 is promoted to n=3, making n=2 empty, n=3 with two particles. So energy is 2E + 0 + 18E=20E.

But the options don't have 20E.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and another in n=4. So configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). But wait, four particles: 2+1+1=4, so that's correct. The energy would be 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E. Which is even higher.

Hmm, none of this is matching the options. So maybe I'm missing something about the way the system's energy levels are filled.

Wait, perhaps the particles aren't all fermions. Wait, the question says they're spin-1/2, which are fermions, so yes, the Pauli exclusion applies.

Wait, maybe the system's energy is calculated differently. Perhaps the ground state is when all four particles are in the same n, but that can't be because each n can only hold two, right?

Wait, another approach: The energies for the system are determined by the sum of each particle's energy. So the ground state is the lowest possible sum.

Then the first excited state is the next possible sum.

But let me list the possible configurations and their energies.

Possible configurations for four particles:

1. All in n=1 and n=2: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2 → E=10E.

2. 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → E=2E +4E +9E=15E.

3. 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → E=2E + 0 + 18E=20E.

4. 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4 → E=2E +4E +16E=22E.

5. 2 in n=1, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4 → E=2E +9E +16E=27E.

6. 2 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → E=8E +18E=26E.

Wait, but configuration 6 is 2 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → E=8E +18E=26E.

So the energies in order would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 20E (second excited), 22E, 26E, 27E.

But the options don't have 20E or 26E. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but the options don't have any of these. The closest is option D: 10E,15E,18E.

So perhaps the second excited state is 18E, which would mean that the configuration is 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → E=2E + 18E=20E. But 20E is not 18E.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not considering the sum correctly. For example, perhaps the energies are summed per particle, not per n.

Wait, in the ground state:

n=1: 2 particles × E =2E.

n=2: 2 particles ×4E=8E.

Total:10E.

First excited state: n=1 (2×E=2E), n=2 (1×4E=4E), n=3 (1×9E=9E) → total 15E.

Second excited state: n=1 (2×E), n=3 (2×9E)=18E → total 2E +18E=20E.

But the option D says the second excited state is 18E. Which would imply that the sum is 18E, but that would require four particles with an average energy of 4.5E. But the sum can't be 18E for four particles, because each in n=3 would be 9E each, but four can't all be in n=3 because each n can hold two.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the sum correctly, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question is considering each particle's energy, but not the sum. No, the question says 'energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system', so it's the total energy.

Wait, maybe I should check the options again.

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

Hmm. If the second excited state is 18E, that would mean the sum is 18E, but that's impossible for four particles, because each has at least E.

Wait, unless the question is about the maximum energy of the particles, not the sum. But the question says 'energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system'. So system's total energy.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the particles are bosons, but the question says spin-1/2. So no, they are fermions.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options. The only option that includes 10E as the ground state is option B, D, and C.

Option C: 4E,10E,15E.

Wait, why would the ground state be 4E? That would require all particles to be in n=2, but each n can hold two. So n=2 has two particles, and another two in n=2? No, that's not possible. So I think the ground state must be 10E.

So the options that start with 10E are options B and D.

Option B: 4E,10E,50E.

No, that can't be because the ground state is 10E.

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

Which matches my calculation: ground 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

But how? Because earlier I thought second excited state is 20E.

Hmm, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4, leading to a higher energy. But 18E is 2*9E, which is two particles in n=3. So the configuration would be 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, two in n=3. So total energy 2 +18=20E.

But that's not matching option D. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, but the other three particles remain in n=1 and n=2. But that's not possible because n=1 can hold two.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of ways to arrange the particles.

Wait, perhaps the energies are not the sum of all, but per particle. But the question says the system's energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the sum of the squares of the quantum numbers, but that's not correct.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the given options.

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

So ground state is 10E.

First excited:15E.

Second excited:18E.

So for 18E, that's the sum of the energies of the four particles.

So 18E = sum of four E_n.

Each E_n is n² E.

So 18E = E (n₁² + n₂² + n₃² +n₄² ).

So n₁² +n₂² +n₃² +n₄²=18.

What set of four n's (each being a positive integer, considering Pauli exclusion) would sum to 18?

Possible combinations:

n=1,1,2,2 → sum =1+1+4+4=10 → matches ground state.

n=1,1,2,3 → sum=1+1+4+9=15 → first excited.

n=1,2,3,4 → 1+4+9+16=30 → higher than 18.

n=1,1,3,3 → sum=1+1+9+9=20 → higher than 18.

n=1,2,2,3 → sum=1+4+4+9=18 → yes.

So that configuration is 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2 → no, because that's the ground state.

Wait, no. Wait, configuration with two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3.

Wait, no, that sum is 1+1+4 +9=15.

Wait, another possibility: one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.

Sum=1 +4+4+9=18.

But wait, can two particles be in n=2? Yes, because each n can hold two.

So the configuration is:

n=1:1 particle.

n=2:2 particles.

n=3:1 particle.

So sum of squares: 1+4+4+9=18.

So the total energy is E*(1 +4 +4 +9)=18E.

So this would be a possible configuration.

But in terms of filling order, when would this configuration occur?

Wait, the ground state is 2,2 → 10E.

The first excited state is 2,1,1 → sum 15E.

The next possible would be 1,2,1, which gives sum 18E.

But how does that fit into excited states?

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3, making 2,1,1 → sum 15.

Then the second excited state is when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, making 2,0,2 → sum 20E.

But that's not 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle moves from n=2 to n=3, and another from n=2 to n=4. So configuration is 2,0,1,1 → sum 1+16+0 + ... wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, leading to sum 18E.

Wait, no. Let me calculate the sum for configuration 1,2,2,3.

So 1² +2² +2²+3²=1+4+4+9=18.

So the configuration is one particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.

Which would require a total of 4 particles: 1+2+1=4.

But according to the Pauli exclusion, each n can hold two particles. So n=2 can hold two.

So this configuration is possible.

But when would this happen in terms of filling the levels? It would require that the particles are arranged as 1,2,2,3.

But in the ground state, the filling is 2,2. To get to 1,2,2,3, you'd have to have one particle in n=1, but that's the lowest level, so it's filled already.

Wait, perhaps the system's total energy for this configuration is 18E, which would be the second excited state.

But how does this fit into the order of excited states?

I think I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option D: 10E,15E,18E.

So the ground state is 10E, the first excited is 15E, the second excited is 18E.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Concepts:
1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Well**: The energy levels are quantized and given by:
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E,
   \]
   where \(E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}\) is the ground state energy for \(n=1\).

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: Since the particles are fermions (spin-1/2), each spatial state \(n\) can hold at most two particles (with opposite spins).

3. **Ground State Configuration**: The lowest energy configuration is achieved when particles occupy the lowest available energy levels. For four particles:
   - Two particles occupy \(n=1\) (each with energy \(E\)),
   - Two particles occupy \(n=2\) (each with energy \(4E\)).
   Total energy:
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E + 2(4E) = 10E.
   \]

4. **First Excited State**: The next lowest energy configuration occurs when one particle is promoted from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\). The configuration becomes:
   - Two particles in \(n=1\),
   - One particle in \(n=2\),
   - One particle in \(n=3\).
   Total energy:
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
   \]

5. **Second Excited State**: The next configuration involves promoting another particle from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\), resulting in:
   - Two particles in \(n=1\),
   - Zero particles in \(n=2\),
   - Two particles in \(n=3\).
   Total energy:
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E + 0 + 2(9E) = 20E.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (30E, 39E, 50E)**: These values are much higher than the calculated energies and do not match the expected configurations.
- **Option B (4E, 10E, 50E)**: The ground state energy is incorrect (\(4E\) instead of \(10E\)).
- **Option C (4E, 10E, 15E)**: The ground state energy is incorrect (\(4E\) instead of \(10E\)).
- **Option D (10E, 15E, 18E)**: Matches the calculated ground state (\(10E\)) and first excited state (\(15E\)), but the second excited state is listed as \(18E\), which is inconsistent with the calculated \(20E\). However, this option is the closest match to the expected results.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**, as it aligns with the calculated ground and first excited states, even though the second excited state value differs slightly from the detailed calculation.
