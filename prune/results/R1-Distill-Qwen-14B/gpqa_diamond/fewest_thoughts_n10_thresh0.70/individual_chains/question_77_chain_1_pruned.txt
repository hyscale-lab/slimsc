Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about two different reactions, and I need to figure out the major products they form. The options are A and B, each with different possibilities. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions the Cope rearrangement. From what I remember, the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes. It usually happens when the molecule is heated or exposed to light. The product is another 1,5-diene but with rearranged double bonds. 

Looking at the first reaction: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene is treated with BuLi and then H+. Hmm, wait, BuLi is a strong base, a good deprotonating agent. But how does that relate to the Cope rearrangement? Or maybe this is a different reaction before the rearrangement?

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's see. The first part, part A, is the product after BuLi and H+.

The starting material for A is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So, the structure is benzene with a substituent group. That substituent is (oxy)methyl attached to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Let me sketch that out.

The 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group is a four-carbon chain. The double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents: at C1 is the oxygen connected to a methyl group (OCH2?), and at C3 is a methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-O-CH2Ph, where Ph is the benzene ring. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the group is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the structure is OCH2- attached to the benzene, and the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CHCH(CH3)- ?

Wait, but the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CHCH2CH2- ? But in this case, it's 3-m
