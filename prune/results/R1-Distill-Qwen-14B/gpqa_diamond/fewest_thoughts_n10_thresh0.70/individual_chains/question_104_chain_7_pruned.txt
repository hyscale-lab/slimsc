Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet similar in mass to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV shifts detected are 5 and 7 milliangstroms for planet #1 and #2 respectively. I need to find how many times longer planet #2's orbital period is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift, which is related to the mass of the planet and its orbital parameters. The formula I remember is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) / ( ( (1 day)^(-1) ) * ( (2 pi / P ) )^(1/3) ) )

Wait, that might be a bit complicated. Alternatively, I think the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) )) )

But since both planets are around Sun-like stars and their masses are similar to Neptune (so M_p << M_*), perhaps M_p is negligible compared to M_*, so maybe I can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies a bit.

I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ). But for circular orbits, e=0, so 1 - e² =1, so that term is 1.

But wait, since both planets have the same mass (similar to Neptune) and the stars are the same (same mass), and the shifts are different? So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1 / (2 pi c)) * ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) / ( (P * (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ) )

Hmm, maybe that's getting too detailed. Alternatively, I can use the relation between K and the orbital period. Since both stars are the
