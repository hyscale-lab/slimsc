Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. But wait, the specifics are a bit fuzzy. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that two stars have the same mass, each similar to the Sun. Each star has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the setup is that each star is being tugged by a planet, causing the spectral lines to shift periodically.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, I think the key here is understanding how the radial velocity (RV) method works. The RV semi-amplitude, I think, is the maximum velocity the star moves due to the planet. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v * sin i) / (something), but I'm not exactly sure. Oh right, the RV formula relates to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination angle. But I should probably recall the exact formula.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1 / (2π c)) )

Wait, that's complicated. Maybe I can simplify it. Since M_p (planet mass) is much smaller than M_star, which is ~Sun-like masses, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit.

Another approach I remember is that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)). But wait, maybe it's more precise to think in terms of the formula:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

But I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, I think the formula can be written as:

K = [
