Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question involves a series of reactions leading to a final product, and I need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. The options are A) 8, B) 4, C) 10, D)7.

First, let me parse each step of the reaction.

Step 1: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Hmm. So the starting material is a bicyclo structure, and it's reacting with another compound. The other compound has two dibromomethyl groups on the cyclohexadiene. Sodium iodide might be a nucleophile here, like an SN2 reaction. Oh wait, but dibromomethyl groups are good leaving groups. So maybe this is a Diels-Alder reaction?

Wait, the starting bicyclo compound is a diene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene). The other molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. That's a dienophile perhaps? Or maybe the diene is the diene and the other is the dienophile.

Wait, Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. The bicyclo compound has a conjugated diene. The other molecule is cyclohexa-1,3-diene (so also a conjugated diene). But it's substituted with two dibromomethyl groups on carbons 5 and 6. So maybe the dienophile is the bicyclo compound, and the other is the diene? Or perhaps this is a cycloaddition.

Wait, but the structure is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So positions 5 and 6 each have a CH2Br2 group. Wait, no, dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2. So the cyclohexadiene has two CH2Br2 groups at 5 and 6.

So when the reaction occurs, perhaps the two equivalents of this dienophile (since it has two CH2Br2 groups) are reacting with the diene in the bicyclo structure.

Wait, but in Diels-Alder, the diene (four conjugated double bonds) reacts with a dienophile (like a double bond). Here, the starting molecule is a bicyclo diene â€” maybe that's the dienophile. Or maybe the other molecule is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the bicyclo diene and the cyclohexadiene. But wait, the other molecule has two di bromomethyl groups, which are probably leaving groups. So maybe the reaction is a 1,4-addition or a substitution.

Wait, sodium iodide is present. I know that in some cases, NaI can act as a nucleophile, but more commonly, in substitution reactions, iodide can displace a leaving group. But the other molecule has Br atoms. So perhaps it's an SN2 reaction where the iodide displaces Br from the dibromomethyl groups.

Wait, each dibromomethyl is CH2Br2. So each CH2Br2 has two Br atoms. But in an SN2 reaction, each displacement would require the bromide to leave. But with two Br atoms on the same carbon, I'm not sure how that would proceed. Maybe the displacement occurs one Br at a time, but that would take two equivalents of iodide per Br.

Wait, but the starting molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of positions 5 and 6 has a CH2Br2 group. So each of those carbons has two Br atoms. So each of those carbons has a CH2Br2 group.

So when NaI
