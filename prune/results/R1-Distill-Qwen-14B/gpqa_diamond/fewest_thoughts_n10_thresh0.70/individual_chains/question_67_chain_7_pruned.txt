Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about two electrons in p orbitals, and their angular momentum states. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

So, the setup is two electrons in p orbitals. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l=1. The problem states that the coupled angular momentum state is |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, wait. So, the state is given as |l1, l2, l, m>, which represents the individual angular momenta and the total. So l1 and l2 are 1 each for both electrons. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron and finding the joint probability that both have eigenvalues -ħ. Oh right, because the orbital angular momentum along the z-axis is Lz, which for a state |l, m> has eigenvalues mħ. So each electron has Lz eigenvalues based on their individual m values.

Wait, but wait. Each electron's orbital angular momentum is in a p orbital, so l=1 for each. So for each electron, L1z and L2z can have eigenvalues mħ where m can be -1, 0, +1. So if we measure L1z and L2z, each can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

But the total state is |1,1,2,-1>. So I think this is a coupled state where the total angular momentum is l=2, and m=-1. How does that relate to the individual m1 and m2 values?

Oh right, when you add two angular momenta, the total m is m1 + m2. So in the coupled state |l1, l2, l, m>, m is the sum of m1 and m2. So m = m1 + m2.

In this problem, the state is |1,1,2,-1>. So l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1. So m = m1 + m2 = -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

But then the question is, what's the probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ. That means m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because Lz eigenvalues are mħ. So if m1 = -1, L1z is -ħ. Similarly for m2.

So the question becomes: what's the probability that in this state, m1 is -1 and m2 is -1.

Wait, but the state is a coupled state, so how do we find the expansion in terms of the uncoupled basis? Because in the uncoupled basis, the state would be |m1, m2>, and the coupled state is a linear combination of these.

So to find the probability of m1=-1 and m2=-1, we need to find the coefficient of the |m1=-1, m2=-1> state in the expansion of |1,1,2,-1>.

Wait, but
