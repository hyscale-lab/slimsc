Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The problem says that the state |alpha> of an electron is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Also, I have to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I think I should normalize the state |alpha> because the problem says it's proportional to that expression. Normalization means making sure that the sum of the probabilities (the square of the magnitudes of the coefficients) equals 1.

The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2-i) for |down>. The magnitude squared of (1+i) is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, because |a + ib|^2 = a² + b². Similarly, the magnitude squared of (2-i) is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalized state would be [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Wait, but the problem says it's proportional, so I need to normalize it. So |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2-i)|down> ] multiplied by 1/sqrt(7), right?

Next, the operator in question has a matrix representation A where A_ij is ħ/2 when i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Since the basis here is |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of S_z, the operator A is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write that down.

The matrix A in the z-basis would have zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 on the off-diagonal. So it looks like:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait a second, because for a 2x2 matrix, each element where i ≠ j is ħ/2. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the eigenstates of this operator A would be the eigenstates of this matrix. Let me find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors because the problem is asking about the probabilities of measuring in these eigenstates.

Wait, the operator A is given, but it's not diagonal in the z-basis. So the eigenstates of A are not the same as |up> and |down>. So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A and then find the expansion coefficients.

Alternatively, I can find the eigenstates of A and then project |alpha> onto each, then the square of the magnitude of these projections gives the probabilities. Hmm, okay, let's proceed.

So,
