Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about an electron's state and calculating probabilities and the average of an operator. Hmm. Let's parse the problem.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, proportional means it's equal to some constant multiplied by that expression. But since we're dealing with probabilities, maybe the normalization doesn't matter yet, or maybe I need to normalize it.

The first part asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix Aij where Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, what does that matrix look like?

Let's think: for a 2x2 system (since the state is in up and down), the matrix would be:

[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Because when i≠j, it's ħ/2, and diagonal elements are 0. So this operator is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh, wait, that's similar to the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the operator A is (ħ/2) * σx.

So the eigenstates of this operator would be the same as the eigenstates of σx, because scaling by a constant doesn't change the eigenstates, just the eigenvalues. The eigenstates of σx are the superpositions |+x> and |-x> states. So the eigenstates of operator A are |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues ±ħ/2 respectively.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenstates of the operator A. So if I express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates, the coefficients will give the probabilities when measuring the operator's eigenvalues.

Alternatively, maybe I should diagonalize operator A and find its eigenstates, then express |alpha> in that basis. But since A is proportional to σx, which I know the eigenstates of, perhaps I can proceed that way.

So, first, I think I should normalize |alpha>, because probabilities depend on that.

The given state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me compute the norm. The inner product of |alpha> with itself is (1+i)*(1-i) + (2-i)*(2+i). Let me calculate each term.

(1+i)(1-i) = 1^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

(2-i)(2+i) = 2^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5.

So the norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>. Let me recall what these states are. The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and the |-x> state is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Wait, is that right? Or is it (|up> + i|down>)/sqrt(2) for another basis? Wait, no, the standard eigenstates for σx are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x>=(|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because σx flips up and down.

So, to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, we can write |alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the inner products. Let me write it out:

|alpha> = a |up> + b |down>, where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2-i)/sqrt(7).

But let's express |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

We know that |up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2),

and |down> = (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2).

So substituting into |alpha>:

= a [ (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2) ) ] + b [ (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

= [ a + b ] / sqrt(2) * |+x> + [ a - b ] / sqrt(2) * |-x>.

So let's compute c1 = [ a + b ] / sqrt(2) and c2 = [ a - b ] / sqrt(2).

First, a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), b is (2-i)/sqrt(7).

So a + b = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = (3 ) / sqrt(7) → because the i terms cancel.

So c1 = [3/sqrt(7)] / sqrt(2) = 3/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) )= 3/sqrt(14).

Similarly, a - b = (1+i) - (2 -i) = ( -1 + 2i ) → because 1-2 = -1, i - (-i) = 2i.

So a - b = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(7).

Then c2 = [ (-1 + 2i ) / sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2) ) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

So c1 = 3/sqrt(14), c2 = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The probabilities are |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

Compute |c1|^2: (3^2)/(14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.64286.

Compute |c2|^2: [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 → (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357, but wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, c2 is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14), so the magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 → (1+4)/14 →5/14≈0.357.

Wait, but 9/14 is about 0.64286, and 5/14 is about 0.357. But let me check the sum: 9+5=14, so 14/14=1, correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.643, 5/14≈0.357. But the options have 0.64, 0.36 as in option A, but let's see the other possibilities.

Wait, looking at the options, option D has 0.61 and 0.29, which doesn't add up to 1. So probably not. Option A: 0.64 and 0.36 → 0.64 is 9/14 ≈0.6428, 0.36 is 5/14≈0.357, which is close. So perhaps the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, but wait, did I compute c1 and c2 correctly? Let me double-check.

Wait, a + b: (1+i + 2 -i ) = 3, so yes.

a - b: (1+i ) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = -1 + 2i.

Yes, that's correct.

So c1 is 3/sqrt(14), so |c1|^2 = 9/14. c2 is (-1+2i)/sqrt(14), magnitude squared is (1^2 + 2^2)=5, so 5/14.

So the two probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Let me compute those fractions as decimals:

9/14 ≈ 0.642857..., so about 0.643, which is close to option A's 0.64.

5/14 ≈0.357, which is close to 0.36 in option A.

So perhaps option A or option B? Let me look at the options.

Option A) 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7.

Option B) 0.54, 0.46, 3hbar/sqrt(7).

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because the operator's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, so when I express |alpha> in terms of these, the coefficients are c1 and c2. The probability of measuring the eigenvalue corresponding to |+x> is |c1|^2, which is 9/14, about 0.6428.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36. That's close. So the first two parts of the problem would have probabilities around 9/14 and 5/14.

Now, the average value of the operator. Oh, right, the expectation value.

The operator A is (ħ/2) σx. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σx in the state |alpha>.

The expectation value of σx is given by <alpha| σx |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed as c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>, where |+x> is eigenstate with eigenvalue +1 for σx, and |-x> is eigenvalue -1.

So <sigma_x> = |c1|^2*(1) + |c2|^2*(-1) = (9/14)(1) + (5/14)(-1) = (9 -5)/14 = 4/14 = 2/7.

So <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) = ħ/7.

So the average is ħ/7, which matches option A's third value. So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and expectation value ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. That seems correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: did I compute <sigma_x> correctly?

Alternatively, another approach: the expectation value of σx is (alpha |
