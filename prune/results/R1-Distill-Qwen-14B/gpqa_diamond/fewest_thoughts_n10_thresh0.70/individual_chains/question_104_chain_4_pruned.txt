Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's movement towards or away from us.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the RV method was used to detect both.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but I think the RV method's signal depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period. Oh, wait, the formula I remember is that the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (V0) * (M sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (P/(2*pi))^(1/3)}), but maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/ (2 * pi * sqrt(1 - e²)) ) ) ) ... Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the Doppler shift and the relation between velocity, period, and other factors.

Wait, but both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses. Since the RV method measures the velocity of the star, the semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the star's mass. The formula for K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) * (2π)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ (c * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ))), but maybe I'm complicating it.

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach. The RV method detects the star's velocity change due to the planet. The semi-am
