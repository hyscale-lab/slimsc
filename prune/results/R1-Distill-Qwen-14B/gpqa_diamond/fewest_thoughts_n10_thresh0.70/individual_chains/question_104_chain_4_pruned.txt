Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, radial velocity detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as it moves due to the planet's gravity. I remember that the Doppler shift is related to the star's velocity, which in turn is related to the planet's orbit.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both have circular orbits. The RV method detected each planet. For planet #1, the spectral line shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for #2, it's 7 milliangstroms.

Wait, the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So I need to find the ratio Period2 / Period1.

I think the Doppler shift (wavelength shift) relates to the velocity of the star. The formula for radial velocity is v = (lambda shift) / lambda_0, where lambda_0 is the rest wavelength. But here, the shifts are given in milliangstroms. Since the same spectral line is used for both stars, lambda_0 is the same for both, so the velocity is proportional to the shift.

So, the velocity of star 1 is v1 = 5 * 1e-3 angstroms / lambda_0. Similarly, v2 = 7 * 1e-3 angstroms / lambda_0. So v2 is larger than v1. But how does that relate to the orbital period?

I recall that the RV method gives us the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbital parameters. The formula involves the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period. Oh wait, the formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) )) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) )

Wait, maybe I should think about the simplified version when M_p << M_*, which is the case here since Neptune's mass is much less than the Sun. So, the formula simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) )) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) )

Wait, alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps the more useful approach is
