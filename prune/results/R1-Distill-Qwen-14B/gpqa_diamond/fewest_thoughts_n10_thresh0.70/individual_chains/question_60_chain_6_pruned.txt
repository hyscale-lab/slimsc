Okay, so I have this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember something about special relativity and how time slows down for objects moving at high speeds relative to an observer. Let me think.

The question says that an alien spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really, really fast. The astronaut is 22 years old and wants to know how long the trip will take from their own perspective. The options are whether they'll die before getting there, or the time in years.

Wait, the average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years. So from Earth's perspective, the trip would take a certain amount of time, but because of time dilation, the astronaut's own clock would run slower. Or wait, no. Wait, the astronaut is on the spacecraft, so their own time is the proper time. So the time experienced by them would be less than the time measured from Earth.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me get this straight. Time dilation occurs because of relative velocity. The spaceship is moving at a high speed relative to Earth, so from Earth's frame, the spaceship's clock is running slow. But from the spaceship's frame, Earth is moving, so the distance is contracted. So which perspective do we need here?

The question asks, from the astronaut's point of view, how long will it take. So we need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

So first, I think I need to find the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. Wait, the L
