Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about an alien astronaut traveling to Earth at a super high speed, and we have to find out how long it takes from their perspective.

Wait, the astronaut is 22 years old, and I need to find out if they live long enough to reach Earth. The average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years, so if the trip takes less than that, they should be fine. But if it's longer, they might not make it.

The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really, really fast. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs due to Einstein's theory of relativity. So from the astronaut's perspective, time would pass slower compared to someone on Earth.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Time dilation is when time moves slower for the moving observer. So from Earth's frame, the astronaut's time would be dilated, but from the astronaut's frame, it's Earth's clocks that are moving and thus running slower. Or wait, no, depends on the frame.

Wait, the problem is asking how long it takes from the astronaut's point of view. So we need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

First, I think I need to calculate the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, what's the distance? Hmm, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about
