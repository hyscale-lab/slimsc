Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question is about a star that's being observed by astronomers. The star has the same radius as the Sun, right? So R_star is equal to R_sun. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots. The filling factor here is 20%, which I remember refers to the fraction of the star's surface that's covered by spots. So, 20% of the star's surface is these dark spots.

The star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, I suppose, because dark spots on stars are usually due to lower temperatures. The temperature difference between the spots and the rest of the star is 1000 K. So the spots must be at 5000 K, since 6000 - 1000 is 5000. Wait, or could it be the other way around? No, dark spots are cooler, so yes, spots are 5000 K.

The setup is that this star is being observed, and because it's rotating, the spots come into and out of view, causing changes in brightness. This is similar to the light curve variations we see when a planet transits in front of a star. So the question is asking: if there were a planet instead of spots, what size (radius) would it need to be to produce the same change in brightness (amplitude) as the spots do?

The options are A to D, with some percentages or fractions relative to the star's radius. The question is about finding Rpl (the planet's radius) divided by Rstar (the star's radius).

Hmm. So I think I need to model both scenarios: the star with spots and the planet transiting, then compare their brightness variations.

Let me start with the planet transit scenario because that's more straightforward for me. When a planet transits in front of the star, the amount of light blocked is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The area is πRpl², and the star's area is πRstar². So the amplitude ΔF of the light curve (the drop in brightness) would be (Rpl / Rstar)². Because it's a square, the change in brightness depends on the square of the radius ratio.

Wait, but wait. The star with spots is different. The spots are cooler, so when they rotate into view, the total brightness of the star as seen from Earth would decrease because the spots are darker. But how does this affect the overall brightness variation?

The star's total brightness when the spots are on the visible side depends on the area of the spots. The filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the star's surface is spots. But wait, the spots are cooler, so each spot emits less light. So the total flux from the star when the spots are visible would be the flux from the non-spots and the spots.

The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σT^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the star's total
