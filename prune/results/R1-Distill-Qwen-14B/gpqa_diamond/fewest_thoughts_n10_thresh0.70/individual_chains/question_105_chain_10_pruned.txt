Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So the question is about a star similar to the Sun, and it's got some dark spots on one hemisphere. The astronomers are observing it and notice brightness variations because of rotation. But the interesting part is that this could look like an exoplanet causing the changes. The task is to find out what the radius of such a planet would need to be, relative to the star, to produce the same brightness variation as the spots.

Alright, so let me think about what I know. When a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The change in brightness depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. The formula for the change in brightness, or the depth of the transit, is (Rp/Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius.

But wait, this star has spots. The problem says that one hemisphere is covered with dark spots that have a filling factor of 20%. So the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. But since it's only one hemisphere that's spotty, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing the observed brightness to dip periodically.

Wait, but the question states that the situation resembles an exoplanet. So when the star isn't covered by spots, what would the planet's radius have to be to cause the same brightness variation?

So, I think I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to what a planet would cause.

First, let's figure out the brightness variation from the spots. The spots are cooler, so when they're on the visible side, the star's overall brightness decreases. The amount it decreases depends on the area of the spots and their temperature relative to the star.

The star's total flux without any spots would be based on its entire surface. The spots contribute less flux because their temperature is lower. The flux from a spot is sigma*T^4, where sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The flux from the unspotted area is sigma*(Teff)^4, and the flux from the spot is sigma*(Teff - delta T)^4. 

Wait, but the filling factor is 20%, so 20% of one hemisphere is covered. So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots when viewed from Earth is 0.2 * (1/2) = 0.1, because it's only one hemisphere. Oh wait, no. Wait, the star is a sphere, so the area of a hemisphere is half the surface. If one hemisphere is covered in spots covering 20% of that hemisphere's area, then the total area covered is 0.2 * (π R^2) / 2 = 0.1 π R^2, but the total surface area of the star is 4 π R^2. So
