Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, two stars, star_1 and star_2. The problem says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The question is about finding the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2, assuming LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), which I think means the Boltzmann distribution applies here.

Wait, I remember that in thermal equilibrium, the population of energy levels depends on the temperature. The Boltzmann factor comes into play. The formula for the number of particles in a certain energy state is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)), where E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

So the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). In this case, I think E_i is the higher energy level because the atoms are more excited, so maybe E_i is higher than E_j. But wait, no, wait. The question says that in star_1, the specific energy level is twice as excited as in star_2. So the population in that level is higher in star_1.

Wait, let me think carefully. The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So the number of atoms in that energy level is twice as much compared to star_2. So (n1)/(n2) = 2.

Wait, but wait, I think I need to model this correctly. Let's let E be the energy difference between two levels. Let's say that E is the difference between a certain energy level and the ground state. Or perhaps E is the difference between two specific levels, but the problem says the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. So maybe the formula refers to E being the energy of the level of interest compared to some other level.

Ah, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps each star has its own excitation. So for each star, the population of the specific energy level is given by the Boltzmann factor relative to the ground state (or another
