Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation, which depends on their temperatures.

They also measured the radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, but I'm not sure how the radial velocity affects the luminosity calculation here. Wait, the question says they computed the luminosities using blackbody radiation, so maybe the radial velocity is a red herring or used for something else, but perhaps it's not directly relevant for the luminosity calculation. Let me think.

Wait, the problem is about luminosity, which is a measure of energy output. For blackbody radiation, luminosity depends on the star's radius, temperature, and the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So the first thing I should do is find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 to Star_2.

Given that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

They also have the same peak wavelength. Since both stars emit as blackbodies, the peak wavelength λ_max is determined by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ1 = λ2 implies T1 = T2. So T1 = T2.

So, since T is the same for both stars, the luminosity ratio would be (R1/R2)^2. Because L ∝ R² T^4, and T is the same, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1
