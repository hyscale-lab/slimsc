Okay, so I have to figure out the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. But wait, what's the exact formula?

Oh right, the equilibrium temperature T is given by T = T_star * (L_star / (16πσd^2))^(1/4) multiplied by (1 - albedo)^(1/4), all divided by something? Wait, no, another way to write it. Oh yeah, the formula is T = T_eff * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), but maybe I should think differently.

Wait, more precisely, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * ( (1 - A) / (2) )^(1/4) * ( (L_star) / (16πσ a²) )^(1/4 ), but I think another approach is better. The key is that the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period because the distance relates to the period via Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law says that P² ∝ a³, assuming the same star. So if P is the orbital period, then a ∝ P^(2/3). Because Kepler's law is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³, so a = ( (GM) / (4π²) )^(1/3) * P^(2/3). So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

But the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ), but wait, no, wait. Alternatively, the formula is T_eq = T_star * ( L_star / (16 π σ a² ) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 ). But wait, maybe a simpler approach. Since all these planets are orbiting the same star, L and albedo are the same for all, so the ratio of their temperatures will depend on the ratio of their orbital distances.

So the ratio of temperatures T4/T2 = (d2/d4)^(1/2), because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), and a is proportional to P^(2/3). So T ∝ 1/(a^(1/2)) ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

Wait, let me make this precise. Because a is proportional to P^(2/3), so a4 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) * a2. Because a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

So the ratio of temperatures would be T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = ( (P2/P4)^(2/3) )^(1/2) )= (P2/P4)^(1/3) ?

Wait, let me think again. Since a is proportional to P^(2/3), so a4 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) * a2. Therefore, a4 = a2 * (P4/P2)^(2/3).

So, since temperature is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), T4 = T2 * sqrt(a2 / a4) = T2 * sqrt(1/( (P4/P2)^(2/3) )) )

Simplify that: sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So T4 / T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, so the ratio is (P2/P4)^(1/3). But what's the period ratio between Planet 2 and Planet 4?

Wait, the question states the periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 is 2*P1, Planet_3 is 2.5*P1, Planet_4 is 3.5*P1, and Planet_5 is 5*P1.

So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5.

So P2/P4 = 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3). Hmm, what's that value?

Wait, 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. The cube root of 0.5714.

I know that cube root of 0.5 is about 0.7937, because 0.7937^3 ≈ 0.5. Wait, no, wait: 0.7^3 = 0.343, 0.8^3=512, 0.79^3 = approximately 0.5 (since 0.79^3 is about 0.5), but wait, 0.7937^3 is 0.5. Let me compute cube of 0.83: 0.83 *0.83=0.6889, then *0.83≈0.571. Oh, right! So (0.83)^3 ≈ 0.571. So T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think. If 0.83 cubed is about 0.571, which is 4/7 (since 4/7≈0.5714), then the cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83. So T4/T2 is about 0.83.

Wait, but let me confirm the calculation. Let me compute 0.83^3.

0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889. Then 0.6889 * 0.83.

0.6889 * 0.8 is 0.55112, 0.6889 *0.03=0.020667. Summing 0.55112 + 0.020667= 0.571787. So yes, 0.83³≈0.571787.

So that's about 0.571, which is 4/7. So cube root of 4/7 is ~0.83.

So T4 = 0.83 * T2. So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83. So looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

Wait, but the question is asking for the ratio of Planet_4's temperature to Planet_2's. So T4/T2 ≈ 0.83.

So the correct answer is C) ~0.83.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the equilibrium temperature formula. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance \( a \), and \( a \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \) (from Kepler's third law). Thus, the temperature ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{1/3}
\]

The orbital periods of the planets are in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). Therefore, \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
