Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking what percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes are present among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, I think the blue ones are the dithiocyanate complexes. So that's probably the [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ complex, but I'm not entirely sure about the structure. But I'll proceed with what I know.

Stability constants are for the formation of complexes. Each β is for a different complex. Let me list them out:

- β1 (for [Co(SCN)]^2+): 9
- β2 (for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+):40
- β3 (for [Co(SCN)_3]^2-):63
- β4 (maybe [Co(SCN)_4]^2-):16

Wait, but the order matters because higher β means more stable. So, the higher the β, the more the complex will form.

Wait, but how do I find the percentage of each complex? I think I need to use the stability constants to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to each other.

The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all the species: Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^2+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Or maybe not all of them? I'm not quite sure about the exact complexes, but perhaps I can model it with the given β values.

Wait, the problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I'm a bit fuzzy on which complex is blue. Wait, I think in solution, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue. Or was it [Co(SCN)_3]^2-? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the question refers to the dithiocyanato complex, which would
