Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. I remember that stability constants (β) are involved here. 

The setup is that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I think these β values correspond to the different complexes formed, like Co(SCN)_n^2+ where n is 1,2,3,4.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. So for each complex, the higher the β, the more stable the complex is. So Co(SCN)_3^2+ has β3=63, which is the highest, so that's the most stable. But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think dithiocyanato would mean two SCN ligands attached, so that's the n=2 complex, Co(SCN)_2^2+. Right? Because I remember that the different complexes have different colors, and the blue one is the dithiocyanate. Or maybe another one? Wait, I think the blue is Co(SCN)_2^2+.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused between the different Co(SCN)_n complexes. Let me think. I think the Co(SCN)_2^2+ is blue, Co(SCN)_3^2- is maybe another color, and so on. But the question specifically says dithiocyanato, which is two SCN groups, so that's n=2. So we need the fraction of Co(SCN)_2^2+ in the solution.

To find the percentage, I think we need to calculate the distribution of Co across all possible complexes. The possible complexes are n=0,1,2,3,4. But wait, n=0 is just Co^2+ ions, right?

But how do I approach this? I've heard of the method where you find the fraction of each species based on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand. Since the ligand (SCN^-) is in solution, the formation of complexes depends on both the β values and the ligand's concentration.

I think the general approach is to calculate the formation of each complex step by step. The total cobalt is the sum of all the species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_3]^3+ + [Co(SCN)_4]^4+. But wait, wait. Wait no, wait. Wait, Co is in +2 oxidation state. So each complex will have a charge. Let me think about that.
