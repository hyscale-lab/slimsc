Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which theory doesn't require regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are A to D: Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? Oh right, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, which are like infinities that pop up in calculations. These infinities can cause problems because you can't have an infinite result in a physical measurement. Regularization introduces a temporary 'cut-off' or modifies the theory in a way to make these infinities manageable, allowing you to renormalize the theory by absorbing the divergences into physical parameters like mass and charge.

So, which theories require this? Let's go through each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, including quantum gravity. Since it's a theory that combines quantum mechanics and general relativity, it's supposed to be finite, meaning it doesn't have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories. Or does it? Wait, wait. I think I've heard that in string theory, the perturbative expansions have better behavior because the theory is background-dependent and maybe some of the divergences are tamed by the higher-dimensional nature or the strings themselves. Plus, string theories often don't require the same kind of divergent integrals because the interactions are different. So maybe superstring theory doesn't need regularization as much, or perhaps it doesn't require it at all? Not entirely sure yet.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory with the gauge group SU(3). I know that QCD does require regularization. Because of the non-abelian nature and the possibility of things like Landau poles (though I'm not sure if that's a big issue in practice), but definitely, when you do calculations in QCD, especially for processes with many gluons or high energies, you run into divergences. Regularization methods like lattice regularization or using dimensional regularization are used. So B probably needs regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, an abelian gauge theory. I remember that QED does have divergences and requires regularization. The famous example is the calculation of the electron self-energy, which leads to the need for renormalization. Without regularization, the loop diagrams give infinite results. So C requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, this is the non-quantum version. Classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones because they don't involve the same infinities arising from the mathematics. In classical E&M, even though you can have point charges which have their own issues (like the infinite self-energy), but when you're dealing with classical fields, the theory doesn't have the divergences that quantum theories do because it's not a quantum field theory. So regularization isn't a concept here because the theory is classical. So D probably doesn't require regularization.

Wait, but the question is which
