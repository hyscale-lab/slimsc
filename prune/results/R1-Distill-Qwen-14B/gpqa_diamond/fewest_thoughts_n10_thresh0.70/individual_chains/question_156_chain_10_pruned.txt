Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question involves a chemist performing two reactions with different starting materials, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both reactions use mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products from both reactions are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to determine how many peaks each HPLC will show.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I should probably figure out what reactions are happening here. mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. I remember that peracids are commonly used in epoxidation reactions, especially for alkenes. So, when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. 

Wait, but wait. Oh, but wait! Sometimes, especially with certain conditions, it's possible to have other reactions. Wait, mCPBA is a peracid, so it's going to react with the double bond to form an epoxide. So, both (E) and (Z) oct-4-ene will form epoxides when treated with mCPBA.

Epoxidation of alkenes typically follows a specific stereochemistry, but the configuration of the starting alkene will affect the structure of the epoxide. Let me think about that. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end are on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds across the double bond, it forms an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the epoxide's structure.

Wait, no, wait again. For the epoxidation, the reaction is a concerted process where the peracid approaches the same face as the double bond. So, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene will influence the configuration of the epoxide. For an (E) double bond, the substituents are trans, so the epoxide will form a certain way. Similarly, for a (Z) double bond, it'll form another.

Wait, but what's the structure of oct-4-ene in each case? Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on both ends, but wait, no. Let's think. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH
