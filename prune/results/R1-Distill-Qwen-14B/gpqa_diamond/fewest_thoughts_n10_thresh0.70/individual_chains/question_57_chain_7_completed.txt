Okay, so I have this physics problem here about scattering amplitude and phase shifts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The problem states that we're dealing with elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. They've given me some phase shifts: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The rest are ignored. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, all in units of fm.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) can be written in terms of partial waves. Each partial wave has a phase shift δ_l. The formula I think is something like f(θ,φ) = (1/(2i)) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l / (sin θ) ) e^{i (lφ)}.

But wait, along the incident direction, which is when θ=0°, right? So θ=0, so sinθ is zero. Wait, that would make the denominator zero, which is a problem. Oh wait, but maybe when θ=0, the scattering is along the same direction as the incident beam. I think for this case, the scattering amplitude is different. Or perhaps the expression simplifies.

Wait, maybe when θ=0, the expression for f(0,φ) is simpler. Because for θ=0, the Legendre polynomials terms might simplify. Alternatively, I think that the amplitude when the scattering is along the beam direction (θ=0) can be written as a sum over the partial waves, each contributing a term proportional to e^{iδ_l} (or maybe sin δ_l) multiplied by (2l+1) and some other factors.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The general expression for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ,φ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) / (2ik) ) * (Pl(cosθ)) ]

Wait, no, that might not be right. Another approach: the scattering amplitude can be written as:

f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l * (1/(sin θ)) ) e^{i l φ} ]

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look for another approach. Oh, wait, in some references, the scattering amplitude can be expressed as:

f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l * [ e^{i l φ} - e^{-i l φ} ] / (2i sin θ )

But when θ is 0, sinθ is zero. Hmm, but perhaps the limit as θ approaches zero is considered. Alternatively, maybe the imaginary part along the beam direction (θ=0) relates to the terms that don't depend on θ, which might only be the l=0 term?

Wait, but when θ=0, the terms involving higher l might contribute as well. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude in the direction θ=0 and any φ is given by:

f(0, φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l e^{i l φ} 

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if I'm looking for the imaginary part of f along the beam direction, perhaps I should evaluate f(0,0) or f(0, φ) and then take its imaginary part.

Wait, another thought: the scattering amplitude can be written as a sum over partial waves. Each partial wave contributes a term, and for each term, the amplitude is proportional to e^{iδ_l} multiplied by some function of θ and φ.

But since we're looking along the incident direction (θ=0), let's think about each term. The l=0 term would have Pl(cosθ) = P0(1) = 1. For higher l, Pl(1) =1 as well, because cos(0) is 1. But wait, no, higher l terms have Pl(1)=1, but I'm not sure how that affects the overall amplitude.

Alternatively, maybe when θ=0, the amplitude simplifies. Let me think about the general expression for f. The formula I recall is:

f(θ,φ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) * Pl(cosθ) / (2ik sinθ) ) ]

Wait, I'm not confident about that. Another approach: perhaps it's better to use the optical theorem or something related to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude.

Wait, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (θ=0) is related to the total cross-section. Remember that the optical theorem states that the total cross-section σ_total is (4π/k²) Im f(0,0). So Im f(0,0) = (k²/(4π)) σ_total.

Wait, that's an important point. So if I can find Im f(0,0), I can relate it to the total cross-section. But wait, the problem doesn't provide the total cross-section. So maybe that's not the way to go here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the partial wave expansion of f. The scattering amplitude f can be written as:

f(θ,φ) = Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) f_l (θ) e^{i l φ}

Where f_l is a function involving the phase shifts δ_l. So for each l, f_l is:

f_l (θ) = [ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ] / (2i k sinθ ) * Pl (cosθ)

But wait, when θ=0, sinθ=0. So this would cause a problem unless the numerator is also zero. Let's see: e^{2i δ_l} -1 = e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - e^{-i δ_l}) ) = 2i e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l. Wait, no, let me compute e^{2i δ} -1. Let me factor it:

e^{2i δ} - 1 = e^{i δ} ( e^{i δ} - e^{-i δ} ) = e^{i δ} * 2i sin δ.

So [ e^{2i δ} -1 ] = 2i e^{i δ} sin δ.

So substituting back into f_l (θ=0):

f_l(0) = [2i e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] / (2i k sinθ) ) * Pl(1)

But sinθ=0 here. So this would be 0/0, which is indeterminate. Hmm. So maybe we need to take the limit as θ approaches 0.

Alternatively, perhaps the forward scattering amplitude is given by:

f(0, φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l e^{i l φ} }

Wait, I think I read this somewhere. So when θ=0, the expression for f(0, φ) is this sum.

So the imaginary part of f(0, φ) would be (1/(2k)) times the sum over l of (2l+1) sin δ_l times the imaginary part of [e^{i (δ_l + l φ)} ].

But wait, wait: the term is e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l e^{i l φ} }, multiplied by (2l+1)/(2ik). So when you take the imaginary part, you have to consider the imaginary part of the entire term.

Let me break it down. Let’s write the term as:

(2l+1)/(2ik) * e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l e^{i l φ}

Wait, e^{i δ_l} can be written as cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So substituting that:

(2l+1)/(2ik) * (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) * sin δ_l * e^{i l φ}

Multiply (cos δ + i sin δ) by sin δ:

cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ.

So the term becomes:

(2l+1)/(2ik) * [ cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ ] * e^{i l φ}

Now, separate into real and imaginary parts.

But wait, the entire f is a sum of these terms, so to find the imaginary part of f, we sum the imaginary parts of each term.

So the imaginary part of each term is:

Im [ (2l+1)/(2ik) * (i sin² δ) * e^{i l φ} ) ]

Wait, because the term [cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ] can be split into real (cos δ sin δ) and imaginary (i sin² δ) parts.

So when calculating the imaginary part of the entire term, only the imaginary part of [ (2l+1)/(2ik) * (i sin^2 δ) e^{i l φ} ] contributes.

So the imaginary part of that term is:

Im [ (2l+1)/(2ik) * i sin² δ e^{i l φ} ]

Simplify this. Let's compute:

(2l+1)/(2ik) * i sin² δ e^{i l φ} 

= (2l+1) * (i/(2ik)) ) * sin² δ e^{i l φ}

Wait, i/(2ik) is 1/(2k) multiplied by (i/i) =1/(2k).

So this becomes:

(2l+1) * (1/(2k)) * sin² δ e^{i l φ}

So the term is [ (2l+1) * sin² δ ]/(2k) * e^{i l φ}

The imaginary part of this is [ (2l+1) * sin² δ ]/(2k) * sin(l φ).

Because e^{i l φ} = cos(l φ) + i sin(l φ), so the imaginary part is the coefficient multiplied by sin(l φ).

So the imaginary part of each term is [ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ]/(2k) * sin(l φ).

But wait, when we're looking at the imaginary part of the entire f(0, φ) along the beam direction, which would be for any φ. Wait, but in the problem statement, it’s about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh, that's θ=0, but φ can be any angle. But perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude of the imaginary part, or the average, or perhaps it's considering the contribution when the scattering is along the same direction, which is when φ=0 or 2π? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the case where φ=0, so that e^{i l φ}=1, so the imaginary part for each term is [ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ]/(2k) * 0, because sin(0)=0? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually asking for the imaginary part of f(0,0), the forward scattering direction.

Wait, when φ=0, all the terms have e^{i l φ}=1. So the imaginary part for each term is [ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ]/(2k) * sin(0) which is zero. So that can't be right because then the imaginary part would be zero. That doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake in evaluating the expression. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: perhaps when θ=0 and φ=0, the scattering is in the same direction as the incident beam. The amplitude in this case is f(0,0), and its imaginary part is given by something else.

Wait, maybe another way. The partial wave expansion for f(θ,φ) is:

f(θ, φ) = Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) f_l (θ) e^{i l φ}

Where f_l (θ) is given by:

f_l (θ) = [ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ] / (2i k sinθ) * Pl (cosθ)

But when θ=0, sinθ=0, so unless the numerator is also zero, f_l would be undefined. So let's compute the numerator:

e^{2i δ_l} -1 = e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - e^{-i δ_l}) ) = e^{i δ_l} * 2i sin δ_l

So numerator is 2i e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

So f_l (0) = [2i e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] / (2i k * 0) * Pl(1)

Wait, but Pl(1) is 1 for all l, because Pl(1)=1. So f_l(0) is [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ]/(k * 0) *1.

That still leads to a 0 denominator. So perhaps we need to take the limit as θ approaches zero.

Let me consider θ approaching zero. Then sinθ ≈ θ (in radians), so 1/sinθ ≈ 1/θ.

So f_l (θ) ≈ [ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ] / (2i k θ) ) * Pl(1)

Which is [ 2i e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] / (2i k θ) ) * 1

Simplify:

= [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ]/(k θ )

So as θ approaches zero, unless sin δ_l is zero, f_l (θ) tends to infinity. But in reality, the sum of all these terms must converge, so perhaps the leading term as θ approaches zero is given by the lowest l term where δ_l is non-zero.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this approach is leading me anywhere. Maybe I should think about the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude and then compute the imaginary part along θ=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually referring to the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 and any φ, which would give an expression that depends on the sum of terms with e^{i l φ}.

But the problem is asking for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0. But I'm not sure whether it's considering any specific φ or the general case.

Wait, perhaps the question is simplified. Maybe the imaginary part along the beam direction is simply the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by some constant.

Wait, let me think about the expression I had earlier. The imaginary part of f(0, φ) is (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l sin(l φ) [since each term contributes (2l+1) sin δ_l sin(l φ) / (2k) ].

But the problem says, "along the incident beam direction." That might mean that φ is the same as the initial direction, which could be φ=0. So if I set φ=0, then sin(l φ) = sin(0) = 0. So that would make the imaginary part zero, which can't be right because the options don't have zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the magnitude of the imaginary part, or perhaps the average value, but that seems unclear.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Another thought: the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section via the optical theorem. The optical theorem states that the total cross-section σ_total is equal to (4π/k²) times the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude f(0,0).

So, σ_total = (4π/k²) Im f(0,0).

But the problem doesn't give me the total cross-section. Hmm, but wait, maybe I can compute Im f(0,0) using the phase shifts. Because the optical theorem relates Im f(0,0) to σ_total, but without knowing σ_total, perhaps this isn't helpful.

Wait, another approach. The partial wave expansion for f(θ, φ) can be written as:

f(θ, φ) = Σ (2l+1) ( e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l / (2i k) ) * ( e^{i l φ} / sinθ )

But again, when θ=0, this expression is problematic. So perhaps the forward scattering amplitude is given by the limit as θ approaches zero, which is why we have to consider the partial wave expansion's l=0 term.

Wait, for l=0, Pl(cosθ)=1. So f_0(θ) = [ (e^{2i δ_0} -1 ) / (2i k sinθ) ) ] = [ 2i e^{i δ_0} sin δ_0 ] / (2i k sinθ) ) ] = [ e^{i δ_0} sin δ_0 ]/(k sinθ )

As θ approaches zero, sinθ approaches θ (in radians). So f_0 approaches [e^{i δ_0} sin δ_0 ]/(k θ ). That tends to infinity, which doesn't make sense. So maybe higher l terms balance this?

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of all terms leads to a finite value. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0, which is the forward direction. The formula for Im f(0,0) can be written in terms of the phase shifts. From the partial wave expansion, perhaps Im f(0,0) is given by the sum over l of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, let me think. The forward scattering amplitude is f(0,0), so maybe its imaginary part is given by (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to derive it.

The partial wave expansion for f(θ, φ) is:

f(θ, φ) = Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ]/(2i k) * Pl(cosθ) / sinθ * e^{i l φ}

At θ=0, sinθ=0 and Pl(1)=1. So:

f(0, φ) = Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ]/(2i k) * (1) / 0 * e^{i l φ}

This seems problematic because of division by zero, but perhaps when taking the limit as θ approaches zero, the expression simplifies.

Wait, perhaps we can evaluate the amplitude by considering the leading term as θ approaches zero. The lowest l term would dominate. For example, the l=0 term.

But for l=0, Pl(cosθ)=1, and the term becomes [e^{2i δ_0} -1]/(2i k sinθ). As θ approaches zero, [e^{2i δ_0} -1] = 2i e^{i δ_0} sin δ_0. So the term becomes (2i e^{i δ_0} sin δ_0)/(2i k sinθ) ) = (e^{i δ_0} sin δ_0)/(k sinθ )

As θ approaches zero, sinθ ~ θ, so the term becomes (e^{i δ_0} sin δ_0)/(k θ ) → infinity. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps higher l terms contribute in such a way that the sum converges. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: considering that the scattering amplitude f is related to the T-matrix, and in the partial wave expansion, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by some factor.

Wait, thinking again about the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude is:

f(θ, φ) = Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ]/(2k) * (e^{ilφ} - e^{-ilφ})/(2i sinθ)

But when θ=0, the denominator is zero. So perhaps the real part is zero, but the imaginary part could be considered as a sum of terms involving δ_l.

Wait, maybe when θ=0, the expression becomes:

f(0, φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l e^{i l φ}

Which would be the case if the Pl(cosθ) term is 1 and the 1/sinθ term is handled somehow. But that still leads to a problem because of the 1/sinθ factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to compute the imaginary part of f(0,0), which would be (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, let's test that idea. For each l, the term is (2l+1) sin δ_l. So summing these terms:

l=0: 1 * sin(90°) = 1 * 1 = 1

l=1: 3 * sin(67°) ≈ 3 * 0.9205 ≈ 2.7615

l=2:5 * sin(55) ≈5 *0.8192≈4.096

l=3:7 * sin(30) ≈7 *0.5=3.5

l=4:9 * sin(13) ≈9 *0.22495≈2.02455

Adding all these up: 1+2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455=13.38205.

So the sum is approximately 13.382.

Then, the imaginary part of f(0,0) would be (1/(2k)) * 13.382.

Wait, but what is k? k is the wave number. Since the electrons have energy 50 MeV, we can compute k.

The electrons are non-relativistic at 50 MeV? Wait, 50 MeV is about the rest mass of an electron (which is ~0.511 MeV). So 50 MeV is highly relativistic.

But let's compute k. The relativistic expression for the momentum is:

p = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c^2)^2 )

E is 50 MeV, m c^2 is ~0.511 MeV. So E >> m c^2, so p ≈ E/c.

But let's compute it accurately.

E = 50 MeV

m c^2 = 0.511 MeV

So p^2 c^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈ 2500 - 0.261 ≈ 2499.739 (MeV)^2.

So p c ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.9974 MeV.

k = p/(ħ c). Since ħ c is about 197.33 MeV fm.

So k = (49.9974 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) ≈ 0.2534 fm^{-1}.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2 * 0.2534) ≈ 1 / 0.5068 ≈ 1.973 fm.

So Im f(0,0) ≈ 13.382 * 1.973 fm ≈ let's compute that.

13.382 * 1.973 ≈ 13 * 2 is 26, but let's calculate more accurately.

13.382 * 1.973:

13 * 1.973 = 25.649

0.382 * 1.973 ≈ 0.752

Total ≈ 25.649 + 0.752 ≈ 26.401 fm.

But looking at the options, none are around 26.4. The options are A) 87163.4, B) 355.351, C)177.675, D)251.271.

Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, where did I go wrong? Let me go back.

Wait, earlier I assumed that Im f(0,0) equals the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by 1/(2k). But that gave me about 26.4 fm, which isn't an option. So maybe that approach is incorrect.

Alternative idea: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of f(0,0) is (Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c)/(2k). Wait, let's check units. k is in fm^{-1}, ħ c is in MeV fm. So (ħ c)/(k) would have units (MeV fm)/(fm^{-1}) )= MeV fm^2.

Wait, perhaps not the right approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0,0) = (ħ c)/(2k) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

But k is in fm^{-1}, so 1/k is fm.

So ħ c is about 197.33 MeV fm.

So (ħ c)/(2k) = (197.33 MeV fm) / (2 * 0.2534 fm^{-1}) )

= 197.33 / (0.5068) ) MeV fm * fm^{-1} ?

Wait, units: [ħ c] is MeV fm. [k] is fm^{-1}.

So (ħ c) / (k) has units MeV fm * fm = MeV fm^2. That can't be correct for f, which has units of fm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake with the units. Let me compute k correctly.

k is given by k = p/(ħ c). Wait, no, wait: The wave number k is defined as k = p/(ħ), because p = ħ k. Because the momentum p is equal to ħ k.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in calculating k. Let me correct that.

So,

p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c

Wait, actually, the correct expression is p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )

Because E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So,

p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.261) = sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.9974 MeV.

So p = (49.9974 MeV)/c.

But ħ is in units of J s, but when working in MeV and fm, we use ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, k = p / ħ = (p c)/(ħ c) ) = (49.9974 MeV/c) ) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) * c

Wait, wait, no, let me think in terms of units.

p = ħ k → k = p / ħ.

But p is in MeV/c (since p c is in MeV), and ħ is in MeV fm.

So p = (49.9974 MeV/c )

ħ = 197.33 MeV fm.

So k = (49.9974 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) * c.

Wait, units: (MeV/c) / (MeV fm) ) * c → [ (1/(fm)) ) * (c/c) ) ] → 1/fm.

So k = (49.9974) / (197.33) fm^{-1} ≈ 0.2534 fm^{-1}.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2 * 0.2534) ≈ 1.973 fm.

So now, going back: if Im f(0,0) is (Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * 1/(2k).

Wait, but earlier calculation gave me about 26.4 fm, which is not an option. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f(0,0) = (Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c)/(k^2) )

Wait, because the units might not add up. Let me think about the units.

Im f has units of fm.

(Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l ) is dimensionless.

k is in fm^{-1}.

So, if I have (ħ c) * (1/k^2), units are (MeV fm) * fm^2 → MeV fm^3. No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im f(0,0) = (ħ c)/(k) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Because then, (ħ c) has units MeV fm, k is fm^{-1}, so (ħ c)/k has units MeV fm^2.

But f has units of fm. So perhaps that's not matching.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the units. Let me try to find another approach. Maybe I should look for a formula that relates the total cross-section to the phase shifts.

The total cross-section σ_total is given by the sum over l of (2l+1) (sin δ_l )^2.

Wait, yes, because from the partial wave expansion, the differential cross-section is given by:

dσ/dΩ = |f(θ,φ)|^2 = (1/k²) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ (sin δ_l )^2 + (Pl(cosθ))^2 ] ... Maybe?

Wait, no, the differential cross-section is:

dσ/dΩ = (1/k²) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (sin δ_l )^2 ( (1 + cos²θ) / 2 )

Wait, I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, the total cross-section is the integral of dσ/dΩ over all solid angles, which would pick out the l=0 term because higher l terms involve angular dependencies that average out.

Alternatively, the total cross-section σ_total is given by:

σ_total = (4π/k²) Im f(0,0)

And from partial waves, Im f(0,0) is (Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/(2k)).

Wait, earlier we computed that, and it came to about 26 fm. But looking back at the options, none of them are close to that. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of k somewhere in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is Im f(0,0) = (ħ c)/(2k) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Because ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm, and k is 0.2534 fm^{-1}.

So Im f(0,0) = (197.33 MeV fm) * (1/(2 * 0.2534 fm^{-1})) ) * [ Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l ]

Wait, let's compute the constants first.

(197.33 MeV fm) / (2 * 0.2534 fm^{-1}) ) = (197.33)/(0.5068) ) MeV fm^2.

But MeV fm^2? Doesn't match f's units of fm.

Hmm, perhaps that approach isn't correct. Maybe I should use the formula:

Im f(0,0) = (Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c)/(k^2)

Because then, units would be (MeV fm ) / (fm^{-2}) ) → MeV fm^3. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

Im f(0,0) = (Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c)/(k)

Which would have units MeV fm / fm^{-1} → MeV fm^2. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of (k) in the denominator.

Wait, another approach: The optical theorem gives σ_total = (4π/k²) Im f(0,0).

And σ_total can also be expressed as Σ (2l+1) (sin δ_l )^2 (4π/k²).

Wait, no, perhaps σ_total is (Σ (2l+1) (sin δ_l )^2 ) (4π/k²) )

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me look up the exact expression for the total cross-section in terms of phase shifts.

Upon reflection (no pun intended), the total cross-section is given by:

σ_total = (4π/k²) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (sin δ_l )^2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, I think it's actually:

σ_total = (4π/k²) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (sin δ_l )^2.

But that's the differential cross-section integrated over all angles.

Wait, no. The differential cross-section is:

dσ/dΩ = (1/k²) Σ_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) (sin δ_l )^2 (1 + cos²θ) /2.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, from the partial wave expansion, the differential cross-section is:

dσ/dΩ = (1/k²) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (sin δ_l )^2 (1 + cos²θ) /2.

Wait, perhaps not. Another approach: the total cross-section is the integral of the differential cross-section over all solid angles.

Since the differential cross-section depends on θ, integrating over all angles would require:

σ_total = ∫ (dσ/dΩ) dΩ = ∫ [ (1/k²) Σ_{l}(2l+1) (sin δ_l )^2 (1 + cos²θ)/2 ] sinθ dθ dφ

But integrating over φ would give a factor of 2π, and the integral over θ would involve (1 + cos²θ)/2.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the total cross-section is equal to (4π/k²) Im f(0,0), and from the partial wave expansion, Im f(0,0) is (Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k).

So, combining these:

σ_total = (4π/k²) * [ Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k) ) ]

= (4π/k²) * [ (Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k) ) ]

= (2 π Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(k^3 )

But wait, I don't know σ_total, so this approach might not help unless I can find another way.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l as S. Then, Im f(0,0) = S/(2k).

Earlier, S was approximately 13.382, and k is 0.2534 fm^{-1}.

So Im f(0,0) ≈ 13.382 / (2 * 0.2534) ≈ 13.382 / 0.5068 ≈ 26.4 fm.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I'm miscalculating S.

Wait, let me re-calculate S accurately.

Let me compute each term:

l=0: (2*0 +1) * sin(90°) = 1 * 1 = 1.

l=1: 3 * sin(67°) = 3 * 0.920504 ≈ 3 * 0.9205 = 2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55°) =5 * 0.819152 ≈ 4.09576.

l=3:7 * sin(30°) =7 * 0.5 =3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13°) =9 * 0.224951 ≈ 2.02456.

Adding up: 1 + 2.7615 = 3.7615; +4.09576 =7.85726; +3.5=11.35726; +2.02456=13.38182.

So S = 13.38182.

So Im f(0,0) = S/(2k) = 13.38182 / (2 * 0.2534) ≈ 13.38182 / 0.5068 ≈ 26.40 fm.

But the options are all much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is not about f(0,0) but about the imaginary part of the amplitude in the far field, leading to a larger value. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of (ħ c) somewhere.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (k/(2i)) Σ ... So perhaps the units are important.

Wait, k is in fm^{-1}, so 1/k is fm. So when I compute 13.382/(2k), that would be in fm.

Wait, so Im f(0,0) is about 26.4 fm. Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 251.271 fm, which is about 10 times larger.

Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere. Let me double-check the calculation of k.

Earlier, I computed k as 0.2534 fm^{-1}.

But wait, let me recompute p.

E =50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV.

p c = sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 ) ≈49.9973 MeV.

So p = (49.9973 MeV)/c.

ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

k = p / ħ = (49.9973 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) * c.

Wait, units: (MeV/c) / (MeV fm) ) * c → (1/(fm)) * c/c → 1/fm.

So k = 49.9973 /197.33 ≈ 0.2534 fm^{-1}.

That's correct.

So 2k is 0.5068 fm^{-1}, and 1/(2k)=1.973 fm.

So 13.382 * 1.973 ≈ 26.4 fm.

But if the correct answer is around 26.4, but the options don't have that, perhaps the question is asking for something else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the imaginary part of the amplitude as a sum over all the phase shifts, but multiplied by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f = (Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c)/(k^2).

So let's compute that:

ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

k^2 = (0.2534 fm^{-1})^2 ≈ 0.0642 fm^{-2}.

So (ħ c)/(k^2) = (197.33 MeV fm ) / (0.0642 fm^{-2}) ) = 197.33 /0.0642 * MeV fm^3.

But Im f must be in fm, so this approach isn't giving the right units. So perhaps this isn't the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f = (ħ c /k) * (Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k).

Because (ħ c /k) has units of MeV fm * fm = MeV fm^2. Then, dividing by k again gives MeV fm^3, which is not correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l and then multiply by some constant.

Sum S =13.382.

Given that option C is 177.675 fm, which is about 13.382 * 13.26 fm.

Wait, 13.382 *13.26 ≈ 177.6. So perhaps the factor is (ħ c)/(2k^2).

Because ħ c =197.33 MeV fm, and k=0.2534 fm^{-1}, k^2=0.06424 fm^{-2}.

(ħ c)/(2 k^2) = (197.33)/(2 *0.06424 ) fm^{-1} → 197.33 / 0.12848 ≈ 1534. So 1534 fm.

But that gives 13.382 * 1534 ≈ 20533 fm, which is way larger than options.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is (ħ c)/(k^2) = 197.33 / 0.06424 ≈ 3072 fm^{-1}.

But 13.382 *3072 ≈ 40941 fm, which is even bigger.

Hmm, this isn't working. Maybe the correct approach is to look for a formula that directly gives the imaginary part in terms of the phase shifts and known constants.

After some research in my memory, I recall that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude can be expressed as:

Im f(θ=0, φ) = (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l e^{i l φ}.

But when evaluating the magnitude, perhaps we're looking for the maximum value or the average.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the amplitude at θ=0 and any φ, which would not be a single value but a function of φ. But since the options are numerical, perhaps the question is considering the magnitude of the imaginary part, which would require integrating over φ.

Wait, but the question says "along the incident beam direction", which might imply θ=0 and any φ. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the problem might be asking for the imaginary part of the amplitude in the far field, which is when r is large, and the amplitude is dominated by the plane wave term. In that case, the expression for the scattering amplitude simplifies, and the imaginary part can be extracted.

But I'm not familiar with the exact formula in that case. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the use of the Born approximation or something similar, but that would be an approximation and may not fit the given phase shifts.

Wait, perhaps the question is simply expecting me to sum the given phase shifts and apply a conversion factor.

Given that, let's compute the sum of the phase shifts:

δ0=90°, δ1=67, δ2=55, δ3=30, δ4=13.

Sum =90+67=157; +55=212; +30=242; +13=255 degrees.

But I'm not sure how to use that.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of (2l+1) * δ_l in radians.

Wait, 90 degrees is π/2 radians, which is about 1.5708.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1 * 1.5708 ≈1.5708

l=1:3 * 67 degrees. 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 radians. 3 *1.16937 ≈3.5081.

l=2:5 *55 degrees. 55 * π/180≈0.9599 radians. 5 *0.9599≈4.7995.

l=3:7 *30 degrees. 30 * π/180=0.5236 radians. 7 *0.5236≈3.6652.

l=4:9 *13 degrees. 13 * π/180≈0.2269 radians. 9*0.2269≈2.0421.

Sum all:

1.5708 +3.5081=5.0789; +4.7995=9.8784; +3.6652=13.5436; +2.0421=15.5857.

But I'm not sure how this sum would relate to the scattering amplitude. Perhaps I should multiply by some factor.

But without a clear formula, I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

Im f = (ħ c)/(2k) * sum_{l}(2l+1) sin δ_l.

So, using the sum S=13.382, ħ c=197.33 MeV fm, k=0.2534 fm^{-1}.

Im f = (197.33) / (2 * 0.2534 ) * 13.382.

Wait, but that would be:

(197.33 /0.5068 ) *13.382.

Wait, 197.33 /0.5068 ≈ 390.3.

390.3 *13.382 ≈5220 fm.

But that's way larger than any option.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct approach is to consider that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by (1/k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So, 1/k is approximately 3.946 fm.

Sum S=13.382.

So Im f ≈ 13.382 *3.946 ≈52.7 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, the options are A)87163, B)355, C)177, D)251.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f = (ħ c) * sum_{l} (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So, 197.33 MeV fm *13.382 ≈2644 MeV fm.

But that's in wrong units.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f = (ħ c) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l /k^2.

So 197.33 *13.382 / (0.2534)^2.

Compute denominator: (0.2534)^2≈0.06424.

So 197.33 *13.382 ≈2644. Then 2644 /0.06424≈41130.

But that's 41,130 fm, which is way larger than any option.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe the correct answer is option C)177.675 fm.

Wait, how could that be? Let's see. 177.675 /13.382 ≈13.26.

So 13.382 *13.26 =177.675.

So perhaps the factor is 13.26.

What is 13.26 in terms of known quantities? Let's see.

k=0.2534 fm^{-1}.

13.26 = (something related to ħ c or k).

Wait, ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So 197.33 / (0.2534 *10) )=197.33/(2.534)≈77.83.

No, that's not matching.

Wait, 13.26 is about (2pi)*2.114.

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is (2pi) times something.

But I'm not getting anywhere. I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess.

Looking at the options, option C is approximately 177.675 fm. That's S=13.382 multiplied by about 13.26.

But without knowing the correct formula, I can't be sure. Perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the imaginary part is (ħ c/k^2) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

But wait, ħ c=197.33 MeV fm, k^2=0.06424 fm^{-2}.

So (ħ c/k^2)=197.33 /0.06424 ≈3069 fm^{-1}.

So 3069 *13.382 ≈40937 fm, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

After all this, I think I must have made a mistake in the earlier step. Maybe the formula I thought of is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im f(0,0) is (ħ c) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k^2).

So:

Im f = (197.33 MeV fm) * 13.382 / (2*(0.2534)^2 fm^{-2}) )

Denominator: 2*(0.06424) =0.12848 fm^{-2}.

So,

Im f = (197.33 *13.382 )/(0.12848 ) fm.

Compute numerator:197.33 *13.382 ≈2644.

So,

2644 /0.12848 ≈20576 fm.

Still not matching any option.

I think I'm not getting any closer. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. The sum S is about 13.38, and option C is 177.675, which is approximately 13.38 *13.26. Since 13.26 is about 4*3.315, which could be ħ c/(something), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C)177.675 fm. But I'm not confident.


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude for elastic electron scattering along the incident beam direction, given phase shifts $\delta_0 = 90^\circ$, $\delta_1 = 67^\circ$, $\delta_2 = 55^\circ$, $\delta_3 = 30^\circ$, and $\delta_4 = 13^\circ$. The scattering amplitude $f(\theta, \phi)$ is expressed in terms of partial waves, and the imaginary part of $f(0, \phi)$ is proportional to a sum over $(2l+1) \sin \delta_l$. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Partial Wave Expansion**: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at $\theta = 0$ is proportional to $\sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin \delta_l$. For the given phase shifts:
   - $l=0$: $(2(0)+1) \sin 90^\circ = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$
   - $l=1$: $(2(1)+1) \sin 67^\circ \approx 3 \cdot 0.9205 = 2.7615$
   - $l=2$: $(2(2)+1) \sin 55^\circ \approx 5 \cdot 0.8192 = 4.096$
   - $l=3$: $(2(3)+1) \sin 30^\circ \approx 7 \cdot 0.5 = 3.5$
   - $l=4$: $(2(4)+1) \sin 13^\circ \approx 9 \cdot 0.22495 = 2.02455$

   Summing these terms gives:
   \[
   S = 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.02455 \approx 13.382
   \]

2. **Wave Number $k$**: The wave number $k$ is calculated using the relativistic energy of the electrons. For $E = 50 \, \text{MeV}$ and $m c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}$:
   \[
   p c = \sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2} \approx \sqrt{50^2 - 0.511^2} \approx 49.9974 \, \text{MeV}
   \]
   Using $\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm}$:
   \[
   k = \frac{p}{\hbar} = \frac{p c}{\hbar c} \approx \frac{49.9974}{197.33} \approx 0.2534 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
   \]

3. **Imaginary Part of $f(0,0)$**: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at $\theta = 0$ is given by:
   \[
   \text{Im } f(0,0) = \frac{S}{2k}
   \]
   Substituting $S \approx 13.382$ and $k \approx 0.2534 \, \text{fm}^{-1}$:
   \[
   \text{Im } f(0,0) \approx \frac{13.382}{2 \cdot 0.2534} \approx \frac{13.382}{0.5068} \approx 26.4 \, \text{fm}
   \]

4. **Mismatch with Options**: The calculated value of $26.4 \, \text{fm}$ does not match any of the provided options. However, option $C$ ($177.675 \, \text{fm}$) is approximately $13.382 \cdot 13.26$, suggesting a possible missing factor of $13.26$ in the calculation. This factor could arise from an additional term or correction not explicitly derived here.

### Conclusion:
Given the discrepancy between the calculated value and the options, and the lack of further clarity on the missing factor, the most reasonable choice based on the provided options is:

**Answer: C**
