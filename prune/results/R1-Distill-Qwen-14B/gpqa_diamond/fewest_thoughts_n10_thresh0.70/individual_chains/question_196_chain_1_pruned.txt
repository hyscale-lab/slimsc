Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. Oh wait, and the speed of light is c, so relativity must come into play here.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, the problem is relativistic, so maybe that's not correct.

Right, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The relativistic kinetic energy is given by KE = (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the energy equation would change because of this.

But wait, the oscillator is subject to Hooke's law, which is a linear restoring force. But when speeds are relativistic, the equations of motion change. The harmonic oscillator in relativity is a bit more complicated. Let me think about the energy approach.

In a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, actually, the potential energy in a relativistic context might also be different. Or maybe the system is treated such that the total energy is conserved, including relativistic effects.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to use the energy conservation in the relativistic case. The potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero there. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the kinetic energy is maximum, and potential is zero. But wait, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv², so the maximum kinetic energy would be when all potential is converted, but with relativistic considerations.

Wait, maybe the total energy is conserved between the two points. At x=A, the oscillator is at rest, so total energy is rest energy plus potential energy. At x=0, it's moving, so total energy is rest energy plus relativistic kinetic energy.

So, let's model that. At x=A, the potential energy is U = (1/2)kA². Kinetic energy is zero, so total energy E is mc² + (1/2)kA².

At x=0, the potential is zero
