Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

First, I need to understand what the starting material is. So, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the first carbon. So, the structure would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH(CH₂CH₃)? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₃, but with a methyl branch on carbon 3. So, the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH₂? No, wait, wait—wait, no, pent has five carbons. So, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be: CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH3)CH₂CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But 3-methyl would have a methyl group on carbon 3. So, carbon 1 is CH₂=, carbon 2 is CH-, carbon 3 is CH(CH3), then carbon 4 and 5. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

So, structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH₂CH3? Wait, that can't be right because that would be more than five carbons. Let me think again. Maybe it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. So, yes, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, wait a minute. Let's count the carbons. The parent chain is five carbons, so the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. So, carbon 1: CH₂=, carbon 2: CH-, carbon 3: CH(CH3
