Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the planet and the closer it is to the star, the bigger the shift, right?

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. They detected these planets using the RV method. 

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is about how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. So the shift is proportional to the velocity of the star in the direction of the observer. The formula I remember is something like delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where c is the speed of light. So a larger shift means a higher velocity.

But how does the velocity of the star relate to the planet's orbital period? Oh right, the star's velocity and the planet's velocity are related through their masses and the orbital parameters. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets are similar in mass, the velocity of the star (v) would be the same if the orbital periods and semi-major axes are the same. Wait, but in this case, the shifts are different, so the velocities are different.

Wait, let me think. The RV method measures the star's velocity. The maximum velocity (v) is given by (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ), but since M_p is much less than M_star, which is similar to the Sun, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So, v ≈ (constant) * (M_p / (M_star)^(1/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3).

Wait, let me get the formula straight. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given by:
