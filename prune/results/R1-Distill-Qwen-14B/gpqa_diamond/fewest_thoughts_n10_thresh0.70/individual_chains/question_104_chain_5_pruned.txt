Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbit.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each hosting a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the stars have the same mass, which is solar-like, and the planets have similar masses, but we're looking at their orbital periods.

The RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us. The shift in the spectral lines corresponds to this velocity. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does this translate into the orbital period?

I think the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the Doppler shift. The formula for K is K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity. But wait, the exact formula I remember involves the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance. Oh right, the formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (P * (2π)) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / (c), but wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

Alternatively, I remember that when using the RV method, for a given planet mass and star mass, a larger velocity semi-amplitude K means a shorter orbital period. Because if the planet is closer, it causes a higher velocity wobble, but the period is shorter. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. If the planet has a shorter orbital period, it's orbiting closer. So, a shorter period implies larger RV amplitude? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * (1) / ( (P) * (2π) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of Kepler's third law. Kepler's law states that (P^2) * (a^3) = (4π²/G(M_star + M_p)) ), but since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate it as (P² a³) / (M_star) ) = 4π² / G.

But how does this relate to the RV method's velocity? The RV semi-amplitude K is related to the star's velocity, which is due to the planet's orbit. The formula for K is:

K = (v sin i) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe a simpler approach is to consider the ratio of the velocities between the two planets. Since both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar
