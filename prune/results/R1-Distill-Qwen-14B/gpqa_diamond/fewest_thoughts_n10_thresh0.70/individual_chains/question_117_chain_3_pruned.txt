Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with molecules being non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? That's when there's a chiral center involved. So, let me go through each option one by one.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which show optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each a combination of numbers 1-4. Let's break them down.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can have some interesting stereochemistry. The substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions. Wait, if the substituents are in positions that allow for the molecule to have a plane of symmetry, maybe it's not chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are such that the biphenyl can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then it's chiral. Biphenyl rings can have cis or trans configurations. So if there are two substituents on each ring, maybe in positions that make the entire molecule lack a plane of symmetry, then it could have optical isomers. Let me think: the structure has two nitro groups on each of the biphenyl rings. Since it's 6,6'-dinitro, that's para on each ring. And then the 2,2' positions have the ester groups. So, the substituents on each ring are at para positions. Wait, could the molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the two substituents on each ring are in para positions, like if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule is symmetric, then no optical isomerism. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then optical isomers would be possible. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe in this case, the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, so it's chiral and can have optical isomers.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure would be
