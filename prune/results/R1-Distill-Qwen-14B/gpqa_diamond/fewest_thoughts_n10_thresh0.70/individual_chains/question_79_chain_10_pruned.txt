Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction product's NMR spectra. Hmm, let's see.

Alright, the reaction involved is Compound X reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, what's that reagent? Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used for deprotonation. Maybe it's an epoxide ring-opening reaction? Or perhaps it's involved in some elimination or rearrangement?

Compound X's formula is C11H12O. Let's think about what kind of compounds fit that. An epoxide would have the formula R-O-R, but that's two rings, maybe? Alternatively, maybe it's a styrene oxide. Styrene is C8H8O, so styrene oxide would have a similar formula but perhaps with more carbons. Hmm, not sure yet.

Looking at the product's NMR data. Let's start with the 1H NMR. The signals are:

δ 2.28 (3H, s) – probably a methyl group attached to something that deshields it a bit. Similarly, 2.31 (3H, s) – another methyl, maybe adjacent to something else? Wait, two separate singlets for 3H each. So two methyl groups in different environments.

Then, the aromatic region: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So four aromatic protons in a pattern that suggests some coupling. The doublets might suggest a para-substituted benzene, but the integration doesn't add up to 4H. Wait, let's sum the integrations: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 =6H. Hmm, a benzene ring with six protons? But wait, that can't be right because styrene only has one substituent. Maybe it's a substituted benzene with substituents in positions that split the signals into doublets.

Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted ring with two substituents in the para positions. Or perhaps it's a substituent that causes the protons to couple with each other. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in such a way that the protons are split into these doublets.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:

21.3 (1C, s) – probably a methyl group attached to something electronegative, like oxygen. Similarly, 28.4 (1C, s) – another methyl, maybe more shielded or attached to a different part.

Then, a series of carbons in the aromatic region: 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.
