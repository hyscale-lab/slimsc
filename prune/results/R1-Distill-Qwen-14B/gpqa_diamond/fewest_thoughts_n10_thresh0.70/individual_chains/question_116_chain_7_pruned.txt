Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about NMR spectroscopy and some reactions leading to the identification of a compound. I remember that NMR can tell us a lot about the structure, especially the splitting patterns and integration. 

The question says Compound A shows two signals in the proton NMR. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I'm thinking about what structures would give such signals. 

A triplet usually arises from coupling with two neighboring protons. The 6H at 0.9 ppm is probably from two methyl groups (each with 3H) that are next to a CH2 group. Because a triplet for 6H would mean each of two sets of 3H is split by a CH2. So maybe it's a structure where two methyl groups are adjacent to a CH2, like in a di-substituted structure, perhaps like an isopropyl group. Wait, no, isopropyl would give a septet for the CH, but here we have a triplet for the methyl groups.

Wait, maybe it's a diethyl group. No, diethyl would have more protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a structure where there are two methyl groups attached to a CH2. Oh, like ethyl groups. For example, maybe the structure is something like neopentyl? No, neopentyl would have a central CH2 attached to two CH(CH3)2 groups, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2CH3)2CHCH2CH3? No, that's pentane. Wait, no, the integration is 6H for triplet and 4H for quartet. Let's think: in ethyl groups, the CH3 would be triplet if adjacent to a CH2. So maybe two CH3 groups each attached to a CH2, which in turn is attached to another CH2. Wait, perhaps it's a diethyl ether? No, because diethyl ether has two CH2CH3 groups, each CH3 would be triplet. But in that case, the CH2 in the middle would be a quartet. But the integrations here are 6H and 4H. So for ethyl groups, each CH3 is 3H, so two would be 6
