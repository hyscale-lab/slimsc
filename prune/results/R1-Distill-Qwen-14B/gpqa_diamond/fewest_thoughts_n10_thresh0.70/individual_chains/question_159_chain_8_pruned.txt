Okay, so I have this question about a quasar and its observed spectrum, and I'm supposed to figure out the comoving distance from Earth based on certain cosmological parameters. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that observations of a quasar are being made in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. Wait, flux dropping at shorter wavelengths... I think this is related to the Lyman-alpha forest or something like that. Or maybe it's about the Lyman limit? Lyman-alpha is around 121 nm, which is in the UV. But I'm not sure how that ties into the comoving distance.

Wait, I remember that when we observe quasars, the flux in their spectra can be affected by intervening hydrogen clouds. The Lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines blueward (shorter wavelengths) of the quasar's emission lines, caused by neutral hydrogen in distant galaxies. These absorption lines indicate that the quasar's light is passing through various intergalactic clouds. But how does that affect the peak wavelength?

Oh, wait a second. The peak at 790 nm is probably the Lyman-alpha emission line redshifted. Lyman-alpha is 121.6 nm in the rest frame. So if it's observed at 790 nm, that must mean the quasar is redshifted. Let me calculate the redshift.

The formula for redshift is z = observed wavelength / rest wavelength - 1. So observed is 790 nm, rest is 121.6 nm.

Calculating z: 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.499. So z ≈6.5. Wait, that's a high redshift. High redshift usually means the object is very far away, since the universe is expanding.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance at scale factor a=1. Wait, scale factor a=1 is now, so the comoving distance is the distance today. Oh, but wait, comoving distance D_C is a way to measure distance in cosmology, considering the expansion of the universe.

The cosmological parameters given are Hubble constant H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ω_m=0.3, dark energy density Ω_lambda=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ω
