Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts here. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution. So, the setup is that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are given: the total cobalt is 1e-2 M, and SCN^- is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.

Wait, stability constants. Right, β is the formation constant, which tells us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. So, the higher β means the complex is more favored.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Hmm. Dithiocyanato would be [Co(SCN)_2]^something. Wait, the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ where n is the number of SCN- attached. So for dithiocyanato, n=2.

Wait, let's think about the possible complexes. The stability constants given are β1 to β4. So for each n:

β1 is for n=1: [Co(SCN)]^2+ → β1 = [CoSCN^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])

β2 would be for n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ → β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2)

Similarly, β3 is for n=3, and β4 for n=4.

Wait, but wait, sometimes the stability constants are cumulative. Oh right! The β values given are cumulative formation constants. So for each step, the formation of the next complex from the previous one.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. No, actually, the way the stability constants are presented can sometimes be either stepwise or cumulative. But in this case, the problem states they are the stability constants, which I think are the overall (cumulative) constants.

Wait, so for each complex, the stability constant is the product of the stepwise constants. So for example, to form [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, the β for that would be β1 * β2.

Wait no, perhaps not. Let me think again. The problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So each β is for the overall complex. So [Co(SCN)_1]^2+ has β1=9, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ has β2=40, [Co(SCN)_3]^2+ has β3=63, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2+ has β4=16.

Wait, but that can't be right because the β4 is lower than β3. So the stability decreases as n increases beyond 3? That seems odd. But maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe these are stepwise formation constants, not cumulative.

Wait, no. Let me think. If they are cumulative, then each β is for the overall complex. So [Co(SCN)_1]^2+ has β1=9, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ has β2=40, which would be the product of the first two stepwise constants. But that would only make sense if each β is cumulative.

Wait, but in some cases, the stability constants are given as stepwise, meaning each β is the constant for adding one more ligand. Like, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^2+ from Co^2+ and SCN^-, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ from [Co(SCN)]^2+ and SCN^-, and so on.

In that case, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ would be the product of β1, β2, ..., βn.

Wait, so the problem gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. So each of these is the stepwise formation constant.

Therefore, the overall stability constant for the first complex (n=1) is β1=9.

For the second complex (n=2), it's β1 * β2 = 9 *40=360.

n=3: 9*40*63= 9*40=360, 360 *63=22680.

n=4: 22680 *16= 362880.

Wait, but wait, the problem says β1=9, β2=40, up to β4=16. So for the fourth complex, the overall β is 9*40*63*16.

Hmm, but why is β4 lower than β3? That would imply that the stepwise addition of the fourth SCN^- is not favorable, which might not make sense. But perhaps the actual β4 is 16, so it's the product up to that point.

Wait, but the way the problem states the stability constants is that each β is for the respective complex, which suggests that they are cumulative.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's reread the problem.

"the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

So, each β corresponds to a different complex. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^2+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^2+, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2+.

So each β is the overall formation constant for that specific complex.

So, the formation of [Co(SCN)_1]^2+ is governed by β1=9.

The formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is governed by β2=40.

Wait, that's not possible because the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ would actually be β1 * β2, but the problem says β2 is 40, which is the overall for that complex.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if β1 is 9, and β2 is 40, then the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is 40, which would be higher than the first, but when you go to [Co(SCN)_3]^2+ with β3=63, it's even higher. Then β4=16, which is lower than β3. That would imply that the fourth complex is less stable than the third, which is possible, but a bit unusual.

But perhaps the way it's given is that each β is for the nth complex, so the overall β for each is as given.

In that case, the order of stability would be β3 (63) is the highest, then β2 (40), then β1 (9), and β4 (16) is lower than β3.

Wait, no. β3 is 63, β4 is 16. So the third complex is more stable than the fourth, which seems odd. But perhaps that's the way the problem is set up.

So, the problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

So, the task is to find the fraction of all cobalt species that are [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

So, the approach is to calculate the distribution of Co species in solution, considering all possible complexes (n=0,1,2,3,4).

But wait, considering that the solution has Co^2+ and SCN^-, the cobalt can form complexes with varying numbers of SCN^- ligands.

The total concentration of cobalt is [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_3]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_4]^2+ = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

Wait, but that's not entirely correct. Because each complex has a different charge, but in solution, the overall charge must balance. But perhaps for the sake of this problem, we can assume that the solution is neutral, and the counterion concentrations balance the charges. But I think for this problem, we can ignore the counterion concentrations because the problem is only concerned with the distribution of Co species, not the ions in solution.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using the stability constants to find the fraction of each species.

So, the general approach is to write the expressions for each species in terms of the free [Co^2+] and [SCN^-], then calculate the fraction of each species.

But since the SCN^- concentration is given as 0.1 M, which is much higher than the Co concentration (1e-2 M), the solution is probably in a regime where most of the Co is complexed.

But let's proceed step by step.

Each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ has a stability constant:

βn = [Co(SCN)_n^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n)

So, for each n, [Co(SCN)_n^2+] = βn * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n

But wait, no. Because each βn is the overall stability constant, regardless of the stepwise formation.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the stepwise and overall formation constants again.

Wait, let me clarify.

If the stability constants are given as β1, β2, etc., for each complex:

β1 = [CoSCN^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2)

β3 = [Co(SCN)_3^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3)

β4 = [Co(SCN)_4^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4)

So, each is the overall formation constant for that complex.

So, each species can be expressed as:

[CoSCN^2+] = β1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]

[Co(SCN)_2^2+] = β2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2

[Co(SCN)_3^2+] = β3 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^3

[Co(SCN)_4^2+] = β4 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^4

And the free Co^2+ is just [Co^2+].

So, the total concentration of all Co species is:

[Co_total] = [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-] + β2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^4

We can factor [Co^2+] out:

[Co_total] = [Co^2+] (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

But [Co_total] is given as 1e-2 M.

So, let's compute each term in the parenthesis.

Given:

[SCN^-] = 0.1 M

β1 =9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute each term:

Term1: 1

Term2: β1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term3: β2 * [SCN]^2 =40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

Term4: β3 * [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063

Term5: β4 * [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

Adding them up:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 + 0.4 =2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646

So, the sum is approximately 2.3646.

Thus,

[Co_total] = [Co^2+] * 2.3646 = 1e-2 M.

So,

[Co^2+] = 1e-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 4.225e-3 M.

Wait, let me compute that precisely.

1e-2 is 0.01.

0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

So, [Co^2+] ≈ 4.225e-3 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex can be found using the expressions above.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (n=2):

[Co(SCN)_2^2+] = β2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * 4.225e-3 * (0.1)^2

Compute:

40 * 4.225e-3 = 0.169.

Multiply by (0.1)^2 = 0.01: 0.169 * 0.01 = 0.00169 M.

So, [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.00169 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute each term more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the fraction of each species.

The fraction of each species is given by:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Because [Co^2+] is the same in each term, and when you take the ratio, it cancels out.

So, for each n, f_n = (βn [SCN]^n) / sum_terms.

Sum_terms is the denominator we calculated earlier: 2.3646.

So, for n=2, f_2 = (β2 [SCN]^2) / sum_terms.

So,

f_2 = (40 * (0.1)^2) / 2.3646.

Compute numerator:

40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

So f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169.

Which is about 16.9%. Wait, but looking at the options, D is 16.9%. But wait, the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, but in the complexes, which ones are blue?

Wait, I think that the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. Let me recall: in chemistry, the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is usually the one that's blue, but wait, wait. Hmm. Wait, I think I might be mixing up things. Wait, in the case of Co(II) complexes, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is typically a deep blue. But wait, in this problem, the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

Wait, but I might be making a mistake here about which complex is blue. Let me think again. For example, the famous CoCl2 is pink, and when SCN^- is added, it forms [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ complexes which have different colors. I believe [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is blue, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is more commonly known as a blue complex. Wait, but the question specifies "dithiocyanato" which refers to two SCN ligands, so it's [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. So perhaps that's the correct one.

But wait, the calculation I did for f_2 is 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So according to this, the percentage is about 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, another possibility is that I've made a mistake in considering the stepwise formation constants. Because in my initial approach, I treated each βn as the overall formation constant for that complex. But if the β values were stepwise, then the calculation would be different.

Wait, earlier I considered each βn as the overall stability constant for the n-th complex. But what if βn is the stepwise formation constant, meaning that β1 is for the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc.?

In that case, the overall β for the n=2 complex would be β1 * β2, and for n=3, β1*β2*β3, and so on.

So, let's reevaluate the problem under this assumption. Because this could change the results significantly.

If each βn is a stepwise formation constant, then the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ is the product of β1, β2, ..., βn.

So, in this case, the overall β for each complex would be:

β_total for n=1: β1 =9.

n=2: β1*β2=9*40=360.

n=3: 360 *63=22680.

n=4:22680 *16=362880.

So, the sum_terms would be:

1 + β1 [SCN] + (β1 β2) [SCN]^2 + (β1 β2 β3) [SCN]^3 + (β1 β2 β3 β4) [SCN]^4.

Let's compute each term.

[SCN] =0.1 M.

Term1:1

Term2: β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9

Term3: β1 β2 [SCN]^2 =360 *0.01=3.6

Term4: 22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 * 0.001=22.68

Term5: 362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288

Sum_terms =1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468

So sum_terms=64.468.

So, the fraction f_n is (β_total * [SCN]^n) / sum_terms.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^2+:

β_total = β1 * β2=360.

So,

f_2 = (360 * (0.1)^2) / 64.468 = (360 * 0.01) /64.468 = 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05556 or 5.556%.

Wait, but that's a different result. So which approach is correct?

Hmm, this is confusing. Now I'm not sure whether the given β values are stepwise or overall.

The question states, "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So, each βn is the stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^2+.

If stability constants are given for each complex, then each βn is the overall formation constant. So, the first approach is correct.

In that case, in the first approach, f_2 was ~16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, in the first approach, I assumed that each βn is the overall stability constant for that complex. So, [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ has a β of βn.

But looking back to the problem, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So, the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, which is what we're calculating f_2 for.

So, with the first approach, f_2 is 16.9% (option D), but according to the second approach, where βn are stepwise, f_2 is about 5.5%, which isn't one of the options. So that suggests that the first approach is the correct one.

But wait, the options include 38.1% and 25.6% which are higher than 16.9%.

Hmm. Let me double-check the first approach.

In the first approach, the sum_terms was 2.3646. So, for each f_n:

f_n = (βn [SCN]^n) / sum_terms.

So, let's compute each f_n.

f_0 = 1 / sum_terms ≈ 1/2.3646 ≈0.4225 or 42.25%.

f_1= (β1 [SCN]) / sum_terms = (9*0.1)/2.3646=0.9/2.3646≈0.381 or 38.1%.

f_2= (40 * (0.1)^2) /2.3646 = 0.4 /2.3646≈0.169 or 16.9%.

f_3= (63*(0.1)^3)/2.3646= (63*0.001)/2.3646=0.063/2.3646≈0.0266 or ~2.66%.

f_4= (16*(0.1)^4)/2.3646= (16*0.0001)/2.3646=0.0016/2.3646≈0.000676 or 0.0676%.

Adding all fractions:

42.25 +38.1 +16.9 +2.66 +0.0676 ≈100%.

That adds up correctly.

So the fractions are:

f_0:42.25%, f_1:38.1%, f_2:16.9%, etc.

Wait, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So which complex is blue? Earlier thought was [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is blue, which would be f_2=16.9% (option D). But wait, looking at the options, option C is 38.1%, which is the percentage for f_1. So perhaps I got the wrong complex.

Wait, perhaps the blue color is associated with [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (n=4?), but in our case, the complex with n=2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

Alternatively, maybe I had the wrong complex in mind. Let me think again: in the case of Co(II) and thiocyanate, the [Co(SCN)4]^2- is a deep blue color, which is the tetrathiocyanatocuprate(II) ion. But wait, Co^2+ with four SCN^- would have a charge of 2+ +4*(-1) = -2, which would be [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but in our case, the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^2+, which suggests n=2, charge 0? No, wait: for [Co(SCN)_n]^2+, the charge would be 2+ (from Co^2+) plus n*(-1) (from n SCN^-). So 2+ -n = charge.

Wait, for [Co(SCN)_n]^2+, the charge would be 2+ -n.

So for n=1: [CoSCN]^+, n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0, n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^-1, n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^−2.

Wait, but that's only possible if the counterions are present to balance the charge. But in the problem statement, the solution is just Co^2+ and SCN^-, but other ions (like Na+) might be present to balance charges. But perhaps that's beyond the scope.

So, the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would be neutral, but I think the blue color is more typically associated with [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, which would be n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

Wait, but in our problem statement, the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^2+. So, that would mean for n=2, the complex is neutral.

But, in real chemistry, the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is more common and is blue. So, perhaps in this problem, the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, which would be n=4.

Wait, but according to our first approach, the fraction for n=4 is 0.0676%, which is very small. So that can't be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about which complex is blue. Let me think again: perhaps [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is blue. Or maybe the blue is for [Co(SCN)_3]^−1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the calculations.

But according to the initial approach, the fractions are:

- f_0: ~42%
- f_1: ~38%
- f_2: ~17%
- f_3: ~2.66%
- f_4: ~0.06%

So, the largest fractions are f_0 and f_1.

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. So that's f_2=~16.9%, which is option D.

But looking at the options, option C is 38.1%, which is f_1, and option A is 42.3% (which is close to f_0).

Alternatively, perhaps the confusion is whether the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^2+, or [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}.

Wait, let's compute the charge correctly. Co^2+ has a charge of +2. Each SCN^- is -1. So, for n ligands, the charge would be 2+ -n *1- = 2−n.

So, for n=1: 2−1=+1 → [CoSCN]^+.

n=2: 2−2=0 → neutral.

n=3: −1 → [Co(SCN)_3]^−.

n=4: −2 → [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

But the problem statement says the solution contains Co^2+ and SCN^-. The complexes are given as [Co(SCN)_n]^2+.

Wait, that's not possible because for n=2, the charge would be 0, not +2. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]Cl_{something}, but the problem doesn't specify that.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^2+, but that would imply the charge is +2, which would only be possible if n=0 (just Co^2+). Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the problem actually has a typo, and the complexes have an overall charge of 0. So, perhaps the correct formula is [Co(SCN)_n], and the charge is 2−n. But the problem states [Co(SCN)_n]^2+.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that the problem is correct as written, and the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^2+.

So, for n=1: [CoSCN]^2+ → charge is +2.

Which would require that Co^2+ is +2, and SCN^- is -1 each. So, 2+ + (−1)*1 = +1. So, to have [CoSCN]^2+, perhaps two SCN^- are attached?

Wait, no, that would make n=2. So, I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's complexes have the form [Co(SCN)_n]Cl_m, but the charge on the complex ion is 2+.

Wait, perhaps the formula is [Co(SCN)_n]^{2+}, which would require that the charge is 2+.

So, Co^2+ has +2, and each SCN^- is -1. So, 2+ + (−1)*n = +2 → 2 −n = 2 → n=0. Which brings us back to Co^2+.

That can't be, so perhaps the problem's complexes are [Co(SCN)_n] with charge 2−n.

But given that, perhaps the problem's complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^2+, which would require n=0, which is just Co^2+.

This is getting me nowhere. Perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the problem's complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} and that the given βn are the overall formation constants.

But perhaps this is a futile effort, and I should proceed with the calculation as per the first approach, leading to option D (16.9%) as the answer. But looking back at the options, option C is 38.1%, which is the fraction for [CoSCN]^2+ (n=1).

Wait, but the question is about dithiocyanato complexes, which have two SCN ligands. So, n=2.

So, back to f_2=16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the question says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". So, perhaps the blue color is due to a different complex, like n=4, but in our calculation, the fraction is negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is wrong because I used the overall βn, but the correct approach is to use the stepwise βn.

Wait, perhaps I should try that again.

In the stepwise approach, each βn is the stepwise constant for adding the nth SCN^- to the (n-1)th complex.

So, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ is the product of β1 to βn.

So, for n=2, β_total = β1 * β2 =9 *40=360.

So, the fraction f_2 is (β_total [SCN]^2) / sum_terms.

Sum_terms in this case was 64.468.

So,

f_2 = (360 *0.01 ) /64.468 = (3.6)/(64.468) ≈0.05556 →5.556%, which is about 5.56%.

But this isn't one of the options. So, this suggests that the initial approach (each βn is the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^2+) is correct, leading to f_2=16.9% (option D).

But the options don't have 5.5%, which suggests that the initial approach (each βn is the overall) is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]^2+) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (β) and the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN^-.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: [Co_total] = 10⁻² M.
- Thiocyanate concentration: [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.
- Stability constants:  
  β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16.

### Approach:
1. **Stability Constants**: Each βₙ represents the overall stability constant for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]²⁺. The fraction of each cobalt species is given by:  
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k}
   \]
   where the denominator is the sum of contributions from all cobalt species.

2. **Sum Terms**:  
   Compute each term in the denominator:  
   - \( \beta_0 = 1 \), \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9 \),  
   - \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \),  
   - \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \),  
   - \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \).  

   Adding these:  
   \[
   \text{Sum} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

3. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]²⁺**:  
   The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is:  
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Sum}} = \frac{40 \times (0.1)^2}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]

4. **Percentage**:  
   Convert the fraction to a percentage:  
   \[
   f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]²⁺) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution is **16.9%**.
