Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule's energy states. Hmm, I remember from my studies that molecules can be modeled as quantum rotors and vibrators. The question is about the photon momentum needed for the molecule to switch to the next state when it absorbs a photon.

Let me read the question again. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. It can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model, so I guess this is a non-rigid rotor model. Wait, or is it the rigid rotor? No, the question specifies the non-rigid rotor model, which means the bond length can change a bit. But for this problem, maybe the bond length is given, so I can use it.

The problem gives masses Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. Oh wait, I need to work in SI units, so I have to convert amu to kilograms. One amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So Mx is 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg, and My is 2 * that.

Wait, but for the moment of inertia, I think I use the reduced mass. Right, because for a diatomic molecule, the moment of inertia is μ * R², where μ is the reduced mass. Oh, right, the reduced mass is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Let me calculate that.

Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.321e-26 kg.

My = 2 amu = 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 kg). Let me compute the denominator first: 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.653e-26 kg.

The numerator is (3.321e-26) * (3.321e-27) = approximately (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 = about 11.027e-53 kg².

Wait, wait, no, (3.321e-26) * (3.321e-27) = 3.321 * 3.321 = approx 11.027, and 1e-26 * 1e-27 = 1e-53. So 11.027e-53 kg².

So μ is 11.027e-53 / (3.653e-26) = let's compute that.

11.027e-53 / 3.653e-26 = (11.027 / 3.653) * 1e-27 ≈ 3 * 1e-27 ≈ 3e-27 kg. Wait, but let me do it more accurately.

3.653 is about 3.653e-26 kg. So 11.027e-53 divided by 3.653e-26 equals approximately (11.027 / 3.653) * 1e-27. Let me compute 11.027 / 3.653. Hmm, 3.653 *3 is 10.959, which is just under 11.027, so about 3.02 times. So 3.02e-27 kg. So around 3.02e-27 kg.

Wait, that's the reduced mass. Now, the moment of inertia I is μ * R². The bond length R is 2 angstroms. Oh wait, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R is 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ * R² = (3.02e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Calculating (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m². So I = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

Okay, so I have the moment of inertia. Now, the problem mentions the quantum rotation-vibration
