Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about binary compounds of fluorine with some element Y. Hmm, I need to figure out what Y is and then determine the molecular weight range for substance A4. Let me read through the question again carefully.

So, there are five binary compounds of fluorine and Y. The substances A1 to A5 have various properties. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think that refers to oxidation state of fluorine or maybe the formula?) is 31.96% for A2. Wait, the formula mass of fluorine is about 19, so 31.96% could be the mass percentage. Let me see: 31.96% of what? Oh, maybe the formula of A2 has fluorine in a certain oxidation state. Or perhaps it's the percentage composition. Let me think.

When A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and F2. So the decomposition reaction could be something like A1 → A2 + F2. Since A1 is a compound of Y and F, A2 must be another compound of Y and F. Wait, but fluorine is a diatomic molecule, so maybe the decomposition produces YF something and F2.

Next, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so being oxidized suggests that A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so maybe A1 is a fluorine compound of Y that's quite reactive.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So A3 is YF something. Also, A3 can interact with xenon, which probably means it's a reactive compound as well.

Then, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4, A5 is formed. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So maybe A5 is a salt, like YF4 or something, that when it dissolves in water, it dissociates into ions.

Wait, let's try to find Y. The key is probably that Y forms five binary compounds with F.
