Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when an operator is applied. So the operator P acting on the eigenvector gives (eigenvalue) times the eigenvector.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. So the full operator P would be the vector sum in the direction of n. Since n lies in the x-z plane, it must be along some angle θ from the x-axis towards the z-axis. So n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps? Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, and the direction is determined by θ.

So the operator P would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction vector. That is, P = n · σ (where σ are the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2 maybe). Wait, no, wait. Each component P_x, P_y, P_z is given as ħ/2 times a matrix. Let me see: 

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]], which is the same as (ħ/2) σ_x. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) [[0, -i],[i, 0]] = (ħ/2) σ_y, and Pz is (ħ/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]] = (ħ/2) σ_z. So the operator P is given by P = n · (σ · (ħ/2)) ?

Wait, more precisely, since n is a direction vector, the operator P would be (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). 

But wait, the problem says the operator is for a muon along
