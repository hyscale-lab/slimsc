Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is asking for the eigenvector of the operator P along an arbitrary direction n, which is in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P is given in terms of its components: Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, so P is a vector operator, right? So when they ask for the eigenvector along direction n, that probably means we're looking at the operator P·n, because the operator along an arbitrary direction is the component of P in that direction. So the operator we're considering is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

But wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. So the direction vector can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since it lies in the x-z plane. So n_y is zero. That simplifies things because Py would then have no effect, right? So the operator P·n would be P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

Because n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. So the operator becomes P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z.

Now, each component of P is multiplied by ħ/2. So let me write down the matrices:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Since n is in x-z, n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So the operator P·n would be (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

Wait, because:

P_x n_x = (ħ/2) [ [0, n_x], [n_x,
