Alright, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Okay, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs, right? So like, if parallax plx is in arcseconds, then distance r is about 1/plx parsecs. Wait, is that correct? Or is it the other way around? Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by the distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/r, which means r = 1/plx. 

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting that in... let's see. N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. 1 over (1/r)^5 is the same as (r)^5, because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so the reciprocal is r^5.

So N is proportional to r^5. Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, wait, that's the derivative, right? Because it's asking about the change, not the total number. Wait, no, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)"? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Because if N is proportional to r^5, then for a small change in r (like a unit distance), the change in N would be the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, but maybe the question is more about the relation between N and r, not the rate of change. Let me read the question again. It says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)." Oh, so it's about the variation—like, for each additional unit of distance, how does the number change? So perhaps it's about the differential change, which would be the derivative. But maybe it's just the relation in terms of r.

Wait, the initial statement is that N varies as
