Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax is usually inversely related to distance, right? Because parallax (plx) is 1 over distance, so distance r is 1 over plx. Oh wait, I think the formula is plx = 1 / (distance in parsecs). So r is proportional to 1/plx.

The problem is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So, for a given small range of r, like dr, how does the number of stars, let's say dN, change? 

They gave that the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, 1/plx is r. So 1/plx^5 is r^5. That would mean N is proportional to r^5. Wait, but I need to be careful here. Let me think again.

Wait, no, wait. Let me write down the relations step by step. Parallax (plx) is 1/r, where r is in parsecs. So plx = 1/r. So r = 1/plx.

The number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. So N ‚àù 1/(plx)^5. Substituting r in terms of plx, since
