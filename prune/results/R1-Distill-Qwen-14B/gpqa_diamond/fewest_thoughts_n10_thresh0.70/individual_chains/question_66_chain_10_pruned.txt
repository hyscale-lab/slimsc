Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices given are combinations of these, and I have to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, meaning it's based on the Standard Model but includes higher-dimensional operators to account for beyond the Standard Model physics. Effective theories are usually built by adding terms that are consistent with the symmetries of the underlying theory, but I'm not entirely sure which symmetries those are.

Let me start by recalling what each symmetry means.

Lorentz symmetry: This is the symmetry of special relativity, where the laws of physics are the same for all observers in inertial frames. Operators in a Lorentz-invariant theory must transform in a way that respects the Lorentz group. So, any operator in SMEFT should be constructed to transform correctly under Lorentz transformations.

Poincare symmetry: This includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's like the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. If a theory is Poincare invariant, it's also Lorentz invariant. Now wait, does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry? Since SMEFT is based on the Standard Model, which is a Poincare-invariant theory, I think the SMEFT operators must also respect Poincare symmetry. But wait, SMEFT is an effective field theory, which typically lives at a certain scale and includes all possible operators consistent with the underlying symmetries. So the underlying SM has Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT must respect that as well.

CP symmetry: This is charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) combined. If a theory has CP symmetry, then the laws are the same under the simultaneous reversal of charge and parity. But I don't think SMEFT necessarily must have CP symmetry. The Standard Model isn't CP symmetricâ€”its CKM matrix has complex phases leading to CP violation. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, meaning they don't have to respect CP symmetry.

CPT symmetry: This is the combination of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). I remember that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because in quantum field theory, the LSZ formalism and the structure of the S-matrix require that. So any operator in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry if the theory is to be Lorentz-invariant. Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry is automatically respected.

So putting it together: which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect?

- Lorentz symmetry (1): Yes, since it's part of the structure.
- Poincare symmetry (2): Yes, because it's part of the underlying SM and the effective theory must respect it.
Wait, but wait a sec. SMEFT is an effective theory, so it's built by adding operators to the SM. So the SM already respects Poincare symmetry. Therefore, the SMEFT operators must be Poincare-invariant as well. So 1 and 2 must be respected.

Wait, but wait
