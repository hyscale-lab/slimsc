Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again and jot down the key points.

So, the setup: an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams is heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they form a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through three tubes: the first has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second is a Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third has red-hot copper. The results are that tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g, and tube 2 doesn't change. Then, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temp and pressure.

Hmm. I need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are from 13 to 19, so I think the total moles might be around there.

Let me try to break this down. The gases are passed through these tubes. The first tube with Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, but wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is actually a deliquescent and can act as a desiccant. But in this case, it's anhydrous, so maybe it's reacting with something. Oh wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb water, but in this case, when gases pass through, perhaps the Mg(ClO4)2 is absorbing some moisture, but I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, since it's anhydrous, maybe it's reacting with a gas that has water or some other compound.

Wait, the key here is that tube 1's weight increased by 3.60g. So gas must have reacted with Mg(ClO4)2. Mg(ClO4)2 is used in the drying of gases, but when it absorbs water, it forms Mg(ClO4)2·xH2O. Alternatively, maybe the gas is water vapor, but in that case, the Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it, increasing the tube's weight. Or perhaps the gas is something else, like HCl, which would react with Mg(ClO4)2?

Alternatively, thinking about gas absorption, when HCl gas passes through Mg(ClO4)2, it would react. Mg(ClO4)2 + 2 HCl → MgCl2 + 2 HClO4? Wait, but MgCl2 is a solid, and HClO4 is a liquid. But I'm not sure about that reaction. Alternatively, maybe Mg(ClO4)2 reacts with HCl to form MgCl2 and HClO4. But if that's the case, then the reaction would produce HClO4, which is a strong acid and would maybe not be absorbed. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Moving on, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. If a gas is passed through a solution of Ca(OH)2, it might precipitate something or not. If the gas doesn't react with the solution, the weight wouldn't change. The problem says the weight of tube 2 didn't change, so the gas didn't react with Ca(OH)2 solution. What gases don't react with Ca(OH)2 solution? Well, CO2 would react, forming CaCO3 precipitate. H2 would react as well. HCl would react, producing CaCl2 and water. NH3 would react, forming Ca(OH)2? Wait, no, NH3 is a weak base and would react with Ca(OH)2? Wait, no, Ca(OH)2 is already a strong base. Maybe the gas isn't acidic or basic enough to react. If the gas is neutral, like maybe N2 or O2 or something else, then it wouldn't react, so the solution's weight wouldn't change. Alternatively, maybe it's a noble gas, but I don't think that's likely.

Then tube 3 has red-hot copper. The gas passed through it caused the weight to increase by 0.80g, and CuO was formed. So what gases react with hot copper? Well, CO would react with CuO to form CO2 and Cu, but wait, no, it's the other way around. CO is a reducing agent. If the gas is CO, it would react with CuO to form CO2 and Cu. But in this case, the copper is red-hot, so maybe the gas is reacting with oxygen? Or perhaps the gas is a combination that includes CO, which reduces the copper oxide.

Wait, but the problem states that the tube's weight increased. So when a gas reacts with the hot copper, if it's gaining mass, that suggests that the gas is being oxidized, and perhaps releasing some other gas. Alternatively, maybe the gas is being consumed, but the products are heavier.

Wait, another angle: red-hot copper is in tube 3, and the gas passes through. So perhaps the gas is H2S? But H2S doesn't react with hot copper. Or maybe it's a reducing gas like H2, which would react with CuO to form water and Cu. Let's think: CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. But if H2 is passing through, it would reduce CuO. However, the mass of the tube increases. Wait, when H2 reacts with CuO, the products are Cu and H2O. But in what form? If the reaction occurs in a tube, and the products are water vapor and solid Cu, then the water might condense, increasing the mass. So, for example, 2 moles of H2 and 1 mole of CuO would produce 2 moles of H2O and 1 mole of Cu. The mass change would be from H2 to H2O. Let's calculate that.

Molar masses: H2 is 2 g/mol, H2O is 18 g/mol. So 2 moles H2 (4g) → 2 moles H2O (36g). So the mass increases by 32g (36-4=32) per mole of H2. But in our case, the mass increased by 0.80g. Let's see: if x is the moles of H2, then 36 - 2x = 0.80? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Each mole of H2 would add (18 - 2) = 16 g (since 2H2 + CuO → 2H2O + Cu). Wait, wait, no. Let me write the balanced equation: CuO(s) + H2(g) → Cu(s) + H2O(g). So for each mole of H2 consumed, you produce 18g of H2O (as gas?), but the mass of the solid Cu would be 64g per mole. Wait, but the initial mass of the copper is probably much more, so perhaps the mass change is just due to the H2O. Alternatively, maybe the H2O is condensing on the tube, so the mass increases.

So, if H2 is reacting with CuO, the mass change would be 18g H2O minus the mass of H2 consumed. Let me calculate: for each mole of H2, 2g consumed, 18g H2O produced. So net gain is 16g. If the
