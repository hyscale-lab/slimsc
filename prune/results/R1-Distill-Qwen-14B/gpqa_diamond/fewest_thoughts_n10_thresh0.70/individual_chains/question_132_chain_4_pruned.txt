Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a solution that's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds. Both have the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. We have to choose which two compounds are present from the given options.

First, I should think about the structure of the compounds. All the options are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, wait, diethyl is C2H5 groups, right? So 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups attached to the benzene ring.

The molecular formula is C10H14. Let's confirm each option's formula. For tetramethylbenzenes, each methyl is CH3. So four methyl groups would be 4*3=12 H, plus the benzene's 6 H: 18 H. But the formula given is C10H14. Oh wait, benzene is C6H6. So four methyl groups would add 4* (C1H3) = C4H12. So total C6+4= C10, and H: 6 (benzene) + 12 = 18. But the formula is C10H14, which has 14 H. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Each benzene ring has 6 C and 6 H. If we have four methyl groups (each CH3), that's 4*3=12 H. So benzene (6 H) + 12 H = 18 H. But the formula is 14 H, so that's 4 H less. So maybe some substituents are taking H away? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are not all methyl?

Wait no, the options are all tetram
