Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², which I remember is the harmonic oscillator potential. The force here follows Hooke's law, which makes sense because F = -k r, and in this case, k must be m ω².

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy eigenvalue.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, especially in the harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized. For a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. But since it's isotropic, the energy depends on the radial part, I think.

Wait, right! In 3D, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0,1,2,...). Or wait, is it that the principal quantum number is different? Oh wait, no, in 3D, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Let's think.

In the harmonic oscillator, each direction (x, y, z) contributes a quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z. Each of these can be 0,1,2,... and the total energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, people sometimes denote the total sum as n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then E = (n + 3/2) ħω. So the energy levels are determined by n, which is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, but another way to think about this is in terms of radial quantum numbers, especially for a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator. Oh right, because in spherical coordinates, the energy levels can also be described by the principal quantum number N, where N = 2n_r + l + 1. Wait, no. Wait, in the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy depends not just on the radial part but also on the angular momentum, but
