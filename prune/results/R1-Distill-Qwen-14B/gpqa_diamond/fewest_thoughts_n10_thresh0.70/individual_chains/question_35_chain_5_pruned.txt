Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, Ay. They say Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and it's given by c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π). And the matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and then determine which statement is correct based on that.

First, I should probably write down the matrix for Ay. Let's see, c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. So S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Therefore, Ay would be:

[ 0    -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))    0 ]

But wait, maybe I should calculate that scaling. Let me double-check: multiplying each element by c, so the elements become 0 and -i*(h/4π), and i*(h/4π) and 0.

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue. The matrix Ay - a I would be:

[-a       -(i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -a ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (i h)/(4π) * (-i h)/(4π) ) ].

Wait, determinant is (Ay - a I)_{11}*(Ay - a I)_{22} - (Ay - a I)_{12}*(Ay - a I)_{21}.

So that would be (a^2) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ].

Let's compute the off-diagonal term: (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) = (-i^2) (h^2)/(16 π²) )

Wait, no, the product is (i h/(4π)) * ( -i h/(4π) ) because Ay - a I's (1,2) element is -(i h)/(4π), and (2,1) is (i h)/(4π). So when you multiply them, it's [ (i h/4π) ) * ( -i h/4π ) ] for the cross terms.

Wait, the product would be (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) = (i * -i) * (h^2)/(16 π²) )

i * (-i) is -i^2. Since i^2 is -1, this becomes - (-1) = 1. So the product is (1)*(h²)/(16 π²)
