Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Let me try to unpack what's being asked here. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y. 

First, let me read the problem again carefully. The operator A_y is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. So the matrix S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And A_y = c * S, so substituting c, it becomes:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Hmm, wait, but I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices used in quantum mechanics. Let me recall them. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Oh wait, so S here is actually the Pauli Y matrix. So S is σ_y, which is [[0, -i],[i,0]].

Right, so A_y is (h/(4π)) multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix. Pauli matrices have some known properties. Their eigenvalues are ±1, I think, because they square to the identity matrix. Let me confirm that. The Pauli matrices satisfy σ_i² = I for i = x, y, z. So S^2 = I.

So A_y² = (c)^2 * S² = c² * I. Then, the eigenvalues of A_y squared will be c² * eigenvalues of I, which are 1 and 1 (since I is the identity matrix). Wait, no, no. Wait, when you square A_y, (c S)^2 = c² S² = c² I. So the eigenvalues of A_y squared are c² * 1 and c² * 1, but that can't be right because S itself has eigenvalues ±1, so A_y would have eigenvalues ±c.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's compute the eigenvalues of A_y. The eigenvalues of S are ±1 because S is a Pauli matrix. So the eigenvalues of c S are c * (±1), which would be ±c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues a would be ±h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, the options B and A are talking about parts of the eigenvalues. Let's see the options again.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are +2πh or –2πh, real parts are +h/(4π) or –h/(4π). Hmm, that can’t be right because the eigenvalues of A_y should be real. Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so S is Hermitian. Because S^† = S for a Hermitian matrix. Let me check S's conjugate transpose. S is [[0, -i], [i,
