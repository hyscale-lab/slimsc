Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles and Lorentz factors. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it step by step.

Alright, the setup: particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Wait, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction. Since these particles are moving at a high speed, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame would be longer due to time dilation. But how does that tie into how far they travel before decaying?

Oh right, the distance a particle travels before decaying depends on its lifetime and speed. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau). So the proper lifetime is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame, and in the lab frame, it's gamma * tau.

The distance the particle travels is velocity * time. Velocity is approximately the speed of light c for ultra-relativistic particles. So, distance = c * gamma * tau.

Wait, but the problem says that one third of the particles reach the inner walls when gamma is 20. So for a gamma of 20, the distance they travel on average is such that one third make it to 30 meters. Then, when gamma increases, the average distance they travel increases, so more of them will reach the walls.

Wait, but the problem says that when gamma is 20, one third reach the walls. We need to find the gamma where two-thirds reach the walls. So the average distance needs to be enough that two-thirds make it.

Let me think about the relationship between the number of particles that reach the wall and their average lifetime. So, the survival probability is a function of the mean lifetime. If the mean path length is longer than the detector's radius, more particles will reach the wall.

Wait, the average distance a particle travels before decaying is the mean decay length,
