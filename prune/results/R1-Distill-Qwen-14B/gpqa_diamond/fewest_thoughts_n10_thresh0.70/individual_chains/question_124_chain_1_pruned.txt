Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Initially, particles have a Lorentz factor of about 20, and on average, one third of them reach the inner walls. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds reach the walls.

Hmm, so I remember that the Lorentz factor is gamma (γ), which is given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But in this problem, maybe I don't need to calculate γ directly but instead relate it to the distance the particles travel.

Wait, the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities. That usually means that their velocity is very close to the speed of light. So maybe I can approximate their speed as c, but I'm not sure yet. Let's think about how long the particles take to reach the detector walls.

The particles are produced at the center of the sphere, so the distance they need to travel to reach the inner walls is equal to the radius of the detector. So that's 30 meters.

The time it takes for a particle to reach the wall would be the distance divided by their velocity. But in relativity, time can be affected by the Lorentz factor. Oh, wait, but in the lab frame, the time would be t = r / v.

But how does the Lorentz factor come into play here? Oh right, the lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime (due to time dilation). So the proper lifetime is tau, and the lab lifetime is gamma * tau.

Wait, but the problem says that particles decay before reaching the wall or not. So the fraction that reaches the wall depends on whether their lifetime is longer than the time it takes them to travel the radius.

So, the particles are fast-decaying, meaning their lifetime is short. So the probability that a particle reaches the wall is based on whether the lab lifetime is longer than the time it takes to travel 30 meters.

So, the lab lifetime is gamma * tau. The time they have is t = 30 / v. But at ultra-relativistic speeds, v is approximately c. So t ≈ 30 / c.

Wait, but wait, for a given gamma, how does that relate to t? Because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which can be rearranged. Let me see: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) → gamma² = 1/(1 - v²/c²) → 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma² → v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

But if gamma is large (like 20), then 1/gamma² is small, and v ≈ c. So perhaps I can approximate v as c. But maybe I shouldn't approximate yet. Let me think.

The proper lifetime of the particle is tau. The lab lifetime is gamma * tau. So the time available for the

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles and Lorentz factors. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it step by step.

Alright, the setup: particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Wait, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction. Since these particles are moving at a high speed, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame would be longer due to time dilation. But how does that tie into how far they travel before decaying?

Oh right, the distance a particle travels before decaying depends on its lifetime and speed. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau). So the proper lifetime is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame, and in the lab frame, it's gamma * tau.

The distance the particle travels is velocity * time. Velocity is approximately the speed of light c for ultra-relativistic particles. So, distance = c * gamma * tau.

Wait, but the problem says that one third of the particles reach the inner walls when gamma is 20. So for a gamma of 20, the distance they travel on average is such that one third make it to 30 meters. Then, when gamma increases, the average distance they travel increases, so more of them will reach the walls.

Wait, but the problem says that when gamma is 20, one third reach the walls. We need to find the gamma where two-thirds reach the walls. So the average distance needs to be enough that two-thirds make it.

Let me think about the relationship between the number of particles that reach the wall and their average lifetime. So, the survival probability is a function of the mean lifetime. If the mean path length is longer than the detector's radius, more particles will reach the wall.

Wait, the average distance a particle travels before decaying is the mean decay length,
