Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Initially, particles have a Lorentz factor of about 20, and on average, one third of them reach the inner walls. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds reach the walls.

Hmm, so I remember that the Lorentz factor is gamma (γ), which is given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But in this problem, maybe I don't need to calculate γ directly but instead relate it to the distance the particles travel.

Wait, the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities. That usually means that their velocity is very close to the speed of light. So maybe I can approximate their speed as c, but I'm not sure yet. Let's think about how long the particles take to reach the detector walls.

The particles are produced at the center of the sphere, so the distance they need to travel to reach the inner walls is equal to the radius of the detector. So that's 30 meters.

The time it takes for a particle to reach the wall would be the distance divided by their velocity. But in relativity, time can be affected by the Lorentz factor. Oh, wait, but in the lab frame, the time would be t = r / v.

But how does the Lorentz factor come into play here? Oh right, the lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime (due to time dilation). So the proper lifetime is tau, and the lab lifetime is gamma * tau.

Wait, but the problem says that particles decay before reaching the wall or not. So the fraction that reaches the wall depends on whether their lifetime is longer than the time it takes them to travel the radius.

So, the particles are fast-decaying, meaning their lifetime is short. So the probability that a particle reaches the wall is based on whether the lab lifetime is longer than the time it takes to travel 30 meters.

So, the lab lifetime is gamma * tau. The time they have is t = 30 / v. But at ultra-relativistic speeds, v is approximately c. So t ≈ 30 / c.

Wait, but wait, for a given gamma, how does that relate to t? Because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which can be rearranged. Let me see: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) → gamma² = 1/(1 - v²/c²) → 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma² → v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

But if gamma is large (like 20), then 1/gamma² is small, and v ≈ c. So perhaps I can approximate v as c. But maybe I shouldn't approximate yet. Let me think.

The proper lifetime of the particle is tau. The lab lifetime is gamma * tau. So the time available for the
