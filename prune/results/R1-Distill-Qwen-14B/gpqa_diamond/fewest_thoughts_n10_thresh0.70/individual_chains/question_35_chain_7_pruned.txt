Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me go through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The setup says that Ay equals c multiplied by the S matrix. Oh wait, c is h over 4π, right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, spin matrices for spin-1/2 particles are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, and each of them is a 2x2 matrix. Oh, right! The S matrix here looks a lot like the Pauli Y matrix. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches exactly with S as given. So S is σy.

So the operator Ay is c multiplied by σy. Now, c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

But I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. I remember that when you have a matrix operator, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and a is the eigenvalue.

Alternatively, since
