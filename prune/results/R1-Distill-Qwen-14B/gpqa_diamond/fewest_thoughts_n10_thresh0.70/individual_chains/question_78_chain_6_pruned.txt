Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in an electromagnetic field due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I need to figure out the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain point and time. Let me try to remember what I know about this.

The question says that a charge q is moving with some trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at time t where t is greater than tr, the time when the field was generated. So, the field observed at t is due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr. 

Wait, the setup involves vectors. The field point is r, and the vector d is from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. So, the distance between them is d, I think. Or maybe d is a vector, so |d| would be the distance. Oh, right, the vector d is from the charge's position at tr to r. So, if the charge was at position s(tr) at time tr, then d is r - s(tr). Got it.

So the charge's velocity at time tr is v. Now, I remember that potentials are related to the charge's position and velocity. For a stationary charge, the scalar potential is V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of the fields from its motion—like the magnetic field due to current.

Wait, the scalar potential and vector potential in the Lorenz gauge are given by certain expressions. Or maybe I should think about how the potentials transform when the charge is moving. Oh, right! The potentials depend on both the charge's position and its velocity.

In the context of retarded potentials, I think the scalar potential V has a term involving the charge's position and the vector potential A involves the velocity. But wait, the question provides options, so perhaps I should recall the exact forms.

Let me think about the scalar potential. For a charge moving with velocity v, the scalar potential isn't just q/(4πε₀ r), because the charge's motion affects the potentials. No, wait, actually, the scalar potential might still have a similar form but with some correction. Or maybe not, because the scalar potential is more about the electrostatic part, while the vector potential is about the magnetostatic part.

Wait
