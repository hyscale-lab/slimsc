Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields, and these are related to the scalar and vector potentials, respectively.

The question is asking about the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t, given that the charge q is moving with some trajectory. The options are A to D, each giving expressions for V and A. I need to figure out which pair is correct.

Let me start by recalling what I know about scalar and vector potentials. The scalar potential, V, is related to the electric field. The electric field E is the negative gradient of V. For a static charge distribution, V is straightforward, like Coulomb's law. But when the charge is moving, things get a bit more complicated because of the effects of relativity and the motion itself.

The vector potential A is linked to the magnetic field B via the curl of A. So when a charge is moving, it can produce a magnetic field, hence a non-zero A.

Wait, but in the case of a single moving charge, do we have static fields or do we have to consider retarded potentials? Oh right, because the fields are transmitted at the speed of light, the potentials at a point depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time. This is the retarded time concept.

So, the scalar potential for a moving charge would be similar to Coulomb's law but evaluated at the retarded time. The vector potential would involve the velocity of the charge at that retarded time.

I remember that the scalar potential V due to a charge q moving with velocity v at retarded time tr is given by something like V = q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge at that time to the observation point. But wait, when the charge is moving, how does that affect the distance? Oh, there's a term involving the velocity in the denominator, right?

Wait, the general expression for the scalar potential when the charge is moving is V = q/(4πε₀ (r - (v/c²) t_ret)), where t_ret is the retarded time. Or is it something else? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form.

Similarly, for the vector potential A, I think it's given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) multiplied by some terms involving the velocity and the distance. Oh, because A is proportional to the velocity of the charge.

Wait, more specifically, the vector potential is found using the formula A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π (r² - (v t)^2))^(1/2) or something like that. Or perhaps it's (μ₀ q v)/(4π (r - (v/c²) t)) ), but I'm not exactly sure.

Looking at the options, option C and D have denominators with terms like (d c - d · v) and (d c + d · v), respectively. Wait, d is the vector from the field generation point (at time tr) to the observation point r. Oh, so d = r - s(tr), where s(tr) is the position of the charge at time tr.

So
