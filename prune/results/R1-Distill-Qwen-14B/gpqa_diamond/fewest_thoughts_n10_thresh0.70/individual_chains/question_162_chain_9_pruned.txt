Okay, so I have this metric given, and I need to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The metric provided is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks familiar. I think this is a two-dimensional metric, so we're dealing with a 2D spacetime or maybe a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, but for the purposes of area, I guess it's a 2D surface.

Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. But how does that relate to the metric? I remember that the metric can tell us about the geometry of the space. So, the form of the metric might indicate something about the curvature.

Let me see, the standard metric for a sphere in 2D is usually something like (dr² + r² dθ²) but scaled by some factor due to curvature. But this metric is written in terms of x and y, so maybe it's a coordinate system that's not the usual polar coordinates.

Wait, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So, that would imply that x² + y² < 4, because otherwise the denominator becomes zero or negative, which might cause problems. So, the domain of this metric is the region where x² + y² < 4, which is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. But this is a pseudosphere,
