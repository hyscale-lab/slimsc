Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks kind of like a 2-dimensional metric, right? So it's probably describing a surface in some way.

Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. I remember that in hyperbolic geometry, the pseudosphere is like the classic example. But how does that relate to the metric here?

Let me recall: the metric for a pseudosphere (or hyperbolic space) in 2D is usually written in terms of Poincaré coordinates. The standard metric is ds² = (dx² + dy²)/(z²), but wait, that's in 3D for the hyperboloid. Alternatively, in 2D, the Poincaré disk model has ds² = (4 dx² + 4 dy²)/( (1 - (x² + y²))^2 ). Hmm, but that's for the unit disk model. 

Wait, but the given metric here has a denominator (4 - x² - y²). That looks similar but scaled. Let me think about the form. The standard Poincaré disk for radius a has the metric ds² = (4a² (dx² + dy²)) / (a² - (x² + y²))². So if a is 2, because the radius r is 2, then the denominator would be (4 - x² - y²), and the numerator would be 32 dx² + 32 dy² because 4a² is 16 when a=2, but wait, no. Let me compute that again.

Wait, 4a² is 4*(2)^2 = 16. So the numerator is 16 (dx² + dy²), and the denominator is (4 - x² - y²)^2. But in the given metric, it's 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So that suggests that the given metric is different. Wait, 32 is 2*16. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the metric is in a different form. Alternatively, maybe scaling the coordinates. Alternatively, perhaps the coordinate system is different.

Wait, maybe I should think about the area element. The area of the pseudosphere is usually infinite because it's a surface of infinite extent, right? Like, it's a hyperbolic plane which has infinite area, just like the Euclidean plane. But wait, no—pseudosphere is a finite surface? Or is it? Wait, no. Wait, the standard pseudosphere (like the tractricoid) is a finite area surface, but that's a different thing. Wait no—maybe I'm confusing the tractricoid, which is a surface embedded in 3D, with finite area. But in 2D hyperbolic geometry, the entire hyperbolic plane has infinite area. Oh wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm.

Wait, the area in the metric for a 2D hyperbolic space. Let me think about the area element. The area element would be sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. So the metric is diagonal, with g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

So the area element is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy. Wait, no, the square root of the determinant is sqrt( (32/(4 - x² - y²))² ) which is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element is 32 dx dy/(4 - x² - y²).

But what's the region of integration? The metric is defined where the denominator is positive, so 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² <4. So it's defined on the disk of radius 2. So the area would be the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32 dx dy/(4 - x² - y²)].

Let me compute that. We can switch to polar coordinates. x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So the integral becomes:

Integral from θ=0 to 2π, r=0 to 2 of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So let's factor constants out. The integral is 32 * 2π * ∫ from 0 to 2 of [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Compute the integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr. So the integral becomes ∫ (-1/2) (1/u) du.

So ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = (-1/2) ln|u| + C = (-1/2) ln(4 - r²) + C.

Evaluate from 0 to 2:

At r=2, 4 - r²=0 → ln(0) is -infinity. Wait, but when r approaches 2 from below, 4 - r² approaches 0 from positive, so ln approaches -infty. So the integral from 0 to 2 of [r/(4 - r²)] dr is [ (-1/2)( ln(0) ) + (1/2) ln(4) ) ].

Wait, ln(0) is negative infinity, so the whole thing becomes [ (infinite)
