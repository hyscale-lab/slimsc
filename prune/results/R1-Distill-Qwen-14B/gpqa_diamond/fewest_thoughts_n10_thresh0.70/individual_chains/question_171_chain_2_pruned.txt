Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that in such reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions. The substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they can be ortho/para directors or meta directors.

The question asks me to arrange six substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed when they undergo bromination with excess bromine. Only one monobromo derivative is formed, so each will produce para and maybe some ortho and meta products, but since it's excess, maybe it's just the major product? Wait, but the question mentions "only one monobromo derivative is formed"—wait, no, wait, the question says that only one monobromo derivative is formed for each substance. No, wait, no, the question says that each undergoes the reaction and forms one monobromo derivative. Or wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read again.

Wait, the question says: "only one monobromo derivative is formed." Oh, so each reaction produces a single product. That makes more sense. So for each substance, when brominated, only one product is formed. Therefore, the position of substitution is fixed. So I need to find for each substituent, where the bromine adds.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because in most cases, you get multiple products. Unless there's a directing effect so that the major product is only one. Or perhaps in some cases, the substitution is such that only para is formed. But wait, some substituents might cause substitution only in the para position, but I think that's only when there's a strong para-directing group and the molecule is symmetrical enough that the ortho positions are equivalent, leading to either para or meta, but that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe the question is about the yield of the para-isomer—meaning, for each compound, how much of the para product is formed. So for each compound, bromination occurs, and the product can be a mix of para, ortho, and meta. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So the more para-selective the substitution, the higher the weight fraction of the para product.

So, the task is to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of para-isomer. So from least para to most para.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each option is a sequence of the six compounds.

Let me list the six compounds:

1) C6H5-CH3 (methylbenzene, toluene)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethy benzene, but wait, that's same as toluene but with ethyl group. Wait no, C6H5-CH2CH3, ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

First, I need to determine for each substituent, whether it's activating or deactivating,
