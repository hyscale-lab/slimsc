Okay, let's try to figure out this IUPAC naming problem. So, the question describes a benzene ring with several substituents, and I need to determine the correct name from the options given. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, the molecule has a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group. Wait, the parent chain here is benzoic acid because the carboxylic acid is attached to the ring, making it the principal functional group. So the numbering should start from the carboxylic acid as position 1 or the substituents are numbered relative to it.

The substituents are all meta to each other. So, the three groups—carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano—are in the meta positions. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the question says that the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to one another. So each of these groups is at a position that's three apart from the others? Or maybe each pair is meta.

Wait, benzene has six positions. If all three are meta, maybe each is at positions 1, 3, and 5? But that doesn't seem to fit because the other substituents are ortho and para to the carboxylic acid.

Wait, the question also states that ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. So, if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the hydroxyl and dimethyl amino are at positions 2 and 6 (since ortho is adjacent, positions 2 and 6) or positions 2 and 4? No, wait, wait. Let me get the numbering right.

Actually, in benzoic acid, the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, positions 2 and 6 are ortho, 3 and 5 are meta, and 4 is para.

Wait, but the question says the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, ortho to it are a hydroxyl (OH) and a dimethyl amino group (N(CH3)2). So, positions 2 and 6 would have these groups. Wait, but let me confirm: in benzoic acid, the substituents are numbered based on the position relative to the carboxylic acid group. So, the carboxylic acid is in position 1. Then, the adjacent carbons (2 and 6) are ortho; the next (3 and 5) are meta; and 4 is para.

So, the hydroxyl and dimethyl amino are ortho to the carboxylic acid. So, let's say they are at positions 2 and 6.

Wait, but wait: the question says ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. So, both at positions 2 and 6? But what about the other substituents?

The para position (4) to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. So position 4 is OMe.

Also, the methoxy and the alcohol (OH) are both ortho to the nitrile group. Hmm, the nitrile is at a position where both the methoxy (position 4) and the hydroxyl (position 2 or 6) are adjacent to it.

So, the nitrile (CN) must be in a position such that its adjacent positions include 4 and, say, 2 or 6.

Wait, let's try to map this out.

Let me try to assign positions.

Carboxylic acid (COOH) is position 1.

Ortho to COOH are positions 2 and 6. So substituents in 2 and 6 are OH and N(CH3)2.

So let's say position 2 is OH and position 6 is N(CH3)2, or vice versa.

Wait, but the question states that the hydroxyl and dimethyl amino are both ortho to the carboxylic acid. So, positions 2 and 6 each have one of these groups.

Para to COOH is position 4, which is OMe.

Now, the carbaldehyde (CHO) and cyano (CN) groups are meta to each other and to the COOH. So, COOH is position 1, so the groups meta would be positions 3 and 5.

Wait, but the carbaldehyde and cyano are meta to each other as well. So if the carbaldehyde is at position 3, the cyano would be at position 5, and vice versa.

Wait, but the question says that the three groups (COOH, CHO, CN) are all meta to each other. So each is three positions apart. So, if COOH is at 1, then CHO would be at 3, and CN at 5, but that would make them meta to each other all around.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement is such that each of the three substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other.

Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so perhaps they're placed at positions 1, 3, and 5. But wait, COOH is already at 1. So the CHO and CN must be at positions 3 and 5.

So, let's assign:

Position 1: COOH (carboxylic acid)

Position 3: CHO (carbaldehyde)

Position 5: CN (cyano)

But wait, let's see if that fits the other conditions.

So, the methoxy (OMe) is at position 4 (para to COOH).

The OH is at position 2, and the dimethyl amino is at position 6.

Wait, but the question also says that the methoxy and the alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile. So, the nitrile is at position 5. So, the positions adjacent to 5 are 4, 6, and (maybe 2 and 4? Wait, no. For a benzene ring, each position has two adjacent positions. Position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6.

Wait, position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. So, if the nitrile is at position 5, then the substituents ortho to it would be positions 4 and 6.

But according to the problem, the methoxy (position 4) and the alcohol (position 2 or 6?) are ortho to the nitrile.

Wait, so the nitrile is at 5. Positions 4 and 6 are adjacent to 5. So, the substituents at 4 and 6 should be methoxy and alcohol.

Wait, looking back: the methoxy is at position 4 (para to COOH at 1). The alcohol is at position 2 or 6.

If the nitrile is at 5, then the substituents at 4 (OMe) and 6 (N(CH3)2) are adjacent to 5.

Wait, but the problem says that the methoxy and the alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile. So, the nitrile must have substituents at positions adjacent to it, which are OMe and OH.

Wait, but earlier I thought the OMe is at 4, and OH is at 2, and the dimethyl amino is at 6.

Hmm, but if the nitrile is at 5, its adjacent positions are 4 and 6.

So, the substituents at 4 and 6 must be OMe and OH.

Wait, but in our earlier assignments, 6 has N(CH3)2. So that would not fit.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the substituents again.

Substituents:

1: COOH

2 and 6: OH and N(CH3)2 (ortho to COOH)

4: OMe (para to COOH)

3: CHO

5: CN

But then, the nitrile is at 5. So, the adjacent positions are 4 and 6.

The substituents at 4 and 6 are OMe and N(CH3)2.

But the problem says that the methoxy and the alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile. So, the nitrile's adjacent substituents should be OMe and OH.

Wait, but in this arrangement, the substituents at 4 and 6 are OMe and N(CH3)2.

That doesn't match, because the alcohol is at 2, not 6.

Hmm. So perhaps my initial assignments are wrong.

Alternative approach: Let's make a drawing.

Imagine the benzene ring with COOH at position 1.

Positions 2 and 6 have substituents: OH and N(CH3)2.

Position 4 has OMe.

The other substituents are CHO and CN. They are meta to each other and to COOH.

So, COOH is 1, the other two substituents (CHO and CN) are at 3 and 5.

So, positions 3 and 5: CHO and CN.

Now, the nitrile is either at 3 or 5.

The methoxy is at 4, and the alcohol is at 2 or 6.

The nitrile is at position 3 or 5.

If the nitrile is at 5, then adjacent positions are 4 and 6.

At 4 is OMe, at 6 is N(CH3)2.

But the problem states that the methoxy and the alcohol are ortho to the nitrile. So, the nitrile should have OMe and OH as its adjacent groups.

So, in that case, the nitrile would need to be adjacent to both OMe (position 4) and OH (position 2 or 6).

Wait, but if the nitrile is at position 5, then position 6 is adjacent. So substituent at 6 would have to be OH.

Wait, but earlier I thought substituents at 2 and 6 are OH and N(CH3)2.

So, if the nitrile is at 5, then substituents at 4 (OMe) and 6 (N(CH3)2) are adjacent. But the problem states that the OMe and OH are ortho to the nitrile. So, that can't be, unless the substituent at 6 is OH, and position 2 is N(CH3)2.

Wait, maybe I swapped them.

Let me reassign:

Position 1: COOH.

Position 2: N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino).

Position 6: OH (hydroxyl).

So, ortho to COOH are 2 and 6: substituents are N(CH3)2 and OH.

Then, position 4: OMe (para to COOH).

CHO and CN are meta to COOH. So, positions 3 and 5.

If the nitrile is at position 3, then its adjacent positions are 2 and 4.

So, position 2 is N(CH3)2, and position 4 is OMe.

But the problem states that the methoxy and the alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile. So, the nitrile should have both OMe and OH adjacent.

So, in this case, if the nitrile is at position 3, the adjacent positions are 2 (N(CH3)2) and 4 (OMe). So, OMe is adjacent, but OH is at position 6, not adjacent to 3.

Thus, this arrangement doesn't satisfy the condition. Hmm.

Alternative arrangement: perhaps the nitrile is at position 5.

Adjacent positions: 4 (OMe) and 6 (OH).

So, substituents at 4 and 6 are OMe and OH.

Wait, that fits because position 6 is OH, which is ortho to COOH. So, let's check:

Position 1: COOH.

Position 2: N(CH3)2.

Position 3: CHO.

Position 4: OMe.

Position 5: CN.

Position 6: OH.

Wait, now the nitrile is at 5. Its adjacent substituents are 4 (OMe) and 6 (OH), which matches the condition that both are ortho to the nitrile.

Also, the substituents at 3 (CHO) and 5 (CN) are meta to each other (since 3 and 5 are two positions apart on the ring), and both are meta to COOH (position 1). So that fits the initial condition.

So, the substituents are:

1: COOH.

2: N(CH3)2.

3: CHO.

4: OMe.

5: CN.

6: OH.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that the carboxylic acid has a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another. So, the three substituents (COOH, CHO, CN) are all meta to each other. Wait, but in this arrangement, COOH is at 1, CHO at 3, CN at 5. So each is two positions apart, which is meta.

Yes, that makes sense.

Now, numbering the substituents in the order of priority as per IUPAC rules. The functional groups have priority: the principal group is the carboxylic acid, so that's the first part of the name.

The substituents are named in alphabetical order, with their positions as low as possible.

Wait, the substituents are:

At position 2: dimethylamino (N(CH3)2).

Position 3: formyl (CHO).

Position 4: methoxy (OMe).

Position 5: cyano (CN).

Position 6: hydroxyl (OH).

Wait, but wait, the substituents attached to the ring are:

COOH (position 1),

N(CH3)2 (position 2),

CHO (position 3),

OMe (position 4),

CN (position 5),

OH (position 6).

Wait, but when writing the name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, except for the principal group.

So, the substituents are:

- 2-(dimethylamino),

- 3-formyl,

- 4-methoxy,

- 5-cyano,

- 6-hydroxy.

Wait, but the substituents are numbered in such a way that the numbers are as low as possible. Let me check the numbering.

Wait, the principal group is the carboxylic acid at position 1.

The substituents are then numbered in the order of their positions as 2,3,4,5,6.

But in IUPAC nomenclature, the substituents are arranged in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions.

So, the substituents' alphabetical order is:

C comes before F, which comes before H, M, etc.

Wait, substituents to list in alphabetical order:

- 2-(dimethylamino),

- 3-formyl,

- 4-methoxy,

- 5-cyano,

- 6-hydroxy.

Wait, no, in alphabetical order, the substituents would be arranged as:

C: cyano,

F: formyl,

H: hydroxy,

M: methoxy,

N: dimethylamino.

So, the order would be:

5-cyano,

3-formyl,

6-hydroxy,

4-methoxy,

2-(dimethylamino).

Wait, but the substituents are at positions 2,3,4,5,6.

So, the order of substituents in the name would be:

2-(dimethylamino), 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy.

Wait, no, wait. Because in the alphabetical order, C comes before F, so the substituents are:

cyano (5), formyl (3), hydroxy (6), methoxy (4), dimethylamino (2).

But in the name, the order is alphabetical, regardless of their positions. So the substituents are listed in the order of their letters.

So, the substituents in order are:

cyano (C), formyl (F), hydroxy (H), methoxy (M), dimethylamino (N).

Wait, but methoxy (OCH3) would be 'methoxy', which starts with M. Dimethylamino starts with N.

So, the substituents in alphabetical order: cyano, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy, dimethylamino.

But wait, the substituent names are:

At position 2: dimethylamino,

position 3: formyl,

position 4: methoxy,

position 5: cyano,

position 6: hydroxy.

So, in the name, the substituents are listed as per their alphabetical order, but their positions are as per their numbering.

Wait, no, actually, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. So the name would start with the substituent that comes first alphabetically, followed by the others in order.

So, the substituents are:

- 5-cyano,

- 3-formyl,

- 6-hydroxy,

-4-methoxy,

-2-(dimethylamino).

But when arranged alphabetically, the order is:

cyano, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy, dimethylamino.

Wait, no, the substituent name for 2-dimethylamino is 'dimethylamino', which starts with D, so comes after cyano (C), formyl (F), and before hydroxy (H).

Wait no, the order of letters is C (cyano), D (dimethylamino), F (formyl), H (hydroxy), M (methoxy).

So the correct order would be: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

But wait, the substituent 'dimethylamino' is at position 2, and 'formyl' at 3, 'hydroxy' at 6, 'methoxy' at 4, 'cyano' at 5.

So, when listing them alphabetically, the order is:

C (cyano): position 5,

D (dimethylamino): position 2,

F (formyl): position3,

H (hydroxy): position6,

M (methoxy): position4.

So, the name would be 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Yes, that's exactly the substituent order I have here.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

That would mean cyano at 3, dimethylamino at6, formyl at5, etc. Doesn't fit our arrangement.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

So, substituents: OH at2, CN at3, OMe at4, formyl at5, dimethylamino at6. Doesn't match our arrangement.

Option C: 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid.

So substituents: dimethylamino at2, formyl at3, OMe at4, CN at5, OH at6. This matches our structure.

Wait, wait, but in our structure, the substituents are:

Position 2: dimethylamino,

3: formyl,

4: methoxy,

5: cyano,

6: hydroxy.

So, the substituents in order are:

2-(dimethylamino),

3-formyl,

4-methoxy,

5-cyano,

6-hydroxy.

So, the name would be 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid.

Ah, that would be the correct order.

Wait, but earlier I thought the substituents are listed in alphabetical order. So why is the option C starting with 2-dimethylamino, then 3-formyl, etc.?

Wait, no. I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.

Wait, the substituents are named alphabetically, regardless of their position numbers. So, the order in the name should be:

cyano (C),

dimethylamino (D),

formyl (F),

hydroxy (H),

methoxy (M).

Wait, but wait, hydroxy comes before methoxy. So the order is C, D, F, H, M.

So, the substituents in the name should be:

5-cyano,

2-(dimethylamino),

3-formyl,

6-hydroxy,

4-methoxy.

So, the name would be 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Which is option D.

Wait, but in option C, the substituents are listed as 2-dimethylamino, 3-formyl, etc.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused about whether the substituent order in the name is based on their position numbers or their alphabetical order.

Wait, IUPAC rules state that substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions on the ring. So, the substituents are arranged in alphabetical order, not based on their positions.

So, the correct order of substituents in the name would be:

C (cyano),

D (dimethylamino),

F (formyl),

H (hydroxy),

M (methoxy).

So, the substituents are:

5-cyano,

2-(dimethylamino),

3-formyl,

6-hydroxy,

4-methoxy.

So, the name is 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Looking at the options:

Option D is this.

Wait, but I'm now confused because another option (option C) has the substituents in order of the positions.

Wait, the correct IUPAC name requires substituents to be listed in alphabetical order, not in the order of their positions. So, the correct substituent order is as I described.

Therefore, option D is the correct name.


The molecule is a benzoic acid derivative with multiple substituents. The carboxylic acid group is the principal functional group, assigned to position 1. The substituents are positioned as follows:

- **Position 2**: Dimethylamino group (N(CH₃)₂)
- **Position 3**: Formyl group (CHO)
- **Position 4**: Methoxy group (OMe)
- **Position 5**: Cyano group (CN)
- **Position 6**: Hydroxyl group (OH)

The substituents are arranged based on their positions relative to the carboxylic acid group and each other. The problem specifies that the carboxylic acid, formyl, and cyano groups are all meta to one another, and the methoxy and hydroxyl groups are ortho to the cyano group. This arrangement matches the substituents assigned above.

In IUPAC nomenclature, substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions on the ring. The alphabetical order of the substituents is:

1. Cyano (C)
2. Dimethylamino (D)
3. Formyl (F)
4. Hydroxy (H)
5. Methoxy (M)

Thus, the correct IUPAC name lists the substituents in this order, with their respective positions:

- **5-cyano**
- **2-(dimethylamino)**
- **3-formyl**
- **6-hydroxy**
- **4-methoxy**

The full name is **5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**, which corresponds to **Option D**.

ANSWER: D
