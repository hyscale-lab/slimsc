Okay, so I've got this problem here where an algorithm takes some DNA sequences and converts them into numbers. I need to figure out what the algorithm does and then apply it to the new sequence given. Let me think through this step by step.

The examples given are:
AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

Hmm, I wonder what the algorithm is doing. Let me look at the first example. AGG is three nucleotides long and outputs 115. Thinking about DNA, each nucleotide is A, T, C, G. Maybe each base is being converted to a number and then summed or multiplied or something.

Let's break down AGG: A, G, G.

Wait, in DNA, A is adenine, T is thymine, C is cytosine, G is guanine. But how to map these to numbers. One possibility is assigning A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Or maybe something else. Let me try that.

For AGG:
A is 1, G is 4, G is 4. So 1 + 4 +4 = 9. That's not 115. So maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe it's considering the positions as exponents or something. Hmm. Another thought: Maybe each nucleotide is converted to a digit, and then the sequence is treated as a base-5 number? Because DNA has four nucleotides, but maybe using base 4 or 5.

Wait, let's see. Let's assign A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3. Let's test this.

For AGG: A is 0, G is 3, G is 3. So the sequence is 0,3,3. If it's a base-4 number, then the value would be 0*4^2 + 3*4^1 + 3*4^0 = 0 +12 +3 =15. Not 115. Hmm.

Wait, but the output is 115, which is a bigger number. Maybe it's a different base or a different mapping.

Another approach: Maybe each base is mapped to a two-digit number, like A=10, T=20, C=30, G=40. Then sum or something else. Let's check.

AGG would be 10 +40 +40 =90. Not 115. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps each nucleotide is converted into its position in the alphabet. A is 1, T is 20, C is 3, G is 7. Let me sum them: 1 +20 +7=28. Not close to 115.

Wait, maybe it's the sum of their positions multiplied by their position in the sequence. Alternatively, maybe it's a product. Let's think.

Another idea: Maybe each nucleotide's value is based on its ASCII code. Let's see, the ASCII for A is 65, G is 71, T is 84, C is 67. Let's see:

For AGG: 65 (A) + 71 (G) +71 (G) = 207. But the output is 115. Hmm, 207 is too big. Maybe subtracting some number? 207-92=115. Not sure where 92 would come from. Maybe not.

Hmm, perhaps it's a different approach. Maybe each base is mapped to a number, and then each digit is multiplied by its position (like a weighted sum). Let's try that.

For AGG, maybe A is 1, G is 4, so the sequence is 1,4,4.

If each digit is multiplied by 10^position... Wait, for a 3-digit number, it's 1*100 +4*10 +4 = 144. Not matching.

Wait, maybe each nucleotide is converted to a number and then summed in a way that the
