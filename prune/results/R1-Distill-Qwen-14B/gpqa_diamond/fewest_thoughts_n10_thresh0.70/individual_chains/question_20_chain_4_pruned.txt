Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about nuclear physics, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let's try to think it through. The question is about the impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations. Hmm, I remember that the impulse approximation is an assumption that allows treating nucleons as if they're free, meaning their interactions are considered independent of their being bound in a nucleus. But wait, why is that done?

The question asks which four assumptions imply this "impulse" approximation. The options are statements 1,2,3,4. The choices are combinations of them, so I need to figure out which three are correct.

Let me list out the assumptions:

1. Interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.

The impulse approximation is a simplification where each nucleon is treated as a free particle, right? So the idea is that when a nucleon interacts (like via an electroweak interaction), the others don't affect it much. So the approximation ignores the complications of the nucleus's structure and the interactions between nucleons.

Assumption 1: Interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. This makes sense because if the interaction is only with individual nucleons, you don't have to worry about the rest of the nucleus affecting the process. So that's probably part of the impulse approximation.

Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent except for the selected nucleon. Hmm, what does that mean? If the nucleus is transparent, that probably means that other nucleons don't significantly affect the interaction of the selected one. So during the interaction, the other nucleons don't block or modify the process. So this also aligns with the impulse approximation idea where each nucleon is treated independently.

Assumption 3: The quarks inside the nucleon are non-relativistic. Wait, why would that matter? Oh, because if the quarks are moving non-relativistically, their internal dynamics are simpler. But does that relate to the impulse approximation? The impulse approximation is about treating the nucleon as free, not about how the quarks behave. So I'm not sure if this is a necessary assumption for the impulse approximation. Maybe it's more about the dynamics within the nucleon, like if they're non-relativistic, they don't have relativistic effects that complicate the interaction.

Assumption 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh, right, because in the impulse approximation, you're ignoring the binding forces (like the nuclear force holding the nucleon in the nucleus). So you treat the nucleon as if it's free, not bound. So this assumption is definitely part of the impulse approximation.

So, which assumptions make up the impulse approximation? Let's think:

Looking at the options, the correct answer should include 1,2,4. Because 1 says the interaction only affects individual nucleons, 2 says others don't interact, so the nucleus is transparent except for the one nucleon, and 4 says the binding forces are ignored.

Wait, what about statement 3? If statement 3 is about the quarks being non-relativistic, does that matter for the impulse approximation? The impulse approximation is about treating the nucleus as a collection of free particles, not about the internal structure of the nucleon. So the quarks' behavior (relativistic or not) might be a separate approximation, perhaps for treating the nucleon itself. So statement 3 probably isn't one of the assumptions that imply the impulse approximation. So it's not part of the correct
