Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory framework that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. These operators are added to the SM Lagrangian to account for physics beyond the SM, but at a higher energy scale.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. I need to figure out which of these are required for all operators.

Wait, let's think about each symmetry one by one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think that's a big one. Because the SMEFT is a field theory, and field theories generally require Lorentz invariance. That is, all the terms in the Lagrangian must be invariant under Lorentz transformations. So any operator in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. Otherwise, the theory wouldn't make sense as a relativistic theory. So Lorentz (1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So Poincare symmetry implies that the theory is invariant under Lorentz transformations and translations. But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. Effective theories can sometimes break Poincare symmetry because they're not supposed to describe physics at all scales. Or do they? Wait, no, wait. Effective field theories are still local and Lorentz-invariant. Because they're effective, they incorporate the symmetries of the underlying theory, which should be Lorentz-invariant. So SMEFT operators probably must respect Poincare symmetry too. So (2) is also a required symmetry.

Wait a second, but sometimes in effective theories, you can have operators that break translational symmetry? Or is that not the case? Wait, no, I think effective field theories are still built with local interactions, so translations are accounted for via the derivatives in the Lagrangian. So Poincare must be respected, right? So 2 is required.

Then CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. The SM has some CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. So in SMEFT, do we require all operators to respect CP symmetry? Or
