Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, meaning it's a low-energy approximation that incorporates the Standard Model plus some higher-dimensional operators. Effective theories should respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory, which in this case is the Standard Model. So what symmetries does the Standard Model have?

The Standard Model respects several symmetries. I think it's Lorentz-invariant, which means it respects Lorentz symmetry. Lorentz symmetry includes things like rotations and boosts, right? So Lorentz Symmetry is definitely one that SMEFT must respect. That's point 1.

Then there's Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations? Like, the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime includes both. Oh, right, because Poincare includes translations, which are part of spacetime symmetries. So if SMEFT respects Lorentz, does it automatically respect Poincare? Or are they separate? I'm a bit confused here. Because in the Standard Model, the symmetries are Poincare plus internal symmetries. So SMEFT should respect Poincare as well. So points 1 and 2 would both be required.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. SMEFT is built to respect these symmetries, so the operators must individually be invariant under these symmetries. So if an operator doesn't respect, say, Lorentz symmetry, it wouldn't be part of the theory. So all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, etc.

Wait, but wait. I thought that in SMEFT, the operators are classified by their Lorentz, gauge, and other quantum numbers. So perhaps all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. As for Poincare, since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations, but I'm not sure if the
