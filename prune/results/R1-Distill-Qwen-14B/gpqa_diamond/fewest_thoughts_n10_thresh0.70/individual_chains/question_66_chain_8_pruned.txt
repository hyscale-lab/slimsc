Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question is asking which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are A to D, each combining some of these.

First, I need to remember what each of these symmetries entails and whether they're required in SMEFT.

Starting with Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT is an effective field theory that incorporates all possible Lorentz-invariant operators. So Lorentz symmetry must definitely be respected. Operators in SMEFT are constructed to be Lorentz scalars, which means they transform in a way that leaves the theory invariant under Lorentz transformations. So point 1 is a must.

Next, Poincaré symmetry. Hmm. Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting space and time). In effective field theories, the symmetry group is usually the same as the Standard Model, which is Poincaré plus gauge symmetries. Wait, but SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible interactions, so do the operators have to respect Poincaré symmetry?

Wait, but I think in the SMEFT framework, the theory is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory, but I'm not 100% sure about Poincaré. Because Poincaré includes translations as well. Are all the operators in SMEFT Poincaré invariant? Or is it possible that some operators might break translation invariance? 

Wait, no. Because in SMEFT, it's an effective theory valid below some cutoff scale, and it's built as a Lorentz-invariant theory with higher-dimensional operators. Translation symmetry is part of the Poincaré group. So do the SMEFT operators respect translation symmetry? I think they do, because effective field theories are typically constructed to have the same symmetries as the underlying theory, and the Standard Model has Poincaré symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry. So point 2 is also correct.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused. Because when you have renormalizable theories, the terms in the Lagrangian are local, so they
