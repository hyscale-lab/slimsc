Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question has two parts. Let's look at them one by one.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, in the second reaction, that product reacts with reagent B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, no, actually, let me read that again. Oh no, wait, the first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second step is taking 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile (which I think is a typo, probably with a nitrile group) and reacting it with B (H2O) to form the acid.

Wait, no, perhaps the first reaction is correct. Let me make sure. The first product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN and A, which is a reagent, it gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, so maybe it's some kind of substitution reaction.

Wait a second, butan-2-one is acetone. So acetone reacting with sodium cyanide. NaCN is a nucleophile. I remember that in the presence of an acid, the ketone can undergo a nucleophilic addition. So maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin.

Cyanohydrin formation is when a ketone reacts with a nitrile (like HCN, but here it's NaCN, which is a source of CN-). The reaction typically requires an acid catalyst. Oh wait, right, usually you need an acid like H2SO4 or H3O+ as catalyst. So acetone plus HCN (or CN-) in acidic conditions would form the cyanohydrin, which adds OH and CN groups to the carbonyl carbon.

So in the first reaction, acetone +
