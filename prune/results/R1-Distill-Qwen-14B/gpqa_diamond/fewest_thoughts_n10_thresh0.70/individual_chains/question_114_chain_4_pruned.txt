Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about reagents and reactions. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN plus something called A, giving 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Right, so when a ketone reacts with a nitrile group, that's probably a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So in ketones, the carbonyl group is attacked by the nucleophile. But wait, in the product, it's a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon. Oh, right, that's the formation of a cyanohydrin. So the reaction is the addition of CN- to the carbonyl group, forming a cyanohydrin. But how does that happen?

Wait, the cyanohydrin formation typically uses a strong acid as a catalyst. Because the carbonyl is activated by acid. Oh right, so the CN- (from NaCN) acts as a nucleophile, but the carbonyl needs to be protonated first to make it more electrophilic. So A is probably an acid, like H3O+ or maybe something else. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of HSO3- or H+ and SO3^2-.

Wait, but in the first step, butan-2-one plus NaCN and A gives a cyanohydrin. The conditions for cyanohydrin formation are typically acid-catalyzed. So H+ would be needed. So A is probably H3O+.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+.

Now for the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen? Nitrile hydrolysis, right. The conditions for nitrile to carboxylic acid usually involve strong acid and heat, or maybe using a strong oxidizing agent.

Wait, but the reagent B is in the presence of H2O. So maybe it's an acidic hydrolysis. Nitriles hydrolyze under strong acidic conditions to give carboxylic acids. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you get a different product. Wait, under acidic conditions, the nitrile (RCN) hydrolyzes to RCOOH. So the reagent B should be an acid.

Looking at the options, in the second part, B is either HCl (options A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D).

So for the second reaction, the reagent B is an acid. So which acid is needed for nitrile hydrolysis to the acid? Usually, HCl is used in the acidic hydrolysis. So B would be HCl.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl â†’ This fits both reactions.

Option B: A=H3O+; B=CH3COOH. But wait, would acetic acid be strong enough for the hydrolysis? I think HCl is more commonly used because it's a strong acid, which is needed to protonate the nitrile and drive the hydrolysis to completion. So maybe option A is the correct one.

Wait, but wait. In the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and H3O+ gives the cyanohydrin. That makes sense. Then, in the second, the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid using HCl (which is a strong acid), so B would be HCl.

Looking at the options, option A is A = H3O+ and B = HCl.

Wait, but what about option C and D? In option C, A is NaHSO3. I'm not
