Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given values are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with some very small distances in meters.

Alright, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The formula I think is tau = hbar / (Gamma), where hbar is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, is that for the lifetime or the decay width? Oh right, the natural linewidth or resonance width is Gamma, and the lifetime is inversely proportional to it. So tau = hbar / Gamma.

But wait, the decay distance would then be the velocity of the particle multiplied by the lifetime, right? Because distance equals velocity times time. So I need to find the velocity of the meson X first.

How do I find the velocity? Well, relativistic equations probably apply here since the energies are high. The meson is produced with energy E_X, which is higher than its rest mass. So I should use the relation between energy, mass, and momentum.

The total energy E is related to momentum p and mass m by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Oh, but wait, the units here
