Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance and its decay distance. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question states that X is a meson resonance with given parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. We're to find the mean decay distance, and the options are A through D with various values in meters.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula, I think, is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ) multiplied by the velocity (βc). So, distance L = βγ c τ. Wait, but γ is the Lorentz factor, right? Oh wait, wait. Because for a particle moving relativistically, the lifetime observed is longer due to time dilation. So the mean lifetime τ is the proper lifetime times gamma. Alternatively, I might have to find the proper lifetime first.

Wait, the proper lifetime τ_0 is related to the decay width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is the width Γ, which is given as 320 MeV. So, the proper lifetime τ_0 is approximately ħ / Γ. But wait, isn't Γ equal to ħ/τ_0? So τ_0 = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but units are a bit tricky here. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units of GeV·s or something. Let me think about the units. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So if Γ is in GeV, then τ_0 is ħ / Γ. But in this case, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So, τ_0 = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, but wait: Is Γ in MeV or GeV? Oh, the given Γ is 320 MeV, so it's 0.32 GeV. So that's correct.

But then,
