Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that both instruments are high-resolution spectrographs. The question gives me some key details about their brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait: it says stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Oh wait, no, I think I got that backwards. Wait, the V magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's a lower number. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, meaning V mag less than 17. Because higher V magnitudes are fainter. So any star with V mag less than 17 is bright enough for ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe brighter than 16 mag, so V mag less than 16.

So the star must have an apparent V magnitude that's less than 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES. Wait, but waitâ€”no, wait. Wait, no, the question says for ESPRESSO, they can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. Oh, no, wait: it says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed". Oh wait, no, actually, V magnitude is such that lower numbers are brighter. So "brighter than 17 mag" would be V < 17. Because a star with V=17 is fainter than one with V=16. So if a star is brighter than V=17, it's V is less than 17. So for ESPRESSO, the star's apparent V must be <17. For HIRES, the star must have apparent V <
