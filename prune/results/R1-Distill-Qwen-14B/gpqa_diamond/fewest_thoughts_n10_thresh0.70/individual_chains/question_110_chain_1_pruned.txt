Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs at two observatories. I need to figure this out step by step.

The question is about the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. The key point is the apparent V magnitude each can observe. ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can see brighter than 16 mag. So, the star must have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait: the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Oh wait, magnitude scale is tricky. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its apparent magnitude is lower (like 16, 15, etc.). So, ESPRESSO can detect stars with apparent V mag â‰¤17? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, let me think. The way it's written: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, brightness is the key. A magnitude of lower numbers are brighter. So for ESPRESSO, any star with V mag less than 17 (brighter than 17) is observable. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter
