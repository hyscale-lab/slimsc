Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which exoplanet among the options has the highest density. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So the formula is density = mass/volume. For planets, especially rocky ones like Earth, the density depends a lot on their mass and radius because the volume depends on radius.

Looking at the options:

Option a) is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So that's the same as our own planet. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I think. So this planet has that density.

Option b) has 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but wait, the question says this planet has a density of 5.5. So it's specified, so I don't have to calculate it. But wait, why would that be the case? If a planet is more massive than Earth, but same density as Earth, then it would have a larger radius. Because for the same density, mass is proportional to volume, which is radius cubed. So if it's twice Earth's mass, then the volume would be twice that of Earth, so radius would be cube root of 2 times Earth's radius. But that's besides the point because the question is about which has the highest density.

Option c) is a planet with the same composition as Earth but five times more massive. So same composition would mean same density. Wait, no, wait. Earth's density is 5.5, but if the planet has the same composition, then yes, same density. But I thought that as a planet's mass increases beyond Earth, other factors might come into play, like maybe it's more gaseous, but the question says same composition. Oh wait, same composition as Earth implies same density. So if it's five times Earth's mass, but same density, then its volume is five times Earth's. So radius would be cube root of 5 times Earth's radius. But since density is same, option c's density is 5.5 as well. So same as a and c? No, no, wait. Wait, option b is already 5.5 density. So both b, c, and a have same density as Earth? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option c: same composition as Earth, five times Earth's mass. So same composition implies same density. So that's 5.5. But wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Wait, no. Because Earth's density is 5.5. So same composition would have same density, regardless of mass. So if you have a planet of same composition, then same density. So that would make option c's density same as Earth, 5.5.

Option d: same composition as Earth but half the mass. So same density, 5.5. So same as a, b, c, d all have 5.5?

Wait, but the options must have different densities. Oh wait, no. Let me check again.

Wait the options are:

a) Earth mass and radius. So same as Earth. Density 5.5.

b) 2 Earth masses,
