Okay, so I've got this problem about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons, and these transitions are governed by selection rules.

First, I need to recall the selection rules for dipole transitions. I think the selection rules for the hydrogen atom in the non-relativistic theory are:

Δl = ±1, 0? Wait, no, wait. I think for dipole transitions, the selection rule is Δl = ±1. Because the dipole operator has a component with angular momentum 1, so it can change the orbital angular momentum by one unit.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1. So l changes by 1. Also, the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, ±1. But for the specific case here, the initial state is |3,0,0>, so l=0 and m=0.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. It wants to decay to n=1, l=0, m=0. But it needs to go through two dipole transitions. So first, it goes from 3->something, then that state goes to 1.

Hmm, let's think about the possible transitions.

First, from n=3, l=0. So what are the possible states that can be reached in a dipole transition?

Because Δl must be ±1. So from l=0, the next l's are l=1. So the first transition would be to a state with l=1. So n can change as well. Let's see, possible n values for the first transition: from 3 to 2 or 4? But since 3 is higher energy than 2, and the atom is decaying, it's more likely to go down to lower energy levels. So first transition is from 3 to 2.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is |3,0,0>, so after the first transition, it would go to a state with l=1, so |2,1
