Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

A chemist found a white solid, and he gathered some spectral data to identify it. We need to choose the correct structure from the options given. The data includes mass spectrometry, IR, and 1H NMR.

Let me break down each piece of data.

Starting with the mass spec. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%. There's another peak at m/z 158, 32%. Hmm, molecular ion peak suggests the molecular weight is 156. The m/z 158 is likely a fragment or an isotope. Wait, 158 is 156 plus 2. Oh, wait, could that be a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35.5, so the common isotope is ^35Cl (75%) and ^37Cl (25%). So if the molecular ion is 156, which is even, but if there's a Cl in the molecule, the molecular ion could be a mix of 35Cl and 37Cl. Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156, and the other peak is 158, which is +2. So that makes sense because 37Cl is two mass units higher than 35Cl. So the molecular formula probably contains one Cl atom. Because the molecular ion is showing 156, and the other is 158, which is 37Cl instead of 35Cl. The abundance is 32% for the 158 peak. Wait, but the natural abundance of Cl isotopes is about 75% for 35Cl and 25% for 37Cl. So the molecular ion peak would be a combination of these. Let's think: the molecular formula would have one Cl, so the molecular weight would be 156. Let me compute: what's the formula that adds up to 156 with one Cl.

Wait, maybe I should look at the options first.

The options are A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid, C) Phenyl chlor
