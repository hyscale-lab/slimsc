Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. Some of these particles decay quickly, and only a third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, they want to find out what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead.

Hmm, I remember that the Lorentz factor (gamma) is related to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame would be longer than their proper lifetime. So the particles that decay faster would have a shorter lab lifetime, meaning they might not travel as far before decaying.

Wait, but in this problem, the initial setup is that one third reach the walls. So probably the particles' lifetime is such that on average, they can only reach one third of the detector's radius. Now, we need to find the Lorentz factor that allows two-thirds to reach the walls. That probably means the particles' lifetime is longer, so they can travel further before decaying.

I think the key here is to relate the proper lifetime of the particles to the time they experience, which is affected by gamma. The lab frame sees the particles' lifetime as gamma multiplied by their proper lifetime (tau). So tau_lab = gamma * tau.

The distance a particle travels before decaying is its speed multiplied by the time it lives. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their speed is approximately the speed of light, c. So the distance (d) is v * t â‰ˆ c * gamma tau.

Wait, but the distance they travel is important here. The detector's radius is 30 meters. So if a particle's decay length is longer than the radius, it would reach the wall. Wait, no, actually, the decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So if the decay length is longer than the radius, the particle might not have decayed yet when it reaches the wall. Wait, no, the decay length is the average distance, so if the decay length is equal to the radius, then on average, half the particles would reach beyond and half before. Hmm, wait, actually, no. The decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle hasn't decayed by the time it travels a distance L is exp(-L/(c tau_lab)), right?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. The speed is approximately c. So the time they have is t = R/(c), where R is the radius. The probability that the particle hasn't decayed by then is exp(- t/(tau_lab)) = exp(- R/(c tau_lab)). Because the decay probability is modeled by an exponential decay: the probability P that the particle hasn't decayed after time t is P = exp(-t/(tau_lab)).

So in the original scenario, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So that would mean that the probability of survival (not decaying) is 1/3. So,

1/3 = exp(-
