Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through the question again.

The setup is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying, traveling at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector's radius is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, so I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But how does that relate to the particles reaching the detector walls?

Wait, I think it's about the time it takes for the particles to decay versus the time it takes them to reach the detector's edge. Because if they decay before reaching the wall, they won't be detected. So the decay length must be longer than the radius of the detector.

But wait, in the initial scenario, one third reach the walls. So I guess that relates to the fraction of particles that decay after traveling the distance to the wall. So if a particle's lifetime is tau, then the observed lifetime is gamma * tau because of time dilation. The distance the particle travels before decaying is v * gamma tau.

Wait, but wait, the formula for the mean decay length is L = c * gamma * tau. Because velocity v is approximately c for ultra-relativistic particles. So if the decay length L is greater than the detector's radius, R, then the particles have a higher chance of decaying before reaching the wall. Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, if the decay length is longer than R, then the particle has a higher probability of traveling beyond R before decaying. Or wait, perhaps it's the opposite.

Wait, the particles that decay after traveling a distance R will contribute to the detection. So the fraction of particles that reach the detector walls is the fraction that haven't decayed by the time they've traveled R meters.

So the proper approach is to calculate the probability that a particle hasn't decayed when it has traveled a distance R. The decay follows an exponential probability. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed after time t is exp(-t/(tau)), where tau is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's
