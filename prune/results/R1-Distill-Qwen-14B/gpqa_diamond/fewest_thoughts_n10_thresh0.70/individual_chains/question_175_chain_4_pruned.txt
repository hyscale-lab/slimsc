Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and the radiation they produce. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question says we have an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees and the form of f.

Alright, so I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation, and the radiation pattern depends on the angle. For a dipole radiator, I think the radiation pattern is different than for a point charge. Wait, dipole radiation has a specific dependence on the angle.

Oh right, the radiation from a dipole antenna. The power radiated per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) for a dipole varies as (1 + cos²θ), but wait, wait. That's for the angular dependence. Or was it (sin²θ) or something else? Hmm. Let me think. No, for a dipole, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (1 + cos²θ). So the maximum occurs when cosθ is ±1, which is along the axis (θ=0 or 180 degrees), and the minimum is when cosθ is zero, which is the equator (θ=90 degrees). Wait, but wait, wait. Another thought: Maybe the angular dependence for the dipole is (sin²θ), so maximum at 90 degrees?

Wait no, I'm getting confused. Let me recall the exact formula. The radiation intensity for a dipole is given by something like (p² ω⁴ sin²θ)/(something with c and constants). Wait, wait. Another approach: the dipole's radiation pattern is such that the intensity is maximum perpendicular to the dipole (θ=90), and minimum along the axis (θ=0 and 180). So the formula I think is (sin²θ), so the intensity varies as sin²θ. So when θ is 90 degrees, sinθ is 1, so maximum. At θ=0 or 180, sinθ is zero, so no radiation in those directions.

But wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm. Let's think about this again. The dipole's radiation pattern is symmetric, so maximum at θ=90. So the intensity must be maximum there. So the formula for intensity (power per solid angle) is proportional to sin²θ. So the function f(θ) would be proportional to sin²θ. Therefore, when θ is 30 degrees, sinθ is 0.5, so sin²θ is 0.25.

Wait, but in the problem, the function f is a function of λ and θ. So f could have a dependence on 1/λ^something. Oh, right, the power radiated also depends on the frequency. For a dipole, the power radiated is something like (p^2 ω^4)/(something). So, since the wavelength λ is related to the frequency f by c = f λ, so ω = 2πf = 2π c / λ. So ω^4 would be proportional to 1/λ^4.

So putting it together, the function f would have a dependence like 1/λ^4 multiplied by sin²θ. Wait, but the problem says f is a function of λ and θ. So f probably has a form like (something) * (1/λ^k) * sin²θ.

But the question is asking for the fraction of the maximum power A that is radiated at θ=30 degrees. So if the maximum occurs when sin²θ is maximum, which is sin²(90) =1, then the fraction at θ=30 would be (sin²(30))/ (maximum sin²θ) = (0.25)/1 = 0.25, which is 1/4.

So the fraction is 1/4, which would be 25% of A.

Now, looking at the options, let's see.

Option B: 1/4, λ^(-3)
Option C: 1/4, λ^(-4)

Wait, I thought the power dependence was 1/λ^4. Because the power radiated by a dipole is proportional to ω^4, and ω is proportional to 1/λ, so ω^4 is 1/λ^4.

So the function f is proportional to 1/λ^4 multiplied by sin²θ. So the form of f would be proportional to sin²
