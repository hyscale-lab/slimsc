Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a reaction scheme where a compound A undergoes several reactions to form compounds B, C, D, and finally E. The task is to identify compound E from the given options, which are all cyclic ketones. Oh, and there are some hints provided, so I need to make use of those.

Let me break down the reactions first:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Hmm. Also, there are hints given:

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Wait, phosphorous ylide reactions are typically used in Wittig reactions, right? So Wittig reactions form alkenes by reacting a ylide with an aldehyde or ketone. So, compound A must be a carbonyl compound, since it reacted with a ylide to form an alkene.

The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw that structure.

Wait, the name is a bit complicated. Let's parse it. The main ring is cyclopentane. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group attached. Propan-2-ylidene would be a group like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait no, propan-2-ylidene is the group -C(CH3)₂? Wait, no, wait. Let's think. The substituent is propan-2-ylidene, which is CH₂-C(CH3)=. Wait, no, the substituent is a propenyl group, perhaps.

Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be a substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached at C2. So, the structure would be CH₂-CH(CH3)-, but as a ylidene? Hmm, maybe it's (CH3)2C=CH- attached to the cyclopentane.

Wait, no, perhaps it's a cyclopentane ring with substituents. Let me try to draw this in my mind. The compound is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane has two methyl groups on carbons 1 and 2. Then, on carbon 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a propyl group with a double bond starting at C2. So, the substituent is CH₂-CH(CH3)-, but as a ylidene, so perhaps it's a double bond. So the structure would have a double bond between carbons 4 and some adjacent carbon.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinylic group,
