Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me think through it. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that's 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given K for the complex is 5x10^10. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions.

Wait, the problem says the pH is ideal. Oh right, EDTA's ability to complex ions depends a lot on pH. But since pH is ideal, I probably don't have to worry about the protonation states of EDTA. So maybe I can use the formation constant as given.

The formation constant, K, is for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA^4- form the complex. The formula is usually written as Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So the K would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote this as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

In solution, some of this complex might dissociate. But because K is so large (5e10), which is a big number, that suggests the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is minimal, meaning [Ca²+] would be very low.

Let me set up an ICE table to model the dissociation.

ICE Table:
Initial:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] = 0 (approx)
[EDTA^4-] = 0 (approx)

Change:
Let x be the amount dissociated. So,
[CaEDTA^2-] decreases by x → 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02
[Ca²+] increases by x → x
[EDTA^4-] increases by x → x

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

So the K expression becomes:
K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10

So 0.02 / x² = 5e10 → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root of that is sqrt(4)=2, and 10^(-13/2) = 10^-6.5. So 2e-6.5 M.

Wait, 10^-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7, so 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Oh, that looks familiar. So [Ca²+] is about 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that must be the answer. But let me double-check my setup. Oh, wait, K is given as 5e10, so I think my approach is correct.

Alternatively, sometimes EDTA's K is given as log K, but in this case, it's given as K, so my calculation should be okay. Also, since K is so large, x is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation holds.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, we denote \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Let \(x\) represent the concentration of dissociated \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\) at equilibrium. Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

Converting \(10^{-6.5}\) to scientific notation:

\[
10^{-6.5} = 3.16 \times 10^{-7}
\]

Thus:

\[
x = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

This corresponds to the concentration of calcium ions, \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)**.

Answer: C
