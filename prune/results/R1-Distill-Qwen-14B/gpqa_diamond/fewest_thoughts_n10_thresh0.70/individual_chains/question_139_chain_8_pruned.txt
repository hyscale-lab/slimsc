Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I need to figure out the right starting materials A and B that, when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce two different diketones. Hmm, let me think.

The question says that treating A gives 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione, and treating B gives 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. I remember that sodium nitrite and HCl are involved in diazotization reactions, but wait, that's typically for aromatic amines. Oh, wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Alternatively, maybe it's about the formation of carbonyl groups from alcohols or something else.

Wait a second, another reaction that involves HCl, NaNO2, and H2O is the hydrolysis of nitro compounds or maybe the Beckmann rearrangement. Oh right! The Beckmann rearrangement is when a nitro group in a carbonyl compound rearranges upon treatment with acid, forming an amine. But wait, that's when you have a nitro group attached to a carbonyl, like in nitroalkanes or nitro esters. But in this case, the products are diketones. So perhaps the starting materials are something that can form a ketone upon some kind of rearrangement or elimination.

Wait, another thought: when you have a secondary or tertiary alcohol treated with nitrous acid (from NaNO2 and HCl) and then hydrolyzed, maybe it's forming a carbonyl group. Oh, wait, I think that's the Stephen reduction or something else. No, Stephen is for ketones to aldehydes. Alternatively, maybe it's about the formation of a carbonyl from a nitro compound. Or perhaps it's the HNO2-induced dehydration of an alcohol to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, right! I think that the treatment of alcohols with nitrous acid can lead to the formation of carbonyl groups. Specifically, for secondary alcohols, treatment with nitrous acid (like HONO) can cause the formation of a carbonyl group via an elimination reaction. So, if you have a secondary alcohol, under certain conditions, it can lose
