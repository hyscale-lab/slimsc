Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle in a given state. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let's parse the problem. The particle is in a state that's a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. Oh wait, right, |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator.

The operator we need to find the expectation value for is 10σz +5σx. So I guess I need to compute the expectation value ⟨10σz +5σx⟩.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator O is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. So for this problem, I can compute each part separately and then add them up.

Let's break it down. The operator is 10σz +5σx, so the expectation value will be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

I'll compute each expectation value separately.

First, ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The expectation value of σz is just the weighted sum of the eigenvalues.

The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. The state is a linear combination: 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩.

Calculating ⟨σz⟩:
= |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1)
Wait, because expectation is sum of probabilities times eigenvalues.

Calculating the coefficients squared:
0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, moving on to ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which flips the spin states. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, but that might not be directly helpful here.

I think the way to calculate ⟨σx⟩ is to express the state in terms of the σx eigenstates, but maybe it's easier to just compute the matrix elements.

Wait, alternatively, I can use the formula for expectation value in terms of the state components.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when you apply σx to |↑⟩, you get |↓⟩, and vice versa.

But perhaps another approach is to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let's write this as a column vector. Let's see, in the standard basis, |↑⟩ is [1; 0], and |↓⟩ is [0;1].

So ψ can be written as [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Now, σx is the matrix:
[[0, 1],
 [1, 0]]

So to find ⟨σx⟩, we compute ψ† σx ψ.

Let me compute that.

ψ† is the conjugate transpose, but since all coefficients are real here, it's just [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ† σx ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Let me compute the matrix multiplication step by step.

First, multiply σx by ψ:

σx * ψ = [0*0.5 +1*(sqrt(3)/2) , 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2)]^T.
Which is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, multiply ψ† by this result:

0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.

Wait, let me compute that correctly.

Wait no, actually, the multiplication is:

[0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Which is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.

So that's (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) )= 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check. Maybe I should compute it another way.

Alternatively, perhaps using the expectation value formula:

⟨σx⟩ = (a*b' + a'*b), where a and b are the coefficients of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, respectively.

Wait, because σx can be written as |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

So, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (⟨↑| a* ) + (⟨↓| b* )) * (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑| ) * (a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩ )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write it as:

⟨σx⟩ = |a|^2 ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + a b* ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + a* b ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ + |b|^2 ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩.

But σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ = ⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0.

Similarly, ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩ = 0.

The cross terms:

⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ = ⟨↑|↑⟩ =1.

⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ = ⟨↓|↓⟩ =1.

So putting it all together:

⟨σx⟩ = a b* *1 + a* b *1.

Since a and b are real numbers here (the coefficients are real), a* =a, b* =b.

So ⟨σx⟩ = a b + a b = 2ab.

Wait, because a and b are the coefficients in ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩.

In our case, a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

So 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) )= (2 * 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 )= (sqrt(3)/2 ) ≈ 0.866.

Yes, that's correct. So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but in the previous calculation using the matrix, I also got sqrt(3)/2, which is the same. So that seems correct.

So now, going back to the original expectation value:

⟨10σz +5σx⟩ =10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

We have:

⟨σz⟩ = -0.5.

⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5*(0.8660)≈4.33.

Adding these together: -5 +4.33= -0.67.

Wait, that's -0.67. But let me check the options.

Looking at the options: A) -1.4, B)1.65, C)-0.7, D)0.85.

Hmm, my result is approximately -0.67, which is close to option C, which is -0.7.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a calculation error. Let me recheck.

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866.

5*0.866 is 4.33.

10σz's expectation is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

So sum is 4.33-5= -0.67. So the expectation value is approximately -0.67.

Rounded to one decimal place, that would be -0.7, which is option C.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because sometimes when people round, 0.67 is closer to 0.7 than to 0.6, so -0.67 would be -0.7 when rounded to one decimal.

So the correct answer should be option C) -0.7.

Wait, but I need to confirm my calculations once more.

Wait, the coefficients for the state: 0.5 for |↑⟩, and sqrt(3)/2 for |↓⟩. Let's confirm that these are normalized.

(0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 0.25 +0.75=1. So normalization is fine.

Another check: for σz, since |↑⟩ is +1, and |↓⟩ is -1, the expectation is 0.25*1 + 0.75*(-1)= 0.25 -0.75= -0.5. Correct.

For σx, the expectation is 2ab, which is 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2)= (sqrt(3)/2) ≈0.866.

So 5 times that is approximately 4.33.

10σz gives -5, so total is -0.67.

Yes, that seems right.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The state \( \psi \) is a linear combination of these eigenstates, so the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2 \cdot (+1) + \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 \cdot (-1).
\]

Calculating the probabilities:
\[
|0.5|^2 = 0.25, \quad \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75.
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot (+1) + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator flips the spin states. Its expectation value is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab,
\]

where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Substituting the values:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) + 5 \cdot 0.866.
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5, \quad 5 \cdot 0.866 \approx 4.33.
\]

Adding these:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Round to One Decimal Place
Rounding \( -0.67 \) to one decimal place gives \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to **Option C**.
