Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are Cis and Trans versions of propenyl and butenyl acetates. Let me see what I can figure out.

First, I should probably recall what these compounds look like. Acetate esters generally have the structure R-OAc, where R is the alkenyl group. So for propenyl acetate, R would be CH2CH2CH2, but wait, propenyl is actually CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propenyl is actually CH2=CHCH2- group. Wait, but propenyl has a double bond. So for propenyl acetate, it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Similarly, butenyl is four carbons with a double bond.

Now, the NMR data given is:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

Let me think about each signal. The acetate group typically has an OAc which has two methyl groups, but wait, no, the acetate is OAc- which is O-CO-O-. Wait no, the acetate ester is OAc attached to an oxygen. The methyl group in the acetate (the O-CO-OCH2CH3?) No, wait, the acetate is OAc-O-R, so the acetate is O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, acetate is CH3COO- as the ester. So in the ester, the structure is R-O-CO-CH3. So the methyl group (CH3) attached to the carbonyl would be a singlet, right? Because it's three equivalent protons attached to a carbon that's next to the carbonyl. So that's the 2.1 ppm (3H, s) peak. That makes sense because the methyl group in acetate is usually around 2 ppm as a singlet.

Next, the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is another triplet, but wait, it's a doublet. Hmm, 3H as doublet. That probably comes from a methyl group adjacent to a double bond. Because in allylic positions, a CH2 or CH3 group next to a double bond would split into a multiplet but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, but for a propenyl group, like CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the structure would have a CH2 next to the double bond. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond. So maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, that's 1-propenyl. Alternatively, maybe it's CH3CH=CH-OAc. No, wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as the substituent.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible structures for the options. The options are Cis-prop
