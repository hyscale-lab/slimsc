Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The more massive the planet and the closer it is to the star, the bigger the shift, right?

The question says both stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So the planets are probably similar in mass, but their orbital periods are what we're comparing.

The key data points are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. Wait, so planet #2 causes a bigger shift than planet #1. But wait, since the stars are the same mass, a larger shift would mean the planet is more massive or closer? Oh wait, both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so same mass. That means the shift must be due to the planet's proximity. Because the closer the planet, the stronger the gravitational pull, leading to a larger RV shift.

The RV method's measured velocity semi-amplitude (K) depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit (but assuming it's edge-on, which gives the maximum effect, so maybe we can ignore that), and the distance of the planet. The formula I think is K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1/(1 - e²))^(1/2) )) * (1/(1 AU))^(1/3) ) * something... Hmm, maybe that's getting too complicated.

Wait, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/P) ) * (1/(c)) )... Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Let me think again.

Oh right! The RV semi-amplitude formula is K = [ (G * P )/(2π c³) )^(1/3) ] * [ (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think in terms of the Doppler shift and how it relates to the planet's orbital period. Another thought: since the stars have the same mass and the planets are similar in mass, the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Wait no, wait. Let me think about Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. But in the RV method, the semi-amplitude K depends on the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter. The formula for K is:

K = (v) ≈ [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (
