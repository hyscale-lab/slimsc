Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, right?

The question says both stars have the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift in the spectral line, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. Like, a bigger shift means the star is moving faster because of the planet's tug. So the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is higher for Planet #2 since 7 is bigger than 5.

Wait, the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude K, which depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit (but since both are circular, probably similar or we can assume same), and the orbital period. Oh wait, I'm a bit confused. The formula for K is something like K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) * (1/(2π)) )^(1/3) ) / (c) ), but maybe I should think in terms of the simplified version.

Wait, another approach: the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ) * something. Wait, I'm not getting this right. Let me think again.

I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) )^(1/3) ) * [ 1 / (c) ] * [1 / (P^(1/3)) ) ]

Wait, that might not be the exact formula. I think the correct formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(2π)) ) )^(1/3) ) / (c) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the RV semi-amplitude. Let me see. The general formula is:

K = (v) = [ (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) ] * [ (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ] * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Hmm, but maybe it's easier to think about the ratio of the velocities. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses (Neptune), their K values should relate to the inverse cube root of their orbital periods. Because the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), assuming that sin i is the same (which it is because both are circular, so i is 90 degrees, so sin i is 1 in both cases).

Wait, no, let me get this right. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ] * (1/(2π c)) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3
