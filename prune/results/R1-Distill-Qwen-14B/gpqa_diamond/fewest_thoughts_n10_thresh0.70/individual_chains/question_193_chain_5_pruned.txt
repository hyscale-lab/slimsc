Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, the formula is N ∝ 1/parallax^5. I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the sun. The formula I recall is that parallax (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So, parallax (π) = 1/d, where d is the distance. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, right, the formula is π = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases. So they're inversely related.

So if parallax is π, then d = 1/π. So π is inversely proportional to d. So maybe I can express everything in terms of d.

The number of stars N is proportional to 1/π^5. Substituting π = 1/d, that would make N proportional to (1/(1/d))^5. Wait, that's the same as (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5. Wait, no, wait. Let's see: 1/π^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. But wait, the problem says the number varies as 1/parallax^5, so N = k * (1/π^5), where k is some constant.

We can express this as N = k * d^5, since π is 1/d.

But the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance. Wait, no, actually, more precisely, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So it's about the change in N per unit distance. So we're looking for dN/dr, the derivative of N with respect to r (distance).

Wait, but N is proportional to d^5, so let's model it with N
