Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. After both reactions are done, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: one normal-phase and one chiral. The question is about how many peaks each will show.

First, I need to understand what each reaction does. Let's break it down.

Reaction I:
The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. It's treated with LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce ketones. So, I think the ketone group in the starting material will be reduced. 

Wait, the structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the ketone is at position 3. When LAH reduces a ketone, it becomes a secondary alcohol. So after reduction, the product should be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, wait—since LAH is a strong reducing agent, maybe it does more. Does it reduce other groups? Hexan-3-one is a ketone, so only that part is reduced. So, the product is an alcohol.

But wait, wait, when you reduce a ketone, you add two hydrogens. But wait, wait—no, LAH reduces carbonyl groups to alcohols. So, yes, the ketone (C=O) becomes a CH(OH) group.

Wait, but let me think about the stereochemistry. The starting material is (S) configuration at the 5-methoxy group. Does the reduction change the configuration? Oh, wait, the reduction is at the 3-position. So the 3-ketone becomes 3-hydroxyl. The configuration at position 3—originally, the ketone was a trigonal planar, so the reduction would create a new chiral center if it wasn't already. Wait, the starting
