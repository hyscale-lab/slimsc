Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think through this.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different values in meters.

I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime, where c is the speed of light. But wait, how do I find the lifetime?

Oh, right! The lifetime τ is connected to the decay width Γ via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For the width Γ, which is the uncertainty in energy, the corresponding uncertainty in time (which is the lifetime τ) is given by τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the exact formula is τ = ħ / Γ, but I should double-check that.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Then the mean decay distance would be c * τ, so c * (ħ/Γ). But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, I've heard that the mean decay length L is given by L = c * β * γ * τ, where β is v/c and γ is the Lorentz factor. Oh
