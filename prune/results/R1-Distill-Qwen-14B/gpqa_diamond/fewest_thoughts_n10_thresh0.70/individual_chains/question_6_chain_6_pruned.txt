Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions, and the potential is given as a function of (r, θ). The potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. We need to find the energy spectrum, and the options are given as A to D.

Hmm, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials, especially in two dimensions, it's often useful to separate the problem into radial and angular parts. But wait, this potential depends on both r and θ, so maybe it's not spherically symmetric. Spherical symmetry would have the potential depend only on r, but here there's a cos²θ term. So I think this is an anisotropic potential, maybe like a perturbation or something else.

Wait, but the potential might be separable. Let me try to write V(r,θ) as the sum of two terms. The first term is (1/2)k r², which is like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions since in 2D, the harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2)k r². The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, maybe I can express this in terms of some angular parts.

Wait, cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2)k r² * [ (1 + cos2θ)/2 ] 

Let me compute that. The first term is (1/2)k r². The second term becomes (3/2)k r² * 1/2 = (3/4) k r², and (3/2)k r² * cos2θ/2 = (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

So V(r,θ) = (1/2 k r² + 3/4 k r²) + (3/4 k r² cos2θ )

Wait, so that's ( (1/2 + 3/4) k
