Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere, the Boltzmann distribution is involved. Oh right, Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, so the excitation level is proportional to the population of that energy state. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, I think 1.38e-23 is actually the Boltzmann constant multiplied by a certain temperature, but wait, the Boltzmann constant is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So if the energy difference ΔE is equal to k*T, then ΔE = k * T_avg? Or wait, no, the energy difference is fixed here because it's the same transition for both stars. So each star's temperature affects the ratio of populations.

The Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations between two energy levels is n2/n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ). So here, for star_1 and star_2, the populations are in a ratio. The problem states that in star_1
