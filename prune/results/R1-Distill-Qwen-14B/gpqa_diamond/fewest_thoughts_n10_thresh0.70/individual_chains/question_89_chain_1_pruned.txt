Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, giving a product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, which gives product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the NMR of product 3.

Hmm, let's start with the first reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. The reaction is dehydrohalogenation, which follows E2 mechanism. So, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with KOH should eliminate two molecules of HBr, forming an alkene. Since the starting material is symmetrical (1,3-dibromo), the product should be a trans-alkene because of the anti-periplanar requirement of E2.

Wait, but adamantane is a diamondoid structure. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on adjacent carbons (since adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane structure). Eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond. So product 1 should be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: each carbon is a bridgehead, so elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C3? But wait, in adamantane, the positions are such that C1 and C3 are across the structure. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, elimination would form an exo double bond, perhaps, making a more stable more substituted alkene.

Wait, maybe it's simpler to consider the product as an adamantane derivative with a double bond. So product 1 is 1,3
