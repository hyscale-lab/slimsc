Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So, the question is about particles produced in a detector and how many reach the inner walls based on their Lorentz factor. Hmm, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to how much time dilation and length contraction occurs in special relativity.

So, the setup is that when particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector, they produce new particles. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, specifically with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector, and the radius is 30 meters.

Wait, the question is asking, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead of one third.

I think the key here is the relationship between the speed of the particles and the time they take to reach the detector's walls. Since they are moving at a high Lorentz factor, their lifetime is extended due to time dilation. So, for a given radius, particles need to have enough lifetime to travel that distance before decaying.

Let me think about it step by step.

First, the detector has a radius R = 30 meters. The particles are produced at the center, so they have to travel a distance R to reach the inner walls.

The lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame (the detector's frame) is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau). So, the lab lifetime is gamma * tau.

The speed of the particle is v ≈ c, since they are ultra-relativistic. So, the time it takes to reach the wall is t = R / v ≈ R / c.

For the particle to reach the wall before decaying, this time t must be less than the lifetime. So, t < gamma * tau. Because if the time is less, then the particle hasn't decayed yet when it reaches the wall.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the probability of the particle decaying in time t is given by 1 - e^{-t/(gamma tau)}. Because decay follows an exponential law. So, the survival probability is e^{-t/(gamma tau)}.

Wait, no, wait. The decay probability is P = 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)). So, the probability that the particle decays before reaching the wall is 1 - e^{- t/(gamma tau)}. The probability of not decaying (reaching the wall) is e^{- t/(gamma tau)}.

In the original scenario, Lorentz factor gamma1 is 20. One third of the particles reach the walls, so the survival probability is 1/3.

So, 1/3 = e^{- t1/(gamma1 tau)}.

t1 is the time to reach the wall with gamma1. Since t = R/(v), and v ≈ c, t ≈ R/(c) = 30 m / 3e8 m/s. Let me compute that. 30 / 3e8 is 1e-7 seconds, or 1e-7 s.

But wait, perhaps we can work in natural units where c=1 to make the calculations easier. So, t = R / c = R when c=1.

So, t = R. Because if c=1, then t = 30 m. Wait, no, because if we're using natural units where c=1, then time and distance have the same units. But in this case, maybe I should just keep t = R / c, which is 30/(3e8) = 1e-7 seconds.

Wait, but for the problem, perhaps the exact time isn't needed, as we can relate the different scenarios using the same t formula.

Wait, in the first case, gamma1 is 20, and survival is 1/3. So,

1/3 = e^{ - (R/(gamma1 c)) * (1/tau) }.

Wait, no, the survival probability is e^{- t/(gamma tau)}, where t is the time in the lab frame. Wait, no, I think I might be mixing up the expressions.

Wait, the proper lifetime is tau. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. The time taken to reach the detector wall is t = R / v. Since v is approximately c, t ≈ R/(c).

So, the condition for the particle to reach the wall is t < gamma * tau. Because if the time taken is less than the lifetime, the particle will reach the wall before decaying.

Wait, but the decay probability is P = 1 - e^{- t/(gamma tau)}. So, the survival probability is S = e^{- t/(gamma tau)}.

In the first scenario, gamma1=20, and S1=1/3. So,

1/3 = e^{ - t/(gamma1 tau) }

Taking natural logs on both sides,

ln(1/3) = - t/(gamma1 tau)

Which gives t/(gamma
