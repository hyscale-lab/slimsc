Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let's read it carefully.

So, the setup involves particles being collided in a spherical detector. When they collide, new particles are produced. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Hmm. I think I need to relate the Lorentz factor to how far the particles travel before decaying. Since the particles are fast-decaying, their lifetime is probably very short, but their speed is so high that some reach the detector walls.

Wait, the key here might be the relationship between the particles' lifetime as observed in the lab frame and the distance they can travel before decaying. Because at high speeds (ultra-relativistic), their lifetime is lengthened due to time dilation. So the proper lifetime (their own frame) is short, but in the lab frame, it's longer.

The distance a particle travels before decaying is given by the product of their speed, lifetime, and some efficiency perhaps. But since they're ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately c, the speed of light. So distance L ≈ γ * c * τ, where τ is the proper lifetime, and γ is the Lorentz factor.

In the first scenario, with γ = 20, one third of the particles reach the detector walls (30 meters). So for these particles that reach the wall, their distance L must be at least 30 meters. So 30 = γ * c * τ. But only one third of them make it, which suggests that maybe only a fraction are traveling in the right direction or something? Or perhaps it's about the probability of decay over time.

Wait, maybe the decay is exponential. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed after time t is P = exp(-t/τ). So the distance they can travel is c * t ≈ c * (γ τ) * (1 - exp(-t/τ)) )? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think again. The proper lifetime is
