Okay, so I've got this question about an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light, wavelength λ, is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field where intensity maxima and minima occur. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity, under the small angle approximation where tan(theta) ≈ theta.

Hmm, I remember that when a light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, and the pattern observed is called a diffraction pattern. For a single slit, the minima occur at certain angles based on the slit width. The formula I remember is that the angle θ for the m-th minimum is given by a sinθ = mλ, where 'a' is the slit width. But wait, that's for a single slit scenario. Here, the aperture is a polygon with many sides, especially when N is very large.

Wait, when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, the polygon tends towards a circle. So in that case, the problem reduces to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture. But wait, no, the question says the apothems are all same length 'a'. Wait, what's an apothem?

Oh, right, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular N-gon, each apothem is length 'a'. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes
