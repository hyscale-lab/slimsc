Okay, so I've got this question about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one when solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and matrix exponentials. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the key factor that allows this conversion. The options are A to D, with things like stability analysis, nonlocal boundary conditions, complex roots, and linear partial fractions.

Wait, the method involves higher-order finite differences and parallel splitting. So, the matrix exponential is being approximated by a fractional approach. Matrix exponentials often come up in solving systems of differential equations, right? Like in the solutions of PDEs, especially heat equations which are parabolic.

When you have a system expressed as du/dt = Au, the solution is u(t) = e^(At)u0. But numerically computing e^(At) can be tricky, especially for large matrices. So they're approximating it with a fractional approximation. I think fractional approximation methods, like those using Pade approximants, are sometimes used to approximate matrix exponentials more efficiently.

Now, the key factor for converting the algorithm from sequential to parallelâ€”parallel splitting usually means breaking the problem into parts that can be computed simultaneously. So maybe the method used in the approximation allows for splitting the matrix into components that can be exponentiated independently or in parallel.

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: That's important for ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up, but it's more about whether the method works correctly, not about making it parallel. So probably not the key factor here.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal conditions are tricky, but I'm not sure how they directly relate to parallelism. Maybe if the boundary conditions allow for some decomposition, but I'm not certain. Not the first thing that comes to mind for parallel algorithms.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Hmm, fractional approximations might involve rational functions whose denominators can have roots. If the approximation has complex roots, does that affect the ability to split the computation? Maybe not directly. Or perhaps the presence of complex roots allows for certain types of decomposition, but I'm not clear.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Oh wait, linear partial fraction decomposition! That's when you break a rational function into simpler fractions. For example, if the denominator factors into linear terms, you can write it as a sum of fractions with those factors as denominators. If the approximation leads to a function that can be decomposed this way, each term could be exponentiated separately, perhaps allowing for parallel computation since each part can be handled independently.

Wait, because when you have a matrix exponential involving a sum of matrices, like e^(A+B) isn't e^A e^B. But if the approximation leads to a situation where the exponent can be split into terms that commute, then perhaps each can be computed in parallel. But how does the partial fraction decomposition help here?

Alternatively, linear partial fraction decomposition might allow the matrix to be split into additive components, each of which can be exponentiated separately and then combined. If each component's exponential can
