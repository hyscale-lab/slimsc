Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand what's going on.

So, the scenario is about a researcher creating a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein. They're interested in how this protein affects SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a plasmid to overexpress the GADD45G gene in the mice by introducing an inducible system. They also modified the gene to include the coding sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus of the protein. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies to test the construct's expression.

But when they started testing, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. They looked into the problem and found that the plus strand of their construct has a specific DNA sequence. The question is asking why they can't overexpress the protein, and it's one of the four options given.

The question gives the DNA sequence, so I should look for possible issues in that sequence that would prevent the protein from being expressed correctly.

First, I'll think about the structure of a gene. The plus strand is the sense strand, so the coding sequence is in the same direction as the mRNA. The construct should be designed so that when transcribed, it produces mRNA that codes for the hemagglutinin tag followed by GADD45G.

Wait, but in the sequence provided, I should check for any issues like premature stop codons, issues with the reading frame, or any other features that might cause the protein not to be expressed.

Looking at the sequence, I'll try to scan for any obvious issues. The sequence starts with 5' ATG, which is the start codon (methionine), so that's good. Then comes TAC, which is tyrosine. Hmm, but wait, if there's a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus, that should be before the GADD45G coding sequence. Oh, wait, maybe the sequence starts with the HA tag.

Wait, the HA tag is a small peptide, usually around 11 amino acids, which is encoded by a short DNA sequence. The given sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So, the HA tag's coding sequence should be right after the start codon. Let me think about the HA tag's DNA sequence.

The HA tag is derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. The most common tag is YPYDVPDYA, which is 10 amino acids. The DNA would be something like TAC TTT GTA CTT ATA GGT ATA TTA. Wait, but maybe the exact sequence varies. Alternatively, sometimes the coding sequence is designed as a short peptide, perhaps with a restriction site or something else.

Wait, but in the provided DNA sequence, I notice that after the ATG, the next few codons are TAC (tyr),
