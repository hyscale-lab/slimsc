Okay, I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should focus on that one. Both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods and host stars are different. Let me break down the information given.

So, Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. That means Planet_1 is orbiting much closer to its star since the period is shorter. Also, the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Hmm, same radius but different masses. That probably means the Planet_1's star is more massive but same size, so it's maybe a subgiant or something.

Wait, the probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. The formula I remember is that the probability (p) is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (1 - (R_planet / R_star)² )^{-1/2} } but wait, no, maybe it's more about the relative size and the orbital inclination.

Wait, the transit probability is actually higher when the orbital plane is edge-on. The probability depends on the alignment, but if both planets are detected via RV method, they have some inclination, but not necessarily edge-on. Oh, but the RV method detects planets with any inclination, but the transit method only works when the orbital plane is edge-on. But in this question, they're already planning to observe for transits, so the question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting given their orbital parameters.

Wait, no, the transit probability is given by the formula p = R_p / (a_p * sqrt(1 - e^2)) ), but wait, when the orbit is circular (e=0), it simplifies. Alternatively, another formula I remember is that the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_star)² multiplied by something else. Or maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius and the planet's orbit. Let me think again.

The probability of a transit depends on the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The formula
