Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits. Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits its host star from our point of view, it blocks a bit of the star's light, and we can detect that dip. But the probability of that happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, so their radii might be similar? But wait, the problem says they have Earth-like planets, so probably similar in size to Earth. But maybe the star's radius plays a role here.

So, the planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, orbital period relates to the size of the orbit. Shorter period means closer orbit, right? So Planet_1 is closer to its star.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So higher mass but same radius—maybe Planet_1's star is more massive but compact, or maybe it's in a different stage. But for this problem, the star's radius being the same is important.

Transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Or wait, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance? Let me think. The formula I remember is P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_planet/M_star)^{1/3} )) ), but wait, no—I think another angle. The probability is roughly proportional to R_star / (a), but actually, the exact formula for the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is approximately (R_star / a), but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, the transit probability is about the chance that the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The formula is more like (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor, but I think that the main factor is that the probability is roughly (R_star / a) times the probability of the orbital inclination being just right. But since both planets have circular orbits, but the probability depends on the alignment.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbit is closer to edge-on.
