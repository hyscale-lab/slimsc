Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a reaction scheme involving several compounds, and I need to identify compound E. There are some hints provided that should help. Let me start by reading through the problem and the hints carefully.

So, the reaction steps are:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

The options given are four different ketones. The hints are about the structure of A and the IR spectra of A and E.

Let me look at the first part of the problem again. The reaction of A with HCN gives B. HCN is a nucleophile, so it's likely adding into some kind of carbonyl group. That makes me think that A is a ketone because HCN usually adds to ketones (or aldehydes) via nucleophilic addition. So A is probably a cyclic ketone.

Then, B is formed when A reacts with HCN. HCN adds to a carbonyl to form a cyanohydrin. Wait, but the reaction of a ketone with HCN would typically give a cyanohydrin, which would have an -OH and a -CN group adjacent. But wait, sometimes HCN can add to a carbonyl to form an aminol if there's an amine involved, but I don't think that's the case here.

So, after HCN addition, B would have an -OH and a -CN group. Then, when B is hydrogenated (reduced) with H2 and Pd, it becomes compound C. Hydrogenation of what? Well, if B is a cyanohydrin, then the -CN group is a nitrile. Hydrogenation of the nitrile would convert it into an amine, but wait, no, wait. Wait, hydrogenation of nitriles (R-CN) with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically give a primary amine (R-CH2-NH2), but that's under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation is more about reducing any double bonds. Wait, but the cyanohydrin from a ketone would have a single bond, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me think about the structure of A and the reactions.

Another approach: Let's consider the structure of compound A. The first hint says that when A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it gives 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, a phosphorous ylide is typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an ylide
