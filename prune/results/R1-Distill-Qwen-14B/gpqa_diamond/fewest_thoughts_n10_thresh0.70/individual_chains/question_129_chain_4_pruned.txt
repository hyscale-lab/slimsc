Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what the question is about. The question involves a series of reactions leading to compound E, and I have to identify which option is correct. 

First, let me try to break down each step of the reaction scheme.

The problem says:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are two hints provided. 

Let me think about each step and what kind of compounds are involved.

Starting with step 1: A + HCN → B. HCN is a nucleophile. When a carbonyl compound reacts with HCN, it typically forms a cyanohydrin. So, I'm thinking that compound A is a ketone or aldehyde because those are the typical carbonyl groups that react with HCN. The product B would then be a cyanohydrin, which is a vicinal diol nitrile.

Wait, wait, or is it the other way around? Oh no, wait. HCN adds to a carbonyl. For example, if A is a ketone, say cyclohexanone, then adding HCN would give (R2C(O)) + HCN → R2C(OH)CN. But wait, no, more accurately, the addition would give R2C(OH)-CN, but wait, I think I might be mixing this up. Alternatively, maybe A is an aldehyde. But regardless, B is a cyanohydrin.

Then, step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. Pd is a catalyst, H2 is hydrogen. So this is hydrogenation. In the case of a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol and a nitrile group, hydrogenation would probably reduce the nitrile group to an amine. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, the cyanohydrin is R2C(OH)-CN. Upon hydrogenation, maybe the nitrile group (CN) becomes CH2NH2? Or wait, no. Hydrogenation of a nitrile (RCN) with
