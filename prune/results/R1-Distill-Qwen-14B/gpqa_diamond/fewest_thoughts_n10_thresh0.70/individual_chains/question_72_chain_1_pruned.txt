Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. After that, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form the final product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are on product 4. The options are A) 8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm. I think I'll need to figure out what each reaction does and what the structures look like after each step.

Let me start by breaking down each reaction step by step.

First step: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene reacts with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature.

I think this is a Diels-Alder reaction. Wait, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, maybe it's an SN2 reaction. But wait, the diene has two dibromomethyl groups, each with Br atoms. So maybe it's a substitution reaction where the tert-butoxy group is a good leaving group? Or perhaps it's a coupling reaction.

Wait, the starting material is a bicyclo structure with a tert-butoxy group. The other molecule is a cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl substituents. So maybe the diene is acting as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction. But wait, the starting diene is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which is a norbornene structure. Norbornene is a good diene for Diels-Alder reactions.

Wait, but then
