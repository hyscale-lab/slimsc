Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentration of cobalt is 10^-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm. So, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) are used to determine the concentration of metal-ligand complexes in solution. The higher the beta value, the more stable the complex. 

The complexes in this case are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. The beta values given are for each successive addition of SCN- to the Co(II) ion. So, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^2+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^+, β3 for [Co(SCN)₃], and β4 for [Co(SCN)₄]^2- or something like that.

Wait, wait. Stability constants (formation constants) are typically given for each step. The overall stability constant for a complex with n ligands is the product of the stepwise constants. Or wait, maybe each β represents the formation from the previous complex. So, β1 would be the formation of the first complex, β2 the second, etc. So, the overall formation constant for the fourth complex would be β1 * β2 * β3 * β4? Or perhaps each β is for adding one SCN to the previous complex.

Wait, no, I think each beta is the stepwise formation constant. So β1 is K for [Co(SCN)]^2+ formation:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]^2+ ; β1 = [ [Co(SCN)]^2+ ] / ( [Co^2+][SC
