Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. So, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with metal-ligand complexes, the stability constants (β) are crucial. These constants tell us how stable a particular complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex is compared to the others.

The metal here is cobalt(II), and the ligand is thiocyanate (SCN-). The problem gives us the stability constants for complexes up to four ligands. The β values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, but I think the order might matter. Usually, βn is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So, β1 is the constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^(?), and so on. Wait, I should clarify that.

The total concentration of cobalt is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think refers to the [Co(SCN)₂]^something complex. Wait, the question says "dithiocyanato," which is two SCN- ligands. So, the complex is [Co(SCN)₂]^n+.

But wait, the complexes could have different charges. Let me think: Co is Co²+. Each SCN- is -1. So, [Co(SCN)]+ would be Co²+ + SCN^- → charge is +1. [Co(SCN)₂]^(0) would be Co²+ + 2 SCN^- → 2-2 = 0. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about the charges, but maybe that's not the biggest issue here.

The main point is to compute the fractions of each possible complex and sum the fraction for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2? Or is it n=2 or n=4? Wait, the options are percentage of the blue dithiocyanato, which I think is [Co(SCN)₂]^(something). But let's proceed.

We have four possible complexes: Co²+ (n=0), [CoSCN]^+ (n=1), [Co(SCN)₂]^0 (n=2), [Co(SCN)₃]^- (n=3), and [Co(SCN)₄]^2- (n=4). But wait, the β4 is 16. So, we have five complexes, from n=0 to n=4. Oh wait, no—n=0 is just the free ion, the others are complexes with 1, 2, 3, 4 ligands.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these complexes plus the free Co²+? Wait, no. The total [Co] is the sum of all species: [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]^- + [Co(SCN)₄]^2−. So, all these add up to 1e-2 M.

The thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. But SCN- is a ligand, so it's consumed in forming the complexes. So, the total [SCN-] in solution is the sum of free SCN- and the SCN- bound in complexes. Wait, but the given [SCN-] is 0.1 M, which is the total, including the free and the bound? Or is it the free concentration? Hmm, the wording says, "the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M." That's a bit ambiguous. Wait, in solution chemistry, [SCN-] usually refers to the total concentration, which includes both free and bound ligand. Or does it refer to the free SCN-? I think in such problems, [SCN-] is the total, including all forms. But I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the formation of complexes. The formation of each complex consumes SCN- ions. So, the total SCN- concentration is the sum of free SCN- and the SCN- bound in complexes. So, if the initial concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, then:

Total SCN- = [SCN^-]_free + sum (n_i * [Co_i]) for i from 1 to 4.

But wait, for each complex, the number of SCN- per Co is n. So, for each [Co(SCN)_n], each mole contributes n moles of SCN-.

So, total SCN- = [SCN^-]_free + Σ (n * [Co(SCN)_n]).

But [SCN^-]_free is the concentration of free SCN- in solution. So, the initial [SCN-] is 0.1 M, which would be [SCN^-]_free + sum (n [Co(SCN)_n]) ) = 0.1.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased is that the solution contains Co(II) and thiocyanate, with concentrations 1e-2 and 0.1 M. So, maybe the initial concentrations are [Co^2+] = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. Then, when the complexes form, the concentrations of the complexes are determined by the stability constants.

But let me think about the approach. To find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), I need to find the fraction of all Co species that are in the [Co(SCN)_2] form.

The stability constants (β) are given for each complex. The general formula for the fraction of a complex is given by the β and the concentrations of metal and ligand.

The fraction f_n for each complex [Co(SCN)_n] is given by:

f_n = (β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n) / Σ (β_k [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^k) for k=0 to 4)

Wait, but wait. For each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^k, the formation constant β_n is defined as:

β_n = [Co(SCN)_n] / ( [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n )

So, [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

The total [Co] is the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n]:

Σ [Co(SCN)_n] = [Co^2+] + Σ_{n=1}^4 [Co(SCN)_n] = [Co^2+] + Σ (β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n )

Wait, but [Co^2+] is the free ion. So, the total cobalt is Σ [Co(SCN)_n] = [Co_total] = 1e-2 M.

Wait, but [Co_total] = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1}^4 [Co(SCN)_n}.

But since [Co(SCN)_n} = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n,
