Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. I need to identify which of the four options it is based on the given IR and 1H NMR data.

First, let's look at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation can help. The formula is CnHmOxNp. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2n + 2 - m - x)/2, where x is the number of halogens, which we don't have here. So, for C9H11NO2:

n=9, m=11, x=2, p=1 (nitrogen). So substituting:

(2*9 +2 -11 -2)/2 = (20-13)/2 = 7/2? Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake. Oh wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, no, another way: Each double bond or ring is a degree. So the formula is (2*9 +2 -11 - 0 (no X) +1 (since N is 1))/2. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me recalculate.

The formula for degree of unsaturation is: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X (halogens), it's (2*9 +2 -11 +1)/2. That is (20 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees. So that could be a benzene ring (which accounts for 3), a double bond (another 1), and an amide or ester group (maybe another 1). Or perhaps a ring plus some other structures.

Now looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those are likely N-H stretches. Wait, but which type? If they're broad, that's usually for amides or amines. 3420 and 3325 could be two peaks, perhaps from
