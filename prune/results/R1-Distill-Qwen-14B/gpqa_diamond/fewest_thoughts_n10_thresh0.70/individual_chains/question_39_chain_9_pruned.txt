Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the normalization constant 'a' for a given wave function. Hmm, I remember that wave functions need to be normalized, which means their integral over all space should equal 1. That's the basic idea.

The wave function given is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait—particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, according to the problem. So the wave function is zero outside that region, I suppose. Or actually, the wave function might not be zero, but the probability of finding the particle there is zero. Because when we measure, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be non-zero only between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That seems a bit off because usually, wave functions are either real or can have both real and imaginary parts. But for the purpose of normalization, I think we're interested in the square of the absolute value, which would be |ψ(x)|². Because the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function.

So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Let me compute |ψ(x)|². The wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, let's write this as a real part plus imaginary part. The real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So, the modulus squared would be (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)².

Because when you compute |A + Bi|², it's A² + B².

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Since (0.5)^2 is 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but wait a second. Is the wave function the same in the region where the particles are found? Because the problem says that none were found outside x=1 and x
