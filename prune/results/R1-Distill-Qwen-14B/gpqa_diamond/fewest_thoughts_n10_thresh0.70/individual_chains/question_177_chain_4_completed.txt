Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. The question says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember something about blackbody radiation and the peak wavelength.

Wait, right, the peak wavelength emitted by a blackbody is given by Wien's Law. The law states that λ_max is proportional to 1/T, where T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Oh wait, wait. Because if λ_max is the same for both, then T is the same. Because if λ1_max = λ2_max, then T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature.

But wait, is that correct? Because the problem says that the stars' brightest wavelengths are the same. So, yes, their temperatures must be the same. Because Wien's law says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So same wavelength maxima implies same T.

Now, the next part: the radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, which probably means it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Hmm, but wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So maybe the observed wavelengths are the same, meaning that any Doppler shift from radial velocity has to be accounted for.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think. The intrinsic wavelength (emitted by the star) is determined by their temperature. But if the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength would be shorter (blue shift), and if moving away, longer (red shift). But the problem says the observed brightest wavelengths are the same. So if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, that would shift its emitted λ_max to a shorter wavelength. But Star_1 is stationary, so its λ_max is as per its temperature. Wait, but if they both have the same observed λ_max, then their intrinsic λ_max must be different? Or maybe the Doppler effect is somehow accounted for.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-read the question. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same. So, for Star_1, since its radial velocity is 0, its observed λ_max is equal to its intrinsic λ_max. For Star_2, moving at 700 km/s, but we observe the same λ_max as Star_1.

Wait, so if Star_2 is moving towards us, its emitted λ_max would be longer than observed, because of the Doppler shift. Wait, no, wait. If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted. So the observed λ would be shorter than the emitted. So the emitted λ_max (intrinsic) for Star_2 would be longer than what we observe. But in our case, the observed λ_max for both is the same. So for Star_1, λ_obs = λ_emit. For Star_2, λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 - v/c) approximately, if v is much less than c. But I'm not sure about the exact Doppler formula.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but I'm not sure if that's the relativistic formula. Alternatively, the non-relativistic approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_emit*(1 - v/c), where v is the radial velocity towards the observer. Wait, so if the star is moving towards us, v is positive, and λ_obs is shorter than λ_emit. So λ_emit would be longer.

But according to the problem, both stars have the same observed λ_max. So for Star_1, which is not moving, λ_emit1 = λ_obs. For Star_2, which is moving at v=700 km/s (let's assume it's moving towards us, since radial velocity is given as positive away or towards?), wait, the problem says Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. Wait, I'm not sure about the sign. Oh, wait, the problem states the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. But it doesn't specify direction, like whether it's approaching or receding. Hmm, that's a point of confusion. But regardless, the Doppler shift will affect the observed λ_max relative to the star's actual λ_max.

So, perhaps to find the actual temperatures of the stars, considering their radial velocities, we need to apply the Doppler shift.

Wait, but the problem says the observed λ_max is the same for both. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. Let's denote λ_emit1 as the intrinsic emission peak of Star_1, and λ_emit2 as that of Star_2.

Since Star_1 has radial velocity 0, λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

For Star_2, moving with velocity v=700 km/s, let's assume it's moving away from us (so v is positive) which would cause a redshift. Then, the observed λ_obs2 would be longer than λ_emit2. But the problem states that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So, for Star_2:

λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity (assuming v_r is positive when moving away, so that causes a redshift).

Wait, or is the formula different? Let me get the Doppler effect correct. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

But when v is much smaller than c, this can be approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_emit * (1 + v/c) for small v. But wait, actually, when the source is moving away, the observed wavelength increases, so if v_r is positive (away), then λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 + v_r / c )

Similarly, when a source is moving towards us, v_r is negative, and λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 - v_r / c )

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the source is moving towards the observer, the observed frequency is higher, so wavelength is shorter.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c )

where v_r is the radial velocity of the star relative to the observer. If v_r is positive, the source is moving away, so λ_obs is longer (redshift). If v_r is negative, moving towards (blueshift), λ_obs is shorter.

But in our case, the problem says that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So, λ_emit1 = λ_obs1, because Star_1 is stationary. For Star_2, which is moving with velocity v_r (700 km/s), the observed λ_obs2 is λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r / c ). But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we have:

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r / c )

So,

λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / (1 + v_r / c )

But wait, because if the star is moving away, the Doppler shift makes λ_obs larger. So if Star_2 is moving away, its λ_emit must be smaller (since the observed one is same as Star_1). So, wait, let's plug in.

Star_1: λ_emit1 = λ_obs.

Star_2: λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r / c )

So,

λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v_r / c )

But since Star_1's temperature is T1 and Star_2's is T2, and λ_emit is inversely proportional to T, because λ_max = b / T.

So,

λ_emit1 = b / T1

λ_emit2 = b / T2

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r / c )

=> 1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v_r / c )

=> T2 = T1 (1 + v_r / c )

But wait, velocity is 700 km/s. Let's compute v/c.

c is about 3e5 km/s, so v/c is 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = approx 0.002333.

So 1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.002333

So, T2 is slightly larger than T1. But wait, that's confusing because if Star_2 is moving away, its emission would be redshifted, meaning the intrinsic λ_emit would have to be shorter to have the same observed λ_obs as Star_1. Wait, maybe I messed up the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the inverse relation.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted light is redshifted, so λ_emit2 would be shorter than λ_obs.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If Star_2 is moving away, each wave crest is emitted from a position that's further away, so the wavelength stretches. So when Star_2 emits a wave with wavelength λ_emit2, due to moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v/c )

So, if λ_obs is the same as Star_1's λ_emit1, then:

λ_emit1 = λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v/c )

But since λ_emit1 = b / T1 and λ_emit2 = b / T2,

So,

b/T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c )

=> 1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v/c )

=> T2 = T1 (1 + v/c )

Wait, but that implies T2 > T1. But if Star_2 is moving away, its observed peak is the same as Star_1. So Star_2 must be hotter? That makes sense because if it's moving away, the emission peak would be blueshifted, but since the observed is same, the intrinsic must be hotter.

Wait, let me think of an example. Suppose Star_2 is very hot, so its emitted λ is shorter. But due to moving away, the observed λ is longer. So if the observed λ is same as Star_1's emitted λ, Star_1 must have a lower temperature than Star_2.

Wait, maybe I should calculate T2 in terms of T1.

Using T2 = T1 (1 + v/c )

v is 700 km/s:

v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333...

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + 0.002333 ) ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So, T2 is about 0.2333% higher than T1.

But wait, that's a small difference. Hmm.

But the problem says to compute the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2. So I'll need to find L1/L2.

The luminosity of a star as a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

L = 4π R² σ T⁴

So,

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4

The ratio L1/L2 is (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

We know R1 = 1.5 R2

So,

(R1 / R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25

And from earlier, T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So,

(T1 / T2 )^4 = (1 / 1.002333 )^4 ≈ (0.99767 )^4 ≈ ?

Wait, 1/1.002333 is approximately 0.99767.

So, (0.99767)^4. Let's compute that.

First, ln(0.99767) ≈ -0.00233.

So, ln( (0.99767)^4 )= 4 * (-0.00233) = -0.00932.

Exponentiating: e^(-0.00932) ≈ 0.9907.

So, (T1^4 / T2^4 ) ≈ 0.9907.

So the ratio L1/L2 is 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which is very close.

Wait, but let me compute that more accurately.

Compute (1.002333)^4:

Wait, no, (T1/T2)^4 is (1 / (1.002333))^4.

Wait, 1.002333^4 is approximately:

We can use the binomial expansion for small x: (1+x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + n(n-1)x²/2 + ... where x is small.

Here, x=0.002333, n=4.

So,

(1 + 0.002333 )^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.002333) + 6*(0.002333)^2 + 4*(0.002333)^3 + (0.002333)^4

Compute each term:

4*(0.002333) = 0.009332

6*(0.002333)^2 = 6*(~0.00000544) ≈ 0.00003264

4*(0.002333)^3 = 4*(~0.0000000125) ≈ 5e-8, negligible.

(0.002333)^4 ≈ even smaller, negligible.

So adding up:

1 + 0.009332 + 0.00003264 ≈ 1.00936464.

So, 1.00936464 is approximately (1.002333)^4.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = (1 / (1.002333)^4 ) ≈ 1 / 1.00936464 ≈ 0.9907.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Rounded to the nearest hundredth, that's approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So the correct answer would be D) ~2.23.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the Doppler effect would mean that T2 is higher, but the ratio ends up making L1 a bit less than twice as luminous as Star_2.

Wait, let me double-check. Since R1 is 1.5 times R2, and L is proportional to R^2 T^4, and T2 is slightly higher, the L1/L2 would be (2.25) * ( (T1/T2)^4 ). Since T2 is about 0.23% higher than T1, T1/T2 is about 0.99767, so to the fourth power, it's about 0.9907. So 2.25 *0.9907 is about 2.228, which is around 2.23.

So the correct option is D.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we start by analyzing the given information:

1. **Key Relationships**:
   - The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:  
     \[
     R_1 = 1.5 R_2
     \]
   - The masses of the stars are proportional to their radii, but mass does not directly affect the luminosity calculation here.
   - Both stars have the same observed wavelength at which they appear brightest (\(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\)).
   - The radial velocity of Star_1 is 0 km/s, while Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s.

2. **Temperature Determination**:
   - Using Wien's Law, the peak wavelength of a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
     \]
     Since the observed \(\lambda_{\text{max}}\) is the same for both stars, the intrinsic \(\lambda_{\text{emit}}\) of Star_2 must account for its radial velocity. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
     \]
     For small velocities (\(v \ll c\)), this can be approximated as:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} \approx \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
     \]
     Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we equate the intrinsic wavelengths:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
     \]
     Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto 1/T\), we find:  
     \[
     T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v/c)
     \]
     Given \(v = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\),  
     \[
     v/c = \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 0.002333
     \]
     Thus,  
     \[
     T_2 \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333
     \]

3. **Luminosity Calculation**:
   - The luminosity of a star as a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
     \[
     L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
     \]
     The ratio of luminosities is:  
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
     \]
     Substituting \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\) and \(T_2 \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333\), we calculate:  
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
     \]
     \[
     \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4 \approx 0.9907
     \]
     Therefore,  
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.228
     \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   - The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2. Comparing this to the options, the closest match is:  
     **D) ~2.23**

Answer: D
