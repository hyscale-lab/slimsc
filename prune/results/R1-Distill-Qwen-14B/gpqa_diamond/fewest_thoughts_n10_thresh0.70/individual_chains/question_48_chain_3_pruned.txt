Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in product 4. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so its structure is a six-membered ring with one of the carbons being a carbonyl group. So, product 1 is formed when cyclohexanone is treated with bromine. Wait, bromine... what reaction does that typically undergo here?

Oh right, cyclohexanone can undergo a haloform reaction when treated with a halogen like bromine. The haloform reaction usually involves the bromination of the methyl ketone group. So, cyclohexanone (which is a methyl ketone) reacting with Br2 would form a dibromide, but wait, I think actually it's more about the formation of a ketone with a bromine substituent. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the reactions. Alternatively, bromine could add across the double bond, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, wait, another possibility: maybe it's an addition to the carbonyl group. But cyclohexanone is a ketone; bromine might not add directly. Oh wait, no, maybe it's a substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening? Or maybe it's the formation of a cyclic bromonium ion? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait,
