Okay, so I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Let me think step by step.

First, let me draw the target molecule. The benzene ring has substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are at the 1, 2, and 3 positions. 

Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering depends on substituents. The substituents are ethoxy (OCH2CH3) at position 1, tert-butyl (C(CH3)3) at position 2, and nitro (NO2) at position 3. So the substituents are in adjacent positions, making the molecule 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, but wait, benzene is symmetric, so perhaps the order of substitution matters.

To make this, I think about the directing effects of the substituents. Nitro groups are meta directors, ethoxy is an ortho/para director, and tert-butyl is a bulky group, which is an ortho/para director but due to its bulk, it might direct more towards para. 

Wait, but substituents that come first will direct the next substitution. So the order of adding
