Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to walk through this step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Let me start by calculating the degree of unsaturation. Each degree is a ring or a double bond. The formula is C9H11NO2. So, for degrees of unsaturation:

Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, but since X (halogens) aren't present here, and N is 1.

So, 2*9 +2 =20. 20 -11 -1 (N?) Hmm, wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. So, substituting into the equation: Degrees = (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. Let me compute that. 2*9=18 +2=20. 20-11=9, +1 (since N is 1) =10. 10/2=5. Five degrees. So that could be a benzene ring (3 degrees) plus maybe an ester group or something with a double bond. Alternatively, maybe an amide or something else.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are probably N-H stretches. The medium to strong intensity suggests maybe amine or amide groups. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. Esters, amides, or perhaps ketones. Since we have an amine group (from the N in the formula), maybe an amide? Or an ester.

The 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, probably from a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something. The triplet comes from coupling with a neighboring CH2.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Could be an NH group, but in the NMR it's a singlet. Wait, but if it's amide, the NH could be exchanging and
