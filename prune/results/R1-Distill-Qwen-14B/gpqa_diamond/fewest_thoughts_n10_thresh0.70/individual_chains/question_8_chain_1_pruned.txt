Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about gene interactions in white lupine plants. The question is about figuring out which genes are transcription factors and how they interact based on the results of some mutant experiments. Hmm, I need to break this down step by step.

Alright, let me read the setup again. They did a high-throughput experiment to find genes contributing to anthracnose resistance. They got three candidates: G1, G2, G3. They made knock-outs (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants. The experiment's testing whether these mutants are more susceptible than wild-type, meaning less resistance.

The results are given as resistance percentages compared to the control. So 100% is the wild type. Let's list them:

- g1: 75% → so, less resistance than control. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance by 25%.
- g2: 0% → total loss of resistance. So G2 is super important; without it, no resistance at all.
- g3: 50% → half the resistance. So knocking out G3 reduces it by half.
- g1g3: 10% → even worse than either alone. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, resistance plummets.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2 alone. So when G2 and G3 are both out, no resistance. But since g2 alone is 0%, that makes sense.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2 alone. So when G1 and G2 are out, no resistance. But since g2 is already 0%, this suggests something else.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about epistasis. Epistatic genes are those where one gene's mutation masks the effect of another. So if a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, the other gene is epistatic.

Looking at the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% → same as g2 (0%). So the phenotype of g1g2 is same as g2. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the presence of the mutation in G2 completely masks the effect of G1.

- g1g3: 10% → lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype. So maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, or perhaps they're redundant. Hmm.

- g2g3: 0% → same as g2. So again, the presence of G2 knockout masks G3's effect. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

So from this, it looks like G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So G2 is downstream of G1 and G3 maybe, or G2 is acting in a position where its function is required regardless of others.

But wait, the question says that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So that's probably G2, because in the single knockout, g2 has 0% resistance. So if G2 is a transcription factor, then its product is necessary for any resistance. So without G2, no resistance. That makes sense.

Now, looking at the other mutants. Let's think about the possible models.

In the case of g1g3: 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either. That suggests that G1 and G3 are either acting in parallel pathways (so they add up their effects) or that they are redundant (so knocking out both gives a more severe effect than each alone). Wait, but if they’re redundant, then knocking out both would have the same effect as each single knockout. But here, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and together it's
