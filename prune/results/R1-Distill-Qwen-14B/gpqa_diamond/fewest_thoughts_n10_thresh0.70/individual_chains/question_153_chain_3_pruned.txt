Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactions. I need to determine the products for each and match them with the given options A, B, C, D.

First, let's break down each reaction.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → A.

I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The nucleophile here is from the enolate, which is generated from dimethyl malonate. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diester, and under basic conditions (like NaOEt, which is a strong base), it can form an enolate.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the Michael acceptor here. Its structure is CH₂=CHCO2Me, where the substituent on the alpha position is a p-tolyl group. Wait, wait—no, actually, for acrylate, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH₂=CHCO-OCH3, but with a substituent on the alpha carbon—like maybe on the CH₂? Hmm, wait, perhaps I should draw it out.

Wait, the compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-; substituents would be on the acrylate. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3. But wait, wait, the (E) configuration implies that the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. But in this case, the substituents are methyl and the p-tolyl group?

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. The formula for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3? No, wait
