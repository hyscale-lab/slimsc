Alright, I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me take it step by step. Okay, so the question is about a series of reactions starting from Compound A, which is C3H6. I remember C3H6 is propene, right? Because propene has the formula C3H6 and is an alkene. Let me think about each reaction.

First, Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Bromination of alkenes usually refers to an addition reaction. Since propene has a double bond between C1 and C2, bromination would add Br2 across the double bond. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, propene is CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2CHCH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, correct formula for propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when you add Br2, it would add across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane. So B is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me get the structure right. Propene is CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no. Propene is actually CH2=CHCH3. So when Br2 adds, the double bond breaks, and each Br adds to adjacent carbons. So the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane: CH
