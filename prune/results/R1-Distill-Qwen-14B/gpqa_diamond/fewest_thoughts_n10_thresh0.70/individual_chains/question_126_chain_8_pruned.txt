Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question involves two reactions, I and II. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to remember. 

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, which is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, right? So the starting material is a ketone, so reaction with LAH would reduce the ketone group to an alcohol. 

The structure for (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is: the carbonyl is at C3 (so structure is CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3, but wait, let's see. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3? No, wait. Hexan-3-one is CH3CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait numbering: hexane is six carbons. So 3-one means the ketone is on C3. So the structure would be CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. 

Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, wait, another approach: the formula is C6H11O. Wait, no, (5-methoxyhexan-3-one). So, the hexan-3-one means the ketone is at position 3. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3? Wait, that's 5-methoxy. So the substituents are: at C5, a methoxy group. So the structure is:

1   2   3   4   5   6
CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH
