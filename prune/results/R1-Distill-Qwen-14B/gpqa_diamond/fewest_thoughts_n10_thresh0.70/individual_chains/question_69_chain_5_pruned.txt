Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The problem states that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The question is asking for the minimum resolution needed in the Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy given is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, okay, so first I remember that the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. Time dilation factor is gamma (γ), which is the Lorentz factor. So γ is equal to the total energy of the particle divided by its rest mass energy. Right, because E = γ m c², so γ = E / (m c²). But since the units here are in GeV, I suppose I don't have to worry about the actual c term because it would cancel out in the units.

So, let's compute gamma. The energy E is 27 GeV and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately... let's see, 3.41 × 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41 × 8 is 27.28. So 27 is just a bit less than 8 times 3.41. So 27 / 3.41 is approximately 7.917. Let's say about 7.92.

So the lifetime in the lab frame (the frame of the bubble chamber) is τ = γ τ₀. So τ = 7.92 × 8 ×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. Let me compute that. 7.92 × 8 is 63.36, so τ = 63.36 ×10⁻¹⁶ s. Wait, that's 6.336 ×10⁻¹⁵ seconds.

Now, what's the next part? We need to find the minimum resolution needed. I think this is about the detection resolution required to see the decay products. So, the decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The formula for decay length is L = v τ. But wait, v is the velocity of the particle. So I need to calculate v, the speed of the X⁰ particle.

To find v, I can use the relationship between gamma and velocity. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Or, another approach is to find beta (β) which is v/c. Since E = γ m c², and momentum p = γ m v = γ m β c. Wait,
