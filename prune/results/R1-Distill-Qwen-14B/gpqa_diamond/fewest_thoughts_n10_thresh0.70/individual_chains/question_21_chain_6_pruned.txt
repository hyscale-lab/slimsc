Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me see what it's about. The question is about isomers and tautomerism, and it's divided into two parts, A and B. Hmm, I need to figure out each part step by step.

First, the question defines constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have different structures, while stereoisomers are the same structurally but different in spatial arrangement. But the actual question is about two compounds and which one doesn't show tautomerism, and then another pair where one shows optical isomerism.

Let's break it down. The first part (A) asks which of the two compounds doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

I remember that tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and a shift of a double bond. For example, in compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups, the hydrogen can shift, causing tautomerism. Benzoquinone is a quinone, which is a structure with two ketone groups connected by a benzene ring. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups para to each other. Wait, but waitâ€”tautomerism requires adjacent or nearby double bonds for the hydrogen shift. Benzoquinone's structure doesn't have adjacent carbonyl groups, so maybe it can't tautomerize. Or wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. That's a six-membered ring with three alternate ketones. So the carbonyl groups are at every other position. Since they're not adjacent, would tautomerism be possible? Tautomerism usually requires a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group and another double bond elsewhere. Wait, but in a cyclic structure like cyclohexane trione, maybe there's a possibility for the hydrogen to shift. Alternatively, maybe the positions are too far apart for that.

Wait, another thought. Tautomerism typically occurs when there's a conjugated system. For example, in o-quinones, where the carbonyl groups are adjacent. Benzoquinone is p-benzoquinone, so the carbonyl groups are in positions 1 and 4 on the benzene ring. So they're opposite each other, not adjacent. So, maybe benzoquinone can't exhibit tautomerism because the hydrogen isn't in a position to shift to the adjacent carbonyl. On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups spaced by one carbon each. So 1,3,5 are positions on a six-membered ring. Each carbonyl is separated by a CH2 group. Wait, but how does that affect tautomerism?

Wait, maybe I should think about whether the compounds can lose a proton and form a double bond elsewhere. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups across from each other. If a hydrogen from the benzene ring were to shift, but wait, the ring is fully conjugated with the carbonyls. Oh, wait, no, the quinone structure is a di-ketone. So in p-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=C=O. So there's a benzene ring with two carbonyl groups opposite each other. But in such a structure, can a hydrogen shift occur? I think tautomerism requires adjacent groups. For example, in 1,2-diketones, you can have tautomerism where a hydrogen moves to form a conjugated double bond. But in 1,4-diketones like p-benzoquinone, the carbonyls are not adjacent, so no tautomerism.

So for part A, benzoquinone (which is 1,4-diketone) doesn't show tautomerism. What about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? It's a 1,3,5-trione, so each pair of carb
