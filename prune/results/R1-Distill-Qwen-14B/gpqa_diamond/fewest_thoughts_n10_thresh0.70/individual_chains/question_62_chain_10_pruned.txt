Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The options are A, B, C, D with different reagents. I need to figure out the correct sequence.

First, I should probably draw the structures to understand what's happening. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond connected to another carbon). The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me parse that name.

The main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means a cyclohexane ring with a formyl (CHO) group attached. The substituent is at position 1, which is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So, the substituent is a methyl group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, that substituent is connected to the cyclohexane ring where the aldehyde is.

Hmm. So, starting from ethynylcyclohexane, I need to go through a series of reactions to get that structure.

Let me think about the steps involved. Ethynylcyclohexane is HC≡C-Cyclohexane. To get to the target, I probably need to functionalize the triple bond somehow.

The target has a hydroxyl group attached to a cyclohexylmethyl group. Also, there's an aldehyde group. So maybe oxidation is involved.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. One approach is to reduce the triple bond. But wait, reduction could lead to different products. Let me think about possible reactions.

Another thought: Maybe the triple bond is converted into something else, like an epoxide or a diol, but I'm not sure yet.

Looking at the options, the reagents include NaNH2, methyl chloride, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, Li in liquid NH3, O3, (CH3)2S, NH4OH, methanol.

So, some common reactions here: Grignard reagents, maybe. Or deprotonation, oxidation, reduction, ozonolysis, etc.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane. The triple bond is between two carbons: one attached to the cyclohexane, the other is a terminal alkyne (HC≡C-). Maybe I can do some alkyne chemistry here.

One possible pathway: first, perform a deprotonation. Using a strong base like NaNH2 (sodamide) would deprotonate a terminal alkyne to form an acetylide. So, if I use NaNH2, maybe that's the first step.

What's the next reagent after that? Looking at the options, in option A it's methyl chloride. So maybe the acetylide reacts with methyl chloride to form a longer chain. Wait, but acetylides are strong bases and will react with alkyl halides in an alkylation. So, methyl chloride would methylate the acetylide, giving HC≡C-CH2-... Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2? Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡C-, so ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached. So HC≡C- is the triple bond. So when treated with NaNH2, which deprotonates the acidic terminal hydrogen, giving a cyclohexylacetylide: cyclohexane-CH- (with the negative charge on the carbon adjacent to triple bond).

Wait, ethyn
