Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem states that it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The question is about finding the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, so in a regular harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is achieved when the potential energy is zero, so all the energy is kinetic. But wait, this is a relativistic case. Oh right, relativistic effects come into play when speeds are significant fractions of the speed of light, c.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed v_max is given by sqrt(kA²/m), right? Because the potential energy at maximum displacement (A) is (1/2)kA², and when converted to kinetic energy, (1/2)mv² = (1/2)kA² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but the question is about a relativistic scenario, so option C might not be the correct answer here.

But wait, the options include various expressions involving c and terms that look like gamma factors, since gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the energy isn't just kinetic plus potential. The total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and relativistic kinetic
