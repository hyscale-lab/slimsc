Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Okay, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO, and there's some NMR data provided. Then, it undergoes a series of reactions with specific reagents, and I need to identify the final product from the options given.

First, let me break down the information. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to understand the structure. Degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 3), a double bond (1), and an ester or amide group perhaps (another double bond, or maybe a ring again? Hmm, not sure yet.)

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet. High chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. But wait, in an aldehyde, the proton is usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But it's a triplet here, so maybe it's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like a phenol, but those are usually around 5 ppm. Or perhaps an alpha proton to a carbonyl, like in an enal or something. Hmm, wait, another possibility: an aldehyde with neighboring protons. Like in a conjugated system, maybe but I'm not sure.

- 6.98 (d, 2H): A doublet. Probably aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted aromatic rings. Let's think, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are typically as doublets. So maybe two aromatic rings, each with two protons as doublets.

- 6.51 (d, 2H): Another doublet, maybe adjacent to the first one. Could be the same
