Okay, so I've got this problem here about two stars and their elemental abundances. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I'll list out all the given data. Both stars have masses more than the Sun, but I don't think mass affects elemental ratios directly here, so maybe I can ignore that for now.

The stars' abundances are given using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. But again, maybe the method isn't crucial here because the problem gives me the abundance values directly.

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is provided:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7 - 12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, wait. Let me correct that. The formula is [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun. Oh wait, no, the way it's given in the problem might already be the log(nX/nH). Let me think. The Sun's composition is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5, which simplifies to log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But wait, perhaps the Sun's values are given as 12 + log(nX/nH) = value, which is a common way to present it. So for Star_1 and Star_2, their [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

Wait, the notation is [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun, which is the same as log(nX/nY in star / nX/nY in sun) ) = log( (nX/nY)_star / (nX/nY)_sun )

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is higher than in the Sun by 0.3 dex.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So the ratio of Fe to H
