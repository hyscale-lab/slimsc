Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and break it down.

The question is about a study on white lupine to find genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They identified three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They made knock-out mutants for each and some double mutants. The experiment is to test whether these mutants are more sensitive to the pathogen.

The results are given as resistance levels compared to the wild-type control. The control has 100% resistance, so any lower percentage means the mutant is less resistant. Let's list the data:

- g1: 75% → less than control, but not super low.
- g2: 0% → totally susceptible.
- g3: 50% → half resistance.
- g1g3: 10% → very low.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

The question is about the interaction between these genes. The options are about which gene is a transcription factor and the relationships between them, like epistasis or pleiotropy or redundancy.

First, some background: transcription factors are proteins that regulate the expression of other genes. If a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes it activates won't be expressed. So when a gene is a transcription factor, its knockout might lead to a more severe phenotype than if it were just a regular gene.

Looking at the data, the single mutants:

g2 is completely resistant? No, wait, 0% resistance. So the g2 mutant can't resist the pathogen at all. That suggests that G2 is important for resistance. If the wild type has 100%, g2 has 0%, so G2 is crucial.

What about the other single mutants: g1 has 75%, so it's less resistant but not as bad as g2. g3 is 50%, so even worse than g1.

Now looking at double mutants:

g1g2 and g2g3 are both 0%, same as g2. So when g2 is knocked out along with either g1 or g3, there's no change in resistance beyond what g2 alone shows. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Epistasis means that the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. If the presence of a mutation in G2 masks the effect of mutations in G1 or G3, then G2 is epistatic to them.

Wait, how does that work? Epistatic relationships can be a bit tricky. Let's think. If a double mutant shows the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, it suggests that the gene that's single is epistatic to the other. For example, if g1g2 has the same resistance as g2, that might mean that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the effect of knocking out G1 only matters when G2 is present. When G2 is gone, G1's effect doesn't matter because the pathway is already blocked at G2.

So in this case, since g1g2 and g2g3 are 0%, same as g2, that suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So the gene with the more severe phenotype is epistatic.

Now, the options:

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor. But wait, in the single mutant, g2 is 0%, which is worse than g1 (75%). So if G2 is a transcription factor, perhaps it's upstream. If G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would prevent the expression of other genes downstream, leading to a more severe phenotype.

Option B: G2 is a transcription factor. That seems plausible because g2 is the most severe. So the option says G2 is a TF
