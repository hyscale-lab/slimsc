Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons are types of particle accelerators. The question is about how many revolutions a proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. Let me try to unpack the problem step by step.

Alright, the problem states that a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈ 0. Then it undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

Wait, wait. Synchrocyclotrons are a bit different from regular cyclotrons because they have a varying magnetic field. Oh right, in a regular cyclotron, the magnetic field is constant, but in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases as the particle's momentum increases. This allows the particles to reach higher energies without the size of the machine becoming too large, I think.

So, the proton is accelerated by the applied voltage. Each time the voltage completes a cycle, the proton gains some energy. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics. Let me think about the basic principles.

The kinetic energy gained by the proton is related to the work done by the electric field. Since the voltage is alternating, the potential difference does work on the proton when the voltage is in the correct phase. The power delivered is the voltage multiplied by the current, but for a single proton, it's simpler to think about energy gained per cycle.

Wait, but since the proton is moving in a magnetic field, its speed is related to the radius of its orbit. The magnetic force provides the centripetal force: qvB = (mv²)/r → r = mv/(qB). But in a synchrocyclotron, B is not constant. Oh right, because the magnetic field increases as the particle's momentum increases. Hmm.

But wait, what about the acceleration? I think that in a cyclotron, the particles are accelerated by the alternating electric field. The frequency of the electric field must match the cyclotron frequency for the particles to keep being accelerated each time they pass through the gap between the D-shaped electrodes.

But wait, the problem
