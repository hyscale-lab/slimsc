Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator vector P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each given as specific 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, meaning it has components in x, y, z directions. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, operators like position or momentum can be vectors. Each component is an operator, and together they form a vector operator. So the question is about finding the eigenvector of the operator P in the direction n. But n is lying in the x-z plane. That might mean that the direction is a combination of x and z, so the eigenvector will depend on the angle theta in the x-z plane.

Wait, but no, wait. Wait, the operator in question is along an arbitrary direction n. So the operator is P·n, which would be the component of P in the direction of n. So the operator we're considering is P·n, which is a linear combination of Px, Py, and Pz. Because n is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero. So n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), assuming θ is the angle from the z-axis. Or wait, maybe from the x-axis? Hmm, depends on convention, but for direction in x-z plane, yes, probably using theta from the z-axis, so n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator would be P·n = sinθ * Px + cosθ * Pz.

Wait, the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the operator we need to find the eigenvector for is P·n, where n is a unit vector in x-z plane, so n = (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ
