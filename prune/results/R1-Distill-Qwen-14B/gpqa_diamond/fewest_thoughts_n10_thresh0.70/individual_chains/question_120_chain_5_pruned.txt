Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, the formula for parallax plx is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a star at 1 parsec has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, at 2 parsecs, it's 0.5, and so on.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Let's say we have a range of parallaxes, like from plx to plx + dplx. How many stars are there in that range?

Wait, stars are uniformly distributed in space. Uniformly means that the number density (stars per volume) is constant. So the number of stars in a region depends on the volume of that region. But how does that translate to parallax?

So, since plx is 1/d, distance d = 1/plx. So higher parallax means closer stars.

If I consider a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dd, the volume of that shell would be 4πd² dd. Because it's a spherical shell, surface area is 4πd², and the thickness is dd. So, the number of stars in that shell would be the volume multiplied by the number density n (stars per volume). So N = n * 4π d² dd.

But wait, we're interested in the number of stars per unit parallax, so in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that into the equation.

So d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, because if plx increases, d decreases, so the signs would matter. But since we're dealing with small increments, probably the negative can be ignored because we're looking at a positive number of stars. So, dd = (1/plx²) dplx, but because d decreases as plx increases, perhaps we should take the absolute value, so it's positive.

So substituting d
