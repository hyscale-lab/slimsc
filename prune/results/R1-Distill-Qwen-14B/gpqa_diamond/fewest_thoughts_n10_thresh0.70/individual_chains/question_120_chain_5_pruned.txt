Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, parallax is something to do with how close stars are, right? I remember that parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star relative to more distant stars when observed from different points in Earth's orbit. The closer the star, the larger the parallax shift. So, parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance. Oh right, the formula is distance = 1 / plx (in parsecs, I think).

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which I guess means that their number density is constant in all directions. So, if you go further out, you should find more stars, but wait, no, because if the density is uniform, the number depends on the volume you're looking at. But wait, the question isn't about the number of stars in a volume, but the number per unit range of parallax. Hmm.

Wait, let me think. Parallax is in arcseconds. So plx can be a small number, like close stars have larger plx. So for a given range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the number of stars in that range?

Well, the number of stars in a thin shell (since parallax is distance dependent) would depend on the volume of that shell. The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πr² dr. Since distance r is inversely proportional to plx, r = 1/plx. So substituting, r² is 1/(plx)^2. Then, dr would be the change in distance corresponding to a change in plx. Let me see, since plx = 1/r, a change dplx would correspond to dr = - (1/r²) dplx. Because the derivative of (1/r) with respect to r is -1/r², so dplx = - dr / r² → dr = - r² dplx. Wait, but I'm not sure about the signs, but maybe I can ignore the sign since I'm dealing with magnitudes.

So putting it all together: the number of stars in a shell with radius r and thickness dr would be proportional to 4π r² dr. But since the number density of stars is uniform, let's say n stars per cubic parsec. So the number N in the shell is n * 4π r
