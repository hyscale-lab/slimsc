Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of reaction mechanisms and structural analysis. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about identifying compound E through a series of reactions. The problem gives a reaction scheme and some hints. Let's break it down.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (probably nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. So A is reacting via a Wittig reaction. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me visualize that structure.

The product has a cyclopentane ring. Positions 1 and 2 have methyl groups. Position 4 has a propenylidene group, which is like a CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe it's a substituent attached via a double bond.

Wait, the structure is 4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituent is attached at position 4 of the cyclopentane. The substituent is propan-2-ylidene, which is a propene group where the substituent is on the second carbon. So it's CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? But as a ylidene, perhaps it's a double bond. Wait, ylidene would indicate a double bond. So it's CH2-C(=CH2)-CH3? Wait, no, more accurately, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(=CH2)-CH3? Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be the group where the substituent is on carbon 2 of propane, so maybe CH2-CH(CH2... No, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The substituent is a propenyl group attached via a double bond. So, the structure would be cyclopentane with methyl groups at 1 and 2, and at position 4, a double bond to a propyl group. So it's a cyclopentane with substituents that form a double bond, possibly leading to a cyclopentene structure or a substituted cyclopentane with a substituent that's a propenyl group.

Wait, another approach. The product after Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the starting material for the Wittig would be an aldehyde or ketone, as Wittig reagents typically react with carbonyl groups.

So, what's the structure of A? Since A reacts with HCN to form B, which is
