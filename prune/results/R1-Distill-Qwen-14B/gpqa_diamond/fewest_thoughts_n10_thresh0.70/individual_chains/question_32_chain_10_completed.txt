Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so X in this case is a lithium nucleus with 3 neutrons. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out the rest mass of this nucleus. Lithium-6, I think, because it has 3 neutrons. Oh wait, lithium usually has 3 protons, so with 3 neutrons, it's Li-6. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6 atomic mass units (u), right? But wait, the mass isn't exactly 6u because of the binding energy, but for high-energy physics calculations, I think they just use the rest mass based on the number of nucleons. So each nucleon is approximately 1 u. So the rest mass should be 6 u, but wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Or maybe I should look up the exact mass.

Wait, the mass of a single proton is about 938 MeV/c². Similarly for a neutron. Since Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be 6 * 938 MeV ≈ 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. But wait, wait a second, because in reality, the atomic mass is slightly less than that because the nucleus is bound. Oh, but for the purpose of this problem, I think we're assuming that the mass is based on the number of nucleons. So maybe I can proceed with 6u.

But wait, maybe the actual atomic mass of Li-6 is needed. Let me check my memory. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 u. Oh, right, because each proton is about 1.007 u, each neutron is about 1.005 u. Wait, no, that's the mass of a proton and neutron individually. Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, since the nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the mass should be approximately (3 * 1.007276) + (3 * 1.008665) u. Let me calculate that.

So, 3 * 1.007276 is 3.021828 u. 3 * 1.008665 is 3.025995 u. Adding them together gives 6.047823 u. But wait, that's the sum of the individual nucleon masses. However, the actual mass of Li-6 is less due to binding energy. Oh, but for the rest mass of the nucleus, we need the actual rest mass, not the sum of the individual nucleons because the mass is less by the binding energy. But I'm not exactly sure. Maybe this problem assumes that the mass is 6u. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact given mass of Li-6. Wait, I think the real mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 u. Let me confirm that. Hmm, I think I remember that the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 u. So, let's go with that: m = 6.015 u.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the mass of the nucleus isn't the same as the atomic mass because the atomic mass includes electrons. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can ignore the electrons since when dealing with heavy ions, the electrons' mass is negligible compared to the nucleons. So, maybe the mass is just 6u. But I'm a bit confused here. Maybe for the sake of solving the problem, I should use the mass as 6u. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use m = 6 * (mass of a proton) or m = 6 * (mass of a neutron). Wait, no, because a nucleus has protons and neutrons, so maybe the average is considered, but I think the standard approach is to take the mass of the nucleus as (Z + N) * 1 u, where Z is protons and N is neutrons. So for Li-6, Z=3, N=3, so m=6u.

But wait, perhaps I should look up the exact value. Let's think. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 u. But the actual nuclear mass is slightly less because the atom includes electrons. So, for a Li-6 ion, which is a bare nucleus (no electrons), the mass would be the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass. But electrons' mass is about 0.0005486 u each. A Li atom has 3 electrons. So 3 * 0.0005486 ≈ 0.0016458 u. So the nuclear mass would be 6.015 u minus 0.0016458 ≈ 6.01335 u. But wait, that's the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. So m ≈ 6.01335 u.

Alternatively, perhaps for this problem, the exact mass isn't needed, and we can proceed with the rest mass energy in GeV. Wait, but perhaps I should proceed with m = 6 u. Let me see: 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 u is 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. But wait, if the actual mass is 6.015 u, that's 6.015 * 931.5 ≈ let's calculate that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. 0.015 u *931.5 MeV/u = 13.97 MeV, which is 0.01397 GeV. So 5.589 + 0.01397 ≈ 5.603 GeV. Hmm, so the rest mass energy is about 5.603 GeV.

But wait, another approach: maybe I should use the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps the problem just uses the mass as 6u, so 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, 5.589 GeV.

But perhaps the problem expects us to use the rest mass as 6u, so let's proceed with that for now.

The next thing is the relativistic energy. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, the question is about the kinetic energy or the total energy? Because sometimes in these problems, the energy given is the kinetic energy, but I need to be careful.

Wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC", which is a collider. So the energy in colliders is usually the kinetic energy per beam. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no. In colliders, the total energy (relativistic energy) of each particle is considered. Because the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c², but sometimes people refer to the total energy as gamma m c². So I need to clarify this.

Wait, the problem states: "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" So I think the question is asking for the total energy (gamma * m c²) of each nucleus. Because RHIC accelerates the ions to a certain energy.

Alternatively, sometimes the energy is given as the kinetic energy. But without more context, I'll proceed with the assumption that the energy is the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy.

So, let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate gamma, given v = 0.96c.

2. Calculate gamma using gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

3. Multiply gamma by m c² to get the total energy E.

But wait, let's compute gamma first. v = 0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784.

So gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

But wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Now, m c² is the rest mass energy. If m is 6u, then m c² is 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.57142857 * 5.589.

First, 3 *5.589 = 16.767.

Now, 0.57142857 *5.589.

0.5 *5.589 = 2.7945.

0.07142857 *5.589 ≈ approximately 0.4000 (since 5.589 * 0.07 ≈ 0.39123).

So 2.7945 + 0.4000 ≈ 3.1945.

So total is 16.767 + 3.1945 ≈ 19.9615 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 19.96 GeV. But let's compute it more accurately.

Wait, 3.57142857 * 5.589.

Let me compute it as (12/3.375) Hmm, perhaps it's better to just multiply 3.57142857 by 5.589.

3.57142857 *5.589.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.589 = let's compute each part.

0.5 *3.57142857 = 1.785714285.

0.08 *3.57142857 ≈ 0.2857142856.

0.009 *3.57142857 ≈ 0.032142857.

Adding these together: 1.785714285 + 0.2857142856 = 2.07142857 + 0.032142857 ≈ 2.103571427.

So total is 17.85714285 + 2.103571427 ≈ 19.96071428 GeV.

So approximately 19.9607 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069

C)20.132

D)21.419

Wait, but 19.96 isn't exactly matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait a minute. Oh, wait! Did I mix up the rest mass and the total energy? Because the question says "the energy of the RHIC", which is a collider. I think in colliders, the energy per beam is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. So perhaps I should calculate the kinetic energy instead.

Wait, that's a common point of confusion. The kinetic energy (K) is (gamma - 1) m c². So the total energy is gamma m c², but the kinetic energy is K = (gamma - 1) m c².

But the question says "the energy of the RHIC", which is the collider's energy per beam. So I think that refers to the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Because when people talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the kinetic energy imparted to each beam. So perhaps I should calculate K instead.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's think again. The question is: "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

So the energy they're asking for is the energy each ion has when moving at 0.96c. So if it's the kinetic energy, then E would be K = (gamma -1 ) m c².

But let me check with the numbers. Let's compute gamma again: 3.57142857.

So K = (3.57142857 - 1) * 5.589 GeV.

That's 2.57142857 * 5.589 GeV.

Calculating 2.57142857 *5.589.

Let me compute 2 *5.589 = 11.178.

0.57142857 *5.589: Let's compute 0.5 *5.589= 2.7945, 0.07142857 *5.589≈0.4000.

So 2.7945 + 0.4000 = 3.1945.

So 11.178 + 3.1945 = 14.3725 GeV.

But looking at the options, none of them are around 14 GeV. So that can't be right. Hmm, so perhaps I was correct the first time, and the question does refer to the total energy.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, the total energy was approximately 19.96 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. So it's close but not exact. Perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass isn't 5.589 GeV. Let me recalculate the rest mass using Li-6's exact atomic mass.

The exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.015172 u. Let me get a more precise value. Oh wait, according to the periodic table, the atomic mass of Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but that's for Li-7. Wait, no, each isotope has its own mass. Let me think: the mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01517 u. So m = 6.01517 u.

So m c² = 6.01517 u * 931.5 MeV/u = let's compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.01517 u *931.5 MeV/u = 0.01517 *931.5 ≈ let's compute:

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.00517 *931.5 ≈ 4.816 (since 0.005 *931.5=4.6575, 0.00017*931.5≈0.158355 → total 4.815855).

So total is 9.315 + 4.815855 ≈ 14.130855 MeV.

So m c² = 5589 MeV + 14.130855 MeV ≈ 5603.130855 MeV, which is 5.603130855 GeV.

So now, E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 * 5.603130855 GeV.

Let me compute that:

3.57142857 *5.603130855.

Let me break it down:

3 *5.603130855 = 16.809392565.

0.57142857 *5.603130855.

0.5 *5.603130855 = 2.8015654275.

0.07142857 *5.603130855 ≈ 0.4000 (since 5.603130855 * 0.07142857 ≈ 0.4000).

So 2.8015654275 + 0.4000 ≈ 3.2015654275.

So adding to the 16.809392565:

16.809392565 + 3.2015654275 ≈ 20.010958 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.01096 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, so there's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated gamma. Let me recompute gamma.

v = 0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma = 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857. That part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is not exactly 6.01517 u. Let me think again. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01517 u, but the nuclear mass is the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons. A Li-6 atom has 3 electrons. Each electron has a mass of about 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons: 3 * 0.00054858 = 0.00164574 u.

So the nuclear mass would be 6.01517 u - 0.00164574 u = 6.01352426 u.

So m c² = 6.01352426 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

Let me compute that.

6 u → 5589 MeV.

0.01352426 u → 0.01352426 *931.5 ≈ let's compute:

0.01 *931.5 =9.315 MeV.

0.00352426 *931.5 ≈ 3.283 (since 0.003 *931.5=2.7945; 0.00052426 *931.5 ≈0.488 → total 3.2825).

So 9.315 +3.2825 =12.5975 MeV.

Total m c² =5589 +12.5975 =5601.5975 MeV → 5.6015975 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 *5.6015975 GeV.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6015975.

Let me do this step by step:

First, 3 *5.6015975 = 16.8047925.

Then, 0.57142857 *5.6015975.

Let me compute 0.5 *5.6015975 =2.80079875.

0.07142857 *5.6015975 ≈ 0.4000 (let me compute exactly: 5.6015975 *0.07142857 ≈ 0.4000).

So 2.80079875 +0.4000 =3.20079875.

Adding to the 16.8047925 gives 16.8047925 +3.20079875 =20.00559125 GeV.

Hmm, that's approximately 20.0056 GeV. The options are C)20.132 GeV and D)21.419 GeV. So 20.0056 is close to 20.006 GeV, but not quite matching any option. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the sum of the individual protons and neutrons without considering the binding energy. Let's try that approach. So each proton is about 938 MeV/c², each neutron about 939 MeV/c².

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So m = (3 *938 +3 *939) MeV/c².

3*(938+939) =3*(1877)=5631 MeV, which is 5.631 GeV.

So m c² =5.631 GeV.

Now, E=gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.631.

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.631 ≈ let's compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857, 3.57142857*0.031≈0.110714. So total 2.142857 +0.110714 ≈2.253571.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.253571 ≈20.1107 GeV.

That's approximately 20.1107 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But wait, why is there a slight discrepancy? Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.631 more accurately.

5.631 =5 +0.631.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.631 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.031 = let's compute 3.57142857 * 0.03 =0.107142857.

Plus 3.57142857 *0.001 =0.00357142857.

So 0.107142857 +0.00357142857 ≈0.110714285.

So 2.142857142 +0.110714285 ≈2.253571427.

Adding to 17.85714285 gives 17.85714285 +2.253571427 =20.11071428 GeV.

So approximately 20.1107 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close, but perhaps the problem expects a more precise calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me recompute gamma more accurately. Because in the first calculation, I assumed that sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. But perhaps a more precise calculation is needed.

v = 0.96c → v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

Now, sqrt(0.0784) = √(784/10000) )=28/100=0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.571428571428571...

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute v=0.96c, then compute gamma.

v =0.96c → (v/c) =0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714.

Hmm, that's exact. So no mistake there.

So the calculation for E is 3.5714285714 *5.631 GeV.

Wait, but 5.631 GeV is only approximate. Because the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.013525 u (as we calculated earlier), which gives m c² =5.6016 GeV.

Wait, I think perhaps the confusion is arising from whether the rest mass is calculated correctly. Let me get the exact rest mass.

The exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.013525 u.

So m c² =6.013525 *931.5 MeV/u.

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.013525 *931.5 = let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.003525 *931.5 = 3.281 (since 0.003 *931.5=2.7945; 0.000525 *931.5=0.4883625 → total 3.2828625).

So 9.315 +3.2828625=12.5978625 MeV.

So total m c²=5589 +12.5978625=5601.5978625 MeV →5.6015978625 GeV.

Now, E=gamma * m c² =3.5714285714 *5.6015978625.

Let me compute that precisely.

3 *5.6015978625 =16.8047935875.

0.5714285714 *5.6015978625.

Compute 0.5 *5.6015978625=2.80079893125.

0.0714285714 *5.6015978625.

Let me compute 5.6015978625 *0.0714285714.

0.0714285714 is approximately 5/70 or 1/14, but let me compute 5.6015978625 *0.0714285714.

Multiplying 5.6015978625 by 0.0714285714.

Well, 5 *0.0714285714 =0.357142857.

0.6015978625 *0.0714285714 ≈0.043076923.

So total is approximately 0.357142857 +0.043076923 =0.40021978.

So 0.0714285714 *5.6015978625 ≈0.40021978.

So 0.5 *5.6015978625 is 2.80079893125, plus 0.40021978 =3.20101871125.

Adding to 16.8047935875:

16.8047935875 +3.20101871125 =20.0058123 GeV.

So approximately 20.0058 GeV.

Looking at the options again, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's not matching. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the rest mass of the nucleus as 6u, not considering any binding energy. Let me try that.

6u *931.5 MeV/u =5.589 GeV.

E=gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

3 *5.589 =16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589: 0.5 *5.589=2.7945, 0.07142857 *5.589≈0.4000.

So 2.7945 +0.4000 =3.1945.

Total E=16.767 +3.1945=19.9615 GeV.

Hmm, that's 19.9615 GeV, which isn't matching any option. So perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Because v is 0.96c, let's compute gamma precisely.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

(0.96)^2 =0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

No mistake here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the speed in terms of beta, which is 0.96, and then using the relativistic energy formula E=gamma m c^2, but perhaps m is the rest mass in GeV/c².

Wait, let me think about the exact numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the kinetic energy. Let me compute the kinetic energy.

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m c^2.

So with gamma=3.57142857, K=2.57142857 *5.6015978625 GeV.

2.57142857 *5.6015978625.

2 *5.6015978625=11.203195725.

0.57142857 *5.6015978625.

Hmm, 0.5 *5.6015978625=2.80079893125.

0.07142857 *5.6015978625≈0.40022.

So 2.80079893125 +0.40022=3.20101893125.

Adding to 11.203195725: 11.203195725 +3.20101893125=14.40421465625 GeV.

So K≈14.4042 GeV. But that doesn't match any options. So perhaps the problem isn't about the kinetic energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the sum of the rest masses of the individual protons and neutrons, which would be 6u as we did earlier, leading to E=19.96 GeV, but that's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me recheck the exact mass of Li-6.

Looking it up, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.013525 u.

So m c²=6.013525 *931.5 MeV/u.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.013525 *931.5= approximately 12.598 MeV.

So total is 5601.598 MeV=5.601598 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.601598 GeV.

3.57142857 *5.601598.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.601598.

Hmm, 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.001598 *3.57142857≈0.005673.

So 3.57142857 *0.601598 =2.142857142 +0.005673≈2.14853.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.14853=20.00567285 GeV.

Approximately 20.0057 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, maybe I should check calculations again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of a different formula or consideration of other factors, like the mass being 6u without the binding energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Because gamma is 3.57142857, which is 25/7. Let me compute 25/7 =3.57142857.

Wait, 25/7 is indeed 3.57142857.

So, E= (25/7) *5.6015978625 GeV.

25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 5.6015978625 *25/7.

Let me compute 5.6015978625 *25 = 140.0399465625.

Divide by 7: 140.0399465625 /7 ≈20.00570665 GeV.

So approximately 20.0057 GeV.

Still, the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.01517 u including the electrons, but that can't be right because the nucleus doesn't include electrons.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the Li-6 atom, including electrons. Let me think: a Li-6 atom has 3 electrons. The mass of an electron is about 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons are 0.00164574 u.

So the mass of the Li-6 atom is 6.01517 u, which includes the electrons.

So for the nucleus, the mass is 6.01517 u - 0.00164574 u =6.01352426 u.

Which gives m c² as before:5.6015978625 GeV.

Hmm, that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula but not using the exact gamma value. Another possibility is that the problem uses beta = v/c = 0.96, then calculates gamma as (1 - beta^2)^(-1/2).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the total energy including binding energy as a negative value. Wait, no, that's not standard practice.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the sum of protons and neutrons as 6u, which gives E=3.57142857 *5.589=19.96 GeV. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

So 20.0057 GeV is closest to option C (20.132 GeV) but a bit lower. Is there any other consideration I'm missing?

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the atomic mass including the electrons. So the mass would be 6.01517 u instead of 6.01352426 u.

So, m c²=6.01517 u *931.5 MeV/u.

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.01517 *931.5 MeV=14.13 MeV.

Total m c²=5589 +14.13=5603.13 MeV=5.60313 GeV.

Now, E=gamma *5.60313 GeV=3.57142857 *5.60313.

3 *5.60313=16.80939.

0.57142857 *5.60313= let's compute:

0.5 *5.60313=2.801565.

0.07142857 *5.60313≈0.4000.

So total 3.201565.

Adding to 16.80939 gives 20.010955 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.011 GeV, still not matching option C.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the rest mass is 6u, leading to 5.589 GeV, and then E=3.57142857 *5.589=19.96 GeV. But again, that's not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v=0.96c.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator for the exact multiplication.

E=3.5714285714 *5.6015978625.

Let me compute this precisely:

3.5714285714 *5.6015978625.

I'll compute 3.5714285714 as 35714285714e-10.

But perhaps it's easier to compute 3.5714285714 *5.6015978625.

Let me break it down:

5.6015978625 =5 +0.6 +0.0015978625.

3.5714285714 *5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.5714285714 *0.0015978625 ≈0.005724.

Adding up:17.857142857 +2.142857142 =20.000000000.

Plus 0.005724 gives approximately 20.005724 GeV.

So E=20.0057 GeV.

Since the options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

The closest is C)20.132, but our calculation is 20.0057, which is about 20.006 GeV. So there's a discrepancy of about 0.126 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach, such as using the rest mass in a different way.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the speed as 0.96c, and the gamma is calculated correctly, but the rest mass is taken as 6.015 u, which includes the electrons, so m c²=5.603 GeV.

So, E=3.57142857 *5.603 GeV=?

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.603=?

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.003=0.0107142857.

So, 2.142857142 +0.0107142857=2.153571427.

Adding to 17.85714285 gives 19.01071428 GeV? No, wait, wait, that's not correct. 5.603 includes 5 and 0.603. So the calculation would be 3.57142857 *5.603 = 3.57142857*(5 +0.603) =3.57142857 *5 +3.57142857 *0.603.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.603 = let me compute:

3 *0.603=1.809.

0.57142857 *0.603 ≈0.3443.

So total is approximately 2.1533.

So 17.85714285 +2.1533=20.01044285 GeV.

Still about 20.01 GeV.

Hmm, since none of the options match exactly, perhaps I need to recheck the calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the rest mass. Let me see: Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The exact mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So m =3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) MeV/c².

3*938.272=2814.816 MeV.

3*939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total m=2814.816 +2818.695=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

3 *5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511≈3.215.

So total E=16.900533+3.215≈20.1155 GeV.

That's approximately 20.1155 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the lithium-6 (Li-6) nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute \( \gamma \) as follows:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.57142857
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m c^2 \)
The rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is calculated based on its atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.01517 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). The rest mass energy is:
\[
m c^2 = 6.01517 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV/u} = 5603.13 \, \text{MeV} = 5.60313 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using the formula \( E = \gamma m c^2 \), we substitute \( \gamma = 3.57142857 \) and \( m c^2 = 5.60313 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
E = 3.57142857 \times 5.60313 \, \text{GeV}
\]
Breaking this into components:
\[
3 \times 5.60313 = 16.80939 \, \text{GeV}, \quad 0.57142857 \times 5.60313 \approx 3.20156 \, \text{GeV}
\]
Adding these:
\[
E = 16.80939 + 3.20156 = 20.01095 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.011 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:
- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

Thus, the closest match is **C) 20.132 GeV**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
