Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let's count how many carbons it has. Each CH3 group is one carbon, and then the chain seems to go on. Let me count each part: each (CH3)2C is a central carbon with two CH3 groups attached. Then there's a CH2, CH(CH3), another CH2, and so on. Maybe it's a diene or something with multiple double bonds? Wait, the formula might be easier to write. Alternatively, perhaps it's a branched molecule with some double bonds.

But wait, the question is about the enthalpy of formation. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, we calculate this using bond energies.

The problem gives me the bond energies for C-C, C=C, C-H, H-H, and the enthalpy of atomization (which is the energy required to break all bonds in an atom, like turning graphite into gaseous atoms). Oh wait, the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 k
