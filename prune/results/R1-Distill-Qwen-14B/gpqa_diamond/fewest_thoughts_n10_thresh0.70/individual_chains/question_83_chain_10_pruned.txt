Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, so we have to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when acetic acid is titrated with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should be straightforward.

First, let me outline the steps. When we dilute acetic acid with water, the concentration changes. Then, when we titrate, the NaOH will neutralize some of the acetic acid, converting it into acetate ions.

Wait, the initial solution is made by diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. The new concentration of acetic acid can be found using dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, let's think about the equivalence point. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence would be 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume V = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So when we add 10 cm³ of NaOH, it's the equivalence point.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (Na
