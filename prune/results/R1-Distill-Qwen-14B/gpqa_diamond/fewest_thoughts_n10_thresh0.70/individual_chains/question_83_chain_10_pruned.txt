Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration and pH calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm. So first, I think I need to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Then, when titrated with NaOH, determine the pH at 25% of the equivalence point and at the equivalence point itself.

Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So this is a classic acid-base titration. The reaction will produce acetate ions and water.

Let me start with the initial dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³ (20 +20). 

The moles of acetic acid before dilution would be Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the concentration is moles divided by new volume. The new volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is 0.1 M. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻ Na⁺ + H2O.

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid. So, initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 mol. So the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001 mol.

The volume of NaOH required for equivalence can be found by moles / concentration. 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

But wait, the question asks about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So at this point, 25% of the acid has been neutralized.

Let me think about the 25% titration first. At 25% completion, the moles of NaOH added are 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 mol. So moles of acetic acid left are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And moles of acetate ion produced are 0.00025 mol.

But wait, when we mix the solutions, the total volume increases. Initially, the solution after dilution is 40 cm³. Then adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH solution brings the total volume to 42.5 cm³. But maybe for dilute solutions, the change in volume is negligible, but I might have to consider it.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the concentration of H+ ions using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation at 25% titration. Because we have a buffer solution at that point.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])
