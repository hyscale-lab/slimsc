Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. It's about identifying which mutation would eliminate an anti-nutritional compound in barley. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has this anti-nutritional compound that makes it unusable for food. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking for the right mutation.

The question is about figuring out which mutation would remove the problematic compound. I think that probably means making the gene non-functional, so the compound isn't produced. So, we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, possibly by creating a premature stop codon or by a frameshift that messes up the protein structure.

Looking at the sequences provided, the intact gene and the mutants differ in their sequences, probably in the first exon. Let me compare each mutant to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. The reading frame is important here. So, let's look at each mutant.

Mutant 1:
Sequence: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact gene:
Intact starts ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...
Wait, so the third codon in the intact is TTT (Phe), but mutant 1 has TTC (also Phe) in the first part. Wait, maybe I should check each codon.

Wait, the sequences are a bit longer. Let me compare the initial parts:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Wait, the first few codons:

Intact: ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc.

Mutant 1: ATG, TTC (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc. So, in the second codon, intact is TTT and mutant is TTC—so same amino acid, no change. Then the third codon: intact is CTC (Leu), mutant is TAC (Tyr). So that's a change. Then GCT remains, etc. So in mutant 1, the third codon is changed. So that's a point mutation
