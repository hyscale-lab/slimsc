Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me a Schrödinger cat state. The state is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where N is the normalization constant. Also, N is given by sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)).

The non-Gaussianity (nG) is calculated using the relative entropy measure. The formula provided is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, relative entropy as a measure of non-Gaussianity usually compares the given state to a Gaussian state. So for a Gaussian state, the Wigner function is Gaussian, and the density matrix has specific properties, like being a Gaussian state.

But in this case, the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are non-Gaussian. So this state is definitely non-Gaussian, which might mean its non-Gaussianity measure is non-zero.

The task is to compute the non-Gaussianity when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5.

Wait, but how do I compute this relative entropy? I mean, I remember that for the relative entropy of entanglement or other measures, it's often difficult to compute exactly, but in some cases, it's manageable.

Wait a second, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the state. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. For a Schrödinger cat state, when alpha is real and non-zero, the state is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases. Now, if the state is a pure state, its density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

The reference Gaussian state tau is probably the state that is the closest Gaussian state to this |psi> state. Because relative entropy is used to measure the distance between two states, with tau being the reference Gaussian.

Wait, but when you're using relative entropy to measure non-Gaussianity, you might compare the state to the Gaussian state that's closest in some sense, perhaps the one with the same first and second moments, or perhaps the maximum likelihood Gaussian estimate.

But wait, for pure states, the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as the given state is unique. Alternatively, in some cases, the reference Gaussian state is the one that is the "best" Gaussian approximation. But I'm not entirely sure how to compute this.

Wait, but maybe there's a simpler approach. Let me think about the specific parameters given: phi = -pi/4, alpha=0.5.

First, let's compute N. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)).

So, let's compute sin(2phi): phi is -pi/4, so 2 phi is -pi
