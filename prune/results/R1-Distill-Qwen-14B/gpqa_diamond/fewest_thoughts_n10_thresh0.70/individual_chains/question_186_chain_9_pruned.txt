Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, let me try to visualize its structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two rings, right? A norbornane structure. The numbering: the main bridge is between carbons 1 and 4. So the substituents are at 2 and 5.

Wait, the molecule is 2-vinyl, so there's a vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) attached to carbon 2. And it's an azabicyclo, so one of the bridgehead carbons is nitrogen. Oh wait, the azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has a double bond. Let me see: the structure is (1S,4R) configuration. So carbon 1 is S, 4 is R.

Now, the Cope rearrangement typically involves 1,5-dienes rearranging into another 1,5-diene. The reaction proceeds through a cyclic transition state, and the product is a different diene. But wait, in this case, the compound isn't a simple 1,5-diene. Let me think—maybe it's a bridged bicyclic compound, so the rearrangement might form a different ring structure
