Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about astronomy, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.

The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength of about 1216 Angstrom. I need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm, I remember that Lyman alpha emission is in the ultraviolet range. Oh wait, but if there's a high redshift, the wavelength would be stretched. So when the hydrogen clouds are at a certain redshift, the Lyman alpha line we observe would be shifted into a wavelength that's visible from the ground.

Ground-based optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths that are in the ultraviolet or beyond because the atmosphere absorbs those. So the observed wavelength after redshift must be in the visible range, right?

The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstrom, which is 121.6 nanometers. That's in the far-ultraviolet. To be visible from the ground, the observed wavelength must be longer than about 300 nm (since the atmosphere is opaque to shorter wavelengths than that, I think). Wait, but wait—some optical telescopes can go a bit into the near-UV, but most observations are in the visible range. So maybe the observed wavelength needs to be in the visible spectrum, like around 400 nm or so?

Wait, but if the quasar's Lyman alpha is absorbed by the hydrogen cloud, and the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, then when the light from the quasar reaches us, the absorption line (from the cloud) would be at a longer wavelength than 1216 Angstrom.

Alternatively, if the cloud is at a higher redshift than the quasar, the quasar's light would already be redshifted beyond the absorption line. But I think in this case, the quasar is behind the cloud, so the cloud is at a lower redshift. Wait, no, actually, when the quasar's light passes through the cloud, the cloud would imprint its own redshift on the absorption line. So the quasar's light is at a certain redshift, and the absorption line is at a higher redshift (since the cloud is in front of the quasar, so it's at a lower redshift than the quasar—no, wait, I'm getting that backwards. If the quasar is at a higher redshift, then the cloud is in front, so it's at a lower z. So the Lyman alpha from the cloud would be at a longer wavelength than the quasar's own emission? Or no, because the quasar's light is being absorbed by the cloud, which is in front. So the absorption line in quasar's spectrum would be at the cloud's redshift. So the cloud's redshift affects the wavelength we observe for the absorption line.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what's required for the absorption line to be in the optical range. The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstrom. For the cloud, the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift of the cloud.

But for ground-based optical telescopes, the maximum wavelength they can observe is about 300 nm (since the atmosphere doesn't let through much beyond that). Wait, no, wait: optical wavelengths are roughly 400-700 nm. So if the observed wavelength must be in the optical, then lambda_obs must be greater than 400 nm, because below that is UV which isn't observed from the ground.

Wait, but wait—what's the shortest wavelength that ground-based optical telescopes can observe? I think the limit is about 300 nm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's assume it's around 300 nm for safety.

So the Lyman alpha absorption line is at 1216 Angstrom (121
