Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the effective temperatures of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Let's start by breaking down what the question says.

So, we have two stars, star_1 and star_2. The iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. The energy difference between these energy levels is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Both photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, since the energy difference is given as delta E (ΔE = E_i - E_j) = 1.38e-23 J, and the excitation level of star_1's iron atoms is twice that of star_2's. Let me think. Oh wait, wait. The question says star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific level. So, if I denote the excitation as the population of a higher energy level, then n_i for star 1 is twice as much as for star 2 for the same energy level.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe it's that the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is higher in star_1. But I'm not entirely sure, but I'll proceed.

Let me denote the ratio of the excited state to the ground state for star_1 as R1, and for star_2 as R2. The question states R1 = 2 * R2. But wait, the exact wording is "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited", so perhaps the excitation level is higher, meaning their population in the excited state is higher.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio is that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of n_i to n_j is given. Let me rephrase: for a specific energy level, the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, perhaps the population ratio n_i/n_j is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2? Not sure, but let's model it.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The excitation level refers to the average energy of the atoms. But wait, in the context of Boltzmann factors, the excitation refers to the population of atoms in higher energy states.

So maybe, in star_1, the number of atoms in a higher energy level (say, level E) compared to a lower one (E') is twice that of star_2's ratio.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as the ratio of the populations. Let me take the ratio for star_1 as R1 = n_i1/n_j1, and for star_2 as R2 = n_i2/n_j2.

The question states that R1 = 2 * R2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, R = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E_i - E_j (assuming E_i > E_j, so ΔE is positive). So R is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

Wait, so R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

Given that R1 = 2 R2, so:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, perhaps I can take the natural logarithm on both sides to simplify.

Taking ln on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, that would be:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Let me rearrange terms:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, that's:

(ΔE)/(k) [ (T1 - T2) )/( T1 T2 ) ) ] = ln(2)

So, [ (ΔE) (T1 - T2) ) ] / (k T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but looking at the options, I need an equation that has ln(2) equals something involving T1 and T2. The options are all ln(2) equals something. So let's solve for that.

Let me multiply both sides by (k T1 T2)/(ΔE (T1 - T2)) ) to get:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE) (T1 - T2) ) ] / (k T1 T2 )

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have ΔE in them. Hmmm. Oh, wait, the problem didn't give us the value of ΔE, but maybe it's not needed because the equation will cancel it out. Wait, but in the given options, the equations don't have any terms with ΔE, so perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me think again.

The ratio R1 = n_i/n_j for star_1 is exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

Similarly, R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

According to the problem statement, R1 = 2 R2.

So:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )

Taking ln of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me rearrange:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Which is:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

So:

(ΔE (T1 - T2)) / ( k T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but in the options, I don't see any mention of ΔE or k. So perhaps the way I set up the problem is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference is given, but I don't need to plug it in because it's a constant. Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the temperatures, so maybe the ΔE cancels out.

Wait, another approach: Let's take the ratio of R1 to R2. R1/R2 = 2.

R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) )

So ln(R1/R2) = ln(2) = [ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) ]

Which is:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ]

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) * [ (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ]

So,

ln(2) = [ΔE (T1 - T2) ) ] / ( k T1 T2 )

Hmm. But the options don't include any terms with ΔE or k, so perhaps this approach is not the correct one.

Wait a second. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think: the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Does that mean that the average thermal energy is higher, or that the population in a higher energy state is higher?

Wait, perhaps I should consider the excitation as the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to those in the lower state. So for star_1, n_i1/n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2/n_j2 ). No, wait the question says that the level is twice as excited, so perhaps n_i1 is twice n_i2, but that's not necessarily true because it depends on the lower state.

Alternatively, perhaps if for each star, the ratio n_i/n_j is given, and for star_1, it's twice that of star_2.

Wait, perhaps the ratio for star_1 is R1 = 2 R2. So using the Boltzmann equation:

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So, R1 = 2 R2.

Taking the ratio:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2

Take ln of both sides:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Which is:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

So,

ln(2) = [ ΔE (T1 - T2) ) ] / ( k T1 T2 )

Hmm, but again, the options don't have any terms involving ΔE or k, so perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the excitation temperature. Or maybe I can manipulate the equation differently.

Wait, maybe I can rearrange the equation to get the terms involving T1 and T2 in the form of the options.

Let me write:

ln(2) = [ ΔE/(k) ] * [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

But without knowing ΔE or k, I can't proceed numerically. So perhaps the equation can be written as:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE) (T1 - T2) ) ] / (k T1 T2 )

Wait, but the options don't have any of this. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) ln(2) = [ T2 / T1 ]

B) ln(2) = [ (T1 + T2) / (T1 T2) ]

C) ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)^2 ]

D) ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ]

Hmm. So the structure of my equation is:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE) (T1 - T2) ) ] / (k T1 T2 )

But in the options, the right-hand side doesn't have ΔE or k. So perhaps I'm missing a relation that can eliminate ΔE or express it in terms of other constants. Wait, but the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly the same as k_B * 1 eV, because k_B is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, yes! Because 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J, but wait, no, wait: 1 eV ≈ 1.602e-19 J.

Wait, but in this case, the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute k_B * T, where k_B is Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So if the energy difference ΔE is equal to k_B * T, then ΔE/(k_B) = T.

Wait, but in the problem, ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k_B. Because k_B is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE = k_B. So substituting that into my equation:

ln(2) = [ (k_B) (T1 - T2) ) ] / (k_B T1 T2 )

The k_B terms cancel out:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / ( T1 T2 )

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is exactly that. So the correct equation is option D.


To determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the relative populations of different energy states in thermal equilibrium. The Boltzmann equation is:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of two energy levels, \(\Delta E = E_i - E_j\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The problem states that the excitation level of star_1 is twice that of star_2. This implies the ratio of populations for the excited state to the ground state is twice as large for star_1 as for star_2. Let \(R_1 = \frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}}\) for star_1 and \(R_2 = \frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}}\) for star_2. Then:

\[
R_1 = 2 R_2.
\]

Using the Boltzmann equation, we express \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) as:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Substituting \(R_1 = 2 R_2\) into the equations, we get:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E (T_1 - T_2)}{k T_1 T_2}.
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which is equal to \(k_B\), where \(k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\) is Boltzmann's constant. Substituting \(\Delta E = k_B\), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
