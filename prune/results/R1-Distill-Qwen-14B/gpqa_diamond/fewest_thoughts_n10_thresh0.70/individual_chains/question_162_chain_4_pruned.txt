Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's only involving dx and dy. So probably, this is a 2D spacetime or maybe a 2D spatial slice in some higher-dimensional spacetime.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere is a term from geometry, usually referring to a surface of constant negative curvature. But in the context of general relativity, pseudosphere might also refer to a solution of Einstein's equations, like the Schwarzschild solution but for anti-de Sitter space or something else. Or wait, maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in 3D? No, the metric here is 2D, so perhaps it's a 2D pseudosphere.

Wait, the metric is in terms of x and y, and the denominator is 4 - x² - y². Let me see. So the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which suggests that the domain is where 4 - x² - y² > 0, because the metric's coefficient would otherwise be negative or undefined. So the region of allowed points is x² + y² < 4, a circle of radius 2. So the maximum r is 2, which aligns with the pseud
