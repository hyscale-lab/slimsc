Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks familiar. I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of spaces, like spheres, hyperboloids, etc. Oh right, the form here might be similar to a hyperbolic metric because of the denominator.

Wait, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So if I rewrite it, it's 4 - (x² + y²), which is like a sphere of radius 2 because 2 squared is 4. But wait, the metric looks a bit different. Oh, wait, this might be a 2-dimensional metric, so a surface in some higher-dimensional space.

Let me think about the form of the metric. The standard metric for a sphere in 2D is usually written as ds² = (R²)/(R² - r²)² (dr² + r²dθ²), or something like that, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, in isometric coordinates, the metric for a pseudosphere might look different.

Wait, another thought: the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Its metric in polar coordinates is usually something like ds² = dr² + (a cosh(r/a))² dθ², where a is related to the curvature. But in this question, the metric is in terms of x and y, not r and θ. Maybe I should look for a coordinate transformation.

Alternatively, perhaps this metric is for a hyperbolic space. Wait, hyperbolic space has a metric with a negative curvature. The given metric has a denominator that's 4 - (x² + y²), which would be positive if x² + y² <4, so the domain is the disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which is 4 - (x² + y²) = (2)^2 - r², where r is sqrt(x² + y²). So, for r < 2, the denominator is positive. So this is a metric on the disk of radius 2.

Now, the metric is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me compute the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor in 2D is diag( g_xx, g_yy ), and determinant is (g_xx)(g_yy) - (g_xy)^2. Here, g_xx = 32/(4 - r²), g_yy same as g_xx, and g_xy=0. So determinant is (32/(4 - r²))².

The area element in 2D is sqrt(det g) dr dθ. Wait, no, wait, the area element in coordinates (x,y) is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So the area would be the integral over the domain of sqrt(det g) dx dy.

So sqrt(det g) is sqrt( (32/(4 - r²))² ) = 32
