Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about expectation values of spin operators. I remember that expectation values are like the average outcome you'd expect from many measurements.

The question says a spin-half particle is in a state that's a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And the operators we're dealing with are σz and σx. The operator in question is 10σz +5σx. We need to find the expectation value of this operator.

Wait, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state. So, for each part of the operator, I can compute their expectation values separately and then combine them.

Let me break it down. The operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I need to find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for the given state.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be easier. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

The state ψ is (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Wait, let me check the normalization. The sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1. So (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. Yep, so it's normalized.

The expectation value of σz is the sum of |a|^2 * eigenvalue for each component. So for |↑⟩, the coefficient is 0.5, so |0.5|^2 is 0.25. Multiply by +1 (eigenvalue), so 0.25 *1 =0.25.

For |↓⟩, the coefficient is sqrt(3)/2. So |sqrt(3)/2|^2 is (3/4)=0.75. Multiply by -1, so 0.75*(-1)= -0.75.

Adding both parts, 0.25 + (-0.75) = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now, moving on to ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are the |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ states, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the easiest way. Alternatively, I can compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ directly.

The Pauli x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So acting on |↑⟩ gives |↓⟩, and acting on |↓⟩ gives |↑⟩.

So let
