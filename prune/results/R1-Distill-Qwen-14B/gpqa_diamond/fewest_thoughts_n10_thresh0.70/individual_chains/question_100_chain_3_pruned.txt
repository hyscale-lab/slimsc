Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step. The question is about a series of reactions starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. So, first, I need to figure out what Compound A is. C3H6 has a degree of unsaturation of 1 (since 3*2 +2=8, 8-6=2, 2/2=1), so it could be either a propene (alkene) or cyclopropane. But probably it's propene because cyclopropane is less common in such reactions, especially bromination.

So Compound A is propene (CH₂=CHCH3). 

Next, it undergoes bromination in CCl4. Bromination of alkenes typically leads to dibromination via an addition reaction. Propene would add bromine to form 1,2-dibromopropane. So Compound B is CH₂Br-CHBr-CH3.

Then, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. That's a condition for elimination reactions. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromopropane) react with alcoholic KOH, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So the reaction would eliminate two molecules of HBr, forming propene again, but wait, wait. Wait, if we have 1,2-dibromopropane and eliminate HBr, we might get propene. So Compound C is the same as Compound A? That doesn't make sense. Wait, no, maybe the position changes. Wait, the starting alkene is propene, which is CH₂=CHCH3. When it adds Br2, it would add across the double bond to form 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, when you treat it with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate HBr to reform the double bond. So the product is the same as the starting material. So C is propene again. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is 1,2-dibromopropane, and elimination would form 1-propene, but that's the same as A. Hmm, but maybe the dihalide is a different structure. Wait, maybe the bromine adds to the same position, or maybe it's a trans addition. But regardless, elimination should bring back the alkene. So C
