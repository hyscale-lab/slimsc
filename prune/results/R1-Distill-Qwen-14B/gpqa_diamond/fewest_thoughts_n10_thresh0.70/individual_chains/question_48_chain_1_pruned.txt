Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to get product 2. Next, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to make product 3. Finally, product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride to form product 4. The question is how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, okay, I think I should break this down step by step. Let me try to outline each reaction step and see what happens.

First, cyclohexanone reacting with bromine. Wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Bromine usually adds to ketones via a certain mechanism. Oh right, when a ketone is treated with bromine (Br2) in a solution, it undergoes a bromination. I remember that this typically happens through the mechanism of the cyclic bromonium ion intermediate. So, the cyclohexanone's carbonyl group reacts with bromine.

Wait, but the product of that would be a dibromide. Let me think: the ketone O=C-R would form an intermediate where the carbonyl oxygen attacks Br2, leading to a bromonium ring. Then the ring opens, and the bromide ions attack, leading to vicinal dihalide. So cyclohexanone would become 1,2-dibromocyclohexane? Or wait, maybe it's 1,2-dibromocyclohexane? Let me think: the bromine adds across the carbonyl group. The carbonyl is O=C-R, which becomes Br-C-Br after adding Br2. So yes, cyclohexanone (a six-membered ring with a ketone) would add Br2 to the carbonyl, forming a vicinal dihalide. So product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: sometimes, when you add Br2 to a ketone, you get a bromohydrin, but that
