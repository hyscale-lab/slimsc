Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that the Hamiltonian represents the energy of a system, and its eigenvalues are the possible energy levels that the system can have.

The given Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. Wait, σ is the Pauli vector, right? So σ · n would be the dot product of the Pauli matrices with a unit vector n. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So σ · n is like n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. 

Since ε is a constant with energy dimensions, and n is a unit vector, the operator itself should have the dimension of energy. Now, the eigenvalues of such a Hamiltonian should be the possible energies, which are the eigenvalues of this operator.

I remember that for a spin-1/2 particle, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues related to their components. Let's think about each Pauli matrix individually. Each σ_i (i=x,y,z) has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But wait, the Hamiltonian here is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices multiplied by some factors. Oh wait, no, it's scaled by ε. So H is ε times the dot product of σ and n.

Wait, the dot product σ · n is a 2x2 matrix because each Pauli matrix is 2x2. So σ · n would be a matrix, and H is just ε multiplied by that matrix.

Wait, what's the trace of σ · n? Each Pauli matrix has trace zero, so their linear combination would also have trace zero. So the eigenvalues should be symmetric around zero. Also, for any Pauli matrix, the square is the identity matrix. So for each σ_i, σ_i^2 = I. So when you compute (σ · n)^2, you get n_x^2 σx^2 + n_y^2 σy^2 + n_z^2 σz^2 + cross terms. But wait, σi σj = i ε_ijk σk when i≠j, but when you square (σ · n), the cross terms will involve products of different σ matrices. Wait, but wait, (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz)^2. Let me compute
