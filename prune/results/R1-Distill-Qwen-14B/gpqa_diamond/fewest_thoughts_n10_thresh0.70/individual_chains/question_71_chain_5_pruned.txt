Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to remember.

The question says there are five exoplanets in a system, all with circular orbits and they're discovered via the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variation, right? But I don't know if that's super relevant here. The important part is that they're in orbital resonance and have periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, Planet_1 has the shortest orbital period, then Planet_2 is twice that, Planet_3 is 2.5 times, Planet_4 is 3.5 times, and Planet_5 is five times Planet_1's period.

The question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, assuming the same albedo. Oh, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula I think is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (1 - a))^(1/4) ) * ( (1 / sqrt(d)) ) ), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the albedo, and d is the distance. Wait, maybe I should think it in terms of the inverse square law for radiation.

Right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_effective * ( ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 pi sigma d^2) )^(1/4), but I'm not sure if that's the exact form. Alternatively, another way I remember is that the equilibrium temperature is proportional to ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) * ( L )^(1/4) ) / d^(1/2). Because the flux from the star goes as L/(4 pi d^2), and the planet absorbs (1 - a) times that, then the energy balance (incoming equals outgoing) leads to the temperature scaling with that.

Wait, but since all the planets have the same albedo, a is the same for all. So the ratio of their temperatures would depend on other factors. Oh wait, no, L is the star's luminosity which is same for all planets, and a is the same. So the only varying factor is the distance d. Because orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law.

So the key is to find the distances of the planets relative to each other. Because Kepler's third law says that (T^2) / (a^3) = constant, assuming the same star. So the orbital period T is related to the semi-major axis a as T^2 ‚àù a^3. So if I can find the ratio of a4 to a2, then that would lead me to the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

But wait, the periods are given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Let me denote the period of Planet_1 as T1, so T1 : T2 : T3 : T4 : T5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5. So T2 is 2*T1, T4 is 3.5*T1.

Since T^2
