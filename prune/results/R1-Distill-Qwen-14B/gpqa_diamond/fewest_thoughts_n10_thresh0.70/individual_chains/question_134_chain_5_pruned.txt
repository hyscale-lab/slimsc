Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually about the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. The typical reaction is an acid and a base producing water and a salt. The enthalpy change is usually negative because it's exothermic. The standard value I remember is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but this might vary depending on the specific substances involved.

Wait, looking at the problem, we have three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Oh wait, no, wait, when you mix them all, but wait, how do they react? Because HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So mixing them would cause some neutralization reactions, but I need to figure out how much acid and base there is in total.

I think the first step is to determine the moles of H+ and OH- ions from each solution. Because when H+ and OH- combine, they form water, which is the neutralization part.

Let me break it down:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl.
HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. The formula is HCl → H+ + Cl-.
The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M.
Moles HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles.
Since each HCl gives one H+, moles H+ from HCl = 0.1 mol.

2. Calculate moles of H+ from H2SO4.
H2SO4 is a strong acid, it dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.
The volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M.
Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.3 L = 0.09 mol.
Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, so moles H+ from H2SO4 = 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 mol.

So total H+ from acids = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

3. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.
Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.
Volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity is 0.5 M.
Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 mol/L × 0.2 L = 0.1 mol.
Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so moles OH- = 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 mol.

Now, when these are mixed, H+ reacts with OH- to form water. So I need to find out who is in excess.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The moles of H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reactant. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and 0.08 moles of H+ will remain unreacted.

Wait, what about the other H+ from H2SO4? Oh, no, wait, the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. So total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the neutralization will use up all 0.2 moles of OH- and 0.2 moles of H+.

So the moles of H+ that react = 0.2, and moles OH- are 0.2
