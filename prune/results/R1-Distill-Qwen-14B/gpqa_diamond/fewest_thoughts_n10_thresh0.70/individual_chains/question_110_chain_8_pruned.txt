Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the question gives me some information about the magnitude limits of each spectrograph. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V magnitude. Wait, no, wait. It says stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Oh wait, wait. Actually, when the question says "brighter than 17 mag," that's a bit confusing because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So, a star with V mag 16 is brighter than 17. So, ESPRESSO can see stars up to apparent V mag 17, right? Because anything brighter than that (i.e., magnitude less than 17) it can see. So, anything with V mag less than or equal to 17 would be detectable. Wait, no, wait: the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" — so, if a star is brighter than 17, meaning its V mag is smaller than 17, then it's observable. So the limit is that ESPRESSO can't see stars fainter than 17 mag. Wait, no, no. Because higher magnitudes are fainter. So if a star's V mag is 18, it's fainter than 17, so ESPRESSO can't observe it. But if it's 16, it's brighter, so it can.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So a star with V mag 17 would be too faint for HIRES. So, for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=17 (for ESPRESSO) and <=16 (for HIRES). Wait, no — because the question is which stars can be detected with both. So a star needs to be observable by both instruments.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Each spectrograph has a
