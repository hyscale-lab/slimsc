Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should understand what each instrument can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can see stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, it says "brighter than 17 mag" can be observed. Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, no, the way it's worded: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed". Oh wait, no, I think it's the opposite. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that would mean it can see stars with V mag less than 17. Because higher mag means fainter. So for example, if a star is 16 mag, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V mag less than 16.

Wait, wait, no. Let me read again: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed". Oh, okay, so brightness is inversely related to magnitude. So when a star is brighter than 17 mag, its V magnitude
