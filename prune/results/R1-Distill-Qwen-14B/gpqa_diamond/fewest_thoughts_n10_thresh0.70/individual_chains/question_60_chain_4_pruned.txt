Okay, so I have this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation effects come into play according to Einstein's theory of relativity. 

The question says that an astronaut is 22 years old and is traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. They want to know how long the trip will take from the astronaut's perspective. The options are that they might die before reaching, or one of the other years.

Wait, so the spacecraft is going really, really fast. The speed is given as 0.99999987c. That's a speed very close to the speed of light. So time dilation is definitely a factor here. From the astronaut's frame of reference, the trip would take less time than from Earth's perspective because of length contraction.

Wait, no, wait. Waitâ€”no, in the astronaut's frame, they are stationary, and the Earth and the destination are moving. Or is it the other way around? No, from Earth's frame, the spacecraft is moving at that high speed. So from Earth's perspective, the spacecraft is moving very quickly, so the time taken would be less than from the spacecraft's frame because of time dilation.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the distance. The question is the perspective of the astronaut. So for them, the distance to Earth is contracted. So the time they experience would be the contracted distance divided by their speed.

Wait, but the problem says the Large Magell
