Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about an annihilation process involving protons and antiprotons. The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. I remember that in particle physics, annihilation processes often involve converting matter and antimatter into other particles, so that makes sense. 

The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass energy of particle A, m_A c², is 300 MeV. I'm supposed to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, each giving a different velocity in terms of c.

Wait, so I think I need to apply conservation laws here. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest mass energy. But the proton is a matter particle, and the antiproton is antimatter, so they annihilate each other, producing these A particles.

Wait, but the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let me think about their masses. The proton has a rest mass energy of about 938 MeV, I think. So each of them (p and p̄) has a rest mass of 938 MeV/c². But the mass of A is given as 300 MeV/c² each. So two A⁺ and two A⁻. So four A particles in total.

Hmm, but wait, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So four
