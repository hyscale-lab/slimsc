Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

So, the question is about a star with certain properties. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question deals with the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so, when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

Hmm, okay. So the ratio is (n1)/(n2) when there are no spots versus when there are spots. The problem says this ratio decreases when there are spots, so the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. We need to find the factor, which would be (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Wait, but the question says "the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots." So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots. Got it.

The question gives the wavelength of the transition between these levels as approximately 1448 Å. Oh, that's in the ultraviolet range, which is about 144.8 nm, since 1 Å is 0.1 nm. Wait, no, wait: 1 Å is 0.1 nm. So 1448 Å is 144.8 nm. That's in the far UV, which is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, but stars emit that.

The photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which is a common assumption in stellar spectroscopy. So the ratio of the populations in the two levels can be explained using the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights of the levels, E2 and E1 are their energies, and k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature.

But wait, in the ratio n1/n2, that would be the inverse. So (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

But since E2 > E1 (because level 2 is higher in energy), the exponent will be positive, so the ratio depends on temperature.

Now, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower. The spots are cooler, so when 40% of the surface is covered, the average Teff goes down. So, the temperature when there are spots is
