Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. Without spots, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levelsâ€”level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which the ratio changes (no spots vs. spots).

Hmm, I remember that the ratio of atoms in different energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy states. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) and E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, since the star's surface has spots, the overall effective temperature changes. But how does that affect the ratio of Ti atoms in the photosphere? Oh, wait, the problem states that when the spots are present, the photospheric effective temperature is lower. So the temperature we should consider is the one in the photosphere, which is now 5500 K when spots are present.

But wait, the spots themselves are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when the star has spots, part of its surface is at a lower temperature than the surrounding. But the overall photospheric effective temperature is given as 5500 K. Or wait, the problem says when 40% is covered, the photospheric Teff decreases to 5500 K. So does that mean the entire photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K, or that the spots are at a lower temperature?

Wait, the problem might be considering the overall effect on the star's spectrum. When spots are present, the star's total emitted flux changes. But in terms of the photospheric conditions, when 4
