Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The starting compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a diamond-shaped molecule with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions. 

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. From what I recall, when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) react with KOH, they undergo elimination to form alkenes via an E2 mechanism. But wait, here the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo. So the two bromine atoms are not on adjacent carbons. Hmm, that's interesting. Wait, no, in adamantane, the positions are such that 1 and 3 might be adjacent in some way. Or maybe more accurately, the structure allows for elimination. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. 

When vicinal dihalides (1,2) eliminate, they form double bonds. But 1,3-dibromo... would elimination be possible? Because in a cyclohexane ring, 1 and 3 are across a ring, but in adamantane each carbon is connected in a way that allows for bridges. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

The product after KOH is a light yellow solid. The NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), and some other signals. The IR has an absorbance at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the product probably has a ketone group. 

Ah, right! When dihalides are treated with a strong base like KOH, especially in elimination reactions, they can form ketones if the structure allows for that. Wait, but how? Oh, wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism or something. Or maybe it's a pinacol-like elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of adjacent dihalides undergoing elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, pinacol elimination requires a 1,2-diol, but here it's a dihalide. 

Wait, another thought: if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons (like a 1,2-dibromo structure, perhaps in adamantane's structure), then elimination would form a double bond. But the IR suggests a ketone, so maybe the structure after elimination has a carbonyl group. Oh wait, I think I remember that when a dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, it can undergo dehydrohalogenation twice, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So maybe two elimination steps: each Br leaves, and two H's are abstracted, leading to the formation of a carbonyl.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane when heated with KOH would lose HBr twice. Each bromide leaves, forming a double bond, but then perhaps further reaction leads to a ketone
