Okay, so I have this question about a genetics experiment, and I need to figure out why the protein isn't being overexpressed. Let me try to break this down.

So the setup is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They're using a plasmid to do this, and they're introducing a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the protein. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and are selecting for antibiotic resistance. But when they test the expression, the protein isn't overexpressing as expected. The question is why.

The options are A to D, each suggesting different possible issues. The provided DNA sequence is the plus (coding) strand of the construct. Let me look at it more closely.

First, I remember that the coding sequence starts with a start codon, which is ATG. Let me see where that is. Scanning the sequence, I see the very first part is ATG TAC... etc. So the start codon is at the beginning. Good.

Now, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so it should be right after the start codon. The HA tag is a specific peptide sequence, but in the construct, it's added as a sequence before the GADD45G coding sequence. So the construct should start with the HA tag, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, but the provided sequence starts with ATG TAC etc., which is the start codon followed by TAC. Wait, what is the sequence of the HA tag? I think the HA tag is a specific epitope derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. The common HA tag sequence is YPYDVPVY (but I'm not 100% sure, maybe it's a shorter version). Alternatively, sometimes it's added as a short peptide after a start codon.

But looking at the sequence, the first part after ATG is TAC. Let me translate that. The first codon is ATG (start), then TAC is Tyr (tyrosine). If the HA tag is correctly inserted, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag's coding sequence is wrong.

Wait, the question says they introduced the sequence for a single HA determinant at the N-terminus. So the construct should be HA followed by GADD45G. But in the given sequence, the start is ATG TAC..., which would be the coding sequence starting with Tyr. So maybe the HA tag isn't properly included, or perhaps the sequence is messed up.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, so perhaps the DNA for the HA tag was inserted in the wrong reading frame. Alternatively, maybe the HA sequence is present but causes a frameshift, leading to a premature stop codon.

Looking at the sequence, after the start codon (ATG), the next codon is TAC. So the sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA... Let me translate a bit
