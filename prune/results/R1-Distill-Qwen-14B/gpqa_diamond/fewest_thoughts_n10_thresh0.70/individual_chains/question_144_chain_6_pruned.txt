Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, the question is about decay distance, so I think it's related to how long they live before decaying.

Alright, the given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance.

I'm a bit rusty, but I think the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle! The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is roughly hbar over 2. So, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and the mean lifetime τ would be something like hbar/(Γ). 

Wait, but I should think about units here. The width Γ is given in MeV, and I need to convert everything into standard units like seconds. Alternatively, maybe I can find the distance without converting to time and then distance in meters.

Wait, the mean decay distance is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So, it's the product of the velocity v and the mean lifetime τ. So, decay distance L = v * τ.

But how to compute this. Let me remember the steps.

First, calculate the mean lifetime τ using the width Γ. The relation comes from the uncertainty principle: Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I think more accurately, the lifetime is τ = ħ / (Γ/2) because Γ is the total decay width, which is the full width at half maximum. So, the uncertainty in energy is Γ, and the uncertainty in time is τ. So, Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime by τ = ħ/(Γ). I think that's correct.

So, let me get the constants right. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because ħ is h/(2π), and h is about 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s. But when working in GeV units, it's easier to use ħ
