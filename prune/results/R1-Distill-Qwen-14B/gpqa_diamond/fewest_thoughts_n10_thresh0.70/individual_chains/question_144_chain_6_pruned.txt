Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with different distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and velocity. The formula, if I recall correctly, is something like L = c * τ * βγ, where c is the speed of light, τ is the mean lifetime, β is v/c, and γ is the Lorentz factor. But wait, how do I find τ?

Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ through the uncertainty principle. The relation is τ = ħ / Γ. Oh wait, but the units have to be consistent, right? Because Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s or something like that.

Wait, let me think about the natural units. In particle physics, they often use units where ħ = c = 1. But when converting to SI units, I'll need to remember to include those constants properly.

So, first, I need to calculate τ. The decay width Γ is 320 MeV. Let me convert that to GeV: 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

The mean lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. But the units: ħ in GeV·s is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25 s. Let me calculate that. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but wait
