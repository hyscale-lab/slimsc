Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. And the options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The formula is τ = ħ / Γ, where Γ is the decay width. Oh wait, but then I think, oh right, the mean decay length depends on the particle's velocity and lifetime. So the formula should be something like L = v * τ.

But wait, how do I get the velocity? Oh, I think I can use the relativistic energy and momentum relations. The production energy E is the total energy of the meson. So E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So gamma = E / (m c²). 

Wait, but m is given in GeV/c², right? So m_X = 1.2 GeV/c². So the energy is 8 GeV. So gamma = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667 or 20/3.

Now, gamma is also 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I can solve for v. Let me compute beta, which is v/c. So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Rearranging, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Let's compute that. Gamma is about 6.6667, so gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444. So 1/gamma squared is about 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Take the square root: sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Wait, but perhaps I should be more precise. Let me calculate gamma exactly. Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 = 6.666666667. Gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444444. So 1/gamma^2 is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 1/gamma^2 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is, let me compute it more accurately. Let's see: 0.9887 squared is (approx) 0.9775. So beta is 0.9887 c.

So the velocity is v ≈ 0.9887 c. Now, the lifetime tau is hbar / (Γ). But wait, Γ is given in MeV, which is a unit of energy. Hbar is in units of GeV·s or something? Wait, I need to get the units right.

Wait, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 1
