Okay, so I’ve got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They’re made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, the question is about the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV.

I think the mean decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime. Because particles that live longer can travel further before decaying. Oh yeah, the mean lifetime is related to the particle's width. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately ħ. So, Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime τ by τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). But wait, Γ is the energy width, so to get the lifetime, it's inverse proportionality.

But wait, how does that relate to the decay distance? Oh, right, the mean decay length is the product of the velocity of the particle and its mean lifetime. So, L = v * τ. But wait, that's only if the particle is moving at a relativistic speed, right? Because for particles moving at high speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. So I need to calculate the lifetime in the particle's rest frame and then account for time dilation.

Wait, but mesons are bosons, so
