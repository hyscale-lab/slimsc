Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to titrations, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

Alright, the problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. I remember that titration involves neutralizing a solution with a strong base. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it will react with NaOH, a strong base. The pH at certain points during the titration can be calculated based on the amount of NaOH added.

First, I'll try to outline the steps I think I should take. 

1. **Calculate the initial concentration after dilution:**
   The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So, I can use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2 to find the new concentration.

2. **Determine the equivalence point:**
   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The amount of NaOH needed for this can be calculated using moles. Since the solution's concentration and volume are known, I can find the volume of NaOH needed. Also, at equivalence, the solution will contain the sodium acetate (a salt of a weak acid and strong base), which will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution. So, the pH at equivalence will be calculated using the Kb of acetate.

3. **Calculate pH at 25% titration:**
   25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So, some of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. I think I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here because it's a buffer solution at this point.

Wait, let me think again. At 25% titration, the amount of NaOH added is 25% of the moles of acetic acid initially present. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid, the moles of acetic acid and acetate will change accordingly. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation should work here.

Let me start with the first step.

**Step 1: Dilution of acetic acid**
Volume before dilution (V1) = 20.00 cm³ = 0.02 L
Concentration before dilution (C1) = 0.05 M
Volume after dilution (V2) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04 L

Using M1V1 = M2V2:
M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2
M2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04
M2 = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M

So, the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

**Step 2: Equivalence Point Calculation**

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. So the solution will consist of sodium acetate. Let's find how much NaOH is needed.

Moles of acetic acid initially = M * V = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:1 (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O), moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 moles.

Volume of NaOH required: moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

But wait, the question isn't asking for the volume, just the pH at equivalence. So, the solution at equivalence is sodium acetate in water.

The concentration of sodium acetate can be calculated. The total volume will be the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³, and we add V cm³ of NaOH to reach equivalence. But when calculating the concentration at equivalence, we need to consider the total volume
