Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so they should neutralize each other in the titration process.

Alright, the problem says we diluted 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Let me start by understanding the initial solution. So when we mix 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The concentration will change because the volume increases. 

Wait, the molarity formula is M = moles / volume (in liters). So the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) = 0.001 moles. Diluting with 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the new volume is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

But wait, is that right? Let me double-check. Initial moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. After adding 0.02 L water, total volume is 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yes, that's correct.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present. So, moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. So the volume of NaOH needed is (0.001 mol) / (0.1 M) = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH. 

But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. 

Wait, no. Wait, titration percentage is based on the equivalence volume. So 25% titration means 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, let's tackle each
