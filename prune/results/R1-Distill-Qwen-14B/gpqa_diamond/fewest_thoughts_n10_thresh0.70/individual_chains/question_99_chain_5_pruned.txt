Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about identifying a compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to be some sort of substituted carboxylic acids. Let me look at the given data.

First, the FTIR spectrum: a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. I remember that the broad peak around 3000 is usually O-H stretching, which makes sense for a carboxylic acid. The strong peak at 1700 is likely the carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which fits with a carboxylic acid as well. So the compound is definitely a carboxylic acid.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR. The problem says that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so no double bonds are present. That means the molecule is probably saturated, which fits all the options since they all have carboxylic acids without any double bonds.

The NMR has two main signals described in a particular splitting pattern. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, splitting patterns can be tricky, but let me think about what these might mean.

First, a doublet of triplets. That suggests that a proton is coupled with two sets of neighboring protons. Let's say it's coupled with two different groups—maybe each group has a different number of protons. For example, if a proton is next to a CH₂ group (which would split into a triplet) and a CH group (which would split into a doublet), the combination might result in a doublet of triplets. Alternatively, the splitting could be from multiple neighboring groups.

But wait, the first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's three levels of splitting. So, maybe the proton is split by three different neighboring groups. Let's imagine that. Let me think about each option.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. Let me draw this structure. So it's something like:

The main chain is probably CH2-C-C-C-COOH. Each of the middle CH groups has substituents. Wait, let me parse the formula correctly.

Wait, the formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the structure is:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the central two carbons each have a hydrogen and an ethyl group.

So the structure is: CH2CH3 is an ethyl group attached to two central CH groups, which are connected to a CH2 and the COOH.

So the molecule's structure is like: [CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH]. Let's think about the NMR. The ethyl groups would have their own signals, and the CH2 near the COOH would have a triplet or something else.

Wait, but the NMR has no vinyl hydrogens, which we've already established.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure would be CH2CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. Hmm, wait, perhaps I should write it correctly
