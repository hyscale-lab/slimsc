Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction to determine the major products A and B.

First, looking at the first reaction: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene is treated with BuLi followed by H+. Hmm, wait, BuLi is a strong base, it's usually used for deprotonation. But wait, in this context, maybe it's part of a conjugate addition or some kind of elimination?

Wait, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes. Oh, but wait, the starting material here is not a diene. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a structure that can form a 1,5-diene after some reaction. Let me look at the structure.

The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Breaking this down: the benzene ring is attached to a CH2-O- group. The oxygen is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So the structure is benzene-CH2-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2CHCH2CH2? No, wait: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- ? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2- but attached at the 1 position. So, the structure is:

Ph-CH2-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2?

Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2- group. So the structure is Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3? Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, maybe it's CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond. No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-, so when attached, it's CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that can't be right. Maybe the structure is Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second carbon? No, wait, no. Let me try to write it.

But-2

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions: the first is a Cope rearrangement, and the second is something that also involves rearrangement upon heating. I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes, typically under heat or base conditions. Oh wait, actually, I think it's usually done with heat or sometimes under basic conditions. But the first part of the problem uses BuLi and then H+. Hmm, BuLi is a strong base, so maybe it's deprotonating something to form a conjugated diene, which then undergoes the Cope rearrangement. 

Wait, the starting material for part A is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methylbenzene. Let me draw that structure. Benzene ring with a substituent attached. The substituent is an oxygen connected to a CH2 group and then another group: 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So, the structure would be benzene-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but the substituent is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. Let's break that down.

Butenyl groups: but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-. But the substituent is 3-methyl, so the structure is CH2-C(CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-CH2? No, wait, butenyl is four carbons. So, 1-yl implies the starting point is the first carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-? Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but that's five carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl: the double bond is between C2
