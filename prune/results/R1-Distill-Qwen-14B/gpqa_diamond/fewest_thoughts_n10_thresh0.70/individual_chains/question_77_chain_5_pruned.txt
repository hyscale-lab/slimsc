Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions: the first is a Cope rearrangement, and the second is something that also involves rearrangement upon heating. I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes, typically under heat or base conditions. Oh wait, actually, I think it's usually done with heat or sometimes under basic conditions. But the first part of the problem uses BuLi and then H+. Hmm, BuLi is a strong base, so maybe it's deprotonating something to form a conjugated diene, which then undergoes the Cope rearrangement. 

Wait, the starting material for part A is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methylbenzene. Let me draw that structure. Benzene ring with a substituent attached. The substituent is an oxygen connected to a CH2 group and then another group: 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So, the structure would be benzene-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but the substituent is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. Let's break that down.

Butenyl groups: but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-. But the substituent is 3-methyl, so the structure is CH2-C(CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-CH2? No, wait, butenyl is four carbons. So, 1-yl implies the starting point is the first carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-? Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but that's five carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl: the double bond is between C2
