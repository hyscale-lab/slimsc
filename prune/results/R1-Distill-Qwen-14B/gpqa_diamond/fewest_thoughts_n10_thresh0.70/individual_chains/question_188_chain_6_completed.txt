Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the details, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given data are the interatomic distance (which I think is the lattice parameter 'a') of 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each.

Wait, wait. I remember that in a rhombohedral crystal, all the edges are equal in length, so a = b = c, and all the angles are the same. So that's correct here because alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees.

The interplanar distance formula for a cubic system is d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l²)), but wait, that's for a cubic crystal where angles are 90 degrees. But in a rhombohedral (or any non-cubic) system, we can't use that formula directly. So I think the formula must be more general.

I recall the general formula for interplanar spacing is d = 1/√[(h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos β)/(a²) - 2(hl cos γ)/(a²) - 2(kl cos α)/(a²)}] 

Wait, no, I think I might have that wrong. Let me think again. Oh right, the correct formula for a general crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = (1/√[( (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) ) - ( hk (cos γ - cos αβ) )/a² + ... Hmm, no, maybe I should look it up in my notes.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the Miller indices and the formula that involves the dot product of the lattice vectors. Alternatively, I might remember that for a rhombohedral system, the formula simplifies because all angles are the same and a = b = c.

Alternatively, another approach I remember is using the formula for d-spacing in terms of the unit cell parameters. The general formula is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - (2hk cos α)/(a²) - (2hl cos β)/(a²) - (2kl cos γ)/(a²) )

Wait, no, maybe I have the terms wrong. Another way: the interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is given by:

d_{hkl} = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2a² hk cos γ - 2a² hl cos β - 2a² kl cos α )^{-1} ]^{1/2}

Wait, maybe I should think of the formula more carefully. Oh, right, the correct formula is:

d = (1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2hk cos γ - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos α )) ) * (a / 1 )

Wait, no, I think it's:

d = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2a² hk cos γ - 2a² hl cos β - 2a² kl cos α ) ]^{-1/2 }

Wait, no, that can't be because the units wouldn't match. Maybe the formula is:

d = [ ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) / a^2 - ( 2 h k cos γ ) / a² - ( 2 h l cos β ) / a² - ( 2 k l cos α ) / a² ) ]^(-1/2 )

Because all terms inside the sqrt would be dimensionless.

Wait, another way: the formula is d = (a/(sqrt(1 + 2cosα + 2cosβ + 2cosγ ... ))) Wait, no, perhaps it's better to look for the correct formula for a rhombohedral structure.

Wait, I think the formula for a general tetragonal or orthorhombic system is different, but rhombohedral is a special case where a = b = c, and angles are all equal.

So, the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d_hkl = a / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors.

Wait, no, wait. The general formula for interplanar distance is d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)/(a^2) + ... ), but I might be getting the signs wrong.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2hk cos γ - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos α )

Yes, that sounds more accurate. Because in the cubic case where all angles are 90 degrees, cos any angle is zero, so d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²).

So for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So, substituting h=1, k=1, l=1, and α=β=γ=30 degrees.

So, cos 30 degrees is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So let's compute the denominator:

h² + k² + l² = 1+1+1=3.

Then, the other terms are:

-2hk cos γ = -2*1*1 * cos30
-2hl cos β = -2*1*1 * cos30
-2kl cos α = -2*1*1 * cos30.

So each of these is -2*(0.8660) ≈ -1.732.

Wait, that's 3 terms: each is -2*(1)(1)* (sqrt(3)/2) )= - sqrt(3).

So each term is -sqrt(3), so three terms total would be -3*sqrt(3).

So the denominator becomes 3 + ( -3*sqrt(3) ) ?

Wait, wait, let me compute it step by step.

Denominator D = h² + k² + l² - 2 h k cosγ - 2 h l cosβ - 2 k l cos α.

So D = 1 +1 +1 - 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) - 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) - 2*(1)(1)*cos(30)

So D = 3 - [ 2 cos30 + 2 cos30 + 2 cos30 ]

Which is 3 - 6 cos30.

cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 6 * cos30 = 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )= 3*sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So D = 3 -5.196 = approximately -2.196.

Wait, but that's negative, which can't be right because the square root of a negative number isn't real. But that's impossible because interplanar distances are real positive numbers.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I got the signs wrong in the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

D = h² + k² + l² - 2 h k cos α - 2 h l cos β - 2 k l cos γ.

Wait, no, maybe I have the angles mixed up. Because in a rhombohedral system, the angles between vectors a, b, c are all the same, but the formula may involve different angles.

Wait, I'm getting confused now. Let me think again.

In crystallography, the interplanar distance formula for a general hexagonal system uses three vectors a, b, c with angles between them.

The general formula is:

d = [ (a² (h² + k^2 + l^2) - 2 a² hk cos γ - 2 a² hl cos β - 2 a² kl cos α ) ]^(-1/2 )

Wait, but that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = ( a² ) / ( (h² + k² + l^2) - 2 hk cos γ - 2 hl cos β - 2 kl cos α ) )^{1/2}

Wait, but in our case, a = 10 Angstroms, and h=k=l=1, and α=β=γ=30 degrees.

So let's compute the denominator.

Denominator = 1² + 1² +1² - 2*1*1*cos(30) - 2*1*1*cos(30) - 2*1*1*cos(30)

Which is 3 - 2*(sqrt(3)/2)*3.

Wait, let me compute each term.

Each of the cosine terms is cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2.

So:

Denominator = 3 - 2*1*1*(sqrt(3)/2) - 2*1*1*(sqrt(3)/2) - 2*1*1*(sqrt(3)/2)

Which is 3 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2 ) * 2 ?

Wait, no, each of the three terms is 2*1*1*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3). Because 2*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3).

So each of the three terms is sqrt(3), so the total of the three terms is 3*sqrt(3).

So denominator = 3 - 3*sqrt(3)

But sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 3*1.732 ≈5.196.

So 3 -5.196 ≈-2.196.

That's a negative denominator, but that's impossible because the square root can't be of a negative number. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Hmm, perhaps I mixed up the angles in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, but perhaps the formula uses angles between a and b, a and c, and b and c.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Denominator = h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos γ - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos α.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, so α = β = gamma = 30 degrees.

So, in that case, all cosine terms are sqrt(3)/2.

So denominator = 3 - 2*1*1*(sqrt(3)/2)*3.

Wait no, each term is 2hk cosθ, so for h=k=l=1, each term is 2*1*1* cos30.

So the sum of all three cosine terms is 3 * (2 * cos30) = 6 cos30.

Wait, no, no. Let me compute each term:

Denominator = 3 - [2*1*1*cos30 + 2*1*1*cos30 + 2*1*1*cos30 ]

So that's 3 - 6 * (sqrt(3)/2 )

Which is 3 - 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

So again, negative. That can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think. Another approach: the interatomic distance is given, which is the lattice parameter a = 10 A. So the unit cell edge is a = 10 A.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not a rhombohedral structure, but a different type. Wait, the question says it's a rhombohedral crystal, which is a special case of a hexagonal crystal system, but perhaps it's a cubic structure with a non-90-degree angle.

Ah, wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a rhombohedral system, which can be written as:

d = a / sqrt( 1 + 2 cos θ ), where θ is the angle between the vectors.

Wait, no. That's for the (100) plane in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, for (111) plane, perhaps another approach is better.

Alternatively, I can model the unit cell and compute the vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, each of length a, with angles between each other of 30 degrees.

So, the vectors can be expressed in a coordinate system as follows:

a = (a, 0, 0)
b = (a cos γ, a sin γ, 0)
c = (a cos β, a (cos α - cos β)/(sin β), a sqrt(1 - cos²β - (cos α - cos β)^2 / sin² β ) )

But wait, this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can construct the reciprocal vectors.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to calculate using the metric tensor.

The metric tensor g is a 3x3 matrix given by:

g = [
[ a², ab cos γ, ac cos β ],
[ ab cos γ, b², bc cos α ],
[ ac cos β, bc cos α, c² ]
]

But in our case, a = b = c =10 A, and alpha = beta = gamma =30 degrees.

So, g becomes:

g = [
[100, 10*10 * cos30, 10*10 * cos30 ],
[10*10 * cos30, 100, 10*10 * cos30 ],
[10*10 * cos30, 10*10 * cos30, 100 ]
]

So cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660, so:

g ≈ [
[100, 100 * 0.8660, 100 * 0.8660 ],
[100 * 0.8660, 100, 100 * 0.8660 ],
[100 * 0.8660, 100 * 0.8660, 100 ]
]

Then, the reciprocal of the metric tensor, g^{-1}, is needed to compute the interplanar distance.

The formula for the interplanar distance d is given by:

d² = (h² + k² + l²) * (1/a²) ) - ( 2 hk cos gamma ) / a² - ( 2 hl cos beta ) /a² - (2 kl cos alpha )/a² )

Wait, perhaps I should compute d as 1/sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 hk cos gamma - 2 hl cos beta - 2 kl cos alpha )

But using the reciprocal space approach.

Wait, but in any case, perhaps it's easier to compute the reciprocal lattice vectors.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

h = (h, k, l) in reciprocal space.

The interplanar distance d is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 hk cos gamma - 2 hl cos beta - 2 kl cos alpha )

Wait, but this brings me back to the same formula as before, which gives a negative denominator.

Wait, perhaps the (111) plane is not allowed in such a structure? Or perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk cos(180-30) ) + ... ] )

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the sign of the cosine terms. Because angles between vectors in a crystal are defined between 0 and 180 degrees, and cos(180 - theta) = -cos(theta).

Wait, in the formula for the metric tensor, the angles are between the lattice vectors. For a rhombohedral system, the angle between a and b is gamma, between a and c is beta, and between b and c is alpha.

Wait, no, perhaps I should define the angle between a and b as gamma, between a and c as beta, and between b and c as alpha.

Wait, perhaps I got the angles reversed. Let me check.

In the definition of the metric tensor for a rhombohedral system, the angle between a and b is gamma, between a and c is beta, and between b and c is alpha. So, with alpha, beta, gamma being the angles between the respective pairs.

Wait, now I'm not so sure. Perhaps it's better to think that in a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, so it doesn't matter.

But regardless, if all angles are 30 degrees, then the cosine terms would be positive.

So let me proceed with the formula.

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos gamma - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos alpha )

But given that all angles are 30 degrees, and h=k=l=1:

Denominator D = 3 - 2*(1)(1)*cos30 - 2*(1)(1)*cos30 - 2*(1)(1)*cos30

Which is 3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2 )

Which is 3 - 3*sqrt(3).

So 3 ≈3, 3*sqrt(3)≈5.196, so 3-5.196= -2.196.

So D is negative. That can't be right, so something must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula has a sign error. I think that perhaps the formula should have plus the cosine terms instead of minus. So let me try that.

So D = 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2 ) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So D ≈8.196.

Then d = a / sqrt(D) = 10 / sqrt(8.196).

Compute sqrt(8.196): since 2.8^2=7.84, 2.86^2=8.1796, 2.87^2≈8.2369. So sqrt(8.196) is about 2.863.

So 10 / 2.863 ≈3.494 Angstroms.

Wait, but none of the options are around 3.49. The options are all around 8-10, so that can't be right.

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in choosing the formula's signs.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha )

Wait, but that would change the sign of the cosine terms. Let me try that.

So D = 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2 ) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈8.196.

So d =10 / sqrt(8.196)≈3.494 Angstroms.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is the reciprocal. So perhaps I should compute 1/d, but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for the interplanar distance.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

The reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl) is:

h* = h/a * (1, 1, 1) ... No, that's only for a cubic system. For a general system, it's more complex.

Alternatively, the magnitude squared of the reciprocal vector is given by:

h*^2 + k*^2 + l*^2 = (h² +k² +l²) - 2hk cos gamma - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos alpha.

Wait, but in our case, gamma=beta=alpha=30 degrees.

So, if I compute the reciprocal vector's magnitude squared:

d^{-2} = (h² +k² +l²) - 2hk cos gamma - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos alpha.

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So,

d^{-2} = 3 - 2*(1)(1)*cos30 - 2*(1)(1)*cos30 - 2*(1)(1)*cos30

Again, same denominator D=3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3 -3*sqrt(3)≈-2.196.

Which is negative, so impossible. That suggests that the (111) plane is not allowed in this structure.

But that can't be, because the question is asking for the (111) plane.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. I think I might be confusing the Miller indices with some other factors.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha )

In that case, D=3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2 ) = 3 +3*sqrt(3)≈8.196.

So d =10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈3.49 Angstroms.

But that's not matching any of the options, which are all about 9-10.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the unit cell and compute the interplanar distance for (111) planes.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the (111) planes are the planes that cut the a, b, c axes at 1,1,1.

The interplanar distance can be found by the formula:

d = (1 / (sqrt( ( (a^2 (h² +k² +l²) ) - a^2 (hk + hl + kl) * 2 cos θ ) )) )

Wait, perhaps I should think of the vectors in terms of their components.

Let me define the three vectors a, b, c as follows:

a = [a, 0, 0]

b = [a cos gamma, a sin gamma, 0 ]

c = [a cos beta, a (cos alpha - cos beta) / sin beta, a * sqrt( 1 - (cos beta)^2 - ( (cos alpha - cos beta)/sin beta )^2 ) ]

But since all angles are 30 degrees, let's calculate that.

So, a =b =c=10 Angstrom.

gamma =30 degrees, beta=30 degrees, alpha=30 degrees.

So,

b vector: [10 cos30, 10 sin30, 0 ].

cos30≈0.8660, sin30=0.5.

So b = [8.660, 5, 0 ].

For c vector:

First, compute the components.

cos beta = cos30 ≈0.8660.

cos alpha = cos30 ≈0.8660.

So,

c_x = a cos beta =10 * 0.8660 ≈8.660.

c_y = a (cos alpha - cos beta)/sin beta.

But cos alpha = cos beta, so (cos alpha - cos beta) =0.

So c_y=0.

c_z = a * sqrt( 1 - cos^2 beta - ( (cos alpha - cos beta)/ sin beta )^2 )

But since cos alpha - cos beta is zero, the second term is zero.

So c_z = a * sqrt(1 - cos^2 beta ) = a sin beta.

sin beta = sin30=0.5, so c_z=10 *0.5=5.

So c = [8.660, 0,5].

Wait, that can't be right because in a rhombohedral system, the angles between a and b is gamma, between a and c is beta, and between b and c is alpha.

Wait, but with all angles being 30 degrees, maybe vectors a, b, c are arranged such that each pair has 30 degrees between them.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in constructing the vectors. Because in this case, the angle between a and b is 30 degrees, but the angle between a and c is 30 degrees, and between b and c is 30 degrees.

Wait, but with a = [a,0,0], b as above, and c as [a cos30,0,a sin30], but perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the vectors are arranged such that a, b, c are all of length a, and each pair has an angle of 30 degrees.

But calculating the vectors accurately might be time-consuming, but perhaps necessary.

Another approach: compute the Miller indices (111) and find the plane equation.

The plane equation in terms of the basis vectors is (1/a) x + (1/a) y + (1/a) z = 1/(a) ?

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the plane (hkl) is given by hx + ky + lz =1, where x, y, z are in the basis vectors.

Wait, the interplanar distance d is given by 1/(sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha )) )

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for d is:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha )

Wait, let's test this.

With h=k=l=1, and angles 30 degrees.

So,

Denominator D = 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2 )

=3 +3*sqrt(3)≈3+5.196=8.196.

So d=10 / sqrt(8.196)= 10/2.863≈3.494 Angstroms.

That's the same result as before, which is way below the options given. So perhaps this is not the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps I need to use the reciprocal of the (111) plane, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I've mixed up the reciprocal lattice's formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps interplanar distance is given by the reciprocal of the reciprocal lattice vector's magnitude.

The reciprocal vector for (111) would be h=1, k=1, l=1.

The reciprocal lattice vector's components are:

( h, k, l ) in reciprocal space.

The magnitude squared is:

h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha.

So in this case, it's 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2)=3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈8.196.

So the reciprocal magnitude is sqrt(8.196)≈2.863.

So the interplanar distance d is 1/2.863 ≈0.349 Angstroms, which is even worse.

Wait, but that's way off.

Hmm, I must be making a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral system, which is:

d = a / sqrt( 1 + 2(cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma) )

Wait, because for (111), h=k=l=1, so their squares sum to 3, but perhaps the formula for rhombohedral is more specific.

Wait, for a rhombohedral system, the (111) plane's interplanar distance can be calculated using:

d = a / sqrt( 3 + 6 cos theta ), where theta is the angle between the lattice vectors (30 degrees in this case).

So,

d = 10 / sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

=10 / sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

Compute the denominator: 3 +3*1.732 ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d≈10 /2.863≈3.494 Angstroms.

Again, this is not matching any of the options.

Wait, the options given are all around 9-10 Angstroms except for option B, which is 8.95, but that's still much lower than 10.

Hmm, perhaps the question is actually about the interatomic distance being 10 Angstroms, but in the formula, the a is the interatomic distance. So perhaps I'm using the correct a.

Wait, but the options are all around 9 Angstroms, which is close to 10. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different for rhombohedral systems. Let me try another approach: using the general formula for a rhombohedral lattice.

The general formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha )

Wait, but that's what I did earlier, leading to d≈3.49 Angstroms.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 hk cos (180 - gamma) + 2 hl cos (180 - beta) + 2 kl cos (180 - alpha) )

Wait, but angles between vectors in a crystal are defined as the angles between them, which are typically acute angles. So 180 - 30=150 degrees, and cos(150) is -sqrt(3)/2.

So, substituting that:

Denominator D = 3 + 2*1*1*(-sqrt(3)/2) *3 =3 -3*sqrt(3)≈3 -5.196= -2.196.

Which again is impossible.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let's think about this differently. Maybe the given data is a=10 Angstroms, and the (111) plane's interplanar distance is to be found.

Wait, perhaps the formula I've been using is for the (100) plane, not (111).

Wait, for (100), h=1, k=0, l=0.

So,

d = a / sqrt(1 + 0 +0 - 0 -0 -0 )=a /1=10 Angstroms. Which is option D, but the question is about (111).

But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the unit cell vectors and find the normal vector to the (111) plane.

The plane equation is:

(1/a)x + (1/a)y + (1/a)z =1.

Wait, no, in a rhombohedral system, the plane (hkl) is given by:

hx/a + ky/a + lz/a =1.

Wait, but perhaps that's not correct either, because the basis vectors are not orthogonal.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to construct the plane's normal vector as a combination of the lattice vectors.

So, the plane (111) can be expressed as:

( a + b + c ) · r = d,

where a, b, c are the lattice vectors, and r is a position vector in the plane.

But the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the normal vector.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

The interplanar distance d is given by d = | (a + b + c ) |^{-1}.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the reciprocal of the magnitude of the normal vector.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is found by considering the projection along the normal vector.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the scalar product.

The normal vector to the (111) plane is given by the sum of the reciprocal basis vectors.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting into a loop here.

Another approach: perhaps find the volume of the unit cell, then compute the reciprocal lattice vector.

The volume of the unit cell in a rhombohedral system is V = a^3 sqrt(1 - cos^2 alpha - cos^2 beta - cos^2 gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma )

But with alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees, this becomes:

V = a^3 sqrt(1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

Wait, let's compute that.

Each cos30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So, 1 -3*( (sqrt(3)/2 )^2 ) + 2*( (sqrt(3)/2 )^3 )

Compute each term:

(sqrt(3)/2 )^2 = 3/4 =0.75.

So 3*(0.75)=2.25.

(sqrt(3)/2 )^3= (3*sqrt(3))/8 ≈0.6495.

So 2*(0.6495)=1.299.

So,

V =a^3 * sqrt( 1 -2.25 +1.299 )

= a^3 * sqrt( (1-2.25) +1.299 )

= a^3 * sqrt( (-1.25) +1.299 )

= a^3 * sqrt(0.049) ≈a^3 *0.2214.

So V≈10^3 *0.2214=2214 Angstrom^3.

Now, the reciprocal of the volume is 1/V≈4.516e-4 Angstrom^-3.

But how does this help with the interplanar distance?

Wait, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Where theta is the angle between the lattice vectors. Wait, but that's for a simple cubic system with all angles theta. But in our case, each angle is 30 degrees.

So, for (111), h=k=l=1,

Denominator D=3 + 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * cos30.

=3 + 2*(3) * (sqrt(3)/2 )

=3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So d=1/sqrt(8.196) ≈0.349 Angstroms.

But that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d= a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha )

In that case, for (111):

d=10 / sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2 ) )

=10 / sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

Which as before, is about 3.49 Angstroms.

But again, this doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says "rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom."

Wait, maybe the interatomic distance refers to the distance between atoms along the a-axis, but in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the vertices, so the interatomic distance would be the distance between nearest neighbors, which in a simple cubic structure would be 'a'. But in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbors could be along different directions.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent lattice points, which in a simple cubic structure is 'a', but in a rhombohedral structure, it could be different. Wait, no, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbors are at a distance of a√1, but in a rhombohedral system, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same along all axes.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed with the given a=10 Angstrom.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) )

But in this case, that would be d=10 / sqrt(3 + 2*(3))=10/sqrt(9)=10/3≈3.333 Angstroms.

Still doesn't match any options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for a rhombohedral system's (111) plane interplanar distance as:

d = a / sqrt( 3 + 2*(1 + 1 +1)*cosθ )

Where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. So θ=30 degrees.

So,

d=10 / sqrt( 3 + 6*cos30 )

=10 / sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

=10 / sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

Which is the same as before, giving d≈3.49 Angstroms.

But again, no matching options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the (123) plane or another plane, but no, the question states (111).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me recheck all steps.

Wait, the question states that the crystal is rhombohedral, interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom, angles alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

I think I've correctly used a=10.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is for the (100) plane, but I'm trying to compute (111).

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Alternative approach:

In a rhombohedral system, the unit cell can be considered as a cube that has been stretched and skewed. The interplanar distance for (111) can sometimes be given by a formula that accounts for the angles.

Wait, perhaps the general formula is:

d^2 = (a^2 (h² +k² + l²) ) / ( (h +k + l)^2 ) ) * (1 - cos alpha - cos beta - cos gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma )

But I'm not confident about this formula.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between d and the unit cell parameters.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors.

So for (111), h=k=l=1, and theta=30 degrees.

So,

d =10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

=10 / sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

Which is again ≈3.49 Angstroms.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the volume of the unit cell and then find the reciprocal lattice vectors.

The volume V is a^3 sqrt(1 - cos^2 alpha - cos^2 beta - cos^2 gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma )

With alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees,

So,

1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 = 1 - 9/4 + 2*(3*sqrt(3)/8 )

= 1 -2.25 + (3*sqrt(3)/4 )

= (-1.25) + (3*1.732/4 )

= (-1.25) + (5.196/4 )

= (-1.25) + 1.299 ≈0.049.

So V = a^3 * sqrt(0.049) ≈1000 *0.2214=221.4 Angstrom^3.

The reciprocal of the volume is 1/221.4 ≈4.517e-3 Angstrom^-3.

But how does that relate to the interplanar distance?

The interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

d = 1/[ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) * (1/a^2) - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) * (1/a^2) ) ]^0.5

So,

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l^2 - 2 hk cos gamma - 2 hl cos beta - 2 kl cos alpha )

Which for (111) is the same as before.

But again, this leads to a denominator of 3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2 )=3-3*sqrt(3)≈-2.196, which is impossible.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach, and the correct formula doesn't subtract the cosine terms but adds them.

So, D=3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2 )=3 +3*sqrt(3)≈8.196.

So d=10/sqrt(8.196)≈3.49 Angstroms. But none of the options are near that.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, but no, the question says rhombohedral.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the angles given are the angles between the planes, not the lattice vectors.

Wait, no, the angles in the crystal are the angles between the lattice vectors.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the formula I have is correct, but the negative denominator suggests that the (111) plane is not allowed in this structure, which would mean the interplanar distance doesn't exist. But the question is asking for it, so perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance in a hexagonal system, but the question is about a rhombohedral system.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should look for another way.

Wait, let's consider that in a rhombohedral system, the (111) planes are equivalent, and the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d= a / sqrt(1 + 2 cos theta + 2 cos^2 theta ), where theta is 30 degrees.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

d= a / sqrt( 3 + 2 ( cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma ) )

Which, for alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees,

=10 / sqrt(3 + 2*(3*(sqrt(3)/2)) )

=10 / sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

Which is the same as before, ≈3.49 Angstroms.

No match.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A:9.08 Angstrom.

But how?

Let me compute 10 / sqrt( (111) )=10 / sqrt(3)≈5.773. Not close.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for d-spacing.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, but I'm not sure.

Another idea: perhaps the question is about a simple cubic structure, but with angles not 90 degrees.

Wait, but a rhombohedral structure is a general case.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should pick the closest option, but I'm not confident.

Wait, let's compute 10 / sqrt( (3 - 3*sqrt(3)) ), but since the denominator is negative, it's not possible. So perhaps the correct approach is to take the absolute value.

So,

D=3 -3*sqrt(3) ≈-2.196.

Absolute value D=2.196.

So d=10/sqrt(2.196)=10/1.48≈6.75 Angstroms.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be:

d= a * sqrt(1/(h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

But that's not likely.

Another thought: perhaps the formula for d is incorrect, and I should use the following approach.

The interplanar distance can be found using the volume of the unit cell and the reciprocal lattice vectors.

The volume of the unit cell is V= a^3.

Wait, but in reality, the volume is a^3 multiplied by sqrt(1 - ... ), as before.

But perhaps I should compute the reciprocal lattice vector's magnitude.

The reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl) is:

h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha )

So for (111), the reciprocal vector squared is 3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2 )=3 +3*sqrt(3)≈8.196.

The reciprocal lattice spacing is 1/d= sqrt(8.196), so d=1/sqrt(8.196)≈0.349 Angstroms.

But that's not matching any options.

I'm clearly missing something here. Perhaps the correct formula is not what I'm using.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the (111) planes are not allowed, but the question is asking for it anyway. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance is the same as the interatomic distance. But no, because the interatomic distance is along the lattice vectors, and the planes are different.

Wait, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, which is the distance between adjacent lattice points along the a-axis. But the (111) planes are not necessarily aligned along the a-axis.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should proceed with the answer being option A:9.08 Angstrom, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

With theta=30 degrees.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 - 6* (sqrt(3)/2) )

=10 / sqrt(3 -3*sqrt(3)).

But 3 -3*sqrt(3)≈3-5.196= -2.196.

Which is negative, so impossible.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and need to make a guess.

Looking at the options, the only one close to 10 is option D:10.05, but that's likely for the (100) plane.

But for (111), perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation steps. Wait, perhaps the formula I should use is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

But theta=150 degrees, because the angle between vectors in the formula is 180 - the given angle.

So cos(theta)=cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(-sqrt(3)/2) )

=10 / sqrt(3 -3*sqrt(3)).

Which is again negative, so impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the inverse of the metric tensor to find the reciprocal lattice vector's magnitude.

The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is:

g = [[a², a² cos gamma, a² cos beta],
     [a² cos gamma, a², a² cos alpha],
     [a² cos beta, a² cos alpha, a² ]]

For our case, a=10, and all angles are 30 degrees.

So,

g = [
[100, 100 * cos30, 100 * cos30 ],
[100 cos30, 100, 100 cos30 ],
[100 cos30, 100 cos30, 100 ]
]

Which is,

g = [
[100, 86.60, 86.60],
[86.60, 100, 86.60],
[86.60, 86.60, 100]
]

The reciprocal metric tensor g^{-1} can be found, and the magnitude of the reciprocal vector (hkl) is given by:

h*^2 + k*^2 + l*^2 = (h² +k² +l²) - 2 hk cos gamma - 2 hl cos beta - 2 kl cos alpha.

Wait, but this brings me back to the same problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal of the metric tensor can be used.

The reciprocal lattice vector (hkl) has components:

u = (h, k, l) in the basis of the reciprocal lattice.

The magnitude squared is (h² +k² +l²) - 2hk cos gamma - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos alpha.

So,

d = 1 / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2hk cos gamma - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos alpha )

But for (111), this becomes 1/sqrt(3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2 ))=1/sqrt(3-3*sqrt(3)).

Which is negative, so impossible.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A:9.08 Angstrom.

But I can't see how to get that from the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the interatomic distance as the distance between two adjacent atoms along another direction, not along a, but perhaps along (1,1,1).

Wait, the distance between two adjacent atoms along (1,1,1) would be a√(1+1+1 + 2cos30 + 2cos30 + 2cos30 )

So, sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2 ))=sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

Which is the same as before, so the distance would be 10 * sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, no, that's the opposite. Because the interatomic distance along (111) would be a * sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2 )) )=10 * sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

Which is 10 * sqrt(3+5.196) = 10 * sqrt(8.196)≈10*2.863≈28.63 Angstroms, which is way too big.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Since all the options are around 9-10, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct answer is option A:9.08 Angstrom.

But wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2*(hk + hl +kl) )

Which for (111) is 3+6=9.

So d=10/sqrt(9)=10/3≈3.333 Angstroms. But that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt(1 + (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) )

Which for (111) is 1+3=4, so d=10/2=5 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the question is actually about the (100) plane, but it says (111).

Wait, the (100) plane would have d=10 Angstroms, which is option D.

But the question is about (111), so that can't be.

Perhaps the correct answer is option A:9.08 Angstrom.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Wait, with theta=30 degrees.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2 ))=10/sqrt(3 -3*sqrt(3)).

Which is sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. So impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have 2*(hk + hl + kl) multiplied by cos(180-30)=cos150= -sqrt(3)/2.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2 ))=10/sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

Which is still about 3.49 Angstroms.

But if I take the reciprocal, 1/d≈0.286, which is nowhere near the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is inverted.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Which would be 10 * sqrt(3 -3*sqrt(3)).

Which is 10*sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. So no.

I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to choose option A:9.08 Angstrom based on the possibility that the denominator is 3 + 3*sqrt(3) and a=10, leading to 10/sqrt(8.196)≈3.49, but perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, wait. Let me compute 10 divided by sqrt( (3) + 2*(1+1+1)*sqrt(3) )

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) )

So for (111), denominator is 3 +6=9.

d=10/sqrt(9)=10/3≈3.333.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d= a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) )

Which for (111) gives d=10/3≈3.33.

No.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct answer is option A:9.08 Angstrom.

Wait, 9.08 is close to 10*sqrt(3/4)=10*(sqrt(3)/2)=8.66, but not quite.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 10 * sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2 ))=10 * sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, but that's the same as before.

Wait, sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3))=sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So 10/2.863≈3.49.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all approaches, and perhaps the correct answer is option A:9.08 Angstrom, but I can't see how to get there with the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, and it's the (100) plane, which would be 10 Angstroms.

But the question specifies (111), so I'm not sure.


The problem involves calculating the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \). The general formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk \cos \gamma - 2hl \cos \beta - 2kl \cos \alpha}}
\]

For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and since \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \). Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3 - 6 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}}
\]

Simplifying the denominator:

\[
3 - 6 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 3 - 3\sqrt{3}
\]

This results in a negative value for the denominator (\( 3 - 3\sqrt{3} \approx -2.196 \)), which is physically impossible for a real interplanar distance. This suggests that the (111) plane may not be allowed in this rhombohedral structure. However, the question explicitly asks for the interplanar distance, so the calculation must proceed.

Revisiting the formula, if the signs of the cosine terms are reversed (i.e., \( +2hk \cos \gamma + 2hl \cos \beta + 2kl \cos \alpha \)), the denominator becomes:

\[
3 + 6 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 3 + 3\sqrt{3}
\]

Thus:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3 + 3\sqrt{3}}}
\]

Approximating \( 3 + 3\sqrt{3} \approx 8.196 \), the square root is:

\[
\sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
\]

So:

\[
d \approx \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

This result does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 9–10 Å. This discrepancy suggests either a mistake in the formula or the interpretation of the problem. Given the options, the closest plausible answer based on the calculations is **A) 9.08 Å**, though the reasoning to reach this value remains unclear.

Answer: A
