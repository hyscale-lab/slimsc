Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me think. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4). Oh wait, I think I remember that spin states are usually represented as column vectors. So (3i, 4) would be a two-component column vector. 

The options are A to D, and I need to compute the expectation value. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to recall the steps. Oh right, the expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket notation. So for an operator O, the expectation is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩. 

In this case, the operator is S_y. Wait, what's S_y in terms of the Pauli matrices? Oh right, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So σ_y is given in the note as:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So S_y would be (ħ/2) times σ_y. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. 

So the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩.

Now the state vector ψ is (3i, 4). Let me write that as a column vector: ψ = [3i; 4]. Because in quantum mechanics, the state is a column vector, and the bra is the conjugate transpose. So ψ† would be [ -4, -3i ].

Wait wait, no. Wait, the conjugate transpose of [3i;4] is [3i^*, 4^*], so [ -3i, 4 ] because the conjugate of 3i is -3i (since i^* is -i), and 4 is real, so stays 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So to compute σ_y |ψ⟩, I need to multiply σ_y by the vector ψ. Let me compute σ_y ψ. 

σ_y is a 2x2 matrix, so:

Compute each component:

First component: 0*(3i
