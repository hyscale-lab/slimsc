Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this is about the harmonic oscillator in three dimensions. The question is about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy.

Wait, so the potential is V(r) = (1/2)mω²r². Oh right, that's the isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator. I think this is a system where each degree of freedom (x, y, z) behaves like a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator.

In one dimension, the energy levels are quantized as E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n=0,1,2,...). But in three dimensions, since it's isotropic, I think the total energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, for the 3D isotropic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. But another way to represent it is using the quantum number n which is the sum of the individual quantum numbers. So n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy is E = (n + 3/2) ħω.

But wait, wait. I think I might have that wrong. No, wait, for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate. The energy depends on the quantum number n, which is the sum of the three quantum numbers. So each energy level is E = (n + 3/2) ħω. So the ground state is n=0 (n_x=0, n_y=0, n_z=0), first excited state is n=1, etc. So the third excited state would be when n=3, because counting starts at n=0 as ground. Let me think: ground is n=0, first excited n=1, second n=2, third n=3. So for n=3, E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's the energy. So looking at the options, option A has (9/2)ħω and 10 functions, and option C also has (9/2) but 3 functions.

Now the second
