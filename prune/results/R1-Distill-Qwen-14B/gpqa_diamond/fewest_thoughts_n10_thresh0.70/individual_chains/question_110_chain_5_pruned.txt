Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, let me understand the key information given. The question is about which stars can be observed by both spectrographs. The problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can observe those brighter than 16. So the star's apparent magnitude has to be <=17 for ESPRESSO, and <=16 for HIRES. Because a brighter star (lower magnitude number) is easier to detect, any star that is brighter than 17 mag can't be seen by ESPRESSO, but wait, it's the opposite: wait, wait. Wait, the statement says that with ESPRESSO, stars "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, no, wait, that's not right. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The V magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter; higher numbers are dimmer. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means they can see stars with V magnitudes up to 17 or lower. So for example, a star with V=17 is the dimmest they can see. So wait, the question says for ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag "brighter than 17 mag" can be observed. Oh, no, wait, actually, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, when the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed," that means stars that have V magnitudes less than 17 (since brighter stars have lower magnitudes). So if a star's apparent V is 17, it's the limit. So for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than 17, so it can be observed. So the maximum apparent magnitude each can observe is 17 for ESPRESSO and 16 for HIRES.

Wait, no, wait. The way it's phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So brighter than 17 is V < 17. So for example, V=16 is brighter than 17
