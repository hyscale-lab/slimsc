Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = ½ m ω² r². I remember that the harmonic oscillator in three dimensions is a common problem, and the energy levels and wavefunctions have specific structures based on the quantum numbers.

The question is asking two things: what's the energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to that energy? The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a value for energy and a number.

First, I need to recall the structure of the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. In three dimensions, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each of the three dimensions. So each energy level depends on n_x, n_y, n_z, which are non-negative integers (0,1,2,…) for each direction.

Wait, right! The energy for each state is given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2 ). Because each direction contributes (n_i + ½) ħω, and adding them up for x, y, z gives the total. So E = ħω (n + 3/2 ), where n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

But wait, sometimes the formula is written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers. So n is the total quantum number, which is a non-negative integer (n=0,1,2,...).

Now, the third excited state—wait, what does "third excited" mean? The ground state is the lowest energy, so it's the first state. The first excited state is the next one, then the second, third. So the third excited state would be the fourth energy level. Because the ground state is n=0 (first), first excited n=1 (second), second excited n=2 (third), third excited n=3 (fourth energy level). Hmm, wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. The ground state is the state with the lowest energy, which is n
