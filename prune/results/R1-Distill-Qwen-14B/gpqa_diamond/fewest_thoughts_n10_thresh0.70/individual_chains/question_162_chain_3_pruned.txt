Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a 2-dimensional metric because it's expressed in terms of dx and dy. I remember that in 2D, the area element is related to the determinant of the metric tensor. Oh right, the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor g_{μν}.

So, the metric here is in the form of ds² = g_{xx} dx² + g_{yy} dy², which suggests it's diagonal. That makes things a bit easier because the determinant is just the product of the diagonal terms.

Let me write this out. The metric components are g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant g would be (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Hmm, no wait, actually, the metric is diagonal, so the determinant is (g_{xx})*(g_{yy}) because the off-diagonal terms are zero. So yeah, g = (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

Wait, but wait a minute. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So that's the same as saying g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and the off-diagonal terms are zero. So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2.

But the area would then be the integral over x and y of sqrt(g) dx dy, which is the same as sqrt(g) multiplied by the area element. Wait, no. Wait, the area element in 2D is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2. Taking the square root gives 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but what are the limits of integration here? The metric seems to have a denominator of 4 - x² - y². So the metric will blow up when 4 - x² - y² approaches zero, meaning when x² + y² approaches 4. So the domain of the coordinates x and y is where 4 - x² - y² > 0, so x² + y² <4. So the region is a disk of radius 2, since 4 is 2 squared. So the coordinates x and y live inside a circle of radius 2.

Wait, so the area we're looking for is the integral of [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy over the region where x² + y² <4. Let me change to polar coordinates because that's easier to integrate. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The denominator becomes 4 - r².

So the integral becomes ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this. The integrand is [32 r ] / (4 - r²). Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r. So -du/2 = r dr. Hmm, so when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the limits for u go from 4 to 0.

So the integral becomes ∫θ ∫r [32 r dr] / (4 - r²) = ∫θ [32 * (-1/2) ∫u=
