Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is like a hyperbolic surface, right? It has constant negative curvature. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

The metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Oh, so this looks like a two-dimensional metric, maybe in polar coordinates? Wait, the variables are x and y, so maybe it's in Cartesian coordinates. Hmm.

I think the area element in a metric is found by taking the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. So, for a metric ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2 g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy², the area element would be sqrt(det(g)) dx dy.

In this case, the metric seems to be diagonal because there's no cross term. So g_{xx} = 32/(4 - x² - y²) and similarly for g_{yy}. So the determinant would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². So the area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy, which would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, but wait. Actually, the area element for a metric is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant. So here, det(g) is g_xx * g_yy since it's diagonal. So det = (32/(4 - x² -
