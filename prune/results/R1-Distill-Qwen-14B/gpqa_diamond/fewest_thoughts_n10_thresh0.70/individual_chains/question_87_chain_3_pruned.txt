Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Let me start by trying to break down the information given.

First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, and it has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Benzene has six carbons, so if it's di-substituted, each substituent must have a certain number of carbons. Let me think: 6 (from benzene) plus the substituents equals 8. So the substituents add up to 2 carbons. Hmm, maybe each substituent is a methyl group? No, because that would make it two methyl groups, so 6 + 2*(1) = 8. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, methyl is -CH3, which is one carbon. So if each substituent is a methyl, then two substituents would add two carbons. But wait, the total is 8, so 6+2=8. So that works. But wait, maybe the substituents are something else.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Oh right, so the substituents must include a carbonyl and a halogen. Oh wait, maybe each substituent is a carbonyl group and a halogen? Wait, but that would be two substituents, each with a carbonyl and a halogen? No, that doesn't make sense because the IR shows both. So the substituents are a carbonyl and a halogen.

Wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone, and the other is a halogen. Let me think about possible structures.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halide. So for example, one substituent is a carbonyl, like a ketone, and the other is a halogen, say, Cl or Br.

Wait, but wait: a carbonyl group is a carbonyl, which is a C=O. So for a benzene ring, substituents could be a carbonyl group like a ketone (Ar-CO-R) or perhaps an aldehyde (Ar-CHO), but aldehyde groups have a carbonyl and are typically more reactive.
