Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy differences between relativistic and classical calculations. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

Alright, the problem states that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. So M is the initial mass, and it's at rest, meaning its initial momentum is zero. Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. No other products, so just the two fragments. 

Wait, the problem says that one fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest-mass. Oh, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Oh wait, so M is the initial rest mass, and the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99 M. Because 99% of M is 0.99 M. But wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so its rest energy is 300 GeV. Wait, but the sum of the rest masses after fission is less than M. So that means mass is lost, which would be converted into kinetic energy, right? Because in fission, some mass turns into kinetic energy of the fragments and possibly other forms like radiation, but the problem says to ignore electrons, so maybe we don't have to worry about that.

Wait, the question is about the kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment. And we need to find the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. So we need to compute T1 relativistically and also using the classical approach, then find T1_rel - T1_classical or the other way around.

Hmm. Let's think about the setup.

First, let's define the rest masses. Let’s say the two fragments have rest masses m1 and m2. The problem states that one is twice as massive as the other, so m1 = 2 m2. The sum m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. So substituting, 2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M. So m1 is 0.66 M.

Wait, but wait, the initial nucleus has rest mass energy 300 GeV. So M is the mass of the nucleus, but when it splits, the total rest mass is
