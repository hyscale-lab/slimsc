Okay, so I have this physics problem about nuclear fission and the kinetic energy of the fragments. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the classical approximation.

Wait, right, in relativity, energy includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. But in the classical (non-relativistic) case, we just use Newtonian mechanics, treating momentum and kinetic energy as ½mv².

Let me break down the given data:

1. Initial rest mass energy: 300 GeV. So, Mc² = 300 GeV.

2. After fission, two fragments. Let's call their masses m1 and m2. Given that m1 = 2 m2.

Wait, no, wait. The question says one fragment is twice as massive as the other. So if the smaller is m, the larger is 2m. But the sum of their masses is 99% of M. So m + 2m = 0.99 M → 3m = 0.99 M → m = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M. So m2=0.33 M, m1=0.66 M.

Wait, wait, wait, no. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Since m1 = 2 m2, substituting gives 2m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M, m1=0.66 M. So yeah, that's correct.

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so total momentum before fission is zero. Thus, after fission, the total momentum should be zero too. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with momenta equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

In the rest frame of the initial nucleus, the two fragments will have equal and opposite moment
