Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy differences between relativistic and classical calculations. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

Alright, the problem states that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. So M is the initial mass, and it's at rest, meaning its initial momentum is zero. Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. No other products, so just the two fragments. 

Wait, the problem says that one fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest-mass. Oh, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Oh wait, so M is the initial rest mass, and the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99 M. Because 99% of M is 0.99 M. But wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so its rest energy is 300 GeV. Wait, but the sum of the rest masses after fission is less than M. So that means mass is lost, which would be converted into kinetic energy, right? Because in fission, some mass turns into kinetic energy of the fragments and possibly other forms like radiation, but the problem says to ignore electrons, so maybe we don't have to worry about that.

Wait, the question is about the kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment. And we need to find the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. So we need to compute T1 relativistically and also using the classical approach, then find T1_rel - T1_classical or the other way around.

Hmm. Let's think about the setup.

First, let's define the rest masses. Let’s say the two fragments have rest masses m1 and m2. The problem states that one is twice as massive as the other, so m1 = 2 m2. The sum m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. So substituting, 2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M. So m1 is 0.66 M.

Wait, but wait, the initial nucleus has rest mass energy 300 GeV. So M is the mass of the nucleus, but when it splits, the total rest mass is

Okay, so I have this physics problem about nuclear fission and the kinetic energy of the fragments. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the classical approximation.

Wait, right, in relativity, energy includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. But in the classical (non-relativistic) case, we just use Newtonian mechanics, treating momentum and kinetic energy as ½mv².

Let me break down the given data:

1. Initial rest mass energy: 300 GeV. So, Mc² = 300 GeV.

2. After fission, two fragments. Let's call their masses m1 and m2. Given that m1 = 2 m2.

Wait, no, wait. The question says one fragment is twice as massive as the other. So if the smaller is m, the larger is 2m. But the sum of their masses is 99% of M. So m + 2m = 0.99 M → 3m = 0.99 M → m = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M. So m2=0.33 M, m1=0.66 M.

Wait, wait, wait, no. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Since m1 = 2 m2, substituting gives 2m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M, m1=0.66 M. So yeah, that's correct.

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so total momentum before fission is zero. Thus, after fission, the total momentum should be zero too. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with momenta equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

In the rest frame of the initial nucleus, the two fragments will have equal and opposite moment
