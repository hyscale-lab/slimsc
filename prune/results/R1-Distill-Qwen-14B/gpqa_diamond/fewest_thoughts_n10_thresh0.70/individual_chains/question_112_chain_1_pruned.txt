Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves an electron state and calculating probabilities and the average value of an operator. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, but I need to find the probabilities for measuring the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij: Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Oh wait, what does that matrix look like?

Wait, let me think. For a two-level system, the matrix would be 2x2. So A should have 0 on the diagonal, because when i=j, Aij=0. And when i≠j, Aij= ħ/2. So the matrix would be:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0  ]

But wait, ħ is hbar. So the operator is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. Interesting.

Wait, but what are the eigenstates of this operator A? Because the question is about measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A, so the probabilities would relate to the projections of |alpha> onto those eigenstates.

So first, I need to find the eigenstates of operator A. Let me find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

The matrix A is:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

To find the eigenvalues, I'll compute the determinant of (A - λI), which is:

| -λ   ħ/2 |
| ħ/2 -λ   |

The determinant is λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0. So λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. Now, the eigenvectors.

For eigenvalue +ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2)I) v = 0.

So:

[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ] [a]   [0]
[ ħ/2  -ħ/2 ] [b] = [0]

From the first equation: (-ħ/2)a + (ħ/2) b = 0 → (-a + b) = 0 → a = b. So the eigenvector can be any scalar multiple of (1,1). So the eigenstate is proportional to |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), perhaps.

Wait, because |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-component of spin. So in the basis of |up> and |down>, the states are expressed.

Similarly, for eigenvalue -ħ/2, the eigenvector would satisfy a = -b. So the eigenstate is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, let me confirm. Because when I have a symmetric matrix like this, the eigenvectors are symmetric and antisymmetric combinations.

So the eigenstates of operator A are |phi+
