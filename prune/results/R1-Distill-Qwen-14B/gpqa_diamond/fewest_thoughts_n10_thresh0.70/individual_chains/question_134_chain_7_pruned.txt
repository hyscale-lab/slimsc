Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some solutions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says we're mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we need to find the enthalpy of neutralization. The options are given in both kcal and kJ, which is interesting. I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases, but I'm not sure how mixing multiple solutions affects that.

Wait, first I think I should figure out how much acid and base are present. Because neutralization is an acid-base reaction, so I need to find the moles of H+ and OH- ions.

Let me break it down. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each HCl gives one H+ ion. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. So the first dissociation is complete, giving two H+ ions per molecule. Wait, but wait, actually, H2SO4 is a strong acid, so the first H+ is released completely, but the second one isn't as strong. Hmm, but in the context of neutralization, I think we're only considering the first dissociation. Because, wait, when H2SO4 is in solution, it donates two H+ ions. But when considering neutralization with a base, each H2SO4 would contribute two equivalents of H+.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. In aqueous solution, the first H+ is fully ionized, the second is only partially. But in the case of neutralization, especially with a strong base like Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, perhaps both H+ ions from H2SO4 will react. Or maybe not? Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base as well. Each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions because of the formula. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

So, I think I should calculate the moles
