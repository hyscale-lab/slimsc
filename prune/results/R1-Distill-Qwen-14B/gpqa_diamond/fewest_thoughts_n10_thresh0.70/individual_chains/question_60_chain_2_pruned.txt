Okay, so I have this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think through this step by step.

The question states that there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They have a spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is really, really fast. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes from their perspective to reach Earth. The options are A to D, with A being that the astronaut dies before reaching.

Wait, so the astronaut is experiencing their own time, which would be the proper time. Time dilation comes into play because they're moving at a high velocity relative to Earth, so from Earth's frame, time would be longer, but from the astronaut's perspective, it's shorter.

First, I need to figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. I remember the LMC is about 160,000 to 170,000 light-years away. Let me take an average of, say, 160,000 light-years. Wait, but the exact figure might not matter because the multiple-choice options are in the tens of years.

So distance is approximately 163,000 light-years. Let me note that as d = 163,000 ly.

The spacecraft's speed is 0.99999987c. Let's compute how long it would take from Earth's frame of reference. Time = distance/speed.

So, in Earth's frame, the time taken would be t = d / v. Let's compute that:

v is approximately 0.99999987c. So, t = 163,000 ly / (0.99999987 * c). Since 1 ly/c is 1 year, t ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * (1 / (1 - 0.123e-6)) ≈ but wait, 0.99999987 is so close to 1 that t is almost 163,000 years. Wait, that can't be right because the options are about 70-80 years.

Wait
