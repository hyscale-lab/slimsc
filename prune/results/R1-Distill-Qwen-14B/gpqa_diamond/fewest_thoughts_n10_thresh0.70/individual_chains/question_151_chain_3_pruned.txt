Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting 0. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). And the observable P is a 3x3 matrix with specific elements.

Wait, right, in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by matrices, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that matrix. So, to find the probability of getting a particular outcome, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to that eigenvalue and then calculate the probability based on the state vector.

But wait, the state vector is given as a column vector. Let me write it down. The state vector is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Wait, actually, it's a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So it's a 3-dimensional vector. But wait, in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually normalized, meaning their norm (the sum of squares of the absolute values) should be 1. Let me check that.

The state vector components are -1, 2, 1. So, the norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so this vector isn't normalized. I think I'll need to normalize it before proceeding because probabilities depend on the inner product, which requires the state to be a unit vector.

So, the first step is to normalize the state vector. The normalization factor would be 1/sqrt(6), right? Because the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) times [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me write that as ψ = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Now, the observable P is given as a 3x3 matrix. Let me write down its elements:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

So, the matrix P looks like this:

[ 0          1/√2      0      ]
[ 1/√2       0        1/√2   ]
[ 0          1/√2      0      ]

Hmm. I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix because the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues. And I'm interested in the eigenvalue 0.

Wait, wait, the problem asks for the probability of measuring 0. So, I need to find if 0 is an eigenvalue of P. If it is, then the probability is the square of the amplitude (the inner product of the state with the corresponding eigenvector). But if 0 isn't an eigenvalue, then the probability is zero.

So, let's find the eigenvalues of P. Let's set up the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

The matrix P - λI is:
