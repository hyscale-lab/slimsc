Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that notation might be a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to rewrite it. Oh wait, I think the correct form is more like L = -λ ψ_f (y) (X(y) + v) ψ_f(y). Or perhaps it's a Yukawa-like interaction, where X couples to the fermion ψ_f. So the interaction term is something like λ X ψ_f ψ_f, which would imply that the boson X can decay into two fermions of the same type.

So the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to find all possible fermion pairs that X can decay into, considering their masses.

First, I should figure out which fermions are light enough that their combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because for a decay to be possible, the sum of the rest mass energies of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the boson. Since X has a mass of 6 GeV, any fermion pair it decays into must have a combined mass ≤ 6
