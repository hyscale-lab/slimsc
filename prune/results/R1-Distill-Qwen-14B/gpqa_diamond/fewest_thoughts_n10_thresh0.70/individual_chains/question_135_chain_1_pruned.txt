Okay, so I have this physics problem about boson decay, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

Hmm, right. So first, I remember that in particle physics, when a boson decays, it has to produce fermions in pairs because the interaction term here is between X and fermion fields. So, the decay products would be a fermion and its antiparticle.

Looking at the Lagrangian, the interaction term is λf ψ̄_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y). So the fermion ψ_f couples to X. That means X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that this term allows.

Wait, but wait. The term is ψ̄_f (y) X ψ_f(y), so each ψ_f is a Dirac fermion. So the X boson can couple to any fermion that's present in this term. But what determines which fermions are present? Oh, right, the model's structure probably includes all possible fermions, but the mass of the boson X will determine which decays are kinematically allowed.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So any decay product must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in decay processes, the rest mass of the decaying particle must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products (in the center-of-mass frame). So for X → f f̄, the mass of f times 2 (since each f has mass m) must be ≤ 6 GeV.

So first, I need to list all the possible fermions that could be produced, considering their masses.

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions:

- Up-type quarks: u, c, t. The masses are about: u is like a few MeV, c is ~1.3 GeV, t is ~173 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. t is way too heavy. So if X is 6 GeV, can it decay into a top quark pair? No, because each top is about 173 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So t is out.

Similarly for the other quarks.

What about down-type quarks: d, s, b. d is about 5 MeV, s is around 100 MeV, and b is about 4.5 GeV.

Wait, so for X → b b̄, the total mass would be 2 *
