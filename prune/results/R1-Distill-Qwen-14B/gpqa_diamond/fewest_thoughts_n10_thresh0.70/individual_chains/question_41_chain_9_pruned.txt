Okay, so I have this physics problem about light traveling through glass that's moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember something about how light's speed in a medium is c/n, but when the medium is moving, how does that affect it? Oh right, from what I recall, the speed of light in the medium doesn't change because of the medium's motion. Or does it have something to do with the observer's frame?

Let me think. When the glass is moving, does that affect the observed speed of the light? In a vacuum, I know that the speed of light is constant regardless of the source's motion. But here it's in glass, which is a medium. So maybe the speed of light in the glass is c/n, but how does the glass's velocity factor in?

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, but in the same direction as the light beam. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass (which is the medium) is also moving in the same direction. Hmm, but I'm not sure if the observer's frame is what matters here.

Wait, the problem is asking for the speed of the light relative to the observer. So what's the frame here? The lab frame is the observer's frame. The glass is moving
