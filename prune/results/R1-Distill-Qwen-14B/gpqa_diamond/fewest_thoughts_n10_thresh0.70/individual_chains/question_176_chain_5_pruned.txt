Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

So the question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. The system's state is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh wait, maybe that's just the components, and we'll normalize it later or is it already normalized? Let me check: the components are -1, 2, 1. The magnitude squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6), so the state is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1,2,1)^T. Right, because states are vectors in a Hilbert space, and they need to be normalized.

The problem says that someone measures Q just after measuring P. We need to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, wait. No. Wait, the measurements are done in the order P then Q. So first, we measure P, get 0, then measure Q and get -1. So the probability is the product of the probability of P=0 and then Q=-1 given that P was 0? Or is it more involved because the state could collapse differently?

Wait, no. When you measure P,
