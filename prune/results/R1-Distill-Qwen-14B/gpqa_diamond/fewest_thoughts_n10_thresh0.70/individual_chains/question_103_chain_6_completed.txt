Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I should visualize the target molecule. The structure is a phenyl group with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Ethan-1-one means a ketone on the ethyl group attached to the benzene. So the benzene ring has a ketone group attached via a CH2 group. Wait, actually, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO, so it's an acetone group attached as a substituent. So the phenyl group is connected to the ketone, making it a phenylacetone structure.

Wait, the substituents on the benzene are 3-bromo and 5-nitro. So numbering the benzene ring, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. Since the acetone (CH3CO-) is attached at position 1, right? Because the main chain is ethan-1-one—so the ketone is on the first carbon, meaning the benzene is attached to the second carbon of the ethanone. Wait, maybe I should draw this structure mentally. The benzene ring has a substituent which is an acetone group attached to position 1, and then on positions 3 and 5, there are Br and NO2 groups.

Wait, more accurately, the benzene ring has three substituents: the acetone group, the bromine, and the nitro group. Let me get the positions correct. The acetone is on position 1, bromine on 3, nitro on 5. So the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other. Wait, no. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Position 1 is where the acetone is attached. Then position 3 is two carbons away in a clockwise direction. Position 5 is two carbons away in the other direction. So the substituents are on 1, 3, and 5 positions? Wait, no, wait. The acetone is on position 1, and the other substituents are at 3 and 5, which are para to each other, with the acetone in between? Or are the substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the acetone group?

Wait, perhaps I should number the benzene ring with the acetone as position 1. Then the substituents are at 3 and 5, which are meta to each other on the ring. So, the structure is a benzene ring where position 1 has the acetone group, position 3 has a bromine, and position 5 has a nitro group. Alternatively, maybe the positions are 3 and 5 relative to the acetone, meaning that the ring has substituents at 1, 3, and 5? No, that can't be right because that would have three substituents, but the target molecule is only a benzene with two substituents: one is the acetone (through a CH2 group, wait no, acetone is (CH3)2CO, but wait, no—ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO- group. Wait, no, ethan-1-one is CH3-CO-. So the structure is benzene with a ketone group (CO) attached to a CH2 group, making it a phenylacetone, specifically.

Wait, no, wait. The structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethan-1-one group is CH2-C(=O)- attached to the benzene. So the benzene has a substituent which is CH2-C(=O)-R, but R is the rest. Wait, no, wait, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethanone is CH3-C(=O)-, and the benzene is attached at the 1 position of the ethanone. So the structure is:

The benzene ring is attached to the carbon of the ketone, which is the first carbon of the ethanone. So the ketone is CO attached to the benzene, and the other carbon is CH3. So it's actually acetophenone, but with substituents on the benzene ring. So the benzene has substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the point where it's attached to the ketone.

So the benzene ring has a ketone group attached at position 1 (if we number the ring that way), and then bromine at position 3 and nitro at position 5. So the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other.

Now, the question is how to synthesize this starting from benzene. So I need to add these substituents in the correct order to get the desired positions.

In aromatic substitution reactions, the order in which substituents are introduced can affect the positions where subsequent groups add. For example, activating and deactivating groups influence the regiochemistry. So, when adding substituents, the directing effect of each group must be considered.

Looking at the substituents needed: bromine (deactivating, meta-directing) and nitro (strongly deactivating, meta-directing) groups. The ketone (from ethanone) is an electron-withdrawing group, which is a meta director.

Wait, but the acetone group is attached as a substituent on benzene, making it a meta director. So if I attach the acetone group first, then any subsequent substituents (bromine and nitro) would add in the meta positions relative to it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to add the deactivating groups first, but I need to think about the directing effects.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me outline the steps each option takes.

The target molecule has three substituents: the acetone group (from ethan-1-one), bromine, and nitro. Wait no, wait. Wait the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the benzene ring has three substituents: the ethanone group (at position 1), bromine (position 3), and nitro (position 5). So three substituents on the ring.

Wait, but initially, benzene has no substituents. So how do you get three substituents? Oh, wait, perhaps the ethanone is a substituent, and then the bromine and nitro are added as substituents on the ring in the correct positions.

Wait, but benzene can only have three substituents if each step adds one. So perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro and bromine groups in the correct positions relative to the acetone group.

Alternatively, wait, maybe the acetone is introduced via Friedel-Crafts, but since the acetone is a ketone, and Friedel-Crafts acylation adds the acyl group to benzene. Acetophenone is a product of Friedel-Crafts acylation, which is a meta-directing group.

So if I first do Friedel-Crafts acylation to benzene, I get acetophenone. Then, I need to add bromine and nitro groups in the correct positions.

But wait, nitration is another step. The problem is that after adding the acetone group, which is a meta director, the next substituents will be added in the meta positions relative to the acetone.

Wait, but if I have two substituents (Br and NO2), they need to be in 3 and 5 positions relative to the acetone. So perhaps I should add them in a way that each directs the next group correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is to add the nitro group first, then the bromine, but considering their directing effects.

Wait, let's think about the synthesis steps.

Option D says:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene → would give nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitrobenzene to an amine. Wait, but Fe/HCl is not a typical reduction condition for nitro groups. Nitro groups are typically reduced with H2/Pd or using Fe/HCl in acidic conditions, but I think that reduces nitro to amine. So step ii) would give phenylamine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the amine, which would typically form a diazonium salt. But wait, if the amine is in the benzene ring, then treating with NaNO2 and HCl would give a diazonium chloride. Then step iv) H3PO2 would typically be used for Sandmeyer reaction, but H3PO2 is a reducing agent. Wait, the Sandmeyer reaction typically uses CuCN or similar for substitution. Wait, but H3PO2 is used in the presence of a diazonium salt to introduce Br or Cl, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for the replacement with iodide or other substitutions. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps after getting the diazonium salt, the conditions would replace it with a bromine, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe this is a way to substitute the diazonium group with a bromine.

Wait, but in any case, perhaps this option is adding a bromine after nitration and reduction.

Then, step v) Br2/FeBr3 → adding bromine via electrophilic substitution.

Step vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation to add the acetone group.

Step vii) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

But wait, let's check if that would lead to the correct substituents.

Wait, initial benzene is nitrated in step i) to nitrobenzene. Then step ii): Fe/HCl reduces nitro to NH2 (phenylamine). Step iii): NaNO2/HCl → diazonium chloride. Step iv): H3PO2 → maybe replace the diazonium with Br, so now the ring has Br. So benzene now has Br at position where the NH2 was, i.e., position where nitro was, since nitro is a meta director.

Wait, but then step v) is Br2/FeBr3. So another bromination. So now we have two bromines? Or perhaps another substitution.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should evaluate each option step by step.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene to give acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination of acetophenone. Since the ketone is meta director, adding Br would go meta to the ketone. So acetophenone (meta-directing) would add Br in the meta position. So now, benzene has ketone and Br in meta positions.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. The ketone is meta director, and Br is also a meta director. So where would the nitro group add?

Wait, perhaps the nitration would occur in a position that's meta to both the ketone and Br. But if the ketone is at position 1, and Br is at position 3, then the nitro group would be at position 5. That's exactly what we need! So after steps i, ii, iii, we have positions 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2), which is the target.

But wait, the problem is that the order may not allow that. Let me think about the regiochemistry.

In step iii), after adding Br meta to ketone, the ring has substituents in positions 1 (ketone), 3 (Br). When you nitrate, the nitro group will enter a position that is meta to both. Let's see: the ketone directs meta, Br also directs meta. The available positions would be 5 and another. Wait, but in a benzene ring, the meta positions to the ketone (position 1) are 3 and 5. The Br is at 3, so the meta to the Br would be position 6 (if the Br is at 3, meta would be position 6, which is across the ring). Wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration would occur at position 5, which is meta to the ketone and para to the Br. Because the Br is at position 3, its meta would be position 6. So the nitro could go either into position 5 (meta to ketone) or position 6 (meta to Br). But in this case, the target requires nitro at 5 and Br at 3.

Wait, but perhaps it's more about the strongest directing group. The nitration step uses HNO3 and H2SO4, which is a strong nitrating mix. The substituents present are ketone (meta) and Br (meta). So the most activated position would be where both directing effects point. Or perhaps the most activating group's direction takes precedence.

Wait, the ketone is a strong deactivating group (electron-withdrawing), so it's a meta director. The Br is a deactivating, meta director as well. So when both are present, the positions that are meta to both would be the target for nitration.

In the case of acetophenone (position 1) and Br (position 3), the available meta positions would be:

- For the ketone: positions 3 and 5. But position 3 is already occupied by Br. So the next available is 5.

- For Br: meta positions are 6 and possibly others, but in this case, the only available position meta to both is 5.

So nitration would occur at position 5, giving the desired product. Then after steps i-iii, the target is achieved. But wait, then why are there more steps in the option? Let me check option A steps:

Option A's steps are i to vii, but the target is made in steps i, ii, iii. So why does the option have more steps? Wait, looking back, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So after steps i (Friedel-Crafts acylation), ii (bromination in meta), iii (nitration in meta to ketone), we get the structure with substituents at 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). That's correct. But the option includes more steps (iv to vii), which suggests that perhaps this isn't the correct path because the synthesis could be completed in fewer steps.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Because the order in which substituents are added can affect whether the subsequent steps can proceed. For example, if you add a nitro group before the ketone, perhaps you can't do Friedel-Crafts because nitro is a strong deactivating group, and Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups on benzene.

Ah, that's an important point. Friedel-Crafts acylation (which uses AlCl3 as a catalyst) requires that the benzene ring is activated. Nitro groups are deactivating, so if you have nitro on benzene, you can't perform Friedel-Crafts on it anymore. So the ketone must be added before any deactivating groups like Br and NO2.

So in this case, the ketone must be added first. Then, the Br and NO2 can be added in the correct positions. So in option A, the first step is Friedel-Crafts, which is correct.

So let's see option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts: benzene → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3: acetophenone → adds Br meta to ketone. So Br at position 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration → adds NO2 meta to ketone (position 5), since Br is at 3.

So after step iii, the structure is 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone, which is the target. So why does option A have more steps after that? It seems like steps iv to vii might be irrelevant or perhaps a distractor.

Wait, but the question is about high-yield synthesis. So perhaps the sequence in option A would require more steps, but the target is achieved in the first three steps. So the remaining steps would complicate the synthesis, perhaps leading to side products or unnecessary reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that after adding the Br and NO2, there's a need to reduce something, or perhaps perform another acylation, which isn't needed.

Wait, looking at option A's steps:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → adds Br at position 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → adds NO2 at position 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction step, but why?

Wait, perhaps after nitration, you have the nitro group. But if you need to introduce another substituent that requires a reduction, but I don't think so in this case.

Wait, the target has a Br and a nitro group, both of which are deactivating. So after adding the ketone, adding Br, then nitro, as in option A, gives the correct structure. Thus, the correct option would be the one where the ketone is added first, followed by Br, then nitro.

Looking back at the options:

Option A does that: steps i, ii, iii.

Other options:

Option B starts with Br, which is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't work afterward. Because Friedel-Crafts needs activating groups. So option B can't be correct because after adding Br, the ring is deactivated, so the next step is nitration (HNO3), but then after that, when trying to do Friedel-Crafts (step iii), the ring is too deactivated, so it won't proceed. Therefore, option B is incorrect.

Option C starts with nitration. Then step ii) is Fe/HCl, which is probably a reduction of nitro to amine. Then step iii) Friedel-Crafts. But wait, after nitration, the ring has a nitro group, which is deactivating. Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. So if you have nitro on benzene, you can't do Friedel-Crafts. Thus, option C is incorrect.

Option D starts with nitration, then reduction to amine, then diazotization, then H3PO2 (probably to substitute with Br), then Br2/FeBr3, then Friedel-Crafts, then another nitration. But again, after nitration, Friedel-Crafts won't work. So likely, option D is incorrect.

So, option A is the only one that starts with Friedel-Crafts, which is correct. Then adds Br, then nitro. So the correct answer would be option A. But wait, looking at option A, after steps i, ii, iii, the target is achieved. But the option lists steps iv to vii as well. That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the target is not just the benzene but the ethanone. Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the benzene ring has the acetone group, Br, and nitro. So the correct order is adding acetone first, then Br, then nitro.

But the problem is that after adding Br, the ring is already deactivated, but nitration can still proceed because nitration is a strong electrophile. So option A's steps i, ii, iii would give the target. So why are there more steps in the option? Maybe the given options include all the steps, but some are distractors.

Wait, maybe I've made a mistake in considering the substituents' positions. Let me think again.

If you have acetophenone (ketone at position 1), then bromination adds Br at position 3. Then nitration adds NO2 at position 5. So the positions 1,3,5 are all substituted. That matches the target.

So the correct sequence is steps i, ii, iii in option A, which would produce the target. So the correct option is A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (the ketone group, bromine, and nitro group) are introduced in the correct positions on the benzene ring. The ketone group is an electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director, while bromine and nitro groups are also deactivating and meta-directing. The order of reactions must account for the directing effects of these groups and ensure that the benzene ring remains reactive enough to undergo subsequent substitutions.

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts acylation adds the ketone group to benzene, forming acetophenone. The ketone is a meta-director.
2. **Step ii: Br₂/FeBr₃**: Bromination occurs at the meta position relative to the ketone, adding a bromine atom at position 3.
3. **Step iii: HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration occurs at the meta position relative to the ketone, adding a nitro group at position 5.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps are unnecessary, as the target molecule is already formed after steps i–iii.

This sequence correctly introduces the substituents in the desired positions (1: ketone, 3: bromine, 5: nitro). The synthesis is complete after steps i–iii.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i: Br₂/FeBr₃**: Bromination of benzene introduces a bromine atom, but bromine is a deactivating group, making the benzene ring less reactive for subsequent reactions.
2. **Step ii: HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration can still occur, but the bromine directs the nitro group to the meta position relative to itself.
3. **Step iii: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts acylation requires an activated benzene ring, which is no longer possible due to the deactivating effects of bromine and nitro groups.

This sequence fails because the Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot proceed after the benzene ring has been deactivated by bromine and nitro groups.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i: HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration of benzene introduces a nitro group, which is a strong deactivating group.
2. **Step ii: Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine group occurs, but this does not restore the reactivity of the benzene ring for Friedel-Crafts acylation.
3. **Step iii: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot proceed because the benzene ring remains deactivated by the nitro group.

This sequence fails because the benzene ring is deactivated by the nitro group, preventing the Friedel-Crafts acylation from occurring.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i: HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration of benzene introduces a nitro group, which is a strong deactivating group.
2. **Step ii: Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine group occurs, but this does not restore the reactivity of the benzene ring for subsequent substitutions.
3. **Step iii: NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization of the amine group forms a diazonium salt, but this does not restore the reactivity of the benzene ring for Friedel-Crafts acylation.
4. **Step iv: H₃PO₂**: This step likely introduces a bromine atom, but the benzene ring remains deactivated.
5. **Step v: Br₂/FeBr₃**: Bromination cannot proceed effectively because the benzene ring is deactivated.
6. **Step vi: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot proceed because the benzene ring remains deactivated.
7. **Step vii: HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Additional nitration is unnecessary and would not correct the earlier issues.

This sequence fails because the benzene ring is deactivated by the nitro group, preventing the Friedel-Crafts acylation and other substitutions from proceeding.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence is **Option A**, where the ketone group is introduced first via Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination and nitration. This ensures that the benzene ring remains reactive for subsequent substitutions, and the substituents are introduced in the correct positions.

**Answer: A**
