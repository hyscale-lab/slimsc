Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm supposed to figure out what compound E is. Let's see, the reaction steps are from compound A to E through a series of reactions. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, the reaction steps are as follows:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is then reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Finally, compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Oh, and there are some hints provided. Let's not forget those. The hints are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and compound E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

Alright, so let's start by analyzing hint a. So, when Compound A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms this specific structure: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. Wittig reagents add to carbonyl groups, right? So that suggests that compound A has a carbonyl group because the Wittig reaction forms alkenes. 

Wait, the product from the Wittig is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me try to draw this structure mentally. Cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1 and 2 being methyl groups. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(=CH2)-, I think. Oh wait, propan-2-ylidene would be the ylid part, which is a CH2CH2 group but with the ylid structure. Wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C= as the substituent.

Wait, the product from the Wittig reaction would have a new double bond. So the starting material A has a carbonyl, and the Wittig adds a new group. The product structure is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane with a substituent at position 4 which is propan-2-ylidene, which I think is a methyl group attached via a double bond. So that substituent would be a =CH(CH2CH3) or something else?

Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be (CH2CH(CH3))= maybe? Or wait, no. Propan-2-ylidene would be (CH3)2
