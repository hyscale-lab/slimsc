Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, right, I remember that the potential is V(r) = ½ m ω² r², which is the same as three one-dimensional harmonic oscillators in each direction (x, y, z). 

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy. Let's break this down.

First, I need to recall how the energy levels work in a 3D harmonic oscillator. I think each dimension contributes to the energy, so the total energy would be the sum of the energies in each direction. For a 1D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n + ½) ħω, where n is the quantum number (0,1,2,...).

In three dimensions, since each direction is independent, the total energy E would be E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as E = (N + 3/2) ħω, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So each energy level is determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in x, y, and z directions.

Now, the third excited state... Wait, I need to clarify what the ground state and excited states are here. The ground state is the lowest energy, which would be when all n_x, n_y, n_z are 0. So the first excited state would be when one of them is 1, but there are multiple possibilities for which one. But when we talk about the 'excited state' in terms of ordering, I think we consider the total N.

Wait, no. The energy levels are determined by N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So each energy level is labeled by the principal quantum number N. The ground state is N=0 (all n's are zero). The first excited state is N=1 (one of the n's is 1, others zero), second excited state is N=2, third excited state is N=3.

Wait, but wait. How does the energy depend on N? The energy is (N + 3/2) ħω. So for N
