Okay, so I have this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both a North and South pole; you can't isolate them. That's why, for instance, you can't have a single pole sticking out on a magnet; it's always paired. 

Wait, Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields behave. One of the equations is about the divergence of the magnetic field. Oh right, the divergence of B is zero. That equation is ∇·B = 0. This comes from the fact that magnetic monopoles don't exist in our universe. So if in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that equation must change. Because if monopoles exist, there would be sources for the magnetic field, so the divergence wouldn't be zero anymore. So that equation would definitely be different.

But the question is which of Maxwell's equations are different. Let me think about all four equations:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. That's about electric charge sources. If magnetic monopoles exist, does this equation change? Probably not directly. It's about electric fields and charges.

2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0. As I thought before, this would change if monopoles exist. Because monopoles would act as sources or sinks for the magnetic field, so divergence of B would not be zero. So this equation would definitely be different.

Wait, so that's one equation changed.

3. Faraday's Law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. This relates the curl of the electric field to the time change of the magnetic field. Would this change? I don't think so. Because even if you have monopoles, Faraday's Law as it stands describes induced electric fields due to changing magnetic fields. But wait, if monopoles exist, maybe there's another term. I'm not sure. Let me think. In our universe, this equation holds because it's about the curl of E being opposite the time derivative of B. But if magnetic monopoles exist, perhaps there's a term involving magnetic current or something. Oh, wait! Maxwell's equations also have an Ampère's Law type equation which includes the displacement current. But I'm getting a bit confused.

4. Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition): ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t. But wait, Ampère's Law for the magnetic field is about the curl of H being equal to the current plus the displacement current. But that equation deals with the electric current and the time-varying E field. How would magnetic monopoles affect this? Hmm. Maybe the presence of magnetic monopoles would introduce additional terms in this equation. Because in Maxwell's equations, the other version is Faraday's Law, which doesn't have such terms unless you have monopoles.

Wait, Maxwell's equations as I know them are four in number:

1. ∇·E = ρ_ε / ε₀
