Okay, so I have this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator approximations, but wait, the question specifies the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor accounts for bond vibrations, unlike the rigid rotor which assumes the bond length is fixed.

The question states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which for the rotation-vibration model would be the state where both vibrational and rotational energies are in their ground states. So for the quantum numbers, that would be vibration level v=0 and rotation level l=0.

The question asks about the momentum of a photon needed for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The next state would require the least energy increase, so probably moving to the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. Wait, but in the fundamental state, both are at their lowest. So if the molecule absorbs a photon, which transition is possible?

In the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels account for both rotation and vibration. But when you're in the v=0 state, the next possible transition is to v=1, which is the first vibrational excited state. Because moving from v=0 to v=1 would require the photon to have energy equal to the vibrational energy quantum.

Wait, but wait. The question says, "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So, perhaps it's the next higher energy state after the fundamental. The fundamental state is the lowest, so the next higher would be the first excited state.

But what's the structure of the energy levels here? For a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are given by a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. The total energy E is the sum of rotational energy (E_rot) and vibrational energy (E_vib).

For the rigid rotor, the rotational energy is E_rot = (ħ² l(l+1)) / (2I), where I is the moment of inertia. For the harmonic oscillator, E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number.

But wait, the non-rigid rotor model incorporates the vibration into the rotational energy. So the moment of inertia isn't constant; it varies with the vibration. Oh, but maybe for the purposes of this problem, we
