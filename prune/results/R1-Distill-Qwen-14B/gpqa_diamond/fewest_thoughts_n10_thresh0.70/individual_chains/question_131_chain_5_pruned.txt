Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, let's read the question carefully.

The question is about a dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene to form an anhydride. The anhydride has specific NMR spectra. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, both with the molecular formula C13H16O3.

The key part is the NOESY NMR data. The major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. I need to figure out which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak.

First, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Dehydration of Dicarboxylic Acid:**
   The starting material is a cis-alkene dicarboxylic acid. Dehydration would form an anhydride. The structure of the anhydride depends on the position of the double bond. Since it's a cis-dicarboxylic acid, the resulting anhydride will have a cyclic structure, probably a bicyclic structure if the acid has adjacent carboxylic groups.

2. **NMR Data of Anhydride:**
   Looking at the 1H NMR, there's a single peak at 7 ppm. That usually suggests an aromatic proton, but wait, the anhydride might not be aromatic. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton from the anhydride? Or perhaps a conjugated system causing the shift. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group, but that's more in carbon NMR.

   The 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Carbon shifts around 137 are typically for carbons attached to electronegative atoms, like carbonyls. Wait, but 137 is more like a carbon next to an oxygen, perhaps a carbonyl or an oxygen-bearing carbon. 165 ppm is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Since it's an anhydride, the carbonyl would be present, and the 13C NMR would show two carbonyl carbons
