Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are both in circular orbits, which probably simplifies things. The question is about their orbital periods.

The problem gives the shift in the spectral lines caused by each planet. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but wait, radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift, right? The star moves due to the planet's gravity, causing a shift in the spectral lines. The formula I remember relates the velocity of the star (v) to the Doppler shift (Δλ/λ), and that's given by v = (Δλ/λ) * c, where c is the speed of light. Oh wait, but here they're giving the shifts in milliangstroms. So we need to relate the shifts to the velocities.

But wait, the question is about the orbital periods. How does the Doppler shift relate to the orbital period? Oh, because the RV method detects the star's velocity changing periodically as the planet orbits. The semi-amplitude of that velocity (K) depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period and distance. Wait, maybe the formula is K = (v) = (2πG)^{1/3} * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^{2/3} (1 + M_p/M_star)^{1/3} ) * (1/(P)^{1/3}) )

Wait, I think the formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like:

K = (v) = ( (27 * π * G) / (2 * c^3) )^{1/3} * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^{2/3} (1 + M_p/M_star)^{1/3}) ) * (1/(P)^{1/3}) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the more commonly used simplified formula. Since both stars have the same mass (like Sun), and the planet masses are similar (so M_p << M_star, so (1 + M_p/M_star) ≈ 1), then the formula simplifies. 

The simplified version is K ≈ ( (G * P )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (2π c) (M_star)^(2/3) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to look for the relation between K and the orbital period P. Because the question is about the ratio of the periods.

Since both stars are the same mass and the planets have similar masses, the only varying factors given are the Doppler shifts (which relate to K). So for each planet, K1 = 5 milliangstroms and K2 =7 milliangstroms. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says the shifts are periodic from the spectral lines, so each shift corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. So K is the semi-amplitude velocity.

So K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^{1/3} P^{1/3} ) ), assuming that M_p is much less than M_star, so sin i is approximately 1 (edge-on orbit, which is typical assumption).

Wait, more accurately, the RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (sin i) / ( (2π P )^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so (1 - e^2)^(1/2) =1. So K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) * sin i / ( (2π P )^(1/3) )

Wait, wait, maybe I should write it correctly. Let me think again.

The exact formula for K is:

K = [ ( (G * P ) / (2π c^3) )^(1/3) ) ] * [ ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]

But again, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So,

K ≈ ( (G P ) / (2π c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But since both systems have the same M_star and M_p is similar, and assuming sin i is similar (maybe same inclination, though that's not given), then K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)).

Wait, so if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to K^(-3). So the higher K, the smaller the period. Because K is velocity, higher K means the star is moving faster in its orbit. But why would that be? Because if a planet is closer to the star, the orbital period is shorter, and the star's velocity is higher. Because for a closer planet, the star's velocity is higher for the same mass planet.

So for two planets with same mass, same star mass, the ratio of their K velocities is the same as the ratio of their (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ), but since M_p and M_star are same, K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)).

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

Alternatively, K1 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * K2

Wait, let me double-check. If K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), then K1 = K2 * (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the ratio:

K1 / K2 = [ (P2 / P1) ) ]^(1/3 )

So, solving for P2/P1:

P2 / P1 = (K1/K2 )^3

Wait, no, let's rederive.

K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)) )

So K = C / P^(1/3), where C is a constant that includes other factors (which are same for both planets in this problem).

So K1 = C / P1^(1/3 )

K2 = C / P2^(1/3 )

Divide K1 by K2:

K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

So P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let's substitute.

Wait, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So, cube both sides:

( K1 / K2 )^3 = P2 / P1

So, P2 = P1 * ( K1 / K2 )^3

Wait, but let's think about the numbers. If K1 is smaller than K2, then K1/K2 is less than 1. So (K1/K2)^3 is even smaller, making P2 smaller than P1. But that depends on how the shifts are given.

Wait, the problem says: Planet #1 was detected from a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 from 7 milliangstroms.

Wait, wait no, no. The problem says: the host of planet #2 was 7 milliangstrom, so that would be K2 =7 milliangstroms. Wait, but wait, the shift is in wavelength, not velocity. So I might have to convert the wavelength shift to velocity.

Wait, the problem gives the shift in wavelength, not velocity. So first, I need to calculate the velocity shift for each, then use those velocities in the K ratio.

Wait, the shift given is in milliangstroms. So, to get the velocity, I need to use the Doppler shift formula. The formula is Δλ/λ = v/c, where Δλ is the shift, and λ is the wavelength.

So, to get velocity v = (Δλ / λ) * c.

But what is λ here? The problem doesn't specify the wavelength of the spectral line. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, perhaps the ratio of velocities depends only on the ratio of the shifts, because the same spectral line is used for both stars. So, for the same line, λ is the same for both. So, the ratio of velocities K1 and K2 is the same as the ratio of their shifts.

Because K1 = (Δλ1/λ) * c

K2 = (Δλ2/λ) * c

So K1/K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 5/7

So, K1 = (5/7) K2

Wait, but earlier I thought K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So, if K1 = (5/7) K2, then:

(5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, no, earlier we had K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, let's go back.

We have K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So, 5/7 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

Cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364

So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? So P2 / P1 ≈ 0.364, which is about 0.36. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1 by a factor of ~0.36. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be 1 / 0.364 ≈ 2.75 times longer? Wait, no, wait. So the question is, "How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then it's 0.364 times as long, so #2's period is shorter. So the question must be how many times shorter? Wait, no, the question says, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then P2 is 0.364 times P1, i.e., P2 is shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is ≈0.36, so the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is #2's period than #1's? It's shorter, so the answer would be less than 1. But looking at the options, option A is ~0.36, which is the ratio P2/P1. So the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. The velocity semi-amplitude K is larger when the planet is closer (because the star's velocity is higher for a closer orbit). So a larger K implies a shorter orbital period. So since K2 is larger than K1 (7 >5 ), that implies P2 is shorter than P1. So P2 is 0.36 times P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer is approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies that \( P \propto K^{-3} \). Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, the ratio of their orbital periods depends only on the ratio of their semi-amplitude velocities \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \). The problem provides the wavelength shifts for the two planets: \( \Delta \lambda_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #1 and \( \Delta \lambda_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #2. 

The velocity semi-amplitudes are proportional to the wavelength shifts because the same spectral line is used for both stars. Thus, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{\Delta \lambda_1}{\Delta \lambda_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Using the relationship \( P \propto K^{-3} \), the ratio of the orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3 = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, planet #2's orbital period is shorter than planet #1's by a factor of approximately 0.36.
