Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, they're talking about the decay of a single atom. Wait, but radioactive decay is a statistical process, right? So even if we know the probability for a certain time, each atom has a certain chance of decaying.

The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance the atom has decayed. That makes me think of the decay law, which is usually modeled with an exponential function. Oh right, the formula is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where N(t) is the number remaining after time t, and λ is the decay constant.

Wait, but the problem is giving me a probability for 100 minutes, which I think relates to the half-life somehow. Or maybe not directly the half-life, but the decay constant. Because the probability of decay relates to the cumulative decay over time.

So, the decay probability P is 1 - N(t)/N0. So P = 1 - e^(-λt). In this case, P is 0.32 when t is 100 minutes. So I can set up the equation:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)

Which simplifies to e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides, I get:

-100λ = ln(0.68)

So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100.

Let me calculate that. Wait, ln(0.68) is negative. Let's see, ln(0.68) ≈ ln(1 - 0.32) ≈ around -0.38566 (I remember ln(2) is about 0.693, and 0.68 is a bit less than 0.7, so maybe around -0.4? Let me check with a calculator. Oh wait, I don't have a calculator, but I can approximate it.)

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute λ first. Let's proceed step by step.

So, λ = ln(1/(1 - 0.32)) / 100? Wait, no. Because 1 - e^(-λ t) = 0.32 → e^(-λ t) = 0.68. So taking the natural log, -λ t = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68)/t → but since t is positive, it's ln(1/0.68)/100.

Wait, 1/0.68 is approximately 1.470588. So ln(1.470588) is about 0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

But wait, maybe I should calculate it precisely. Let me think. But perhaps I can proceed without exact numbers.

So, the question says that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. Now, we want the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, that's a bit tricky. Because the next 150 minutes on top of the previous 50 would make 200 minutes total. Or is it 150 minutes from now?

Wait, the question says: so far, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Oh, so the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes that have already passed. So the total time since the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, the probability from time 50 to 200 (so 150 minutes later) is the question.

But wait, no. Because the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is the same as if it were starting fresh. So even though 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, the probability for the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes for a new atom.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The key here is that the decay process is memoryless, meaning the probability of decay in a future interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed without decay. So, regardless of the time already elapsed, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes from the start.

Wait, but wait a second. If the atom has survived 50 minutes, the probability of decaying between t=50 and t=200 is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from t=0, given that it hasn't decayed yet. Because of the memoryless property, it's like starting fresh at t=50.

So, the probability we're looking for is P = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

We can compute λ using the previous data. From the given, P(100) = 0.32. So:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) → e^(-100λ) = 0.68 → -100λ = ln(0.68) → λ = - ln(0.68) / 100.

Compute ln(0.68). Let me think, I remember that ln(0.5) is about -0.693, ln(0.6) is about -0.5108, ln(0.69) is around -0.371, ln(0.68) is a bit less than that. Maybe around -0.38566? Let me see, perhaps I can use exact value via calculator for better approximation. Alternatively, proceed symbolically.

But perhaps it's better to express the required probability in terms of the known probability.

Wait, let's see. We can express the probability of decay in time t as P(t) = 1 - e^(-λ t).

We know P(100) = 0.32 → e^(-100λ) = 0.68.

We can find λ from that. Then, compute P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ).

But since e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^(1.5) ) → since 150 is 1.5 * 100.

So, e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^(1.5).

Compute that. 0.68^1.5 is the same as sqrt(0.68^3), or perhaps 0.68^(3/2) = sqrt(0.68^3).

Alternatively, calculate 0.68^1.5.

Wait, 0.68^3 is about 0.68 * 0.68 = 0.4624; 0.4624 * 0.68 ≈ 0.314. Then, sqrt(0.314) ≈ 0.56. So, 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.56.

So, e^(-150λ) ≈ 0.56. Therefore, P(150) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 → 44%. So the probability is approximately 44%, which is option A.

Wait, but let me check my math again to make sure. Alternatively, perhaps there's a more precise way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate λ numerically.

Given that e^(-100λ) = 0.68.

Take natural log of both sides → -100λ = ln(0.68).

So λ = - (ln(0.68)) / 100.

Compute ln(0.68):

I think ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566248. So λ ≈ 0.38566248 / 100 = 0.0038566248 per minute.

Now, to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, which is P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Compute λ*150 = 0.0038566248 * 150 ≈ 0.57849372.

So e^(-0.57849372) is approximately what? Let me think. e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488.

Since 0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6, let's approximate it. Let me think of it as 0.5785.

So at x=0.5785, e^-x ≈ approximately 0.562.

Wait, e^-0.5785 ≈ ?

Alternatively, I can compute using a Taylor expansion or linear approximation, but perhaps using a calculator is easier. Alternatively, I can remember that e^-0.58 is approximately 0.560.

So, P(150) = 1 - 0.560 = 0.44, which is 44%. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another approach: since the decay follows an exponential distribution, the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-λ t).

So, the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is equal to [1 - e^(-λ * 200)] - [1 - e^(-λ *50)] = e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200).

Wait, but wait. The probability that the atom decays between time t and t + Δt is P = λ e^(-λ t) Δt, but for a small Δt. But in this case, we're looking for the probability of decay between 50 and 200, so Δt is 150.

Wait, but wait, perhaps my initial approach was correct in that, because of the memoryless property, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes starting from now. So that would be P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ *150) ≈ 44%.

But wait, another approach: let's compute the total time of 200 minutes and the decay probability by 200 minutes.

We know that after 100 minutes, the probability is 32%. So what is the probability after 200 minutes?

Compute λ *200 = (0.0038566248) * 200 = 0.77132496.

So e^(-0.77132496) ≈ e^-0.77 ≈ about 0.462.

So the probability of decay by 200 minutes is 1 - 0.462 = 0.538, or 53.8%.

But the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is the probability it decays by 200 minus the probability it decays by 50.

Wait, what's the probability it decays by 50 minutes?

Compute λ *50 = 0.0038566248 *50 = 0.19283124.

e^(-0.19283124) ≈ approx 0.825.

So the probability of decay by 50 minutes is 1 - 0.825 = 0.175, 17.5%.

So the probability of decay between 50 and 200 is 53.8% (by 200) minus 17.5% (by 50) → 36.3%. But that's not matching with the earlier 44% approach. So which is correct?

Wait, that's conflicting with the initial approach. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the way probabilities are calculated. Let me clarify.

The total probability is 32% at 100 minutes, so decay constant λ is known. Now, the problem is that the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, and we're to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes (i.e., from t=50 to t=200).

So the probability of decaying in that interval is P = P(t<200) - P(t<50), which is [1 - e^(-λ *200)] - [1 - e^(-λ *50)] = e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200).

Wait, let's compute that.

We have λ = ln(1/0.68)/100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Compute e^(-λ *50):

λ *50 = 0.0038566 *50 ≈ 0.19283.

e^(-0.19283) ≈ approx 0.8251.

e^(-λ *200):

λ *200 = 0.77132.

e^(-0.77132) ≈ 0.462.

So P = 0.8251 - 0.462 ≈ 0.3631 → 36.3%.

But that's around 36%, which isn't one of the options. Hmm, but the options given are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%. So this approach gives 36%, which is not present. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was wrong. Because the question is about the probability that the atom decays within the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

So, the correct way is to calculate the conditional probability.

The conditional probability is P(decay between 50 and 200 | not decayed by 50) = [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / [P(not decayed by 50)].

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 is P(decay between 50 and 200) = P(decay by 200) - P(decay by 50). But under the condition that it hasn't decayed by 50, the conditional probability is [P(decay between 50 and 200) ] / [1 - P(decay by 50)].

Wait, let me think again. If the atom hasn't decayed by time 50, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting from time 50.

Which, due to the memoryless property, is the same as P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ*150).

So, using λ as calculated, and compute 1 - e^(-150λ).

Wait, earlier I thought that P(150) is 44%, but using the decay by 200 minus decay by 50, I got 36.3%, which is different. But that approach is incorrect because I forgot that the prior 50 minutes have already passed without decay, so the conditional probability is different.

Wait, no. Because the atom hasn't decayed yet. So the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of it decaying in 150 minutes after time zero, given that it hasn't decayed yet. Because of the exponential distribution's memoryless property.

Wait, but the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed. So for any time s, the probability of decay in the next t minutes is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λ t).

So in this case, regardless of the 50 minutes that have passed, the probability of decaying in the next 150 is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Which brings us back to the initial calculation of about 44%.

But why does the other approach give a different answer? Because that approach was considering the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 as a conditional probability, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's think again.

The memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes, given that it hasn't decayed until now, is equal to 1 - e^(-λ t).

So, the correct approach is to calculate 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Which is what I did initially, giving me approximately 44%.

But why did the other approach where I computed the difference between 200 and 50 give me 36%?

Because that approach didn't take into account the condition that the atom hasn't decayed by 50 minutes. So the correct way is to compute the conditional probability.

Alternatively, the conditional probability approach is:

P(decay between 50 and 200 | not decayed by 50) = [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / [P(not decayed by 50)].

Which would be [ (1 - e^(-λ *200)) - (1 - e^(-λ *50)) ) ] / (e^(-λ *50)).

Wait, that's [ (e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200)) ) ] / e^(-λ *50) = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Which is the same as the memoryless approach. So the two approaches agree. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Let me recompute that.

Compute e^(-λ *150):

We have λ = 0.0038566 per minute.

λ *150 = 0.0038566 *150 ≈ 0.5785.

e^-0.5785 ≈ ?

Let me compute it more accurately.

We can use the Taylor series expansion for e^x around x=0, but since x is negative, maybe it's easier to compute e^0.5785 and then take the reciprocal.

Alternatively, perhaps use a calculator-style approach.

I remember that ln(2) is about 0.6931, so e^0.6931 = 2. So 0.5785 is about 0.1146 less than 0.6931.

So e^0.5785 = e^(0.6931 - 0.1146) = e^0.6931 * e^(-0.1146) = 2 * (1 - 0.1146 + (0.1146^2)/2 - ... )

Wait, this might take too long. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate e^-0.5785.

We know that e^-0.5 = 0.6065, e^-0.6 = 0.5488.

0.5785 is 0.5 + 0.0785.

So, let's model e^(-0.5785) as e^(-0.5) * e^(-0.0785).

e^(-0.0785) ≈ 1 - 0.0785 + (0.0785^2)/2.

Calculating:

0.0785^2 = 0.006162.

So, 1 - 0.0785 = 0.9215, plus 0.006162/2 = 0.003081 → 0.9215 + 0.003081 = 0.924581.

So, e^(-0.0785) ≈ 0.92458.

Then, e^(-0.5785) = e^(-0.5) * e^(-0.0785) ≈ 0.6065 * 0.92458 = ?

0.6065 * 0.92458:

0.6 * 0.92458 = 0.554748.

0.0065 * 0.92458 ≈ 0.006009.

Total is approximately 0.554748 + 0.006009 = 0.560757.

So, e^(-0.5785) ≈ 0.5608.

Thus, P(150) = 1 - 0.5608 ≈ 0.4392 → 43.92%, which is about 44%.

So, the correct answer is 44%, which is option A.

Therefore, the probability is approximately 44%, so the answer is A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential decay law. The probability of decay within a given time is modeled by the formula:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant, and \( t \) is the time elapsed. The problem states that the decay probability is 32% (or 0.32) within 100 minutes. Using this information, we first calculate \( \lambda \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \lambda \)
From the given data:
\[
P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]
Rearranging:
\[
e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68
\]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
-100\lambda = \ln(0.68)
\]
\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]
Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \):
\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute.}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
The question asks for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes starting from time zero.

Using the decay probability formula:
\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]
Substitute \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \):
\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.5785
\]
\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.5785}
\]
Approximating \( e^{-0.5785} \):
\[
e^{-0.5785} \approx 0.5608
\]
Thus:
\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.5608 \approx 0.4392 \, \text{or} \, 43.92\%.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**, which corresponds to option **A**.

Answer: A
