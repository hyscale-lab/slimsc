Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about dissolving Fe(OH)3 with a strong acid. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question says we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 and we want to dissolve it in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required and the pH of the resulting solution.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and can be dissolved by a strong acid. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with H+ ions from the acid. 

Let me write down the reaction. Fe(OH)3 is Fe^3+ and OH^- ions. When it reacts with H+, it should form Fe^3+ and water. So the balanced equation would be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. 

I think that's correct. So the stoichiometry is 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacting with 3 moles of H+. 

Now, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 I have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(16 +1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol.

Given that I have 0.1 grams, moles = mass / molar mass. So 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 moles. Let me compute that exactly: 0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 0.0009358 mol. 

So according to the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 needs 3 moles of H+. So the moles of H+ needed are 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.0028074 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol/L. So the volume needed is moles / concentration. So 0.0028074 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028074 L, which is 28.074 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close. But wait, maybe I should double-check my calculations.

Wait, another thought: Since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, perhaps it's fully soluble once enough H+ is added. So I think the calculation is correct.

But wait, maybe I should consider if Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and if it requires more acid? No, because when you dissolve it, the H+ will react with the OH^- to form water, so that part should be correct.

Wait, but another thing: the solution's total volume is 100 cm³, but the acid's volume might be less. Hmm, when I add the acid, the total volume would be the sum of the solution and the acid. But since the acid volume is small compared to 100 cm³, maybe we can approximate it. But in reality, the concentration is based on the total volume after mixing, but the problem asks for the minimum volume needed
