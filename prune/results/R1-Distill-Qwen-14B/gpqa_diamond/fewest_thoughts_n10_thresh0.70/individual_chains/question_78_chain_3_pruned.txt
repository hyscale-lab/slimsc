Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the potentials in an electromagnetic field generated by a moving charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields, and these are related to the scalar and vector potentials. 

The question gives me a scenario where a point charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and I'm supposed to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a later time t, where t is greater than tr (the time when the field was generated).

So, the setup: The charge's velocity at the time tr is v. The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. I think d would be r minus the position of the charge at time tr. Wait, no, wait. The vector d is from the field generation point to r. So if the charge was at some point at time tr, then d is the vector from that point to r. So d = r - s(tr), I guess.

I recall that the scalar potential V is due to the electric field, and the vector potential A contributes to the magnetic field. But how do these potentials depend on the motion of the charge?

In the static case, when the charge isn't moving, the scalar potential would just be Coulomb's law: V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance between the charge and the point of observation. But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because you also have to consider the magnetic effects.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the potentials at a later time t, which is after the field was generated. So we're dealing with retarded potentials here, I think. Retarded time is when the field observed at a point is due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time. Because the electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light, the field at a later time depends on the state of the charge at an earlier time.

So the expression for the scalar potential V in the case of a moving charge would involve the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time. But let me think about the exact forms.

I remember that the scalar potential due to a charge in motion is given by something like V = (q/(4πε₀)) * ( (1/(r - v t')) ) or something more complicated. Wait, maybe I should think about the expressions for retarded potentials.

The general expression for the scalar potential due to a charge distribution is V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) ∫ [ρ(r', t')]/|r - r'| dτ, where t' is the retarded time, t' = t - |r - r'|/c. But for a point charge, ρ is a delta function, so it simplifies.

Wait, but for a moving charge, maybe the scalar potential isn't just Coulomb's law anymore because the velocity affects it. Or does it? Wait, no, the scalar potential is still due to the charge's presence, but the vector potential comes in due to its motion.

Wait, let's think again. The scalar potential V is given by the solution to Poisson's
