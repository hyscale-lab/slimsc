Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the variance formula, right? So the formula for uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the expectation of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation of P_z. So, ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - (<P_z>)² ).

First, I need to find the expectation values <P_z> and <P_z²>. But wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). 

Wait, the basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is given in the P_z basis. That's important because expectation values can be computed directly using the matrix elements.

So, the state is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. To find <P_z>, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Let me write down the matrix P_z. From the problem, P_z is a 3x3 matrix:
First row: [ħ, 0, 0]
Second row: [0, 0, 0]
Third row: [0, 0, -ħ]

Wait, no. Let me double-check. The matrix components are: first row (hbar, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-hbar). So, P_z is a diagonal matrix with elements ħ, 0, -ħ on the diagonal.

So, since the state is a column vector in this basis, the expectation value <P_z> is the sum of the products of the components of |ψ> with the corresponding diagonal elements of P_z.

Wait, because P_z is diagonal, the expectation value is just the dot product of |ψ> with P_z |ψ>, but in components, it's sum (ψ_i * P_z_ii * ψ_i ), right?

So, let's compute <P_z>. 

The components of |ψ> are:
ψ1 = -1/2
ψ2 = 1/sqrt
