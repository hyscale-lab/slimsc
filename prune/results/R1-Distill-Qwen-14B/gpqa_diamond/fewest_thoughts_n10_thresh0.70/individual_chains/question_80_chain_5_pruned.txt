Okay, so I've got this problem here where an algorithm takes a DNA sequence as input and outputs a number. The examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. My task is to figure out what value the sequence ACAGTGACC would give. The options are A) 315, B) 185, C) 333, D) 351.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck, but let's think through this. So, first, I need to figure out what the algorithm is doing. The inputs are DNA sequences, which are made up of the nucleotides A, T, C, G. Each of these is a single letter, so maybe the algorithm is converting each letter into a number and then doing something with those numbers.

Looking at the first example: AGG. That's three letters. The output is 115, which is a three-digit number. Let's break it down. Maybe each letter corresponds to a digit. Wait, but 115 is three digits. So each of the three letters AGG would become 1, 1, and 5? Hmm, but how?

Wait, maybe each nucleotide is assigned a value, and then those values are summed or concatenated. Let's see what the sum of AGG would be if each letter has a value.

Let me think about possible assignments. Let's consider A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. So for AGG, that would be 1 + 4 + 4 = 9. But the output is 115, which is way bigger. So summing doesn't add up here. Maybe it's not a sum but a product? 1 *4 *4 = 16, still not 115.

Another possibility: perhaps each nucleotide is converted to its position in the alphabet. Wait, A is the 1st letter, T is 20th, C is 3rd, G is 7th. So for AGG, A=1, G=7, G=7. If we concatenate those, it would be 1,7,7 â†’ 177, but the output is 115. Doesn't match.

Wait, maybe each nucleotide is converted into its corresponding numerical value where A=0, T
