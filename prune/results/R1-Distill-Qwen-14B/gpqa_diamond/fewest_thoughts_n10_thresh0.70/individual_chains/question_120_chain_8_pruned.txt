Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed. I need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each a different power law.

Wait, what do I remember about parallax and star distribution? Parallax is inversely related to distance. The formula is plx = 1/distance in parsecs, right? So a larger parallax means a closer star. 

Now, the question is about number density in terms of parallax. So we're looking for the number of stars per unit of parallax. Let me think about how distance and parallax relate. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx.

If the stars are uniformly distributed, that means there's a uniform number per unit volume. So the number density n is a constant. But how does that translate into parallax terms?

I should probably express the volume in terms of distance. Let's say we have a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dr. The volume of that shell would be 4πd² dr. Because the number of stars in that shell would be n multiplied by the volume, which is 4πd² n dr. 

But wait, the question is about the number per unit parallax. So maybe I should express everything in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) d plx. Hmm, because if I take the derivative of d with respect to plx, dd/dplx = -1/(plx²). So dr = -dd/dplx * d plx = (1/plx²) d plx.

Wait, but I'm looking for the number of stars per unit parallax. So I'm considering a small change in plx, d plx, and finding how many stars there are in that range.

The number of stars in a shell with parallax between plx and plx + d plx would be the number of stars per unit volume times the volume. That volume is 4π d² * 4π (d + dr)² ... Wait, no, I think I should model it as a shell at distance d with thickness dr. So for a small dr, the volume is 4π d² dr.

But since d is a function of plx, I can express dr in terms of d plx. Because plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Then dr = - (1/(plx)^2) d plx. Because if plx increases, d decreases. So the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases.

So the volume in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr. But substituting dr from above, which is (1/plx²) d plx. So Volume = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d plx = 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Wait, but I'm looking for the number per unit plx. So the number of stars is n * Volume. So n * 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number per unit plx is n * 4π (1/plx^4) * d plx / d plx. Wait, because d plx is the small increment. So the number per unit plx is 4π n / plx^4.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: the number of stars for a small d plx would be n * Volume, which is n * 4π (d)^2 dr. But since dr is (1/plx²) d plx, substituting:

n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) d plx = 4π n (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx is (4π n) / plx^4. So the number density as a function of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would be option A because it's ~1/plx^4. But wait, I thought I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the differential number of stars. Let me denote the number of stars between plx and plx + d plx as dn. The volume of the shell at distance d = 1/plx with thickness dr is 4π d² dr. And since d plx is related to dr, I can write dr = (dd/d plx) d plx. Since d = 1/plx, dd/d plx = -1/plx^2. So dr = -(1/plx^2) d plx.

Wait, but when plx increases, d decreases, so the shell is at a smaller distance
