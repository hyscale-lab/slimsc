Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. It's about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a bit of a mouthful. I need to figure out the right approach.

Wait, enthalpy of formation, right. I remember that the enthalpy of formation of a compound is the change in enthalpy when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for organic compounds, that usually involves carbon, hydrogen, and sometimes oxygen, but this compound doesn't have oxygen, so it's just C and H here.

The problem gives me some bond energies. Oh, bond energies are the amounts of energy required to break a bond. So to calculate the enthalpy of formation, I think I need to consider the bonds broken in the reactants and the bonds formed in the products.

Wait wait, the standard approach is to calculate the enthalpy change using the bond energies. The formula is: Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies of reactant bonds) - (sum of bond energies of product bonds) multiplied by some factors.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about it differently. For the enthalpy of formation, I'm considering the reaction where the compound is formed from its elements. So for this hydrocarbon, the elements would be carbon (C) and hydrogen (
