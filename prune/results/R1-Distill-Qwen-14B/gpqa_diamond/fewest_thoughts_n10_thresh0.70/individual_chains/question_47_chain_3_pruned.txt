Okay, so I have this problem where I need to identify a compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me see what the options are and how I can match the spectral data to each option.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The strong absorption around 3420 and 3325 cm-1 probably indicates N-H or O-H stretches. Amides usually have N-H stretches in that range. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like an amide or ester. 

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are several signals. The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) is likely a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ethyl group. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) could be an OCH2 group, maybe from an ethyl ester. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) is probably adjacent to the ester group, perhaps the CH2 next to the carbonyl. The aromatic region shows two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each integrating 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring because the two doublets are symmetric. 

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide would have a CONH2 group. The IR would show a strong carbonyl (around 1680 maybe?), but the N-H stretch for amide is around 3300-3500. The NMR would have the ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), so the triplet at 1.2 (3H) and quartet around 4.0 maybe? Wait, the ethoxy group in NMR typically has the CH2 at around 4.1 as a quartet and the OCH2 would split into a quartet. Hmm, but the NMR shows a triplet at 1.2 (so maybe ethyl, as in CH2CH3). Wait, the ethoxy's CH2 would be as a quartet, but in the NMR data, I see a quartet at 4.5 ppm which is likely adjacent to the carbonyl. Maybe that's the OCH2 from the ethoxy. Also, the benzamide structure would have amide protons, but in the NMR, there's no signal around 7-8 ppm for NH, but wait, the aromatic signals are at 7.0 and 8.0. Alternatively, maybe this is substituted.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide would have a CONH group. The IR would show a strong carbonyl, maybe around 1720, which matches. The N-H stretch for formamide is usually a single peak around 3300. The ethoxy group would show as triplet and quartet. The aromatic would be para-substituted, so the doublets make sense. The formamide would have the CH2 from ethoxy as a quartet at around 4.1 or so, but the N
