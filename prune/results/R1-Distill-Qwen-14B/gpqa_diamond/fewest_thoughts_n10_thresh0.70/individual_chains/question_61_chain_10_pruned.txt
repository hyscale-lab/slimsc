Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question involves a series of reactions starting with benzene and going through several transformations to produce a final product, which is one of the four options given.

Let me start by listing each step and figure out what happens in each. 

Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitration is typically done with a nitrating mixture, which is HNO3 and H2SO4. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution here. The nitronium ion is the electrophile. Nitration of benzene usually occurs at the meta position, but wait, wait. Wait, no, benzene when nitrated under standard conditions actually tends to substitute at the meta position if the ring is activated. Wait, no, actually, benzene is a symmetric molecule, so the product is a single isomer, meta-don't apply here because benzene is symmetric. Wait, no, when you nitrate benzene, the product is nitrobenzene, which has a nitro group attached. The nitro group is a meta-directing group. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Wait, but let me think again. Benzene is symmetric, so the nitration gives a single product, nitrobenzene. Correct.

Step 2: Product 1 (nitrobenzene) is treated with Br2 and Fe. Oh, that's a bromination reaction
