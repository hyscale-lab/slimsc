Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by breaking down what's given.

The problem is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting, because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both orbits are circular.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Hmm, that's interesting. So same size but different masses. So the Planet_1's star is more massive but same radius. Wait, but stars with higher mass usually have larger radii, but in this case, they're the same. Maybe Planet_1's star is a bit evolved or something, but the question says Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Oh, wait the problem states that both have same radii, so even though Planet_1's star is more massive, it's not larger in radius. That's a bit counterintuitive, but I'll go with that.

Now, the main point is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the transit probability depends on the orbital parameters. Specifically, the probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to align with our line of sight. So the probability of transit, P, is related to the size of the planet's orbit and the star's size.

Wait, more precisely, the transit probability for a planet is given by the formula P â‰ˆ (R_star / a) * (some factor?), where R_star is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Or is it more about the alignment? Oh right, the geometric probability is proportional to (R_star / a), because the chance that the planet's path intersects our line of sight is based on the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit.

So higher (R_star / a) means higher probability, but wait, higher a would make the ratio smaller
