Okay, so I'm trying to solve this transit probability question. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the distance of the planet's orbit.

Wait, the planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and the host stars have the same radius but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star.

I think the transit probability formula is P = (R_planet / R_star)² * (something else). Wait, no, I think the formula is (R_planet / a) * (1 / sqrt(a² - R_star²)), or maybe that's for another parameter. No, wait, the transit probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (a). Or wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me recall. The transit probability for a planet is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s / a)^2 ) / ( (R_s/a) + ... something else? Or maybe it's just (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned such that we see the transit. Oh, right, the transit probability is also related to the relative sizes of the planet's orbit and the star.

Wait, the geometric probability of a transit is (
