Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that there's an electron in a state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because it's given as proportional, meaning it's not necessarily already normalized. Then, there's an operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij. The rule is that Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. So the matrix is diagonal zero except for off-diagonal elements which are hbar/2.

The question asks for two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator and the average value of the operator. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving probabilities and an average.

Hmm, wait, but wait. The operator's matrix is such that Aij = hbar/2 when i≠j. So for a 2x2 matrix, since |up> and |down> are the basis states (assuming we're dealing with spin-½, so two states), the matrix would look like this:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Because the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix is a 2x2 with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

Wait, but what are the eigenstates of this matrix? Because the problem is asking about the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. So I need to find the eigenstates of matrix A.

So matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Hmm, I remember that for a 2x2 matrix where the off-diagonal elements are non-zero and the diagonal are zero, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation.

The characteristic equation for a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [b, a]] (since the matrix A is symmetric) has eigenvalues (a ± sqrt(a² + b²)) but wait, no. Wait, for a matrix [[0, b],[b, 0]], the eigenvalues are sqrt(b² + 0²) and -sqrt(b²), but that's not right. Wait, wait, the trace is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero. The determinant is (0)(0) - (b)(b) = -b². So the eigenvalues are solutions to lambda^2 - (trace) lambda + determinant = 0, which is lambda^2 - 0 + (-b²) = 0 → lambda² = b² → lambda = ±b.

Wait, so in our case, the matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So b is hbar/2. So eigenvalues are ± (hbar/2).

Wait, but wait. Let me recalculate. The trace is 0, the determinant is (0)(0) - (hbar/2)^2 = -(hbar²/4). So the eigenvalues are sqrt( (0)^2 + (hbar/2)^2 ) ... wait no, wait, for a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]], eigenvalues are (a+d)/2 ± sqrt( ((a-d)/2)^2 + bc ). In our case, a=0, d=0, b=c= hbar/2. So the eigenvalues would be (0)/2 ± sqrt( (0)^2 + (hbar/2)^2 ). Which is 0 ± hbar/2. So the eigenvalues are ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are λ₁= hbar/2 and λ₂= -hbar/2. The eigenstates corresponding to these eigenvalues are the eigenvectors. So let's find them.

For λ = hbar/2: the matrix (A - λ I) is [[-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2]]. The equations are:

- (hbar/2) x + (hbar/2) y = 0 → x = y.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1, 1). Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2, the matrix (A + hbar/2 I) is [[hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2]]. The equations are (hbar/2)x + (hbar/2)y = 0 → x = -y. So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1, -1).

Wait, but perhaps I should normalize these. So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), or something like that. Because to normalize (1,1), the length is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), so the normalized vector is 1/sqrt(2) each component.

Alternatively, maybe the eigenstates are
