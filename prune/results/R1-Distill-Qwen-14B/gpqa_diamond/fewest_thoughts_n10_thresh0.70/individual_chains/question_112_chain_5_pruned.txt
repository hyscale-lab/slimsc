Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix representation has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I should figure out what the operator looks like. The matrix A is 2x2 because the state is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, which are the basis states for spin in the z-direction.

So the matrix A would be:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because when i != j, the elements are hbar/2, and when i=j, it's zero. So it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, the matrix has A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. So the diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So yeah, the matrix is:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

That's a 2x2 matrix. So this operator is actually the Pauli X operator multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and here A is (hbar/2) * X.

Wait, but no, the Pauli matrices usually have 1 and 0, but in this case, A is scaled by hbar/2. So, operator A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

Now, the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are the eigenstates of this operator A. Because if X has eigenstates |+x> and |â€“x>, then A will have the same eigenstates but scaled eigenvalues.

So the eigenstates of A are
