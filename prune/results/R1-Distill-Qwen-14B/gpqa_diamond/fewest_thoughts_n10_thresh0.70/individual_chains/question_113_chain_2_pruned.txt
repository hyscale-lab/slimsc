Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question lists the techniques used: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Each of these gives specific clues about the structure of the compound.

Starting with the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 usually indicates O-H stretching, which is common in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak is more typical of an alcohol, because carboxylic acids have a broader and sometimes more intense absorption, but I'm not too sure. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 peak is characteristic of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, but maybe in a conjugated system or an aromatic ring? Or perhaps it's an ester or amide? Hmm.

Wait, I remember that conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents can cause the carbonyl peak to shift. For example, in a carbonyl adjacent to an aromatic ring, like in acetophenone, the peak is around 1670-1700. So the 1700 could be a ketone, and the 1650 might be another carbonyl group or perhaps something else. Alternatively, the 1650 might not be a carbonyl but something else. Let me think: another possibility is an aromatic ring with C=C stretching, which usually is around 1600-1650 cm^-1. Wait, but the 1700 is a strong peak, so that's probably the carbonyl. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring's C=C stretch.

But wait, the problem says two other strong peaks. Since the broad one is at 3000, which is for O-H, maybe the compound has a hydroxyl group and a carbonyl. But the presence of a carbonyl and O-H suggests maybe a ketone with an alcohol, but that's a bit unusual.
