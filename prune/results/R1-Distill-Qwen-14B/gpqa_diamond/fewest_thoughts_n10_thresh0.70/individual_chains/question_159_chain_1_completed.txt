Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar and its spectrum. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says that observations of a quasar were made in the near infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. Oh wait, I remember something about emission lines and how their observed wavelengths can tell us about the redshift of the object. 

So, the peak at 790 nm is probably from a specific emission line. I think the Lyman alpha emission line is a common one. Oh right, Lyman alpha is usually around 121 nm in the ultraviolet range for hydrogen. But wait, that's the rest wavelength. If the observed wavelength is longer, that means redshift. 

Wait, the peak is at 790 nm. If Lyman alpha is 121 nm rest, then the observed is 790. So the redshift z would be (observed - rest)/rest. Let me calculate that: (790 - 121)/121 = 669 /121 ≈ 5.528. So z is about 5.53. 

But wait, wait. Another possibility is the Balmer series. Like H-alpha is about 656 nm. Oh, but 790 is longer than that, so maybe it's a different line. Alternatively, maybe it's the Lyman break. But I think the Lyman alpha line is the main one. So I'll proceed with z ≈5.5.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar. They give the parameters of the universe as Lambda-CDM model: H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m=0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda=0.7, and it's flat. So I need to find the comoving distance at a=1 (which is the current scale factor, meaning now) for a quasar at redshift z=5.5.

Wait, comoving distance is the distance between two points as the universe expands. For a given redshift z, the comoving distance D_C is the integral of c/H(a) times da/a from a=0 to a=1/(1+z). Wait, no, actually the integral is from a=1/(1+z) to a=1, or maybe the other way around. Wait, more accurately, the comoving distance is given by the integral from a=0 to a=1 of c/H(a) * (1/(a^2 (1+z)))?? Hmm, perhaps I should think about the standard formula.

Wait, the comoving distance is D_C = (c/H0) * ∫(1/(H(a)/H0)) * (da / (1+z(a))) ), but I might be mixing up some terms. Alternatively, the proper formula for comoving distance is D_C = (c / H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) [1/(E(z'))] dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda). 

Wait, that's more accurate. So E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m(1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ). So for a given z, we integrate 1/E(z) from 0 to z, multiplied by c/H0.

So for z=5.5, let's compute that integral. But actually, doing this integral exactly is non-trivial because it doesn't have a simple analytical solution. So I think this would require using an approximation or look-up tables or a calculator.

Wait, but I might remember some approximate comoving distances for certain redshifts. Let me think: at z=1, the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc. At z=2, it's around 6 Gpc. Wait, no, wait. I think I might be confusing proper distance and comoving. Or maybe I should think about the age of the universe or luminosity distance, but perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, I can think about the formula for the comoving distance. The integral would be ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ)} ] dz'

So for a flat universe, Ω_k=0, so E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda).

Given that, let's compute the integral numerically for z=5.5.

But without a calculator, this might be tough. Alternatively, perhaps I can use some standard values or approximate methods.

Wait, another approach: for high z, matter dominated era. But wait, dark energy (cosmological constant) starts to dominate at z ~ 0.5 or so. So for z=5.5, which is high, the universe was matter dominated. Hmm, but with dark energy, it's more complex.

Wait, perhaps I can use the approximation for the comoving distance. The integral can be split into parts where dark energy is significant and where matter dominates. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an online calculator or remember that for z around 5.5, the comoving distance is about 11 billion light-years or so. Wait, 1 Gpc is about 3.26 billion light-years. So 11 Gpc would be about 36 billion ly, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think of some standard values. For example, at z=1, comoving distance is about 1.8 Gpc. At z=2, around 6 Gpc. At z=3, around 11 Gpc. At z=4, around 15 Gpc. At z=5, around 18 Gpc. But wait, that can't be right because the universe isn't that big. Maybe I'm mixing up comoving and other distances.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use an approximation formula. There's an approximation by Padmanabhan that gives the comoving distance D_C in terms of z. The formula is:

D_C = (c / H0) * (2/(1 + sqrt(1 + 16 Ω_m (1+z)^3 / (Ω_Λ (1 + sqrt(1 + 16 Ω_m (1+z)^3 / (Ω_Λ )) )) )) )) )

Wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps for high redshifts, when matter dominates, the comoving distance can be approximated with D_C ≈ (c/H0) * (2/(3 H0)) * (1 + z)^(-3/2) )^{-1} ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I can think of the standard comoving distance for a matter-dominated universe. Without dark energy, Ω_Λ=0, the comoving distance is D_C = (c/H0) * 2 * (1 + z)^(1/2) / sqrt(Ω_m) - 2/sqrt(Ω_m) ) * [ (1 + z)^(3/2) - 1 ] / ( (1 + z)^(3/2) ) ).

Wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should just accept that without exact computation, it's hard, but perhaps I can refer to known approximate values.

Wait, another approach: use the "lookback time" first. The lookback time for a given redshift is the difference between the age of the universe now and the age when the light was emitted. But how does that help with comoving distance?

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up a table of comoving distances for high z. Let me try to think: for z=5.5, using the standard cosmological parameters given (H0=70, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7), what is the comoving distance?

I've heard that for z=5, the comoving distance is approximately 11 Gpc. So at z=5.5, it would be a bit higher, perhaps around 12 Gpc? But wait, the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. Oh wait, maybe I'm off by a factor of 3 or something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier calculations. Let me think again: the observed wavelength is 790 nm. Which emission line is this? Maybe it's not Lyman alpha. Let me think: Lyman alpha is 121 nm, so if the observed wavelength is 790, then the redshift is (790/121)-1 ≈ 6.52, so z≈5.52.

Alternatively, could it be the Balmer series? H-alpha is 656 nm in rest frame. So if observed is 790, z=(790-656)/656 ≈ 134/656≈0.204. That's a much lower redshift. But the flux drops at wavelengths shorter than 790, which would imply that the emission line is around 790. But H-alpha at z=0.2 would mean the quasar is nearby, but the options are in Gpc. 0.2 z would correspond to a comoving distance of about (c/H0) * integral up to z=0.2. Let's think: (c/H0) is about 14 billion light-years (since H0=70, c=3e5 km/s, so c/H0≈ (3e5)/(70) ) Mpc/(km/s) → wait, 1 Mpc is about 3.09e19 km. Wait, perhaps better to compute the value:

H0=70 km/s/Mpc → 1/H0 ≈ 14 Mpc/(km/s). So c is 3e5 km/s → c/H0 ≈ 3e5 *14 ≈ 4.2e6 Mpc. Wait, 1e6 Mpc is 1 Gpc. So 4.2e6 Mpc is 4200 Mpc, which is 4.2 Gpc. That's the value of c/H0.

Wait, but the comoving distance D_C is (c/H0) * ∫0^z [1/E(z')] dz'

So for z=5.5, E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+5.5)^3 +0.7 )

Let me compute E(z=5.5):

(1+5.5)=6.5 → 6.5^3=274.625 → 0.3 * 274.625=82.3875.

0.7 is the dark energy term. So sum is 82.3875+0.7=83.0875.

sqrt(83.0875)≈9.115. So E(z=5.5)=9.115.

Wait, but E(z) changes with z, so to compute the integral you have to take into account how E(z) varies from 0 to z=5.5.

At z=0, E(z)=sqrt(0.3 +0.7)=1.

At z=5.5, E(z)=9.115.

But the integral requires evaluating 1/E(z') across all z' from 0 to 5.5.

So for high z, matter dominated, E(z)=sqrt( (0.3)(1+z)^3 +0.7 ). But when z is large, 0.3*(1+z)^3 dominates over 0.7. So for z=5.5, (1+z)^3=6.5^3=274.625, 0.3*274.625=82.3875. 0.7 is negligible compared to that, so E(z) approx sqrt(82.3875)≈9.115.

But wait, for lower z', dark energy becomes more important. So the integral can be split into two parts: from z=0 to z where matter and dark energy are comparable, and beyond.

The scale where matter and dark energy densities are equal is when (1+z_m)^3 * Ω_m = Ω_lambda → (1+z_m)^3 = Ω_lambda/Ω_m = 0.7/0.3≈2.333 → 1+z_m≈(2.333)^(1/3)=~1.33 → z_m≈0.33. So for z>0.33, matter dominates.

So we can approximate the integral from 0 to 0.33 (where dark energy is significant) and from 0.33 to 5.5 (matter dominated).

So the integral is ∫0^0.33 [1 / sqrt(0.3 (1+z')^3 + 0.7)} ] dz' + ∫0.33^5.5 [1 / sqrt(0.3 (1+z')^3)} ] dz'

The first integral (z=0 to 0.33) can be approximated numerically. Let's compute each part.

First integral part (z=0 to z=0.33):
We can approximate this as roughly 0.33 (since dz' is small) times 1/E_avg, where E_avg is around 1 (since at z=0, E=1, and at z=0.33, E ~ sqrt(0.3*(1.33)^3 +0.7 )= sqrt(0.3*(2.352) +0.7) ) → sqrt(0.7056 +0.7)=sqrt(1.4056)=~1.186. So the average E is around 1.09, so the integral is approximately 0.33 / 1.09 ≈ 0.303.

Wait, but that's a rough approximation. The exact integral might be a bit different, but perhaps around 0.3.

Second integral part (z=0.33 to 5.5):

In this range, matter dominates, so E(z')=sqrt(0.3 (1+z')^3) ) → 1/E(z')=1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^(3/2)) )

So the integral becomes:

∫ [1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^(3/2)) ] dz' from 0.33 to 5.5.

Which is (1/sqrt(0.3)) ∫ (1/(1+z')^(3/2)) dz' from 0.33 to 5.5.

The integral of (1/(1+z)^1.5 ) dz is -2/(1+z)^0.5 + C.

So evaluating from 0.33 to 5.5:

(1/sqrt(0.3)) [ -2/(1+5.5)^0.5 + 2/(1+0.33)^0.5 ]

Compute each term:

1+5.5=6.5 → sqrt(6.5)≈2.55 → 2/2.55≈0.784.

1+0.33=1.33 → sqrt≈1.153 → 2/1.153≈1.734.

So the difference is (0.784 - 1.734 )= -0.95. Multiply by (1/sqrt(0.3)).

sqrt(0.3)=~0.5477 → 1/0.5477≈1.826.

So the second integral is 1.826 * (-0.95 )= -1.734. But since we have the negative in front from the integral, it becomes positive. So the second integral is approximately 1.734.

Wait, wait, maybe I should recheck: the integral is (1/sqrt(0.3)) * [ (2/sqrt(1.33) ) - (2/sqrt(6.5) )) ]

Which is 1.826 * ( (2/1.153) - (2/2.55) )

Compute 2/1.153 ≈1.734, 2/2.55≈0.7843.

So 1.734 -0.7843=0.9497. Multiply by 1.826 → 0.9497 *1.826 ≈ 1.735.

So the second integral is approximately 1.735.

So the total integral is the sum of the two parts: 0.303 (first part) + 1.735 (second part) ≈ 2.038.

So the comoving distance D_C is (c/H0) * 2.038.

What's c/H0? c=3e5 km/s. H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

So c/H0=3e5 /70 ≈4285.7 Mpc. Which is 4.2857 Gpc.

Multiply by 2.038: 4.2857 * 2.038 ≈ let's compute.

4.2857 *2 =8.5714.

0.038 *4.2857≈0.163.

So total is approximately 8.5714 +0.163≈8.734 Gpc.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D)7 Gpc, B)8 Gpc, C)9 Gpc.

Wait, 8.7 Gpc is closer to 9 Gpc? So option C is 9 Gpc.

Wait, but wait. My calculation assumed that the first integral was 0.303, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should do a better approximation for the first part.

Alternative approach for the first integral (z=0 to 0.33):

E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7 )

Let me compute E(z) at several points:

At z=0: E=1.

z=0.1: (1.1)^3=1.331 → 0.3 *1.331=0.3993 +0.7=1.0993 → sqrt≈1.0486.

z=0.2: (1.2)^3=1.728 → 0.3 *1.728=0.5184 +0.7=1.2184 → sqrt≈1.1038.

z=0.33: (1.33)^3≈2.352 → 0.3 *2.352=0.7056 +0.7=1.4056 → sqrt≈1.1856.

So to approximate the integral from 0 to 0.33, maybe use the trapezoidal rule or average E.

We can split into intervals:

From 0 to 0.1: E starts at 1, ends at ~1.0486. So average E ≈ (1 +1.0486)/2=1.0243. So the integral over 0.1 is 0.1 *1.0243 ≈0.1024.

From 0.1 to 0.2: E starts at 1.0486, ends at 1.1038. Average E≈ (1.0486 +1.1038)/2 =1.0762. Integral over 0.1 is 0.1 *1.0762=0.1076.

From 0.2 to 0.33: E starts at 1.1038, ends at 1.1856. The interval is 0.13. Average E ≈ (1.1038 +1.1856)/2 =1.1447. Integral is 0.13 *1.1447 ≈0.1488.

So total first integral is 0.1024 +0.1076 +0.1488≈0.3588.

So with a better approximation, the first integral is ~0.3588.

Second integral earlier was 1.735.

So total integral is 0.3588 +1.735≈2.0938.

Multiply by c/H0=4.2857 Gpc.

So D_C=4.2857 * 2.0938≈ let's compute.

4.2857 *2=8.5714.

4.2857 *0.0938≈0.402.

Total ≈8.5714 +0.402≈8.973 Gpc, which is about 9 Gpc.

So the answer would be option C) 9 Gpc.

But wait, the initial assumption was that the peak is Lyman alpha. What if it's a different line?

Alternative possibility: the peak is in the near-infrared, which for a quasar could be the Paschen-alpha line of hydrogen. Wait, the Paschen series has lines in the infrared. The rest wavelength for Paschen-alpha is about 822 nm. Oh wait, that's close to 790 nm. Hmm, but wait, 822 is rest, so if the observed is 790, that would imply a blueshift? No, that can't be right because quasars are at high z, not blueshifted.

Wait, no. Wait, quasars are at high redshift, so their emission lines are redshifted. So if the rest wavelength is 822 nm, and the observed is 790, which is shorter. That would imply a blueshift, which is impossible. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps it's another line. Let me think: could it be the H-alpha line? H-alpha is 656 nm rest. Observed is 790, which would imply a redshift of (790/656 -1) = (1.204 -1)=0.204. So z≈0.204.

Wait, but that's a much lower redshift. If that's the case, the comoving distance would be much smaller.

Wait, let me compute that. z=0.204.

Compute the comoving distance for z=0.204 with H0=70, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7.

The integral ∫0^0.204 [1/E(z') ] dz', where E(z')=sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7).

Compute E(z') at various intervals.

z'=0: E=1.

z'=0.1: (1.1)^3=1.331. 0.3 *1.331=0.3993 +0.7=1.0993 → sqrt≈1.0486.

z'=0.204: (1.204)^3≈1.754. 0.3 *1.754≈0.526 +0.7=1.226 → sqrt≈1.107.

So approximate the integral using trapezoidal method.

Divide into intervals: 0-0.1, 0.1-0.2, and 0.2-0.204.

Wait, maybe just approximate as linear in these small ranges.

Alternatively, compute the average E over 0-0.204.

Alternatively, approximate the integral as the average of E over the interval, multiplied by 0.204.

The E at 0 is 1, at 0.204 is ~1.107. So average E is (1 +1.107)/2=1.0535.

Integral≈0.204 /1.0535≈0.1936.

Multiply by c/H0=4.2857 Gpc: 0.1936 *4.2857≈0.83 Gpc.

So the comoving distance would be about 0.83 Gpc, which is approximately 0.8 Gpc.

But the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. So this doesn't fit.

So that suggests that perhaps the peak is not H-alpha, but a higher-redshift emission line, like Lyman alpha.

So the initial assumption that it's Lyman alpha with z≈5.5 seems correct, leading to a comoving distance around 9 Gpc.

But wait, wait. Let me think again about the emission line. The peak is in near infrared, which is 790 nm. Let's think about the Lyman series. Lyman series is all UV transitions, so Lyman alpha is 121 nm, Lyman beta 102.6 nm, etc. But if quasar is at high z, their Lyman series would be redshifted into optical or IR.

Wait, 121 nm * (1+z) = observed wavelength.

So for observed 790 nm, (1+z)=790/121≈6.528 → z≈5.528.

So that makes sense.

So back to the first calculation, the comoving distance is around 9 Gpc.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)9 Gpc.

But wait, in the initial calculation when I used the first integral as 0.3588 and second as 1.735, total integral 2.0938. So 4.2857 *2.0938≈8.97 Gpc, which is about 9 Gpc.

So the answer should be option C)9 Gpc.


The question involves determining the comoving distance of a quasar based on its observed spectral features and cosmological parameters. Observations show a peak at 790 nm in the near-infrared spectrum, which is interpreted as the redshifted Lyman alpha emission line of hydrogen. The rest wavelength of Lyman alpha is 121 nm, so the redshift is calculated as:

\[
z = \frac{\text{observed wavelength}}{\text{rest wavelength}} - 1 = \frac{790}{121} - 1 \approx 5.528
\]

The comoving distance \(D_C\) is determined using the cosmological parameters: \(H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc}\), \(\Omega_m = 0.3\), \(\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7\), and a flat universe (\(\Omega_k = 0\)). The formula for \(D_C\) is:

\[
D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}} \, dz'
\]

Here, \(c/H_0 \approx 4.2857 \, \text{Gpc}\). The integral is split into two parts: from \(z = 0\) to \(z = 0.33\) (where dark energy is significant) and from \(z = 0.33\) to \(z = 5.5\) (where matter dominates). For \(z > 0.33\), \(\Omega_m (1+z)^3\) dominates, so \(E(z) = \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z)^3}\), and the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m} (1+z)^{3/2}} \, dz
\]

For \(z = 0.33\) to \(z = 5.5\), the integral evaluates to approximately 1.735. For \(z = 0\) to \(z = 0.33\), the integral is approximated numerically, yielding around 0.3588. Adding these gives a total integral of approximately 2.0938. Multiplying by \(c/H_0\), the comoving distance is:

\[
D_C \approx 4.2857 \times 2.0938 \approx 8.97 \, \text{Gpc}
\]

This rounds to approximately 9 Gpc. The options provided are 6 Gpc, 7 Gpc, 8 Gpc, and 9 Gpc, with the closest match being 9 Gpc. Thus, the comoving distance of the quasar is:
