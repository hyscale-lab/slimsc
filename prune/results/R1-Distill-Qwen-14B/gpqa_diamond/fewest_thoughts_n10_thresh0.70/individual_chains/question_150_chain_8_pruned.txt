Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, molecular formula. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be like a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds plus a ring, so 4 degrees) plus a double bond or ring somewhere else. Or maybe a double bond and a ring. Wait, but 5 is that. So probably a benzene ring and an enal or something similar.

Looking at the NMR data: 
9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a strong signal, so probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, maybe adjacent to a CH2 group.

Next peak: 6.98, doublet, 2H. That looks like aromatic protons, maybe in a para-substituted benzene. Because in para substitution, the protons are usually around 6.8-7.3 ppm and
