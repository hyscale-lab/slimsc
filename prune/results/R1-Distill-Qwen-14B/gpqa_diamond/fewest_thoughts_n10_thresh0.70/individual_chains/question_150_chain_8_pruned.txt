Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. The question involves NMR data and a series of reactions, so I'll need to figure out the structure of the starting compound first and then see what happens when it's reacted with those reagents.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C8H9NO, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So plug in the numbers: (2*8 + 2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 3 rings or 4 double bonds?), a double bond, and a carbonyl group perhaps.

Looking at the NMR data:
9.72 ppm triplet (1H) - that's a high ppm, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm, and a triplet might mean it's coupling with two adjacent protons, maybe on a CH2 group next to it.

6.98 ppm doublet (2H) - aromatic protons, perhaps ortho to a substituent.

6.51 ppm doublet (2H) - again aromatic, maybe para to something.

6.27 ppm broad singlet (2H) - possibly some coupling, maybe some vinyl protons or maybe they're part of an enol structure or something with some exchange happening. Or maybe they're adjacent to an oxygen, like in a diene or a substituted ring.

3.66 ppm doublet (2H) - that's a CH2 group, probably next to an electronegative atom. Maybe an oxygen adjacent, like OCH2 or something in an ether linkage. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 connected to a carbonyl group.

Wait, let me try to sketch a possible structure. Since there's an aldehyde (from the 9.72 triplet), perhaps the compound has a benzaldehyde group. But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm.

Another possibility is that the aldehyde is part of a larger structure, maybe a substituted butyraldehyde or something. Let's think about the substituents.

The NMR shows two doublets around 6.98 and 6.51. That suggests two sets of two aromatic protons each. So maybe it's a para-substituted aromatic ring, with two substituents. Wait, but each doublet is 2H, so maybe two para substituents on a benzene ring. Alternatively, perhaps two different substituents on a benzene ring, each causing their own splitting.

Wait, but 2H each in two doublets... Maybe it's a para-substituted benz
