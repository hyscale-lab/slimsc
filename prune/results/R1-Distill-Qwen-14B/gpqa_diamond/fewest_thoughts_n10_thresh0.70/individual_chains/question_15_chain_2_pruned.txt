Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should prioritize observing that one. Okay, let's break down the information given.

First, both planets are Earth-like. They were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, which probably means their actual masses are the same because RV gives the minimum mass, but without knowing inclinations, maybe? Hmm, but I think for the purpose of transit probability, the mass might not matter directly. Oh wait, the transit probability depends more on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance.

They have circular orbits, which is good because that simplifies things. So, Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2's. That means Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter orbital period usually implies a smaller orbit (closer in). Kepler's third law: P² is proportional to (a³)/(M*), where M* is the star's mass. Wait, but since Planet_1's period is 1/3 of Planet_2's, so P1 = (1/3) P2.

The host stars have the same radii. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Hmm, that's interesting. More massive stars are usually larger, but in this case, they've evolved or something to have the same radius? Or maybe Planet_1's star is a main-sequence star, and Planet_2's is a slightly evolved one but same radius.

Now, the probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula for the transit probability is roughly R_planet / (R_star * a) * (something else? Or wait, the probability is proportional to (R_p / a) / R_star? Or maybe it's (R_p / R_star)^2? Wait, no, the geometric probability is approximately (R_p / a) * (R_p / R_star), but I might be mixing up the terms.

Wait, more accurately, the probability that a planet transits its star from our line of sight is given by:

P ≈ (R_p / R_*)² * (1 / (a / R_* )) )

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is P ≈
