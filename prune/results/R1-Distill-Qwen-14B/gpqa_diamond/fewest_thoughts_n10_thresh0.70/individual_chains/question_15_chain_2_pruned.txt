Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh wait, both have the same mass. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1's period is shorter, meaning it's closer to its star since orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting because normally a more massive star is larger, but here they're evolved or in a different state. So Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but same radii. Maybe Planet_1's host is a main-sequence star, and Planet_2's is a subgiant or something.

Now, transit probability. I think the probability (P) is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2, where R_p is planet radius and R_s is star radius. But wait, that's just the geometric
