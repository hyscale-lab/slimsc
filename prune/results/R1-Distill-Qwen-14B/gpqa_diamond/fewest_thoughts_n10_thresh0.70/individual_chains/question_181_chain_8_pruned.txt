Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but I'll try to remember what I can.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, right, that's the approximate time it takes for light (or neutrinos, since they move at nearly the speed of light) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III branch stopped, the effect on the neutrino flux would be felt here almost immediately, as far as we're concerned.

So the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, right? The main way the Sun produces energy. The pp-I and pp-II branches also contribute, but I think the question specifies that only pp-III stops. So all other reactions, including pp-I and pp-II, and the CNO cycle, are still happening as usual.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? From what I recall, the proton-proton chain has a few steps. The pp-I branch produces a helium-4 nucleus, and the pp-II and pp-III branches involve different paths, maybe leading to boron or other elements. But I think the pp-III branch is a minor contributor compared to the main pp-I and the CNO cycle. Or wait, maybe in the Sun's core, the pp-I branch is dominant, but pp-III is another branch that might contribute a bit.

But in any case, if pp-III stops, what neutrinos does that affect? Solar neutrinos come from different processes. The main ones are the pp chain and the CNO cycle. The pp chain produces Beryllium-7, which then decays into Lithium-7, emitting a neutrino. Wait, no, that's the main pp chain. Alternatively, the CNO cycle produces carbon-13, which decays via electron capture to nitrogen-13, which emits a neutrino. So the CNO neutrinos are higher-energy compared to the pp neutrinos.

Wait, but what about the neutrinos from the different branches of the proton-proton chain? The pp-I branch produces a proton and a positron, and then the pp-II and pp-III might produce different isotopes. Oh right, the pp-II branch leads to the production of Boron-8, which then decays into Be-8 and emits a neutrino. Or wait, I think the Boron-8 decays into Be-8 and a positron, and then Be-8 decays into two He-4 nuclei, emitting two neutrinos in the process. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, let's get this straight. The pp chain: the main pathway is pp-I, which goes through the formation of deuterium. Then, the pp-II and pp-III are other side reactions. The pp-III branch is when two protons and a helium-3 nucleus combine to form boron-8, which then decays into two helium-4 nuclei, emitting two neutrinos. So the pp-III branch is a minor part of the pp chain but contributes to the neutrino flux.

If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of those neutrinos from that branch stops. But the main pp-I and pp-II would continue. Also, the CNO cycle continues unaffected.

So the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). We need to find the ratio of their fluxes, band 1 over band 2.

Wait, what are the typical energies of neutrinos from different processes? The CNO neutrinos are higher energy. I think the pp
