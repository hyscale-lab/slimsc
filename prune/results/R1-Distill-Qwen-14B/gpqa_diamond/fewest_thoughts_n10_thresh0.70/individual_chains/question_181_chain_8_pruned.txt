Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio problem. Hmm, let me think step by step. So the question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops, and we need to find the ratio of neutrino fluxes between two energy bands.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production is mainly through the proton-proton (pp) chain. There are different branches in this chain. The pp-I branch is the dominant one, then there's pp-II and pp-III. Oh wait, the question specifies that only the pp-III branch stops. So other reactions, like pp-I and maybe others, are still happening.

Neutrinos are produced mainly as electron neutrinos in the Sun. The energy of these neutrinos depends on the reaction that produces them. I think the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the main pp-I branch. Because higher energy reactions would emit higher-energy particles, right?

Wait, neutrinos from the pp chain are from the fusion of two protons. So when a proton in the pp-III branch fuses, it releases a positron and two neutrinos, I think. Or wait, no, each beta-plus decay (like in the pp-III branch) produces a neutrino. Oh right, each deuterium burning step releases a neutrino. Or maybe I'm mixing it up. The pp-III branch involves the reaction where a proton captures a deuteron to form helium-3 and emits a positron and a neutrino. So each such reaction would produce one neutrino. Since the
