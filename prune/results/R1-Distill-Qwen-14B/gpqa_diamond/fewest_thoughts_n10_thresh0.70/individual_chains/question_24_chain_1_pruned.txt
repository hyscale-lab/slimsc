Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

So, the problem starts with an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. These liquids can decolorize bromine water. Hmm, I remember that substances which decolorize bromine water are usually alkenes or maybe something else with unsaturated bonds. Since it's a mixture of two liquids, they're probably different alkenes or something similar.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum (Pt) when heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. And Y is also an equimolar mixture of two other liquids. The key point here is that Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Wait, so if X had compounds that could decolorize bromine, Y's compounds can't. That suggests that the reaction might be hydrogenation. Because if you hydrogenate alkenes, you get alkanes, which don't have the double bonds to react with bromine. But wait, the question says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, Y is formed. So, maybe the process is a hydrogenation step, but wait, the question says that it's a disproportionation reaction. Oh, wait, the question says it's a result of a disproportionation. Hmm, so maybe the reaction isn't hydrogenation but instead a reaction where a molecule splits into two different molecules, one acting as oxidizing agent and the other as reducing agent.

Wait, but the problem says that when hydrogenated (under severe conditions), both X and Y give the same substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%. Let me calculate the percentage. So, 14.28% is approximately 1/7, since 1/7 is about 14.29%. So, the hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%. Let me find out what that implies about the molecular formula.

The mass fraction of H is 14.28%, which is roughly 1/7. So, the rest, 85.72%, is carbon. For a hydrocarbon, Z has the formula CnHm. The mass of H is (m * 1)/(12n + m) * 100 = 14.28%.

Let me approximate 14.2
