Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume that stars are uniformly distributed. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax angle is inversely proportional to distance, right? So the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the formula is distance d ≈ 1/plx, where plx is the parallax in parsecs. So as parallax increases, the distance decreases.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I think they're asking how the number of stars in a certain parallax range (like between plx and plx + dplx) depends on plx. 

If stars are uniformly distributed, it means that the number density is the same throughout space. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. But here, we're looking at how the number per unit parallax (plx) changes with plx.

Let me think about this. Parallax plx is related to distance d. Since plx is in parsecs, plx = 1/d. Wait, no, plx is in arcseconds, and d is in parsecs, and plx = 1/d. So as d increases, plx decreases.

So for a given range of plx, we can find the corresponding range of distances. Let's say plx is p, and we have a small change dp in plx. The corresponding change in distance would be from d = 1/p to d = 1/(p + dp). Hmm, wait, because as p increases, d decreases. So the distance range for a small dp would be from 1/(p+dp) to 1/p, but I'm not sure if I'm getting that right. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of d.

Wait, maybe I should express the number of stars in a thin shell between distances d and d + dd. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in such a shell would be proportional to the volume of the shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4π r² dr, where r is the radius (distance) and dr is the thickness. So the number of stars would be N = n * 4π r² dr, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But in terms of parallax,
