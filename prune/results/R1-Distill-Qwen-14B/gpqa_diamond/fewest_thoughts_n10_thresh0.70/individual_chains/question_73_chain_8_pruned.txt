Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I can't just add them normally because of special relativity. Oh right, Einstein's velocity addition formula comes into play here.

Wait, the problem states their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c. Both are moving in the positive x-direction. So astronaut A is 2m mass moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is 3m moving at 0.5c. But wait, no, actually, the question doesn't specify which is which, but the problem is about their relative speed. Oh right, relative speed in special relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the speeds.

So the first part is to find the relative speed. The formula for relative velocity in special relativity when two objects are moving along the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²). Wait, wait, actually, let me think again. If object A is moving at u and object B at v, then the relative speed of A with respect to B is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). But wait, which way are they moving? Oh, since both are in the positive x-direction, does that matter? Let me clarify. Suppose I'm sitting in the rest frame of astronaut B. Then I want to find the speed of astronaut A relative to me.

So u is the speed of A in the lab frame (0.6c), and v is the speed of B (0.5c). So the relative speed would be (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Plugging in the numbers: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c*0.5c)/c²). That simplifies to 0.1c / (1 - (0.3c²)/c²).

Wait, 0.6c * 0.5c = 0.3c². So the denominator becomes 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.142857c.
