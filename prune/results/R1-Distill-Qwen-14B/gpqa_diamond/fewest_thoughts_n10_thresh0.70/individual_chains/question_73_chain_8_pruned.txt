Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says there are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c. The second has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but relative to what? Oh, I guess each is moving at that speed relative to some inertial frame, maybe the same frame. Because the question is about their relative speed, so I'll need to consider how to compute that.

Wait, relative speed in special relativity isn't just simply subtracting the two speeds because when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't use the classical velocity addition formula. Right, the formula is different because of time dilation and length contraction effects.

The formula for relative velocity in relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Wait, wait. Wait, no, the formula for the relative velocity when two objects are moving at velocities u and v relative to the same frame. So if one is moving at u and the other at v in the same direction, the relative speed of the second from the first's frame is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. If we have two objects, A and B, each moving at velocities u and v relative to a rest frame S. We want to find the speed of B as seen from A's frame, or vice versa. The formula for that is something like (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Because when you switch frames, you apply the Lorentz transformation.

So in this case, both astronauts are moving in the same direction, so their speeds are in the same direction. Let me get their velocities correctly. The first astronaut (A) is moving at u = 0.6c, and the second (B) is moving at v = 0.5c. Wait, but wait, the problem says their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. So perhaps I should calculate the relative speed of B from A's perspective.
