Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, wait, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinities that pop up in calculations. These infinities can't be physical, so you need a way to handle them. Regularization introduces a temporary "cutoff" to make the integrals finite, and then you remove it later, hoping the results don't depend too much on the cutoff.

So, which theories require regularization? I think Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) does. Because in QED, calculations like loop diagrams can lead to divergent terms. For example, the electron self-energy diagram has a divergence. People like Feynman and Dyson worked on handling these with renormalization, which relies on regularization. So QED definitely needs regularization.

What about Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)? Well, QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's also a quantum field theory with loops and such. But wait, QCD is asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or equivalently, short distances), the coupling constant becomes small. That suggests it's perturbatively manageable at high energies. But do you still need regularization? Because even with asymptotic freedom, when you calculate loop diagrams, you might still get divergences that need to be handled. So I think QCD does require regularization techniques, maybe even more because of things like confinement and dealing with non-perturbative effects, but perhaps in perturbative calculations, yes, regularization is needed.

Superstring Theory. Oh right, string theory is an attempt to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. In string theory, particles are not point particles but strings. One advantage string theory claims is that it doesn't have the same kind of divergences as in quantum field theory. Wait, but I think that's only in certain limits or when considering certain aspects. Or perhaps because string theory is a theory of quantized gravity, it handles high energies more gracefully. Oh wait, in string theory, the fundamental objects have higher dimensions and interactions are different. So maybe the divergences that occur in point particle theories (like QED loops) don't happen the same way. But I'm not sure. I remember that in superstring theory, the high-energy behavior is better controlled because the string length provides a natural cutoff. So perhaps superstring theory doesn't require the same kind of regularization as QFT does because the theory's structure already manages the divergences. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization.

Wait, but wait. Do any of the theories not require regularization? The question is which one "never" requires it. So if a theory doesn't have divergences that need regularization, that would be the answer.

Another option is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, but classical theories don't really have the same issues as quantum ones. In classical ED, you can have issues like the infinite self-energy of a charged point particle, which is why people came
