Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The scenario is that I've got a small peptidic compound that's chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly like what I expected, except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, so it's not like they're each 0.5H or anything. The coupling pattern also rules out spin-spin coupling, which means it's not splitting due to neighboring protons. So, what else could cause duplicate peaks?

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass as expected. Hmm, so same mass, same retention time? Or wait, same mass but maybe different RT? No, the question says both have same mass spectrum as the expected molecule. So same mass, maybe same retention time, but two peaks. So what does that mean?

Well, let's think about possible causes. The options are A to D.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If the crude compound has some starting material or a previous step's product (like a precursor), then the NMR would have more peaks, but the mass spec would show different masses, right? Because the precursor would have a lower mass. But here, both LC-MS peaks have the same mass as the expected product. So that might not fit. Unless the precursor is somehow the same mass? Unlikely, since it's a precursor. So maybe A isn't the right answer.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so LC-MS would show one peak if it's a racemic mixture because the columns are usually achiral, so they might not separate enantiomers. Wait, but sometimes chiral columns can separate them, but the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks of same intensity. Wait, but in an achiral column, enantiomers would co-elute, so same RT. So if the peaks are same RT and same mass, would you see two peaks? Or would they just appear as one? Hmm, depends on the setup. But if they are on a chiral column, which is sometimes used, but the question says that the LC-MS peaks are clearly defined and same intensity. Wait, for a racemic mixture, if the column is chiral, it would separate them into two peaks of equal area. So the mass would be same, but two peaks. That could fit. But then the NMR would show something else. Because enantiomers have identical NMR spectra except for maybe in chiral environments, but the issue here is the same alpha-proton giving two peaks. Enantiomers would have same environment, so same NMR shifts. So why two peaks? Unless it's something else.

Wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. So, same shift? Or similar shifts. The peaks have similar chemical shifts and integrals adding to 1H. So if it's a diastereomer, maybe. Because
