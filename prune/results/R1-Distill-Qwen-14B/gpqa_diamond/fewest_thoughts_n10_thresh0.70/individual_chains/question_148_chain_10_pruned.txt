Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully and try to understand what's going on.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with some element Y. There are five such compounds. The substances A1 through A5 are all binary compounds, I think. Let's break down the information given.

First, substance A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 20°C) into A2 and fluorine gas. So the decomposition reaction would be something like A1 → A2 + F2. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so being oxidized means it's acting as a reducing agent. So A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. Hmm, what compounds of fluorine are strong oxidizing agents and decompose into F2?

Wait, I'm thinking about fluorine compounds. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent itself, but here we're talking about binary compounds with Y. So possible Y could be something like iodine, since I know that certain iodine-fluorine compounds are known.

Also, A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So A3 is YF_x, perhaps. Let's think about fluorinating element Y. If Y is iodine, then A3 could be IF, IF3, IF5, or IF7. I'm not sure yet.

Then, when adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4, we get A5. A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. So when A5 is in water, it breaks down into two products. Common examples of such decomposition could be things like acid and another compound, or something else.

Let me think about each part.

Starting with A1: It's bright red and decomposes into A2 (with ωF=31.96%) and F2. So the formula of A2 must have a fluorine content of about 31.96%. Let me compute what that could be. The molecular weight of F is about 19 g/mol. So if the percentage is 31.96%, let's find the formula.

Assume A2 is YF_x. The mass percent of F is (19x)/(M) * 100 = 31.96%, where M is the molecular weight of A2.

Looking for x such that 19x / (M) ≈ 0.3196. Also, M must be an integer.

Let me try x=3: 19*3=57. So 57/M=0.3196 → M ≈57/0.3196 ≈ 178.4. Hmm, that would be for x=3. Wait, but 178 is a possible molecular weight. Let's see if 19x/(Y's atomic weight +19x) = 0.3196.

Wait, alternatively, let's compute M as (19x)/0.3196.

For x=3: 57 / 0.3196 ≈ 178.4. So M≈178. So the formula would be YF3. Then the molecular weight of Y would be 178 - (3*19) = 178-57=121. So Y would have an atomic weight of about 121. What element has an atomic weight near 121? Iodine is about 126.9. Close enough. So Y is iodine.

So A2 is IF3. Let me check the fluorine percentage in IF3. I is 126.9, F is 19 each. So 3*19=57. (57)/(126.9+57) =57/183.9≈0.310 → that's 31%, which is close to 31.96%. Hmm, maybe IF5? Let me see.

Wait, in the question, it's 31.96%, which is roughly 32%. Let me compute for x=5.

x=5: 5*19=95. So M = 95/(0.3196) ≈ 297.5. That's way higher. Maybe Y is another element. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different.

Wait, another approach. Let me suppose that
