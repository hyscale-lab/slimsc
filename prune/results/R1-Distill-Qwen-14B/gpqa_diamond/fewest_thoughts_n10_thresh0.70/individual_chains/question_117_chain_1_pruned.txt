Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism, right? That's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, leading to different physical properties like how they rotate plane-polarized light. So, the key is whether a molecule has a chiral center or some kind of stereogenic element.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to figure out which ones exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl structures can sometimes have axial chirality. Oh right, biphenyls can have a kind of twist where the two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond, allowing them to rotate. If the substituents are in such a way that they can't be superimposed on their mirror image, then it's chiral. So, here there are nitro groups at 6,6' and carboxylate groups at 2,2'. Let me visualize that. The substituents on each ring are in positions that might make the molecule chiral. So I think this compound has axial chirality, leading to optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The formula is CH3CO-O-CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-O-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

Wait, no. Let me think. The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is HOCH2CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2COOH, right? No, wait, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So it's CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is:

      O
      ||
O-C-O-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

Wait, perhaps I should draw this mentally. The central carbon (carbon 2) has a hydroxyl group, a methyl group, a carbonyl group (from the ester), and a single bond to another carbon. Wait, so the structure is:

The ester group is OMe attached to the carbonyl, which is attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to another CH3.

Wait, wait, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to a CH(OH)CH2CH3?

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again. The formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The propanoate part is the ester. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the carbonyl is on the first carbon, then the second has the hydroxyl and a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's like this:

The ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to a CH2CH(OH)CH3 group? No, wait, wait. No, the propanoate has three carbons. So the ester is R-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? Hmm, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's:

The ester is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the former alpha carbon) has four different groups: the hydroxyl, a methyl, the carbonyl group (from the ester), and the adjacent CH3? Wait, no. Let me count. The structure is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3
Carbon 2: connected to Carbon 1, and has OH, and another CH3.
So, the groups on Carbon 2 are: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and the adjacent Carbon 3 (which is a methyl)? Wait, no, if it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: C(OH) connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon
