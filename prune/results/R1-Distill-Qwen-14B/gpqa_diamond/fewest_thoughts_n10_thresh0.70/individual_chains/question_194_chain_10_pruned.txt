Okay, so I've got this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says we have three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We need to find the partition function Z. The options are given, so maybe I can compute Z and match it to one of them.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). Each state corresponds to a particular combination of S1, S2, S3. Since each spin has two options, the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. So I need to list all possible states and compute E for each, then sum up the exponentials.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to group the states based on their energies. Let me think about the structure of E. The energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So it's a function of the products of the spins.

Each term S_i S_j is either +1 (if S_i and S_j are the same) or -1 (if different). So each S_i S_j contributes either 1 or -1. So each of the three terms in the sum can be +1 or -1. Let me calculate the sum inside the brackets.

Wait, but for three spins, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can take different values depending on the configuration. Let me think about all possible cases.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the possible values of the expression H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's compute H for all possible spin configurations.

Each spin is either +1 or -1. So let's enumerate all possible 8 states:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   H = (1)(
