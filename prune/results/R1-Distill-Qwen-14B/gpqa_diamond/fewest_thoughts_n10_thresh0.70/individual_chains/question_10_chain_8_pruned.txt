Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to find out which one has the highest density. Let me think about what I remember from my classes.

The question gives four options, a to d, each describing a planet with certain characteristics. The options are labeled A to D, which I think correspond to the choices a to d. Wait, actually, no, the options are the choices, so each letter A-D is an option that refers to one of the a-d choices. Wait, the question is a bit confusing, but I'll manage.

So, the question is: Which exoplanet has the highest density? Let me go through each option.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. I think Earth's density is pretty high because it's a rocky planet, unlike gas giants which are less dense.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, that's the same density as Earth but more mass. But wait, density is mass over volume. If the mass is higher, but the density is the same, that implies the radius must have increased to accommodate the extra mass without changing the density. So maybe this planet is larger than Earth but same density. So, its density is the same as Earth, so not higher than Earth.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Oh, so if it's the same composition, then the density would be the same as Earth. Because density depends on the material it's made of. So if it's 5 times more massive, but same density, that would mean a larger radius. So its density is same as Earth, so not higher. So this planet's density is 5.5, same as Earth.

Option d: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition, same density as Earth. So same 5.5 g/cm³. So all of these, a, c, and d (maybe) have the same density as Earth, but let me check.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read them again.

Option a: Earth mass and radius. So Earth's density is 5.5. So a's density is 5.5.

Option b:
