Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement and some other reactions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has two parts. The first is a reaction involving BuLi and H+, and the second is a Cope rearrangement with heat. Let me tackle them one by one.

Starting with the first reaction:

The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw that structure. So, benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an OCH2 group, where the O is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Let me break that down. The butenyl group is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but with a methyl on carbon 3. Wait, no, the numbering might be different.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Let me number from the point of attachment. The substituent is a 1-yl group, so the but-2-en-1-yl is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2- but wait, that's but-1-en-1-yl. Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with the double bond at position 2. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as:

The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)-oxy-methyl. So the structure is:

O
|
OCH2- attached to benzene.

Wait, no. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So it's OCH2-O- where the O is connected to the butenyl group.

Wait, maybe it's more like:

Ph-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Let me think again. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the structure is:

The benzene ring has a substituent that is OCH2- connected to a butenyl group.

The butenyl group is but-2-en-1-yl, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about two different reactions, and I need to pick the major products from the options given. Let's see.

The first reaction is with ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene, and it's treated with BuLi followed by H+. The second reaction is a Cope rearrangement of a more complex molecule under heat.

Starting with the first reaction. The compound given is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw this out. Benzene ring with a substituent attached. The substituent is a (oxy)methyl group linked to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Wait, actually, the structure is:

O
|
O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2 ?

Wait, no. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. So the substituent is an oxygen connected to methyl (from the benzene), and that methyl is connected to the 3-methylbut-2-enyl group. So the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2 ?

Wait, no, but the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. Wait, so the main chain is but-2-en-1-yl, which is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. But wait, 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So if the substituent is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl, then the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. So the but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-, so substituting a methyl on the third carbon makes it CH2=CHCH(CH3)-. So the substituent is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-.

Wait, but the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the benzene is connected to an OCH2 group, and that OCH2 is connected to the butenyl group. So structure is:

Benzene-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2 ?

No, wait, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. So the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, the substituent is OCH2 connected to the 3-methylbut-2-enyl group. So the structure is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? But wait, the butenyl group is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. So the structure is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? But that seems off because the double bond is between C2 and C3.

Wait, the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? But wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. Hmm, maybe I should number the carbons. For but-2-en-1-yl, the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the substituent starts at C1. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-. But wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Or CH2=CHCH2CH2- with the substituent at the first carbon?

Wait, maybe it's easier to write it as CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-
