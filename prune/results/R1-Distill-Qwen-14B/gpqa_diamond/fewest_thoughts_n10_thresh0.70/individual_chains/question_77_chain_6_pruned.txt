Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement and some other reactions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has two parts. The first is a reaction involving BuLi and H+, and the second is a Cope rearrangement with heat. Let me tackle them one by one.

Starting with the first reaction:

The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw that structure. So, benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an OCH2 group, where the O is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Let me break that down. The butenyl group is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but with a methyl on carbon 3. Wait, no, the numbering might be different.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Let me number from the point of attachment. The substituent is a 1-yl group, so the but-2-en-1-yl is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2- but wait, that's but-1-en-1-yl. Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with the double bond at position 2. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as:

The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)-oxy-methyl. So the structure is:

O
|
OCH2- attached to benzene.

Wait, no. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So it's OCH2-O- where the O is connected to the butenyl group.

Wait, maybe it's more like:

Ph-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Let me think again. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the structure is:

The benzene ring has a substituent that is OCH2- connected to a butenyl group.

The butenyl group is but-2-en-1-yl, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-.
