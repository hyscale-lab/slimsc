Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec. I need to figure out the molecular formula from these. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. Let me break down each piece of data.

First, the FTIR. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Oh wait, that's usually an O-H stretch. Broad peaks in IR often indicate hydrogen bonding, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, another part of the IR says strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. So what gives those? The 1700 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation, or maybe an amide. But since the options don't have nitrogen, probably not amide. So maybe a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an ester? Or perhaps the 1700 is an ester or ketone, and 1650 is an aromatic ring. Wait, benzene rings have absorption around 1600, but that's usually a strong peak. Wait, but 1650 is a bit higher. Maybe it's something else.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those in double bonds, like CH₂=CH-. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe an alkene. So that suggests some unsaturation.

Mass Spec has a fragment at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about possible fragments. The molecular ion would break into parts. For example, if the compound is something like an ester, maybe the fragment is from the cleavage of the ester group. Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2CO+, which is a ketene ion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, 45 could correspond to a fragment like CH3COO- or something else. Wait, 45 is more likely from a smaller fragment. Another possibility is that 45 is the molecular ion of a smaller molecule, maybe CH3CH2OH (ethanol) which is 46, but that's not 45. Oh wait, 45 could be from (CH3)2CO, which is 58. No, wait, maybe something else. If the molecular formula is C6H12O2, let's calculate the molecular weight: 6*12 +12 + 16*2 = 72 +12 +32 = 116. So if a fragment is 45, it's a part of that. Alternatively, if the formula is C6H10O2, molecular weight is 6*12 +10 +32 = 72 +10 +32=114. Hmm.

Let me think about each option and their possible IR and NMR data.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures could be esters, maybe. Esters have both a carbonyl (1700 cm-1) and an O-H stretch if it's an ester with an alcohol? Wait, no, esters are O-H free. Oh wait, maybe it's a diol with a carbonyl? Or a hemiacetal? Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the
