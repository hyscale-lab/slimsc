Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula for an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's see what I've learned and how to apply it here.

The question mentions that the compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. Hmm.

Starting with the FTIR data: there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in the IR usually indicate O-H stretches. A broad peak is typical for alcohols (which have an -OH group) or maybe carboxylic acids, but carboxylic acids usually have a very strong and broad O-H stretch. Wait, but another possibility is an alcoholic O-H. But wait, there's also two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 

The 1700 cm⁻¹ region is often where carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, esters, etc.) show up. The 1650 might be an aromatic ring (like conjugated double bonds, maybe C=C stretching) or another carbonyl group, perhaps. Or maybe an amide? But since the options don't include nitrogen, maybe it's something else.

Wait, combining the two carbonyl peaks: 1700 and 1650. That makes me think of esters or maybe conjugated carbonyl groups. For instance, if there's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester or ketone. Or perhaps a ketone and an ester group in the molecule. Or maybe a carbonyl and an aromatic ring, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the NMR data: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the molecule probably has a double bond, maybe conjugated with the carbonyl group. That could explain the 1650 cm-1 peak as the C=C stretch.

Now, the Mass Spectrometry (MS) data: a fragment peak at m/z 45. What's that? Common fragments include things like CH3O+ (which is 31), but 45 is higher. Maybe C3H7+ or something else. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, which is 45 (since 12*2 + 1*6 + 16= 24+6+16=46? Wait, no. Wait, 2 carbons: (CH3)2O would be (12*2) + (6) +16 =24 +6+16=46. Hmm, that's not 45. Oh, maybe it's another fragment. Let me think, maybe a ketene ion or something else.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment at 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+),
