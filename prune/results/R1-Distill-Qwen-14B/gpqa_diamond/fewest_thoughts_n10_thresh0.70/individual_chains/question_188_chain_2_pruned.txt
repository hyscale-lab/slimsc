Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral structures have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 angstroms. Wait, wait, interatomic distance—that's the distance between neighboring atoms along the lattice, so that's the lattice parameter 'a' in a cubic system. But in a rhombohedral structure, is it still 'a' or is it different? Maybe I should think about the unit cell.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh, right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent crystal planes. I think the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a/(√(h² + k² + l²)) multiplied by some factor involving the angles, because in non-cubic systems, the interplanar distance isn't just simply a over the square root of the sum of squares. Wait, no, wait. For a general crystal system, especially non-cubic, the formula is more complex.

Wait, in a cubic system, the interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But for a rhombohedral system, which is a special case of a hexagonal or other crystal system, perhaps it's a bit different. Alternatively, maybe the formula still applies but with a correction based on the angles.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The interplanar distance formula for a crystal with lattice parameter a and angles between axes is given by the general formula: 

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) ) * [1 + 2cos α cos β cos γ - cos² α - cos² β - cos² gamma ] 

Wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, the formula is similar, but with the angles. Let me think. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me recall: in a rhombohedral system, the three lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, so a = b = c. And the angles between them are all equal too, alpha = beta = gamma.

So the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system is (I think):

d = [ (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) + ... ) ]^-1/2 

Wait, no. I'm not getting it right. Another approach: perhaps using the Miller indices (hkl), the interplanar distance is given by:

d = [ (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) ) / (a^2) ]^-1/2 

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, since a = b = c, and all angles are equal, perhaps we can substitute. Let me see.

Alternatively, I remember there's a formula specifically for rhombohedral systems. Let me try to recall. Oh wait, another way: the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = a
