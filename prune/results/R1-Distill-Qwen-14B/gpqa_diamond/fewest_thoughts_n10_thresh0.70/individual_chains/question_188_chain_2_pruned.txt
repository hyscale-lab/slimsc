Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral structure has all sides equal and all angles equal, so it's like a cube that's been skewed a bit. The question gives the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. The problem is to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance... I think that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. Oh right, usually calculated using the formula from X-ray diffraction, which is d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos(alpha) - 2ln cos(beta) - 2mn cos(gamma))), but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again. Oh wait! The formula I'm thinking of is for the interplanar spacing in a general crystal system. For a cubic system, it's simpler, but rhombohedral is a bit more complex.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, since all a, b, c are equal and all angles are equal, perhaps the formula simplifies. Let me recall. The general formula for interplanar distance (d) is d = (a)/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (h k (cos α + cos β + cos γ)) )) ), but I'm not confident. Wait, I think the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d(hkl) = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) )

Wait, no, maybe I have it wrong. Alternatively, another approach is using the metric tensor. Because in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, say 'a', and angles alpha, beta, gamma are all the same, say θ. So the metric tensor would be:

[ a²         a² cosθ      a² cosθ      ]
[ a² cosθ    a²           a² cosθ      ]
[ a² cosθ    a² cosθ      a²           ]
