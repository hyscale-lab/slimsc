Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets in a system with five exoplanets. They found these using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I'm not too sure about that, but maybe it's not super important for solving the problem.

So, the planets are in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They're labeled Planet_1 through Planet_5. The planets have the same albedo, so that factor won't affect the temperature ratio. The question is asking for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. 

I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula is something like T = [(L/(16πσ))*(1 - A)/(d²)]^(1/4), where L is luminosity, A is albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the distance. But since all the planets have the same albedo, A is the same for both, so it cancels out in the ratio. Also, since we're comparing two planets in the same system, the star's luminosity is the same. So the ratio of their temperatures should depend on the square root of the inverse ratio of their distances squared. Wait, let me think.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature equation is T ∝ (L/(16πσ))^(1/4) * (1 - A)^(1/4) / d^(1/2). Because L, σ, and A are constants for this comparison, the temperature ratio T4/T2 will be sqrt(d2/d4), because d is in the denominator, so when you take the ratio, it becomes (d2/d4)^(1/2). 

Wait, no, wait. Let's correct that. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ (L (1-A) ) / (16 π σ d²) ) ]^(1/4)

So, when taking the ratio of T4 to T2, it's:

T4 / T2 = [ (d2²) / (d4²) ) ]^(1/4)

Which simplifies to (
