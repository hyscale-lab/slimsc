Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy measure for a Schrödinger cat state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2alpha^2)). The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Wait, what's a Schrödinger cat state again? Oh right, it's a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian states, right? So when you create a superposition of them, the state becomes non-Gaussian. Non-Gaussianity measures how non-classical the state is, often used in quantum optics.

The problem is asking for the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is that of a reference Gaussian state.

I remember that the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (RNG) is calculated as the difference in quantum mutual information between the state and a Gaussian state. Alternatively, it's the relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Oh right, the relative entropy measure is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the state and the reference Gaussian state. So we're comparing the state rho to a Gaussian state tau.

But wait, how do I find tau? Because the reference Gaussian state could be the thermal state or maybe a specific Gaussian state. Hmm, I think for a single mode, the reference Gaussian state is often the squeezed vacuum or maybe the coherent state. Or perhaps it's the maximum entropy Gaussian state that matches the first and second moments of rho.

Wait, but in this case, the state |psi> is a cat state. Coherent states are Gaussian, so their superpositions are non-Gaussian.

Wait, when you have a superposition of two coherent states, the density matrix would be |psi><psi|, which is the outer product. So rho is a pure state, but non-Gaussian.

The reference Gaussian state tau is probably the closest Gaussian state to rho. Because the relative entropy is minimized when comparing to the closest Gaussian state. So for a given state, the non-Gaussianity would be the relative entropy between rho and the best Gaussian approximation tau.

Alternatively, I think the reference Gaussian state tau might be the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. For a single mode, the first moment is the expectation value of the annihilation operator a, and the second moment might involve the variance.

Wait, for a single mode, the density matrix of a Gaussian state is completely determined by its first and second moments. So if rho is our non-Gaussian state, then the Gaussian state tau that is the best approximation would match the first and second moments of rho.

So I need to compute the first and second moments of rho, then
