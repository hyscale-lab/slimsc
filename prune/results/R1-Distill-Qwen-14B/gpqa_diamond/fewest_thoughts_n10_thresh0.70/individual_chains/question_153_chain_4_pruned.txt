Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, forming an enolate intermediate. Right, and the product is a conjugate addition, meaning the nucleophile adds to the beta carbon.

Looking at the first reaction: dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH to give product A. So, I need to figure out what A is. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diester and a strong electron-withdrawing group. Wait, no, actually, in the Michael reaction, the nucleophile is the enolate, which is typically formed from a compound with alpha hydrogens. So dimethyl malonate has two ester groups, so the alpha carbons are the ones next to the carbonyl.

Wait, but when the base (NaOEt) is present, it deprotonates the dimethyl malonate to form the enolate. The enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which in this case is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but since it's (E), the substituents on each end of the double bond are opposite. The p-tolyl group is on the carbon adjacent to the acrylate group, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached to the alpha position.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is probably CH2-C(=O)-OCH3, but wait, the molecule is 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but if it's 3-p-tolyl, that would be CH2=CH-C(O)-O
