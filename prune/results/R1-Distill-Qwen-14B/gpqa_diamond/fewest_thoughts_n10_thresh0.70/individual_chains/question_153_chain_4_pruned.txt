Okay, so I've got this problem about Michael addition reactions, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The problem has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. The question is asking about the major products of each reaction, and I need to match them to the options provided.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). Hmm, I remember that Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So, the nucleophile is usually the enolate ion.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate easily. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it deprotonates to form the enolate. The enolate has a negative charge on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-C(=O)OCH3, but wait, no, wait. Let me think. Acrylate is CH2=CH-C(=O)-O-. So, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)=O-OCH3? Wait no, no, the structure should be more like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-CH3? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C-O-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached? Wait, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate methyl ester. So the double bond is between C2 and C3. So structure would be CH2CH2-C(p-tolyl)=O-OCH3? No, perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. No, wait. Let's think again. The formula for acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So for methyl acrylate, it's CH2=CHCOOCH3. But in this case, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the substituent is at the gamma position? Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. But that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, meaning the acrylate group is between the p-tolyl and the ester. So, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Because acrylate is CH2=CH-COO-R, so 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the third carbon if the carbonyl is at position 1. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's move on.

In the Michael addition, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is the acrylate. The enolate, which is a strong nucleophile, will attack the beta carbon (the one further from the carbonyl) of the acrylate. So the dimethyl malonate's enolate would add to the beta position of the acrylate.

So, when they react, the attack would form a new carbon-carbon bond. The product would be a new ketone or ester, depending on the groups. Since both are esters, the product will probably have two ester groups.

Looking at the options, option A for reaction A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me imagine the structure. Propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate would have three ester groups at positions 1 and 3, and a methyl group at position 2, perhaps. So, maybe it's OMe groups on carbons 1 and 3, and a p-tolyl group on carbon 2. Alternatively, wait, the formula would be OMe at positions 1 and 3, and a p-tolyl at 2.

Wait, when the Michael addition happens, the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta position of the acrylate. So, the ac
