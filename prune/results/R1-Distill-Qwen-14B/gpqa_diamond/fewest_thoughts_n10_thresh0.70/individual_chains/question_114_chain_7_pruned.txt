Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry reactions and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give different combinations for A and B.

Hmm, starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is also known as methylacetone. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butanone reacting with CN-? Oh right, that's a nucleophilic substitution maybe. But wait, ketones usually don't undergo SN reactions because the carbonyl is a poor leaving group. Oh wait, wait, perhaps it's more about addition. Oh, but the product has a hydroxyl and a nitrile group. Wait, butan-2-one has the structure (CH3)2C=O. So when it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN-.

Wait, in the presence of a base, maybe it's a substitution. Or perhaps it's a Michael addition? No, Michael addition involves conjugated enones. Alternatively
