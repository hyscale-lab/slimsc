Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about selecting suitable reagents for two consecutive reactions. The first reaction starts with butan-2-one (which is also known as methylacetone) and reacts with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes this product and reacts it with reagent B in the presence of H2O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options given are combinations of A and B, and I need to pick the correct pair.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think through each part.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When ketones react with cyanide ions, I remember that it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism involves the cyanide ion adding to the carbonyl carbon, which then gets protonated, leading to the elimination of water. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think in the presence of an acid, the carbonyl becomes more electrophilic. So the reaction of ketones with HCN (or NaCN, which is a source of CN-) typically involves the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right, cyanohydrin formation. So the reaction is: ketone + HCN → cyanohydrin.

But wait, the reagent here is NaCN, not HCN. So how does that work? Because NaCN is a salt, it's a source of CN- ions. To form HCN, you might need an acid to protonate the CN-.

Wait, no. Another thought: when a ketone reacts with sodium cyanide, perhaps under acidic conditions, it forms a cyanohydrin. So maybe the reagent A is an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A and B for
