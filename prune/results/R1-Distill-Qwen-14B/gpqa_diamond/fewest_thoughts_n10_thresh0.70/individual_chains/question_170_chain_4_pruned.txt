Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y.

Wait, spin states. I remember that electrons have spin-1/2, so the spin states are two-dimensional. The spin state is given as a vector, right? So here, the state is (3i, 4), which I can write as a column vector. Let me note it down:

ψ = [3i; 4]

Spin operators are represented by Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, the S_y operator is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrix σ_y. The σ_y matrix is given as:

σ_y = [0, -i;
        i, 0]

So S_y would be (ħ/2) * σ_y. That is,

S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The expectation value of S_y is the expectation value of the operator S_y in the state ψ. To find that, I think you take the conjugate transpose of ψ, multiply by S_y, and then multiply by ψ again. Wait, more accurately, it's <ψ| S_y |ψ>.

So let me write that mathematically. Let me denote the expectation value as <S_y>.

So,

< S_y > = (ψ†) S_y ψ

But since S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, I can write this as (ħ/2) ψ† σ_y ψ.

Let me compute each part. First, ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ. So ψ is [3i, 4], so ψ† is [ -3, 4* ]. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3i is the top component. The conjugate of 3i is -3i, right? So ψ† would be [ -3i   4 ] ?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Original ψ is [3i; 4], so ψ† is [3i*, 4*]. Since 3i is (0 + 3i),
