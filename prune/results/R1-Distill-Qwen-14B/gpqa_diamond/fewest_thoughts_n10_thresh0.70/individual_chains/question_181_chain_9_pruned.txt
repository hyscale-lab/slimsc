Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio question. Hmm, let's see. The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch suddenly stops in the Sun's core. I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that produce energy through proton-proton collisions. The pp-III branch is one part of that chain, right?

Wait, so if the pp-III branch stops, what does that mean for neutrino production? Neutrinos are produced in different parts of the Sun's reactions. I think the main neutrino types from the Sun are the electron neutrinos, and I'm pretty sure the pp chain produces neutrinos through the decay of beryllium-7 into lithium-7, which involves positrons and neutrinos. Oh right, the main pp branch produces neutrinos via the so-called pep reaction as well, but maybe that's a different part.

So, the pp-III branchâ€”what's that? Let me recall. The proton-proton chain has different branches. The main branch is the pp-I, which produces deuterium, then goes through a few steps. Another branch, pp-II, might involve a different path. Then pp-III is another branch. I'm a bit fuzzy, but I think the pp-III branch might involve the production of carbon-12 via triple-alpha reactions or something else. Wait, no, the triple-alpha is more for later stages, like in red giants. Oh, right, the pp chain mainly produces helium-4, but through various pathways.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in the reactions where a boron-8 decays into lithium-8 and emits a positron and a neutrino. And boron-8 is made from the pp reactions, right? So if the pp-III branch stops, which is a part of the pp chain, then the production of boron-8 would decrease. Because the pp chain is responsible for creating the necessary isotopes that lead to boron-8.

So, when the pp-III branch stops, the production of boron-8 would decrease. Boron-8 decays into lithium-8, which then captures a proton to become boron-9, but wait, maybe more importantly, the decay of boron-8 emits a neutrino. So the number of these neutrinos (the so-called Beryllium Neutrinos, maybe?) would decrease.

But wait, the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands. Band 1 is 700-800 keV, and Band 2 is 800-900 keV. So, how do neutrino energies relate to their production in the Sun?

I think that the majority of solar neutrinos come from the decay of boron-8, which emits a neutrino with a certain energy. What's the energy of that neutrino? I remember that the neutrino from boron-8 has an energy around 1.4 MeV. So that would be in the higher energy range. So, if the pp-III branch stops, the production of boron-8 would drop, leading to fewer high-energy neutrinos.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of fluxes in the two bands. So, if the pp-III
