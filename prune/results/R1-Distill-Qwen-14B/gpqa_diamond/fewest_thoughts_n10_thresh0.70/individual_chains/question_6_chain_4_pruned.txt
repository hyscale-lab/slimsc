Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the energy spectrum of a particle in a certain potential. Hmm, let me read the question again.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, I'm a bit confused about what kind of potential this is. Oh right, in polar coordinates, r is the radial distance and θ is the angular coordinate.

I remember that in two dimensions, the Schrödinger equation can often be solved by separating variables when the potential has some symmetry. So maybe I should try to express the potential in a way that shows some separation or perhaps a harmonic oscillator part.

Looking at the potential: V(r,θ) has two parts. The first part is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator in the radial direction. The second part is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, the cos²θ term makes me think of angular dependence that can maybe be expressed in terms of cos(2θ) because cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² * [ (1 + cos2θ)/2 ].

Let me compute that. Expanding the second term: (3/2 kr²) * (1/2) gives (3/4)kr², and the other part is (3/4) kr² cos2θ. So overall, V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Adding the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) kr² = (5/4) kr². So now the potential is V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ. Wait, did I do that right? Let me check: 1/2 is 2/4, plus 3/4 is 5/4, that's right. So, overall, the potential is (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ).

Hmm, I'm wondering if this can be rewritten in a way that separates the angular and radial parts. Alternatively, maybe it's
