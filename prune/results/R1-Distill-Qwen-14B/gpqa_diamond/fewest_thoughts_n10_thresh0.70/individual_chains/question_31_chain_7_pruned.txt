Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product 3. Hmm. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid to form product 1. Oh wait, I remember that nitration is a common reaction. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene, right? So when it's nitrated, the nitro group probably attaches at a specific position. Since toluene is methylbenzene, the nitration would occur meta to the methyl group. Wait, no, wait. The methyl is an activating group, so the nitration would occur in the ortho and para positions predominantly. Oh yeah, the methyl directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene, I think. Or maybe a mix, but in this case, since it's just the formation, perhaps it's para.

Next, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. Hmm, I think that when nitrotoluene is treated with MnO2, it undergoes oxidation of the methyl group. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the methyl group attached to a benzene ring with a nitro group is a good candidate for oxidation. I remember that when a methyl group is attached to a benzene ring and there's a nitro group in the para position, the methyl can be oxidized to a carboxylic
