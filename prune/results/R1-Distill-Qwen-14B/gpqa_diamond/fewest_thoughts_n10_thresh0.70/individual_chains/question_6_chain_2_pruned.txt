Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions with a potential V(r, θ) given by (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. And I need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, especially for two-dimensional systems, the potential often leads to a Hamiltonian that can be separated into radial and angular parts. So maybe I should try to analyze this potential to see if it's separable.

Let me write down the potential again: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Wait, I can factor out kr², right? So that becomes V(r,θ) = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Let's compute that inside the brackets: 1/2 + 3/2 cos²θ = [1 + 3 cos²θ]/2. So, V(r,θ) = (kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ)/2.

Wait, maybe I can rearrange terms. Let's see: cos²θ is (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (kr²/2) [1 + 3*(1 + cos(2θ))/2]. Let's compute that inside:

1 + 3*(1 + cos(2θ))/2 = (2 + 3(1 + cos2θ))/2 = (2 + 3 + 3 cos2θ)/2 = (5 + 3 cos2θ)/2. So V(r,θ) = (kr²/2) * (5 + 3 cos2θ)/2 = (kr²)(5 + 3 cos2θ)/4.

Wait, perhaps that's making it more complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of the angular part. Let's think about the potential in terms of whether it's radial or angular components. The potential is a function of r and θ, but perhaps it can be expressed as a sum of functions each depending on r and θ separately.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be written as a sum of terms that are
