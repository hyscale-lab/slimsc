Okay, so I have this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that in such reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions. The directing effect depends on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating, and whether it's ortho/para or meta directing.

So the question is about the para isomer yield. We need to arrange the substances 1 to 6 in order of increasing weight fraction of the para isomer. Wait, increasing means from the lowest to the highest. So I need to find out which substituent leads to the least para product and which leads to the most, and then order them accordingly.

The substances are:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (benzoyloxy ethyl benzene? Or wait, wait, the formula is C6H5-COOC2H5. Oh, that's benzene with a COOEt group. So that's an ester group, like a phenyl acetate group. So the substituent is -O-CO-Et or wait, no, the structure would be benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group which is connected to an ethyl ester. So the substituent is actually an ester group, which is â€“COOEt.

Wait, no, wait: The formula is C6H5-COOC2H5. So the benzene is attached to a carbonyl group, which is then attached to an ethyl group. So the substituent is an acetyloxy group? No, wait, the structure is O-CO-OEt? Or wait, perhaps I should think of it as a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl (CO) group, which is attached to an ethyl (O-C2H5?), no wait. Let me think: C6H5-CO-O-C2H5? Oh wait, maybe it's benzoyloxy ethyl group? No, perhaps the structure is benzene with a COOEt group, as the substituent. So the substituent is an ester group, which is an electron-withdrawing group.

3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
