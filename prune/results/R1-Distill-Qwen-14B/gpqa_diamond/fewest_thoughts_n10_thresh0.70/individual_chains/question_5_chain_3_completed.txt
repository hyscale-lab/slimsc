Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator along an arbitrary direction. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem states that we're dealing with a muon, which is just a type of elementary particle, but I don't think the specific particle matters here. The operator in question is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, operators have eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and these represent possible outcomes and states of the system.

The operator P is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, I think the general operator P would be the sum of these components multiplied by the direction vector n. Wait, no, actually the operator along an arbitrary direction n would be the dot product of P with n, right? So the operator is P · n, where n is a unit vector in the x-z plane. Oh wait, the problem says n lies in the x-z plane. So n can be expressed as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in x-z, maybe φ is zero? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, any direction in the x-z plane can be represented with polar angles θ and φ, but since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero. So n would be (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1. Alternatively, maybe it's better to write it in terms of θ, the angle from the z-axis. So, n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, wait, sometimes θ is measured from the z-axis, so when θ=0, we're along the z-axis, and θ=90 degrees is along x. So yes, n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) in that case. So, the operator in that direction is P·n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z, because the y-component of n is zero.

So, the operator we're considering is P·n = (P_x sinθ) + (P_z cosθ), because n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. Wait, no, because n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), so P·n is P_x sinθ + P_y * 0 + P_z cosθ. So P·n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Now, each component P_x, P_y, P_z is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. Let me write down each matrix:

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]].
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]].
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, let me write these out more clearly:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1],
               [1, 0]]

P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],
               [i, 0]]

P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0],
               [0, -1]]

So, the operator in the n direction is:

P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside the brackets. Let's compute sinθ * P_x matrix plus cosθ * P_z matrix.

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] becomes [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]

cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] becomes [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding these two:

Top-left element: 0 + cosθ = cosθ
Top-right: sinθ + 0 = sinθ
Bottom-left: sinθ + 0 = sinθ
Bottom-right: 0 + (-cosθ) = -cosθ

So the matrix is:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Multiply by ħ/2, so P·n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix. So the operator is:

P·n = (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Wait, no, because each component is multiplied by ħ/2, so when you add P_x * sinθ and P_z * cosθ, each term is (ħ/2) multiplied by the respective matrix, so when you factor out (ħ/2), you get (ħ/2) times [ sinθ * P_x_matrix + cosθ * P_z_matrix ].

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

P·n = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z

Because P·n = (P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ), and each P_x and P_z already includes the factor of ħ/2.

So, let me write the operator as:

P·n = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z
= sinθ * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]
= (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Which simplifies to the matrix:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ],
          [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So, the operator is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvectors of this operator are the eigenstates of P·n with eigenvalue ±ħ/2. The question is asking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, we need to find the eigenvector for the matrix [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]] multiplied by (ħ/2), and find the eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Wait, but actually, the eigenvalues of P·n are ±(ħ/2), because the operator is of the form (ħ/2) times a matrix with eigenvalues ±1. Because the eigenvalues of a spin-1/2 operator are ±ħ/2.

Wait, let me think. The spin operators S_x, S_y, S_z have eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So, any component of the spin in a particular direction will have eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So, the operator P·n is the spin component along n, which should have eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So the eigenvector we're looking for is the one with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, to find the eigenvector, we can set up the equation (P·n - (ħ/2)I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

Let me write the matrix form:

(P·n) = (ħ/2) * [[ cosθ, sinθ ],
                 [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So, (P·n - (ħ/2) I) is:

(ħ/2) * [[ cosθ, sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, -cosθ ]] 
- (ħ/2) * [[1, 0],
           [0, 1]]

Which equals:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ -1, sinθ ],
           [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

So, the matrix (P·n - (ħ/2) I) is (ħ/2) times:

[[ cosθ -1, sinθ ],
 [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

We can write this as:

(ħ/2) * [ [ (cosθ -1), sinθ ],
           [ sinθ, (-cosθ -1) ] ]

We can factor this matrix equation into variables. Let me denote the matrix as M, so M = (P·n - (ħ/2) I) / (ħ/2), which gives M as [[ cosθ -1, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]. The eigenvector condition is M |v> = 0.

So, M is:

[ cosθ - 1    sinθ      ]
[ sinθ        -cosθ -1 ]

We can write the equations for the eigenvector components, say a and b:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ * b = 0
sinθ * a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

These are two equations, but they should be dependent. Let me write the first equation:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 → equation (1)

The second equation:

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0 → equation (2)

We can solve for a and b. Let's take equation (1): (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b.

Hmm, but cosθ -1 is equal to -2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So, let me substitute these identities.

cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(θ/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So, substitute into a:

a = [ - (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) / ( -2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b

Simplify denominator:

-2 sin²(θ/2) → but in the numerator, it's -2 sin cos, and denominator is -2 sin².

So:

a = [ (2 sin cos) / (2 sin²) ) ] b → (2 cancels, sin cancels in numerator and denominator)

→ [ cos / sin ] b → cot(θ/2) * b

So a = cot(θ/2) * b.

So the ratio a/b is cot(θ/2), so a = cot(θ/2) * b.

But wait, let me make sure. Let me re-express:

a = [ (- sinθ) / (cosθ -1) ] * b
= [ (- sinθ) / (- (1 - cosθ)) ] * b
= [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] * b

Now, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So,

a/b = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] 
= [ cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ] 
= cot(θ/2 )

So, a = cot(θ/2) b.

So the eigenvector can be written as:

|v> = [a, b]^T = [ cot(θ/2) b, b ]^T = b [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]^T

We can factor out b as a scaling factor, so the normalized eigenvector should have a magnitude of 1.

But wait, wait. Let me think about the components. Let me write the vector as (a, b) = (cot(θ/2) b, b) → factor out b, so it's b (cot(θ/2), 1).

But for a normalized vector, the sum of squares must be 1: a^2 + b^2 = |b|^2 (cot^2(θ/2) +1 ) = |b|^2 csc^2(θ/2) ) = 1.

Wait, because cot^2 + 1 = csc^2.

So, |b|^2 csc^2 (θ/2) ) = 1 → |b|^2 = sin^2(θ/2) → b = sin(θ/2) e^{i phi} (since in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors can have a phase factor; for normalized vectors, we can choose phi=0 for simplicity).

Wait, but the question asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So, let me compute a and b in terms of θ.

So, a = cot(θ/2) * b → a = [cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * b.

If b = sin(θ/2), then a = cos(θ/2).

So the vector is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

Wait, but wait, that's only when b = sin(θ/2). Because if b = sin(theta/2), then a = cos(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

Wait, but let me double-check.

In our earlier steps, we have:

a = cot(theta/2) * b.

So, let me set b = sin(theta/2), then a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

So, the vector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, when I set b= sin(theta/2), then the components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Alternatively, the other option could be when b= - sin(theta/2), but that would just introduce a phase factor, which doesn't affect the physical state.

Wait, but the eigenvalue equation gives us a vector proportional to (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but wait, I think I might have mixed up the angle. Because when θ is 0, the direction is along z.

Wait, when theta is 0, n is along z. So the operator P·n is P_z.

The eigenvectors of P_z are (1,0) and (0,1), corresponding to eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So, for theta=0, the eigenvector should be (1,0). Let's see. If theta=0, then theta/2=0, so cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0. So the vector is (1, 0). That's correct.

Similarly, when theta=180 degrees, cos(theta/2)=cos(90)=0, sin(theta/2)=1. So vector is (0,1), which is the eigenvector for -ħ/2. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, in our case, we're looking for the +ħ/2 eigenvalue. So for theta=0, the vector is (1,0), which is correct. For theta=180, the vector would be (0,1), but that's the eigenvalue -ħ/2. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the phase.

Wait, perhaps the correct vector is (cos(theta/2), -i sin(theta/2)) or something else. Wait, no, perhaps I should check the eigenvectors more carefully.

Wait, let's consider theta=0. The operator P·n is P_z, whose eigenvectors are (1,0) and (0,1). So, the eigenvector for +ħ/2 is (1,0), which is [cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0]. So that's correct.

But when theta=pi, n is along -z (since theta=pi, n_z = cos(pi) = -1, n_x= sin(pi)=0). So the operator is P_z again, but with the direction reversed. Wait, no, in our case, n is in the x-z plane, so theta=pi would point along -z. The operator P·n would be -P_z, because the direction is opposite. So the eigenvalues would still be ±ħ/2, but the eigenvectors are the same as for P_z, because changing the sign of the operator would flip the eigenvalues. Wait, but no, the eigenvectors remain the same, but the eigenvalues change sign. So for theta=pi, the eigenvector for +ħ/2 would be (0,1). Wait, but according to our earlier formula, theta=pi, theta/2=pi/2. So cos(pi/2)=0, sin(pi/2)=1. So the vector would be (0,1). But wait, when theta=pi, the operator is P·n = -P_z. So the eigenvalue for the state (0,1) would be -ħ/2, not +ħ/2. So our earlier conclusion must be wrong, because for theta=pi, using our vector (0,1) would give eigenvalue -ħ/2, which is not what we're looking for.

Wait, that suggests that the correct eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 when theta=pi would be (1,0), but according to our formula, it's (0,1), which is not correct. So where did I go wrong?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign somewhere. Let me retrace.

Wait, when we set up the equation (P·n - (ħ/2) I) |v> =0, and found the ratio a/b = cot(theta/2).

But perhaps I should have considered the other eigenvector, the one with the eigenvalue -ħ/2. Because when theta=pi, the operator is (P·n) = -P_z, so the eigenvectors for +ħ/2 would be (1,0), which gives eigenvalue +ħ/2 (since P_z (1,0) is +ħ/2, but P·n is -P_z, so (1,0) would have eigenvalue -ħ/2. Wait, no, wait: if P·n = -P_z, then applying P·n on (1,0) would give - P_z (1,0) = - (ħ/2) (1,0), which is eigenvalue -ħ/2. So the state (1,0) would correspond to eigenvalue -ħ/2 for P·n when theta=pi.

Wait, but we are looking for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So when theta=pi, the vector (0,1) would be the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2, because:

(P·n)(0,1) = (-P_z)(0,1) = (ħ/2)(0,1) → eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Ah, so our earlier conclusion is correct. So when theta=pi, the eigenvector is (0,1), which is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] with theta=pi. So cos(pi/2)=0, sin(pi/2)=1, so the vector is (0,1), which is correct. So, for P·n with theta=pi, the +ħ/2 eigenvector is (0,1), which works because P·n is -P_z, so (0,1) is the + eigenstate for -P_z.

Wait, maybe I was confusing the direction. So, the formula seems to hold.

So, the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), but wait, in the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), option D is (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but we didn't include any hbar in our calculation. The options have hbar in them. But the eigenvectors are dimensionless, right? Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are normalized vectors, and the matrices are in units of ħ/2. So the eigenvectors themselves shouldn't have any hbar terms. So, perhaps the options have an error.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ) → includes ħ, which probably isn't correct.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but this is a general spherical coordinate form, but perhaps it's not specific to this problem.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) → matches what we derived.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)) → includes ħ, which seems off.

Wait, but looking at the problem statement, the given matrices for P_x, P_y, P_z have elements times ħ/2. So the operator P·n is in units of ħ/2. So the eigenvectors are just dimensionless vectors, so they shouldn't have any ħ factors. So options A and D include ħ, which suggests they are not correct.

So, the correct answer should be option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, looking back, when we derived it, the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but perhaps I missed a phase factor or normalization.

Wait, when I set b = sin(theta/2), then a = cos(theta/2), and the vector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But let's check the normalization: cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) =1, so yes, it's normalized.

So, the normalized vector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches option C.

But looking at the options again, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which seems correct.

So, the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each expressed as $\hbar/2$ times a $2 \times 2$ matrix. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the $x$-$z$ plane and can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the $z$-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$
The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta
\]
Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
we get:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for the eigenvector
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0
\]
Substituting $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ and $I$ (the identity matrix), the matrix equation becomes:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0
\]
Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the system of equations is:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0
\]
These equations are consistent, and solving the first equation gives:
\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b
\]
Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:
\[
|v\rangle = b \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector
The normalization condition is:
\[
a^2 + b^2 = 1
\]
Substituting $a = \cot(\theta/2) b$:
\[
\cot^2(\theta/2) b^2 + b^2 = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad b^2 (\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1) = 1
\]
Using the identity $\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1 = \csc^2(\theta/2)$:
\[
b^2 \csc^2(\theta/2) = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad b = \sin(\theta/2)
\]
Thus, $a = \cos(\theta/2)$, and the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is a general spherical coordinate form but does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect.

### Final Answer
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.
