Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about detecting transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers have limited observation time and want to choose the one with the highest probability of transiting. Both planets were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits. The host stars are different: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved.

Hmm, okay. The main thing here is figuring out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. I remember that the transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. But wait, how exactly does that work?

I think the probability of a planet transiting is higher when the star is larger, because the planet has a higher chance of passing in front of it from our point of view. Oh wait, no, actually, the probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit. Wait, more precisely, the probability is proportional to R^2 divided by (a^2 - R^2), where R is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital radius (the semi-major axis). Or is it a different formula?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The transit probability is actually the ratio of the area of the star's disk as seen from Earth to the area of the planet's orbit. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. The probability of a transit is the probability that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is such that it passes in front of the star. So it's based on the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.

The formula I remember is that the probability P is approximately (R_star / a)Â², where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is higher for planets with smaller orbits because it's more likely their orbital plane is aligned edge-on relative to us. But wait, maybe it's more about the size of the star relative to the orbital distance.

Wait, I
