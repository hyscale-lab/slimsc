Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. The options are all similar in terms of carbon count, but differ in hydrogen and oxygen. Let's break down each piece of information and see what clues they give.

First, the FTIR data: there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So that suggests the compound has an -OH group, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually even broader and might appear around 2500-3300 cm^-1. Hmm, but the peak here is very broad, so either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid is possible. 

The other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak, which is typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest conjugation or another functional group. Maybe an aromatic ring because C=O in an aromatic ring (like in an aromatic ketone) can be lower? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or a conjugated ketone. Alternatively, the 1650 could be a C=C stretch because of the vinyl hydrogens mentioned in the NMR. Wait, no, C=C in alkenes usually shows up around 1650 cm^-1 as well. So perhaps the 1650 is from a conjugated double bond.

Next, the 1H NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens. That means there's an alkene (double bond) in the structure. So the compound has both a carbonyl group and a double bond. Also, the presence of an -OH group, as indicated by the IR.

Then, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass for certain fragments. Let me think: a ketene group? Or maybe a methyl group attached to something. Wait, 45 is also the molecular ion for CH
