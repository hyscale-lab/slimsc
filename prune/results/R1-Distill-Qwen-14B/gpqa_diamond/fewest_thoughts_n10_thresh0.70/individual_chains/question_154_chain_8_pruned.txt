Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to figure out, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm just starting to learn about spectroscopy. But I'll give it a shot. Let's read through the question again.

Alright, the problem is about identifying an unknown white solid. The chemist has some spectral data: mass spec, IR, and 1H NMR. The options are four different compounds, all with chlorine and a benzene ring, it seems. Let me break down each piece of data and see what I can deduce.

Starting with the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the highest at 100%. Then there's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, so the molecular formula must have a molecular weight around 156. The 158 could be a fragment, maybe with an added something like a Cl or O. Wait, wait. Wait, the main peak is at 156, but wait, 158 is 2 more than 156. So maybe it's a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has two main isotopes: Cl-35 (about 75%) and Cl-37 (about 25%). So the molecular ion would have a molecular weight of 156, and the next peak would be from the Cl-37 isotope, which would be 156 + 2 = 158. So the molecular formula probably includes one Cl atom. That makes sense because all the options have a chlorine.

So the molecular weight is 156. Let me calculate the possible formula. Let me think: the options are benzoic acids, benzaldehyde, and phenyl chloroformate. Let's look at each.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate the molecular weight: C is 12*7=84, H is 5, Cl is about 35.5, O is 16*2=32. So total is 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Hmm, that's close. But the given molecular ion is 156, so maybe that's off by a half? Or perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the formula is C8H7ClO2? Wait, no.

Wait, benzaldehyde is C7H6O. So 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would have a benzene ring with Cl, OH, and CHO groups. Let me recount: benzaldehyde is C6H5CHO, which is C7H6O. Adding Cl and OH would replace two H's. So the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Molar mass: (12*7)+(5)+(35.5)+(16*2) = 84 +5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. The molecular ion is 156. Hmm, maybe there's a possible error here, but perhaps it's 156. Let me think about the other options.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl attached to the benzene ring at position 4, and a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at position 1. The formula would be C7H5ClO2. Same as option A. Molecular weight would be the same, 156.5. So it's possible.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. That's OClC(O)OPh, but wait, the structure would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the formula would be C6H5O2ClCO? Wait, no. Let me think again. Phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as before. So molecular weight would also be 156.5.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So Cl is at position 2, COOH at position 1. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as others, so same molecular weight.

Wait, all options have the same molecular formula? Hmm, that's interesting. So the molecular weight being around 156.5 would fit all of them. So the mass spec doesn't help me distinguish between them. I need to look at the other data.

Next, the IR data. A broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches. The broadness is because of hydrogen bonding, which is common in alcohols, phenols, or carboxylic acids. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be very
