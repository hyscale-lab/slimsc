Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particle emission. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through it step by step.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. We're supposed to use Pauli statistics to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed.

Wait, Pauli statistics. Oh right, that's for identical particles. But wait, the two nucleons are emitting a particle, so maybe the system after emission has to obey certain quantum numbers. The problem gives an equation that relates isospin (T), spin (S), and angular momentum (L) of the final NN state: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh, and the final NN state has T(NN) = 0.

So the initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would mean 2S+1 =1 → S=0, and L is S in spectroscopic notation? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the notation, the first number is (2S+1), the second is L (as in S, P, D...), and the last is J. So 1S0 implies S=0, L=0 (since S stands for L=0), and J=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

When they emit a particle X, the system becomes the NN in a state with T=0. So let's consider the process: the initial state is NN in 1S0 → NN (after emission) plus X. So the initial state has certain quantum numbers, and the final state must conserve angular momentum and parity.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The problem says that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So for the final state, T=0. Let's write that equation: 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. That is, S and L must be of opposite parity. So if S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.

Also, conservation of parity. The initial parity is the parity of the 1S0 state. The parity of a state is (-1)^(L), since parity operator P has eigenvalues (-1)^L for orbital angular momentum. So for 1S0, L=0 → parity is 1. But then particle X is emitted, which has intrinsic parity -1.

Wait, but the parity of the final state (NN plus X) should be the product of the intrinsic parities of NN and X. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that. Because the parity operator for the whole system is the product of the parities of each part. So if the initial state had parity P_initial, and the final state has parity P_final, and X has parity P_X, then perhaps the parity must be conserved.

Wait, no. Wait, the overall parity of the system must be conserved if the process is parity-conserving. But in this case, since X is emitted, maybe we have to include its parity. Let me think: the initial parity is (NN initial parity) × (parity of X, if X was part of the system). Wait, no. The initial state is just NN in 1S0. When they emit X, the final state is NN' (the new state) plus X. So the parity would be the product of the parity of NN' and the parity of X.

But what is parity in terms of the process? The initial state is just the NN system: parity P_initial = (-1)^L_initial. For 1S0, L=0, so P_initial =1.

The final state is the NN system in a new state, plus X. So the parity of the final state would be P_final = P_NN' × P_X.

Since parity is conserved, if the process is parity-conserving, then P_initial = P_final. So 1 = P_NN' × (-1), because X has parity -1. So P_NN' must be -1. Because 1 = (-1) × (-1). So P_NN' is -1.

The parity of the NN' state is (-1)^{L_NN'}, since the parity of a state is determined by its orbital angular momentum. So (-1)^{L_NN'} = -1 → L_NN' must be odd. So L_NN' is an odd integer.

But wait, the problem says that the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So using the equation T = S + L +1 mod 2, which we have as 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2.

So S and L must be of opposite parity. So if L is odd, S must be even. Because odd + even = odd, which mod 2 is 1.

So, the final NN state has L being odd, and S being even.

Now, the options give transitions from 1S0 to various states plus X. Let's look at each option and see what happens.

Wait, the options are like 1S0 → something. So the initial state is 1S0, and the NN final state plus X. Wait, the options seem to have the initial state as 1S0, and the emitted X is denoted by the letter (like p, s, etc.), but I'm not sure. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p

Wait, the notation is a bit unclear. The problem says the options are like 1S0 → 3S1 + p. So the initial state is 1S0, and the final NN state is something like 3S1, and a particle is emitted. Hmm, but how does that tie into the conservation of angular momentum and parity?

Wait, I think each option represents an allowed transition where the NN system goes from 1S0 to a new state plus the emission of X. So the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is NN in some state (like 7D1) plus X (like p, which I think is a pseudoscalar, but perhaps it refers to a particle like a pion, which has spin 0). Or perhaps the +p refers to
