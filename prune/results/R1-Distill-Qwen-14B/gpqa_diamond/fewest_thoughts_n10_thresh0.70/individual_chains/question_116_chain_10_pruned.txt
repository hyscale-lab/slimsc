Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions starting from compound A, which gives some NMR signals. Then there's a monobromination to form B, followed by a reaction with alcoholic KOH to make C. C has two geometrical isomers, and the cis one reacts with a specific dienol to produce D, which we need to identify from the options.

First, I'll break down the information given. Let's start with compound A's NMR data. It shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, NMR can tell me about the structure. 

So, the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests that there are two sets of three equivalent protons each. These are likely from methyl groups attached to a CH2. Because the triplet is at 0.9, which is typical for methyl groups adjacent to CH2. For example, in a diethyl group, each CH2CH3 would have the triplet for the CH3 because each is next to a CH2. Wait, but 6H would mean two CH3 groups each with 3H. So, the triplet at 0.9 ppm probably comes from two methyl groups attached to something else.

The other signal is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet means each proton is next to a CH2 with two neighboring protons. 4H would mean two sets of two equivalent protons each. So, perhaps a CH2CH2 group? Or maybe two equivalent CH2 groups adjacent to each other. Wait, but a quartet suggests each proton is split by two neighboring protons. So maybe a structure like CH2CH2 something.

Putting this together, perhaps compound A is diethyl something. Diethyl ether? No, because diethyl ether would have more protons. Or maybe it's diethyl something else. Wait, another possibility is that the structure is an ethyl group attached to another ethyl group, perhaps in a cyclic structure.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the integration. 6H and 4H. So 6H would be two CH3 groups, and 4H would be two CH2 groups. So if the structure is
