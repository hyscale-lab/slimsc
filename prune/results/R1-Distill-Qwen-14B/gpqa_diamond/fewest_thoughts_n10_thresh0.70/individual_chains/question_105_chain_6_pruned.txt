Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the brightness variations observed. They compare it to an exoplanet's effect. I need to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same brightness change as these spots.

Hmm, first, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The amount blocked depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. The formula I think is that the change in brightness, or the depth of the dip, is proportional to (Rp/Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius.

But in this case, the star has dark spots. The problem says one hemisphere is covered with spots, and the filling factor is 20%. Oh right, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So, the spots take up 20% of half the star's surface. Wait, no, actually, the filling factor is the fraction of the area covered in the hemisphere. So if the hemisphere is 20% covered, that's 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots are at 5000 K. But wait, how does this affect the brightness? Since brightness is related to temperature squared times area. The star emits more light from hotter regions.

When the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view from our perspective. So when a spot is in front, it blocks some of the brighter regions, but if the star is spot-free, a planet would block the entire disk. But the question is about the same amplitude in brightness variation.

Wait, the question says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude. So the observed dip from the spots should be equivalent to a planet dip.

So, let me think about how the spots affect the brightness. Normally, the star's brightness is uniform, but with spots, when they're facing us, they block some of the light. The brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and their temperature compared to the rest of the star.

The star's
