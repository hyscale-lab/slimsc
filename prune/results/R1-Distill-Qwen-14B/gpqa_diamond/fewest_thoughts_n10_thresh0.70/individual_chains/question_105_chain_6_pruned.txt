Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

So the question is about a star similar to the Sun, radius same as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, the brightness we observe changes, creating a periodic variation. The interesting part is that this brightness variation looks similar to what we'd see if there were an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. The question is asking: what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness change (same amplitude in the light curve), assuming the star didn't have spots?

The options are A to D, with some decimals.

Hmm. So I think I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by a planet transit.

I remember that the change in brightness (the amplitude of the light curve) when a planet transits a star is given by the formula:

ΔF ≈ (R_planet / R_star)^2

Because the planet blocks a part of the star's light proportional to the square of the ratio of their radii. So the fractional change in flux is (Rp/Rs)^2.

But wait, in this scenario, the star has spots that are causing the brightness variation. So I need to find out what the equivalent change in brightness would be when only the planet is present, meaning I need to calculate what the planet's radius would need to be to cause the same ΔF as the spots do.

So first, I need to compute the change in brightness caused by the spots. Since the star is rotating, the spots come into and out of view, causing a dip in brightness. But how does the spot coverage affect the overall light output?

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, at 5000 K (because 6000-1000=5000). The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. Wait, filling factor is usually the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So one hemisphere has 20% coverage of spots.

Wait, but the star is a sphere. So if one hemisphere has spots covering 20% of that hemisphere, then the total area covered by spots on the entire star is 20% of a hemisphere. But since a hemisphere is half the star's surface, the total area of spots is 0.2 * (π R^2) / 2 = 0.1 π R^2. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the total surface area.

Wait, the star's surface area is 4π R². Each hemisphere is 2π R². So a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere would mean the spot area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R²
