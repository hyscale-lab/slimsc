Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me break down the information given and see how I can approach this.

First, the question involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to have a carboxylic acid group since I see "COOH" at the end of each formula. So that's a good starting point.

Looking at the FTIR data: a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. The broad peak around 3000 usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But since all options have COOH, that makes sense. The strong peak at 1700 is probably the carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which is typical for carboxylic acids. So the IR data fits with all the options, so I need to look more at the NMR for differentiation.

Now the 1H NMR part: several peaks, none are vinyl hydrogens. So no double bonds or aromatic rings here. All structures given are aliphatic, so that's consistent.

Looking at the specific signals in the NMR:

- One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, that's a complicated splitting pattern. Let's think about what that implies. Each split indicates coupling with neighboring protons. So a doublet would mean coupling with one set of equivalent protons. A triplet would be two neighboring sets, and a quartet another. So it's likely an environment where the proton is splitting into multiple peaks due to being adjacent to different groups of protons.

- Another signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Even more splits. So this proton is coupling with three different sets of protons, perhaps.

I remember that splitting in NMR depends on the number of neighboring non-equivalent protons. Each neighboring set with n equivalent protons will split the signal into (n+1) peaks. So, the first signal being a doublet of triplets of quartets: wait, wait, let's dissect that. Let me think about each level of splitting.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the splitting as a product of each coupling. So the first split is into a doublet, then each of those splits into triplets, which then each split into quartets. Or is it a doublet of triplets of quartets? Because the notation is a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps it's a (doublet) of (triplet of quartet). But that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the coupling constants are such that each split is at a different value, leading to a complex splitting pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of a triplet, which itself is a quartet. Or maybe the splitting is the product of three different couplings. Let me think about the structure.

Looking at the options, all have a COOH group, and varying substituents around the central carbons. Let's look at each option:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.
So structure-wise, it's something like:
CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.
So the central two carbons each have a CH group attached to two ethyl groups (C2H5) and a methyl (CH3) on one of them? Wait, the formula is a bit unclear. Let me try to parse it.

Wait, the first part is CH3C(H)(C2H5). So that would be a carbon connected to
