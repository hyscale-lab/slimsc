Okay, so I've got this question about a peptidic compound and some analytical data. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my NMR and LC-MS stuff, but let's try to break this down.

The question says that the 1H NMR of the crude compound mostly matches the expected molecule. But there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So, what gives?

Wait, what causes duplicate peaks? If it's the same proton, maybe it's splitting due to something else. Spin-spin coupling usually causes splitting into multiple peaks, but the question says that's ruled out. So maybe it's something like a diastereomer? Or maybe it's some kind of impurity?

Looking at the options: option B says enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so if the molecule is a mixture of enantiomers, each would have the same NMR peaks because they're identical in terms of environment. But wait, no, in that case, wouldn't the peaks just be a single peak? Unless... Oh wait, if the molecule is a racemic mixture, the NMR would show the same peaks as one enantiomer because they have identical environments. But then why two peaks?

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diastereomer, like a mixture of epimers or something. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different peaks. But if one of the diastereomers has the same environment for that proton, like maybe in a symmetric situation, could that cause duplicate peaks? I'm not sure.

Wait, the LC-MS data shows two peaks of equal intensity. Same mass? So both are the same mass, which suggests they are either enantiomers (same mass, different optical activity) or diastereomers but with the same molecular formula. But wait, diastereomers usually have different physical properties. However, if the diastereomers have the same mass, like same molecular weight, then the MS would look same. Oh, but wait, in the question, the mass is consistent with the expected molecule. So they have the same mass. Hmm.

So if the LC-MS has two peaks, same mass, same intensity. What could that mean? Maybe it's a racemic mixture? But then, in the NMR, if it's a racemic mixture, the peaks would not split because the enantiomers are superimposable. So why are there two peaks in the NMR?

Wait, the NMR shows two distinct peaks for the same alpha proton. The integral adds up to 1H. So maybe the structure has two different environments for that same proton in two different diastereomers. But if it's a diastereomer, the environments would be different, so their chemical shifts would be different. So why do they have similar shifts?

Wait, another possibility. If during the synthesis, there's an issue with the reaction. For example, maybe a double coupling occurred during an amide bond formation, leading to a diketone or something. Oh, wait, option C says 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. What would that mean? Amide bonds are formed via coupling reactions, like using HATU or EDCl with HOBt. If there's an issue where two couplings happened, perhaps leading to an extra bond. But how does that relate to the NMR?

Alternatively, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. Maybe the molecule has a double bond, and the alpha protons are split due to coupling with the same proton on another carbon, but that would be spin-spin coupling, which the question rules out.

Wait, but the question says that based on coupling pattern, spin-spin can be ruled out. So it's not that. So what else causes multiplet splitting? Maybe if the molecule has more than one stereocenter, and the proton is in a situation where it's exchanging between two environments, leading to two peaks. Or maybe some sort of dynamic process?

Or another thought: if the crude compound is a racemic mixture, but the NMR isn't split because the two enantiomers are in fast exchange. But wait, that would average the peaks. So why two peaks? Hmm, that doesn't add up. If the NMR is taken quickly, the fast exchange would lead to a single averaged peak, not two.

Wait, but the question says that the NMR integrates to 1H. So if there are two peaks, each integrating to about 0.5H, but same shift. That seems unusual for diastereomers, because each diastereomer would have a different shift. Unless the diastereomers have the same shift for that proton.

Another possibility: the compound might have a double bond, and the protons are in a trans and cis configuration, but that would require the coupling with adjacent protons. Wait, but the question says it's the same alpha-proton. Hmm.

Wait, thinking about the possible reasons for two peaks with same shift but different environment. Maybe it's a result of some sort of pseudo-peak splitting due to other factors, but the question says the coupling pattern doesn't explain it.

Alternatively, perhaps the LC-MS shows two peaks because of two different compounds with the same formula, so same mass. So maybe two different diastereomers.

Wait, if the crude compound is a mixture of diastereomers, that would explain the two LC-MS peaks. But in the NMR, each diastereomer would have its own set of peaks. So for the same alpha proton, if in each diastereomer, the chemical shift is the same, then the NMR would see two peaks. But why would two diastereomers have the same shift for that proton? That seems unlikely unless the environments are identical for that proton, which might not make sense.

Wait, but if the two peaks in the NMR are from the same compound, perhaps the crude has some impurity. But the LC-MS doesn't show that, because the two peaks are the same mass.

Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. So it's two compounds with same molecular weight. So maybe they're enantiomers. Because enantiomers have same molecular weight and same retention time under certain conditions? Or no, under normal HPLC, enantiomers may elute at different times if the column is chiral. If the LC is achiral, then enantiomers would elute together. So if the LC is using a chiral stationary phase, they would split. But the question says two clearly defined peaks of equal intensity. If the LC is achiral, then the two enantiomers would appear as one peak. So in this case, since they see two peaks, perhaps the LC is chiral, and the two are enantiomers, each with the same mass, so same m/z in MS. So the MS can't tell the difference between enantiomers. Thus, the two peaks in LC would be enantiomers.

But then, in the NMR, if they're enantiomers, then in solution, if the sample is a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak because the two enantiomers have the same environment. But the question says that two peaks are present for the same alpha-proton. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if the sample is a diastereomeric mixture, like two diastereomers, each with the same mass, same MS. That could happen if they have same molecular formula but different structures leading to same mass. But how? Wait, molecular mass is same, so same number of atoms, so same molecular weight. So yes, diastereomers can have same molecular weight.

In the NMR, each diastereomer would have its own set of peaks. But if the two diastereomers have the same shift for that particular alpha proton, which seems unlikely but possible, you would see two peaks. But I think more likely, each would have a different shift, leading to more complex peaks.

Hmm, but the question says the two peaks have similar shifts. So maybe the diastereomers have similar environments for that proton. Maybe because of symmetry or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is with the synthesis. Option C says 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. What does that mean? Maybe forming an amide where two bonds were formed, like a double bond or something. Or perhaps an extra coupling leading to a different structure.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the compound has a double bond, and the alpha protons are split due to coupling with vicinal protons. But the question rules out spin-spin coupling as an explanation. Hmm.

Wait, if the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass, same intensity, then it's either two enantiomers or two diastereomers. But the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, same shift. So that suggests that the molecule is perhaps a diastereomer with the same proton environment? I'm not so sure.

Wait, another angle. The NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, but same shift. Why same shift? Maybe because the two diastereomers have the same chemical environment for that proton. That could happen if the diastereomers are epimers at a position not affecting that proton's environment. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe it's a result of some kind of tautomerism or exchange between two structures, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, the question also says that the NMR peaks have similar shifts and roughly equal integrals. So each is about 0.5H. So this could be a case where the molecule has two stereoisomers, but in solution, the alpha proton is experiencing two different environments, leading to two peaks. But in that case, the shifts would differ.

Wait, another possibility: if the crude compound is a mixture of a compound and its deuterated form. But that would change the mass, so the LC-MS would show different m/z. So probably not.

Hmm. Let's think about the options again. The options are A) precursor, B) enantiomers, C) double coupling, D) diastereomers.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be different because it's a larger molecule (the precursor would have more atoms, maybe). But the question says the mass is consistent with the expected molecule, so probably not. So A is unlikely.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. But in the NMR, if it's a racemic mixture, the peaks would be the same, so why two peaks? Unless something else is happening. Wait, maybe the solvent is causing some kind of splitting, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe the sample is not pure, but the question says the NMR looks expected except for these two peaks. So perhaps it's not the enantiomers.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond. I'm not exactly sure what this means. Could it be a situation where two amide bonds formed, leading to a different structure. Maybe a diketone or something else? Or perhaps incomplete coupling leading to some byproduct? But I'm not certain. However, the NMR and MS data don't seem to fit that scenario.

Option D: Mixture of diastereomers. If it's a diastereomeric mixture, the NMR would show different shifts for each corresponding proton. But if for some reason, the two diastereomers have the same chemical shift for that alpha-proton, then the NMR would show two peaks. But how likely is that? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the two diastereomers have the same environment for that proton, which would require some symmetry. But I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. Another thought: if the two diastereomers have the same shift for that proton, but differ elsewhere, the NMR would show two peaks for the same proton, but perhaps the rest of the peaks would also split. But the question says that the NMR otherwise looks correct. So maybe the other protons are either not split or have the same shifts as well, which would be very unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the two diastereomers have the same shift for that proton but different elsewhere. But the question only mentions the alpha-proton having duplicate peaks, so perhaps the other protons are fine.

Wait, but if it's diastereomers, the MS would be the same because the mass is same. So the LC-MS would show two peaks, matching D.

But the NMR would usually show different shifts for each diastereomer's protons, unless for that specific proton, the shifts are the same. But why would that happen?

Wait another possibility: The problem is that the crude compound has not been purified. So perhaps during the synthesis, there's some byproduct. But the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass, so same molecular weight. So the byproduct would have same molecular weight as the desired product, which implies it's either an isomer or a tautomer, but more likely an isomer.

So if the crude contains the desired product plus another isomer, that would explain the two peaks in LC-MS. And in the NMR, if the isomer has the same shift for that alpha-proton (maybe in a symmetric position), you'd see two peaks. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that during synthesis, the product formed as a racemic mixture, but the NMR doesn't show split peaks because the enantiomers are in solution. Wait, but the question says that the two peaks have roughly equal integrals, so each is about 0.5H. So if the sample is a racemic mixture, why are there two peaks? Because enantiomers have same NMR shifts.

Wait a minute, maybe the sample is a racemic mixture, but the NMR is being recorded in a way that shows each enantiomer's peak. Oh, but no, that shouldn't happen because in an achiral solvent, the enantiomers would interconvert quickly, leading to a single peak.

Unless the sample is not in solution, but that's not the case.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The key points are:

1. 1H NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, same shift, integral 1H together.

2. Coupling doesn't explain it because the coupling pattern is ruled out.

3. LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass, same intensity.

So, the two compounds in the mixture have same molecular weight (so same number of atoms), but different structures. It can't be a precursor because the mass would be higher.

So, they're isomers. Either enantiomers or diastereomers.

If they're enantiomers, the NMR would show a single peak because the environments are same. But the question says two peaks, so that's conflicting.

If they're diastereomers, NMR would show different shifts for the same protons. Unless the two diastereomers have the same environment for that proton.

Wait, perhaps the diastereomers have the same shift for that proton. For example, if the diastereomers are epimers, and the epimer position is such that the alpha proton's environment is the same. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, maybe the diastereomers are due to different substituents elsewhere, but the alpha proton's environment is same. Hmm.

Another angle: Take the LC-MS into account. If the two peaks are same mass, same intensity, then the two are structural isomers. So perhaps the compound is a racemic mixture, and the two enantiomers are causing the same mass. But because the synthesis is incomplete, so you have a racemic mix, but that doesn't explain the NMR.

Wait, but wait. The NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. If the compound is a diastereomer, each would have their own set of peaks, but if the two diastereomers have the same shift for that proton, perhaps the two would be superimposed, but it's hard to imagine.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that during synthesis, the amide bond formed in two different ways. Like, in the reaction, sometimes the coupling occurs twice, leading to a different structure. So the product is a mixture of the correct product and an over-coupled product. But how would that affect the NMR and LC-MS.

Wait, option C says 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps that would lead to an extra group, like an additional carbonyl or something, but that would change the molecular mass. So in LC-MS, the other product would have a different mass, which is not the case here. So C might not fit.

So, perhaps the correct answer is B, the mixture of enantiomers. But as I thought earlier, that would lead to a single NMR peak for each proton because they're enantiomers. Unless something else is happening.

Wait, but wait. What if the crude compound is a racemic mixture, and the NMR is showing two peaks because of the presence of a diastereomeric impurity? But the question says that the NMR is otherwise consistent, so probably not.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the crude sample has a mixture of the desired product and a diastereomeric byproduct, leading to two peaks in LC-MS. But then the NMR would also show other changes besides the alpha-proton.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let's try to think of each option.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. So, racemic mix. The NMR would show the same peaks for each enantiomer, so no two peaks for same proton. But the question says two peaks. So perhaps this is not the case.

Option D: Mixture of diastereomers. So, two diastereomers. The NMR for that alpha proton would have two peaks if the diastereomers have different environments, but same shift? Unlikely. Or maybe the diastereomers have the same shift for that proton, but different elsewhere. But why would that be? Maybe if the diastereomers are epimers at a position not affecting that proton's environment.

Wait, for example, if the molecule has two stereocenters, and the diastereomers differ at a different center. So the alpha proton's environment is same for both. Then, the NMR would show two peaks for the same proton. That could fit.

But in that case, the diastereomers would have same shift for that proton, but different for others. So the NMR would show multiple other peaks as well. But the question says the NMR is otherwise consistent, so perhaps in this case, only that alpha proton is split.

Wait, but the question says the NMR is consistent with the expected molecule, except for two peaks. So perhaps all other peaks are as expected, only the alpha has two. So the other protons are same. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the two diastereomers are identical except for a substituent elsewhere that doesn't affect the alpha proton's environment, leading to same shifts. So that could explain two peaks.

In that case, the LC-MS would show two peaks, same mass, same intensity. So D would be correct.

But then, the option D says mixture of diastereoisomers. So that's a possible answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a racemic mixture and the impurity is something else, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the synthesis led to a mix of the correct product and a byproduct that is a diastereomer, which has same molecular weight. So the LC-MS shows two peaks, same mass, same intensity. So the NMR would show two peaks for the same alpha proton if the diastereomer has same shift.

But that seems unlikely, but perhaps possible if the diastereomer has same environment for that proton.

So, considering all this, the most likely answer is either B or D.

But the question's NMR shows two peaks for same proton, same shift. If the sample were a racemic mixture, then each enantiomer contributes a peak, but why two? Because the enantiomers don't split the peaks in NMR. So perhaps B isn't the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. If the crude is a racemic mixture of a meso compound, then the NMR would see each enantiomer as same, but the structure itself is a meso form. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diastereomer mixture, leading to two peaks in the NMR, same shift.

Wait, but diastereomers usually have different shifts. So I'm not confident, but given the options, D seems more plausible than B.

Alternatively, another possibility: The two peaks are due to a single molecule exchanging between two states. But that's more a dynamic process, not a static mixture.

Wait, but the question says the NMR has two peaks, same shift. So, perhaps the two peaks are from the same molecule, but in different environments, perhaps due to some interconversion.

But the LC-MS shows two peaks, so that points to two different compounds.

So, if the LC-MS shows two compounds, same mass, same intensity, then they must be isomers. So either enantiomers or diastereomers.

But enantiomers would not cause NMR to split. So, it must be diastereomers.

So, the NMR shows two peaks for same proton, same shift.

Wait, perhaps the diastereomers have same shift for that proton. So, the option D is correct.

Thus, the most likely answer is D) Mixture of diastereoisomers.


The question involves analyzing a crude peptidic compound based on its 1H NMR and LC-MS data. The key observations are:

1. **1H NMR Spectrum**: The spectrum is consistent with the expected molecule, except for two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts, roughly equal integrals (together integrating to 1H), and the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause.

2. **LC-MS Analysis**: The LC-MS shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities, and both have the same mass spectrum, consistent with the expected molecule.

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**
- A precursor would typically have a different molecular weight (higher mass) than the expected product. However, the LC-MS data shows two peaks with the same mass, ruling out the presence of a precursor.  
- **Conclusion**: Unlikely.

#### **Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**
- Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images and have identical NMR spectra because their environments are identical. If the compound were a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak for the alpha-proton, not two peaks.  
- **Conclusion**: Unlikely.

#### **Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**
- "Double coupling" could refer to an issue during synthesis, such as the formation of an extra bond or byproduct. However, this would likely result in a compound with a different molecular mass, which contradicts the LC-MS data showing two peaks with the same mass.  
- **Conclusion**: Unlikely.

#### **Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**
- Diastereomers have different physical properties, including NMR shifts, but they can have the same molecular weight. If the two diastereomers have the same chemical environment for the alpha-proton, their NMR spectra would show two peaks with similar chemical shifts. This aligns with the observation of two peaks in the NMR spectrum.  
- The LC-MS data showing two peaks of equal intensity and the same mass is consistent with the presence of two diastereomers.  
- **Conclusion**: Most likely.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, which accounts for the observations in both the NMR and LC-MS data.

**Answer: D**
