Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a particle, and I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the decay of a Pi-plus meson into a mu-plus and a neutrino. The reaction is written as π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν. The pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. I'm supposed to find the kinetic energy of the product particles. The options given are A to D, each providing two energies, which I assume are the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino respectively.

Wait, wait. The problem states that the pion is stationary, so the total momentum before decay is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So, p_mu = -p_nu. But since the neutrino is a lepton, it's super light. Wait, but in reality, neutrinos have very tiny (but non-zero) masses. Hmm, but in particle physics, sometimes people approximate the neutrino mass as zero, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, but the problem gives rest masses of the pion and the muon. It doesn't mention the neutrino's mass. Oh, right, because in the standard model, the neutrino is considered massless, but in reality, they do have mass. But in this problem, maybe we can treat the neutrino as massless? Or perhaps the problem expects us to use the rest mass of the neutrino as zero. I'll have to think about that.

So, the given data:
- Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²
- Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_mu) = 105.7 MeV/c²
- Neutrino (ν) mass: since it's not given, perhaps m_nu is considered zero? Or maybe the problem expects us to take it as negligible.

Wait, but in reality, the muon neutrino has a mass, but for the sake of this problem, maybe it's taken as zero. Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't specify, but I think in such decay problems, the neutrino's mass is often neglected because it's so small. So I'll
