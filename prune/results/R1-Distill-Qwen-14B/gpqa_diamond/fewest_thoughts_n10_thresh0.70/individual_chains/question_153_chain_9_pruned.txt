Alright, so I've got this problem here about the Michael addition reactions. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let's try to work through this step by step.

Okay, the question has three separate reactions labeled A, B, and C, each with their own reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and match them with the options provided.

Let's start with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). 

Wait, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the attack of an enolate on a beta, gamma-unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, the nucleophile is the enolate, and the electrophilic part is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Dimethyl malonate is a good enolate precursor. Under basic conditions like NaOEt, it would lose a proton to form an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position of the other carbonyl compound, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the beta carbon. Wait, no. Let me draw it out. The structure is more like O=C-OCH3 attached to CH2-CH(p-tolyl), but since it's E, the double bond is CH2-CH(p-tolyl) with the substituents across.

Wait, the structure is probably (E)-CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the CH2. Wait no, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait. No, perhaps I'm getting confused. The correct structure for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tol
