Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step.

First, the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1. The NMR data for product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Hmm, what could this be?

IR at 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, probably an ester or ketone. But wait, since it's made from dibromide and KOH, maybe it's elimination. Oh! KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So probably, the dibromide undergoes dehydrohalogenation.

1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH would likely form an epoxide because when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halides) react with a base, they typically form epoxides. Wait, but epoxide formation is usually done with a peracid or other oxidizing conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a double bond. But wait, 1,3 positions are not adjacent; adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four-membered rings. So 1 and 3 are two carbons apart. Wait, but in adamantane, the structure is such that each carbon is connected in a way that 1,3 would be on opposite sides or something. Wait, maybe I should think about what 1,3-dibromoadamantane looks like.

Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. In this structure, each bridgehead (the corners where multiple rings meet) is a carbon. So 1,
