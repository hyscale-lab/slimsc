Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. They've given me the components of the operator P in the X, Y, and Z directions.

Hmm, right. So first, I remember that a quantum mechanical operator for angular momentum, like spin, can be written in terms of its components along any direction. The eigenvalues for spin are ±ħ/2, and the eigenvectors correspond to the spin-up and spin-down states along that direction.

Wait, but the operator here is P, not S. But I think the structure is similar, so maybe the same approach applies.

The direction n is in the x-z plane. So any direction in the x-z plane can be described using an angle θ from the z-axis. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane implies that the y-component is zero, so the direction has θ from the z-axis and φ=0, perhaps? Or maybe φ is another parameter, but for the x-z plane, φ is 0 because it's along the x and z axes.

Wait, the direction vector n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) where θ is the angle from the positive z-axis. So for example, θ=0 would be along +z, θ=90 degrees would be along +x.

The operator P is given in terms of its X, Y, and Z components. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

So, P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]].
Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]].
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are similar to these. The Paul
