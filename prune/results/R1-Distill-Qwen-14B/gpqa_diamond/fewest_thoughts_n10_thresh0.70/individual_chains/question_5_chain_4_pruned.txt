Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a muon's operator along an arbitrary direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says the operator is P, and it's given for components X, Y, and Z. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like this are often related to angular momentum or spin. Since the muon is a lepton, similar to an electron, I'm guessing it has a spin-1/2 system, so the eigenvalues would be ±ħ/2.

The eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I'm looking for a vector that, when the operator P acts on it, gives (ħ/2) multiplied by the vector itself.

Wait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right, so the direction is in the x-z plane, which means the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and phi would be zero because it's in the x-z plane. So any direction in x-z would have phi=0.

But wait, the operator is given in terms of its components. So the general form for a spin operator along an arbitrary axis would be P = (P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z). Oh, but wait, no, actually for the operator in direction n, it's probably the combination of the components scaled by the direction cosines. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the eigenvector of this operator. So the operator is the vector dot product of the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Oh, right, because the Pauli matrices are for spin-1/2 systems.

So each component:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the operator in the direction of n is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z
