Okay, so I have this physics problem about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that when charges oscillate, they can radiate energy, right? The question is about the radiated power per unit solid angle and the fraction of the maximum power at a specific angle.

Wait, the setup is an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. So it's symmetric around the z-axis, which probably means the radiation pattern has some symmetry too. The power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis.

The problem says that the maximum power is A. They're asking what fraction of A is radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and also what the possible form of f is. The options give fractions and lambda dependencies.

I think I remember that for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is a function of theta. The power pattern for a dipole in the far field (radiation zone) is proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta)) or something like that. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again: for an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field is given by the dipole radiation formula. The intensity (which is power per unit area) varies with the square of the cosine of theta, or something like that. Oh wait, I think the radiation intensity for a dipole is proportional to (sin^2(theta)) — no, wait, let me get this right.

Wait, no, the dipole radiation intensity has a maximum at theta = 90 degrees. Because for a dipole, the radiation is strongest when you're looking perpendicular to the dipole axis. So the intensity pattern is proportional to sin^2(theta). So the maximum would be when sin(theta) is 1, which is theta=90 degrees.

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The dipole's radiation pattern is maximum at theta=90 degrees. So the intensity I is proportional to sin^2(theta). So at theta=0, intensity is zero. At theta=90, it's maximum. So if the maximum is at theta=90, then the problem's theta is 30 degrees, which is less than 90. So the fraction would be (sin(30))^2 over the maximum, which is sin(90)^2=1. So sin(30)=0.5, squared is 0.25. So the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4. So the fraction of the maximum power A would be 1/4.

But wait, the question says the maximum power is A. So if maximum is at 90, then the power at 30 degrees is (sin^2(30)) times A, which is (0.5)^2 * A = 0.25 A. So the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4.

But wait, wait. Let me make sure I'm not mixing this up with something else. The question says the power per unit solid angle is a function f. So the total power is the integral of f over all solid angles. Wait, but the problem says "the maximum power thus radiated is A". Hmm, I think A is the maximum value of f multiplied by the solid angle element, integrated over all angles. Wait, no. Wait, the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So the maximum value of f would be A, perhaps, but I think that's not quite right.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the total power is the integral of f over all solid angles. So if f is the power per unit solid angle, then the total power P is the integral of f dΩ, where dΩ is sin(theta) dtheta dphi. But the maximum power per unit solid angle is A, which would be the maximum value of f. So the maximum value of f is A.

Wait, that makes more sense. So f(theta) has a maximum value A at some theta. So the fraction of A at theta=30 degrees is f(30)/A.

So, if f(theta) is proportional to sin^2(theta), then f(theta) = k sin^2(theta), and the maximum is when sin(theta)=1, so k = A. So f(theta) = A sin^2(theta). Then, at theta=30 degrees, f(30) = A (0.5)^2 = A/4. So the fraction is 1/4, which is 0.25 of A.

So the fraction is 1/4. Now, what about the form of f? The options give lambda dependencies. So f is a function of lambda and theta.

From the dipole radiation formula, the intensity (which is power per unit area) is proportional to (omega^4)/(r^2) and (sin^2(theta)), but when considering the power per unit solid angle, which is intensity multiplied by r^2 (since power per unit solid angle is like intensity times area per solid angle, and intensity is power per area), wait, no.

Wait, the intensity (Poynting vector) is S, which is power per unit area. The power per unit solid angle (in the far field) would be S multiplied by the area per solid angle, which is r^2 sin(theta) dtheta dphi. So the power per unit solid angle is S / (sin(theta) dtheta dphi) )? No, wait, no. Wait, the solid angle is dΩ = sin(theta) dtheta dphi. So the power in a solid angle element dΩ is S * dA, where dA is the area. But in the far field, dA = r^2 dΩ, since the area is r^2 sin(theta) dtheta dphi. So S = power per area (W/m²), and power dP = S * dA = S * r² sin(theta) dtheta dphi. So the power per unit solid angle is dP/dΩ = S * r². But in the far field, r is large, and perhaps they're considering the radiation zone where r is large, so we can express f as proportional to 1/(lambda)^n for some n, multiplied by a function of theta.

Wait, I think the general form of the radiated electric field for dipole radiation is E ~ (e^{ikr}) / r, where k is the wave number, which is 2pi/lambda. So the intensity S, which is proportional to E^2, would go as 1/r^2. But the power per unit solid angle would be S times r² sin(theta) dtheta dphi, but wait, no, the power per unit solid angle is S * r². Because dP = S * r² sin(theta) dtheta dphi, so dP/dΩ = S r². So S is proportional to (omega^2 / c^2) * (dipole moment)^2 / r^2. Thus, S ~ (omega^4) / r^2 * (some function of theta). So when multiplied by r², the 1/r² cancels, and the power per unit solid angle f is proportional to omega^4 times the function of theta.

But omega is 2pi times the frequency, and the wavelength lambda is c/(f) = c/(omega/2pi) )= 2pi c / omega → omega = 2pi c / lambda. So omega^4 is (2pi c / lambda)^4. So substituting omega in terms of lambda, omega^4 = (2pi c)^4 / lambda^4. So f(theta) is proportional to (1/lambda^4) multiplied by a function of theta.

So f(theta) ∝ (1/lambda^4) sin^2(theta). So the form of f is lambda^(-4) multiplied by sin^2(theta) or something similar. Looking at the options, the forms given are lambda^(-4) and others. So option C says 1/4 and lambda^(-4), which matches with the fraction being 1/4 and the dependence lambda^(-4).

Wait, but the problem says the function f is a function of lambda and theta. So the f would have a term like lambda^(-4) multiplied by sin^2(theta), which would make the overall function f proportional to lambda^-4.

So putting it all together: the fraction is 1/4, and the form is lambda^-4. Looking at the options, option C says 1/4 and lambda^-4. So the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution with spheroidal symmetry along the z-axis. The radiated power per unit solid angle, denoted as \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), depends on the wavelength \(\lambda\) and the angle \(\theta\) with respect to the z-axis. The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the form of \( f \).

For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern in the far field is proportional to \( \sin^2(\theta) \). The maximum power occurs at \(\theta = 90^\circ\), where \(\sin(90^\circ) = 1\). At \(\theta = 30^\circ\), \(\sin(30^\circ) = 0.5\), so the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is:

\[
\text{Fraction} = \frac{\sin^2(30^\circ)}{\sin^2(90^\circ)} = \frac{(0.5)^2}{1} = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Next, the form of \( f \) is analyzed. The radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to the square of the electric field, which scales as \( \omega^4 / \lambda^4 \), where \(\omega\) is the angular frequency. Substituting \(\omega = 2\pi c / \lambda\), the dependence on \(\lambda\) becomes \(\lambda^{-4}\). Thus, \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) has the form:

\[
f(\lambda, \theta) \propto \frac{1}{\lambda^4} \sin^2(\theta).
\]

Combining these results, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \( 1/4 \), and the form of \( f \) is \(\lambda^{-4}\). This matches the description in option C.
