Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, CPT. Let me list them out:

1. Lorentz Symmetry
2. Poincare Symmetry
3. CP Symmetry
4. CPT Symmetry

The choices are A through D, each combining these.

Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused between Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shift in space and time). But in the context of a field theory, especially when we're talking about operators, do SMEFT operators need to respect both? Or is it just Lorentz?

I think the SMEFT is built in a way that maintains the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry because it includes special relativity. So SMEFT must also respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz and translations. But wait, do all SMEFT operators automatically respect both? Or is Lorentz included in Poincare?

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincare since Poincare includes all the transformations that Lorentz does, plus the translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is whether all operators must respect each symmetry.

Wait the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator is Poincare-invariant, it's automatically Lorentz-invariant. But does each operator have to individually respect Lorentz, or is Poincare sufficient?

Hmm, perhaps I should think about whether each operator must respect Lorentz symmetry. Since SMEFT is an effective theory, all the operators must be written in a way that's compatible with the underlying theory's symmetries. The underlying SM has Poincare symmetry, so the SMEFT operators must as well. So each operator must respect Poincare.

Wait, but I'm not sure if SMEFT requires operators to be Poincare invariant on their own. Maybe the P
