Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Hmm, I remember that when particles and their antiparticles annihilate, they produce photons. But wait, let me think about the specifics.

The setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Wait, Lorentz factors. Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time, length, and mass dilate. It's calculated as gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, for the electron, gamma is 4, and for the positron, it's 2.

But wait, the electron and positron are moving towards each other. So their velocities are in opposite directions. I should probably find their speeds to get their momenta.

But wait, since they annihilate, their combined energy and momentum must be considered. The total energy would be the sum of their rest mass energies plus their kinetic energies. But since they are moving, their total energy includes their kinetic energy.

Wait, when two particles annihilate, the photons' momenta and energies must balance the system's total momentum and energy. Since the system is isolated, the total momentum before annihilation must be equal to the total after.

Wait, but in this case, the question says that the two photons have the same energy. So their energies are equal, but their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So maybe they're symmetric in some way.

But wait, the initial particles are moving in opposite directions, so their momenta might be opposite as well. Let me think about the system's total momentum before annihilation.

The electron is moving to the right (since it's moving from the left along the horizontal axis). The positron is moving to the left (from the right). So their momenta would be in opposite directions.

Let me compute each particle's momentum. For a relativistic particle, the momentum p is gamma * m * v. But wait, for electrons and positrons, their rest mass is same, m. So, let's compute p_electron and p_positron.

Electron: gamma_e =4, so p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.
Positron: gamma_p =2, p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p.

But wait, since they are moving towards each other, v_e is to the right, v_p is to the left. So their momenta would add as vectors. Let me define the positive direction as the electron's direction (to the right). So the positron's velocity is to the left, so its momentum is negative.

Wait, but wait, the positron's momentum is gamma_p * m_p * v_p, and v_p is to the left, which is negative. So p_p is negative, p_e is positive.

Wait, but what about their velocities in terms of c? Since gamma is 4 for the electron, let's find v_e.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). For gamma_e =4:

1/(4)^2 = 1 - (v_e^2)/(c^2)

Wait, 1/(gamma^2) = 1 - v²/c² → (1/16) = 1 - v_e²/c² → v_e² = c² (1 - 1/16) = (15/16) c² → v_e= c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4)c ≈ 0.968 c. Wait, sqrt(15) is about 3.872, so 3.872/4≈0.968.

Similarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2. So 1/(2^2)=1 - v_p²/c² → 1/4 = 1 - v_p²/c² → v_p² = (3/4)c² → v_p= (sqrt(3)/2)c ≈0.866 c.

So the positron's speed is 0.866c to the left, and the electron's speed is 0.968c to the right.

So their momenta are:

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e → 4 * m_e * (0.968c) ≈ 3.872 m_e c
p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p → 2 * m_e * (0.866c) * (-1) → because it's moving left, so p_p is negative.

So p_p is -2 * m_e * 0.866 c ≈ -1.732 m_e c.

Wait, wait: the positron's momentum is opposite, so when adding the total momentum, it's p_e + p_p.

Wait, no: the positron is moving left, so if the electron's momentum is positive (right), then positron's is negative. So the total initial momentum is 3.872 m_e c (right) + (-1.732 m_e c) → 3.872 -1.732 = 2.14 m_e c to the right.

That's the total momentum before annihilation.

After annihilation, the system's momentum must be the same. So the photons' momenta must sum to the same as the initial momentum, which is 2.14 m_e c to the right.

The photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So their momenta are vectors in the right direction in the x-component, but the y-components are positive and negative respectively.

Wait, but the problem states that the two photons have the same energy. So their energies E1 = E2 = E_photon.

But energy of a photon is E = |p| c, because for photons, E = pc (since m=0). So the magnitude of each photon's momentum is E_photon / c.

But since both photons have same energy, their magnitudes of momentum are same. Let's denote the magnitude as p_photon.

So each photon has a momentum vector with magnitude p_photon, but in different directions. Let's model them as vectors.

Let me denote photon 1 as moving at an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 as moving at an angle theta below the x-axis, since their directions are symmetric about the x-axis.

Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So the angles would be symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So their angles are theta and -theta, but both in the right direction.

Wait, but wait: if the two photons have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum are same, but their directions are symmetric. So their x-components would be p_photon * cos(theta) and p_photon * cos(theta), adding to 2 p_photon cos(theta). The y-components would be p_photon * sin(theta) and -p_photon * sin(theta), which cancel each other out.

Wait, but the total momentum after annihilation is the sum of the two photons' momenta. So:

Total momentum after = (p1 + p2) = (p_photon (cos(theta) + cos(theta)), p_photon (sin(theta) - sin(theta)) )

Wait, no. Because p1 is (p_photon * cos(theta), p_photon * sin(theta)), and p2 is (p_photon * cos(theta'), p_photon * sin(theta') ). Wait, but I thought they were symmetric, so theta' = -theta.

Wait, no, the problem says one is upper-right and another is lower-right. So their angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, but not necessarily same magnitude. Wait, but perhaps they are symmetric, like theta and -theta. So their y-components cancel.

Wait, but let me think again. The total momentum after is (p1 + p2) = (p_photon [cos(theta1) + cos(theta2)], p_photon [sin(theta1) + sin(theta2)]) )

But since the initial system's momentum is entirely in the x-direction (2.14 m_e c to the right), the total momentum after must have zero y-component and x-component equal to 2.14 m_e c.

So, for the photons' momenta to sum to this, their y-components must cancel each other. So:

sin(theta1) + sin(theta2) = 0 → sin(theta1) = - sin(theta2)

Which implies that theta2 = - theta1, or theta2 = 180 - theta1, but considering their direction is right, the angles are measured from the x-axis towards upper and lower. So, the angles are theta and -theta, but their y-components are positive and negative. So sum is zero, which works.

So, the x-components are p_photon cos(theta) and p_photon cos(theta), assuming both have the same angle magnitude above and below. So their sum is 2 p_photon cos(theta).

This sum must equal the initial total momentum, which is 2.14 m_e c.

So, 2 p_photon cos(theta) = 2.14 m_e c.

But p_photon is the magnitude of each photon's momentum, which equals E_photon / c. And since both photons have same energy, let me denote E_photon as E.

So p_photon = E / c.

But what about the total energy? The system's total energy before annihilation should equal the sum of the photons' energies.

The total energy before is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

Each particle's energy is gamma * m_e c².

Electron: E_e = 4 m_e c².

Positron: E_p = 2 m_e c².

So total energy before E_total = 4 m_e c² + 2 m_e c² = 6 m_e c².

After annihilation, the photons' energies sum to E_photon + E_photon = 2 E_photon.

So 2 E_photon = 6 m_e c² → E_photon = 3 m_e c².

Wait, that can't be right. Because each photon's energy is 3 m_e c²? Wait, but that would make each photon's momentum E_photon / c = 3 m_e c² / c = 3 m_e c.

Wait, but wait, the total energy is 6 m_e c², so two photons each with energy 3 m_e c².

But earlier, the momentum equation is 2 p_photon cos(theta) = 2.14 m_e c.

Wait, substituting p_photon = E_photon / c = (3 m_e c²) / c = 3 m_e c.

So 2 * 3 m_e c * cos(theta) = 2.14 m_e c → 6 m_e c cos(theta) = 2.14 m_e c.

Divide both sides by m_e c: 6 cos(theta) = 2.14 → cos(theta) = 2.14 /6 ≈ 0.3567.

So theta ≈ arccos(0.3567) ≈ approximately 69 degrees. Because cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)=0.342, so 0.356 is between 69 and 70. Let's say 69 degrees.

But wait, the photons are at theta and -theta. So the angle between them would be 2 theta, which is about 138 degrees.

Wait, because each photon is at +theta and -theta, so the angle between them is 2 theta. So if theta is ~69 degrees, then 2 theta is ~138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Total momentum before annihilation:

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.

v_e = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma_e)^2 )) c → sqrt(1- 1/16 )= sqrt(15/16 )= sqrt(15)/4 c ≈0.968c.

Similarly, p_e = 4 * m_e * 0.968 c ≈ 4 * 0.968 m_e c = 3.872 m_e c.

Positron's momentum: gamma_p =2, v_p = sqrt(1 -1/4 )= sqrt(3/4 )= sqrt(3)/2 c ≈0.866c.

p_p = 2 * m_e * ( -0.866 c ) → -1.732 m_e c.

Total initial momentum: 3.872 -1.732 = 2.14 m_e c to the right.

After annihilation:

Each photon's energy E_photon =3 m_e c².

Each photon's momentum magnitude p_photon=3 m_e c.

But their x-components sum to 2.14 m_e c.

So 2 * p_photon * cos(theta) =2.14 m_e c → 2*(3 m_e c) cos(theta) = 2.14 m_e c → 6 cos(theta) =2.14 → cos(theta)=2.14/6≈0.3567 → theta≈69 degrees.

So the angle between the photons is 2 theta ≈138 degrees. So the answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the situation where an electron and a positron annihilate into two photons. The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2. The photons produced have the same energy and move in symmetric directions: one in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction. The goal is to determine the angle between the two photons.

### Key Steps:

1. **Initial Momentum of the System**:
   - The electron's momentum is calculated as:
     \[
     p_e = \gamma_e \cdot m_e \cdot v_e
     \]
     where \(\gamma_e = 4\), \(v_e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}}c = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}c \approx 0.968c\). Thus:
     \[
     p_e = 4 \cdot m_e \cdot 0.968c \approx 3.872 m_e c
     \]
   - The positron's momentum is:
     \[
     p_p = \gamma_p \cdot m_p \cdot v_p
     \]
     where \(\gamma_p = 2\), \(v_p = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}}c = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}c \approx 0.866c\). Thus:
     \[
     p_p = 2 \cdot m_e \cdot (-0.866c) \approx -1.732 m_e c
     \]
   - The total initial momentum is:
     \[
     p_{\text{total}} = p_e + p_p = 3.872 m_e c - 1.732 m_e c = 2.14 m_e c \, (\text{to the right}).
     \]

2. **Energy Conservation**:
   - The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e \cdot m_e c^2 + \gamma_p \cdot m_p c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2
     \]
   - After annihilation, the total energy is carried by the two photons, each with energy \(E_{\text{photon}}\). Thus:
     \[
     2 E_{\text{photon}} = 6 m_e c^2 \implies E_{\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c^2
     \]

3. **Photon Momentum and Symmetry**:
   - For photons, energy and momentum are related by \(E = pc\). Thus, the magnitude of each photon's momentum is:
     \[
     p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c
     \]
   - The photons move symmetrically, one at an angle \(\theta\) above the x-axis and the other at \(-\theta\) below the x-axis. The x-components of their momenta add, while the y-components cancel:
     \[
     p_{\text{total}} = 2 p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta
     \]
     Substituting \(p_{\text{total}} = 2.14 m_e c\) and \(p_{\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c\):
     \[
     2 (3 m_e c) \cos\theta = 2.14 m_e c \implies 6 \cos\theta = 2.14 \implies \cos\theta = \frac{2.14}{6} \approx 0.3567
     \]
   - Solving for \(\theta\):
     \[
     \theta \approx \arccos(0.3567) \approx 69^\circ
     \]

4. **Angle Between the Photons**:
   - The angle between the two photons is \(2\theta\), as one is at \(\theta\) and the other at \(-\theta\). Thus:
     \[
     \text{Angle between photons} = 2\theta \approx 2 \cdot 69^\circ = 138^\circ
     \]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
