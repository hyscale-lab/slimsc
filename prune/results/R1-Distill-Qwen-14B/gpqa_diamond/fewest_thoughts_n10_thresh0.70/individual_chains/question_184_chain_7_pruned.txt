Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are 2, 1, and 3 respectively. Wait, actually, I should double-check the numbering. Oh wait, benzene is a ring, so the numbering goes like this: the ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl at 2, and the nitro at 3. Because in naming, the substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. Hmm, maybe I should visualize the structure.

So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's imagine the ring: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So they're all adjacent to each other in a sort of meta arrangement, but wait, ethoxy and tert-butyl are at 1 and 2, which are adjacent, and then nitro is at 3, which is adjacent to 2. So the substituents are in the order OCH2CH3 (position 1), t-Bu (position 2), and NO2 (position 3). 

Now, the synthesis starts with benzene, so I need to introduce each substituent in the correct order, considering the directing effects of each group. Remember, the order in which you introduce substituents can affect where the next group attaches because each substituent directs incoming electrophiles either ortho, meta, or para.

Let's list the substituents we need to add: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. Let's think about the directing effects. 

The ethoxy group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. The nitro group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. The tert-butyl group is an activating, since it's an alkyl group, and it's also ortho/para-directing because it's an activating substituent.

Wait, but the nitro group is a strong deactivating group. So once it's introduced, it will deactivate the ring, making further electrophilic substitution reactions harder. So the timing of introducing nitro is important.

I think the best approach is to introduce the nitro group last because it's a strong deactivating group. That way, when adding the other substituents, the ring is still activated. Let me think about the steps.

The target molecule has three substituents. So we need three substitution reactions. The initial benzene will get each substituent in some order. Let's consider the order.

Option 1: Introduce nitro group last. So first, introduce ethoxy and tert-butyl, then nitro. But wait, ethoxy is an activating group, which directs incoming substituents to ortho and para. Similarly, tert-butyl is activating and also ortho/para
