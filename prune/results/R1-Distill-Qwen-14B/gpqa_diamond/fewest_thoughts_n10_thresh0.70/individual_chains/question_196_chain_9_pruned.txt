Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, that's a bit advanced for me, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different formula.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, a simple harmonic oscillator's maximum speed is given by v_max = ωA, where ω is the angular frequency. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so I can't use the classical formulas directly. Relativity comes into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, but maybe here it's just the approach that's different.

The problem says it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So, the force is still the same as in the classical case. But in relativity, the equations of motion change because of the relativistic mass or maybe using the energy approach.

Let me think about the energy. In a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. For the classical case, it's (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kx², and at maximum displacement (amplitude A), the potential is maximum and kinetic is zero. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore because of the gamma factor.

Wait, but in relativity, the total energy of the oscillator should also account for relativistic momentum and
