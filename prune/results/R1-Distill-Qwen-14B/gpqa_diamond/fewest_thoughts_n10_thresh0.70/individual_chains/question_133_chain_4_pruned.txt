Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of buffer solutions and pH calculations. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard, so maybe some constants are familiar.

The question is asking about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-. But wait, phosphoric acid (H3PO4) has three dissociation steps. So the species in solution would be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but sometimes people refer to the various hydrogen species as orthophosphates. Wait, no, I think orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, which is PO4^3-. Hmm, maybe I should double-check that. Alternatively, sometimes the terms can be confusing. Wait, the problem refers to orthophosphate ions, so probably PO4^3-.

So the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let's think about their dissociation.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissociates in water, it gives K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So that's a source of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium phosphate dibasic with two waters of crystallization. When it dissociates, it should give Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So that's a source of HPO4^2-.

So we have a solution with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Wait a minute, that means we have a buffer solution because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- and vice versa. So this is a buffer system involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-
