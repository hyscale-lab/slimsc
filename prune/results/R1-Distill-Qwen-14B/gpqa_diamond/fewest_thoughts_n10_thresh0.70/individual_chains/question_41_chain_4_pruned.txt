Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's break it down. The question says a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We're supposed to find the speed of light relative to the observer. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But here, the medium (glass) is moving, so does that affect the observed speed of light?

Oh right, in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, this is about a medium moving through the lab frame. So if the glass is moving, does that change the light's speed as measured in the lab?

Wait, no, because according to Einstein's postulate, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c regardless of the source's motion. But here, the light is in the glass, not a vacuum. So does that change things? Because in a medium, the speed is lower.

Wait, but the medium is moving. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving. So the speed of light in the glass would be c/n in the glass's rest frame. But how does that translate when the glass is moving relative to the lab?

I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think about it using relative velocity. Let's say in the glass's
