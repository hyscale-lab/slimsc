Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the intrinsic angular momentum operator, like spin, is represented by matrices. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. Oh wait, the matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S looks like:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And Ay is c * S, so plugging in c = h/(4π), that would make each element of S multiplied by that factor.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Eigenvalue problems involve solving the equation Ay |φ> = a |φ>, where a is the eigenvalue and |φ> is the eigenvector.

Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, it's manageable. Let me write down Ay explicitly:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S = [[0, -(h/(4π))i], 
                     [(h/(4π))i, 0]]

So the matrix is:

[ 0, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

Eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I)
