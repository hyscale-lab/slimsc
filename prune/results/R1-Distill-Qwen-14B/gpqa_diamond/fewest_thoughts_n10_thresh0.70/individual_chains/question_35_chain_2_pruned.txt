Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, the question says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = aφ. The matrix Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

Wait, so S is a matrix like this:
S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

The question is asking about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The options are A to D, each making a statement about these properties.

Let me recall how to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors. For a matrix operator, the eigenvalues satisfy the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix. Once we have the eigenvalues, the eigenvectors can be found by solving (Ay - aI)φ = 0.

So, first, let's write down the matrix Ay. Since Ay = c * S, let's compute it:

c = h/(4π)
So Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Which makes Ay as:
[[0, -i*(h/(4π))],
 [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

Let me denote h/(4π) as some constant for simplicity. Let's say h/(4π) = k. Then Ay becomes:
[[0, -i k], [i k, 0]]

But perhaps it's better to compute the eigenvalues directly.

The matrix Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so the characteristic equation will be:

det(Ay - aI) = 0

Which is (Ay[0][0] - a)(Ay[1][1] - a) - Ay[0][1] Ay[1][0] = 0

Substituting the values:

Ay[0][0] is 0. So (0 - a) = -a.
Ay[1][1] is 0, so (0 - a) = -a.
Ay[0][1] is -i k, and Ay[1][0] is i k.

Putting it all together:

(-a)(-a) - (-i k)(i k) = 0
Which simplifies to a² - [(-i k)(i k)] = 0

Let me compute (-i k)(i k). Let's see, multiplying these terms:

(-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So (-i k)(i k) = (1) * k^2.

So the equation becomes:
a² - (k²) = 0 → a² = k² → a = ±k.

Since k is h/(4π), the eigenvalues a are ±h/(4π). Wait, but wait—hold on. Because in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators have eigenvalues related to ħ. Since ħ = h/(2π), so h/(4π) is ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. Which is ± (h/(4π)).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B talks about eigenvalues with real and imaginary parts. But the eigenvalues here are real. So Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. That doesn't match, because our eigenvalues are real.

Wait, but wait a minute—no, wait, the matrix Ay is complex. Because it has i
