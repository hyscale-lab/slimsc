Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pericyclic reactions. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question involves three different reactions, all of which are sigmatropic rearrangements. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond with the simultaneous movement of pi bonds, like in Cope and Claisen rearrangements. These reactions usually happen under heat and sometimes acid conditions, which I think helps in the process.

The first reaction is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat to form compound A. Hmm, let me think. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine... that's an amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. The structure would be (CH3O)2CHNH2. Oh wait, but wait, it's ethanamine, so maybe it's (CH3O)2CH2NH2? No, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, so with two methoxy groups on the first carbon, it would be (CH3O)2CHNH2. So the structure is more like that.

But-3-en-2-ol is another compound. Its structure is CH2CH-OH-CH2-CH3? Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would have a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the hydroxyl on carbon 2. So structure is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? Wait, no. Let me get the structure right. Butene is four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol would have a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, no, wait. But-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C2 and C3, and the hydroxyl on C2. So structure would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait no, that can't be right because the double bond is between 3 and 4? No, wait, but numbering starts from the end. But-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C2 and C3 (since the longer chain is 4 carbons, but the lower number is chosen). So structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3, but wait, that's not right because that's butenol. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3. No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Let me think: but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3. Wait, but that can't be correct because the 'en' implies
