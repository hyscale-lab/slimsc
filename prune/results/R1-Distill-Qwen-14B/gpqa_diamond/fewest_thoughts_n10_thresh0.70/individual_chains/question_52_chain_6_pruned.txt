Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the question is about a star's photosphere and how the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. Hmm. I remember that when stars have dark spots, their overall brightness decreases, but how does that affect the temperature and the ionization states of atoms in the photosphere?

So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, why does the effective temperature decrease when spots are present? Oh right, because the spots are cooler regions on the star's surface, so they emit less radiation. So the average temperature of the star as seen from afar goes down.

The main point is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the ratio is lower than when there are none. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changesâ€”so (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots).

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of different energy levels in a gas in thermal equilibrium (LTE). The equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n is the number density, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, we're looking at two levels, level 1 and level 2. Let's say level 1 is higher in energy than level 2. So E_1 > E_2. The ratio of n1/n2 would then depend on the temperature and the energy difference.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K), and the ratio n1/n2 (assuming level 1 is the upper level) is lower than when the star was at 6000 K.

Wait,
