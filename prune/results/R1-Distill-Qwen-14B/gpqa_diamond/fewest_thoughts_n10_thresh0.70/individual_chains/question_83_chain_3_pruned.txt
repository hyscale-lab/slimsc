Okay, I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, the problem is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. The setup is that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I need to find the correct pair of pH values.

First, I should think about what's happening here. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When they react, they form the acetate ion and water. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

Wait, but before the titration, the solution is diluted. Let me calculate the concentration after dilution.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid would be volume (L) multiplied by molarity. So 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol. After dilution, the concentration is moles/volume in liters. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. Let me think about the equivalence point first because that might be easier.

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added are equal to the moles of acetic acid present. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. So the moles of NaOH needed are also 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL.

Wait, but the options don't give me the volume directly. They give me the pH at equivalence and at 25% titration. So I need to find the pH at these two points.

Let's first tackle the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The solution will consist of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The solution at equivalence point is sodium acetate. The concentration of acetate ions can be calculated by finding the concentration after dilution and then considering the moles.

Wait, the total volume at equivalence point is the initial diluted solution plus the volume of NaOH added. The initial solution was 40 mL, and the NaOH added is 10 mL
