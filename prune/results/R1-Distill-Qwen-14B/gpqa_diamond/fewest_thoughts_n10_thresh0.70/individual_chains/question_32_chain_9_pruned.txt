Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Oh wait, and X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Let me see. Lithium usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number would be 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) =6. So X is Li-6 maybe?

Wait, but in physics, when talking about ions in colliders, we usually consider the mass of the nucleus. So the mass of Li-6 would be important here. I think I'll need the mass number to calculate the relativistic energy.

The speed is given as 0.96 times the speed of light. So v = 0.96c. I remember that for relativistic speeds, the energy is given by the total energy which is gamma times the rest mass energy.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me calculate that. So plugging in v=0.96c, v squared is (0.96)^2 c squared. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Then sqrt of 0.0784 is 0.28, right? Because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Hmm, wait, let me check that again. 0.28 is 28/100, so 1/(28/100) is 100/28 ≈3.5714.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is needed. The nucleus is Li-6, so I need its mass. Wait, the mass
