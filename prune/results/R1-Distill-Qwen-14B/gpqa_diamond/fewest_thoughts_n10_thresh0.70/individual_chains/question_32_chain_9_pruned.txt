Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, it's about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is X, which is Lithium with 3 neutrons. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, first, I remember that the energy in particle accelerators is usually the kinetic energy. Oh wait, no, sometimes it's the total energy. I need to clarify that. The question says "energy of RHIC", which typically refers to the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Well, I'll proceed and maybe check later.

The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Lithium typically has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, its atomic number is 3, and mass number is 3 +3 =6. So it's Li-6. Okay, so X is Li-6.

So the mass of the nucleus is the sum of protons and neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², same for a neutron. So each proton and neutron is about 938 MeV. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so mass m = 6 * 938 MeV/c².

Wait, but wait, maybe I should consider the exact mass. Because the actual mass of a nucleus is a bit less than the sum due to binding energy, but in particle physics, sometimes we approximate using the rest mass of the nucleons, or use the exact mass. Oh, since the problem is about high energy, perhaps relativistic effects, so I should use the exact mass of the nucleus. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mass of the nucleus is just the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. So m = (3 + 3) * m_nucleon. But wait, the nucleon mass is about 938 MeV/c². So m = 6 * 938 MeV/c². Let's compute that: 6 * 938 is 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but wait. I've heard that in some cases, the mass of the nucleus is calculated using the average mass per nucleon, which is about
