Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let me see if I can figure this out.

The problem starts with compound A showing two signals in the proton NMR. The first signal is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, NMR signals often tell us about the structure of the compound. Let me think about what these signals could mean.

A triplet in the NMR usually indicates that the proton is next to a CH2 group because the splitting comes from neighboring protons. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests those hydrogens are probably attached to a methyl group (CH3) that's adjacent to another CH2. Wait, because a triplet arises from coupling with two neighboring protons, right? So if it's a triplet for 6H, maybe that's two methyl groups each coupled to a CH2.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet means each proton is next to a CH2 group with two neighboring CH2 groups perhaps? Or maybe each proton is split by three neighboring protons. Wait, quartet could come from coupling with two neighboring protons. Like, if a CH2 is next to another CH2, each proton in the CH2 would split into a quartet. So quartet for 4H could mean two CH2 groups, each split by adjacent CH2s.

Putting these together, maybe compound A is a di-substituted ether or something with two ethyl groups. Wait, ethyl groups. Let me think: each ethyl group has a CH2CH3 structure. The CH3 would be a triplet because it's next to the CH2. The CH2 would be a quartet because it's next to another CH2. But wait, in ethyl groups, the CH3 is a triplet (from adjacent CH2), and the CH2 is a quartet (from adjacent CH3). But in the NMR of compound A, the quartet is at 1.3 ppm, which is more typical for a CH2 that's adjacent to another CH2. So maybe it's a diethyl ether or some structure with two ethyl groups.

Wait, diethyl ether would have two ethyl groups connected by an oxygen. The structure would be CH2CH2-O-CH2CH3
