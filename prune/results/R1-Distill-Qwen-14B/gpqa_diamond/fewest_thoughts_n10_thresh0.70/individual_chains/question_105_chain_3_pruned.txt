Okay, let's tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, the question is about the brightness variations caused by a star's rotation and how that's similar to the effect of an exoplanet. So, the scenario is a star with some dark spots, and when it rotates, these spots change what we see, making it look like a planet is causing the dimming.

First, I remember that when a star has spots, the observed brightness changes because the spots are cooler and block some light. The amplitude of this variation depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference compared to the rest of the star. If we model this as an exoplanet transit, the planet blocks some light when it passes in front of the star. So, the question is asking, what planet radius would cause the same brightness dip as these spots?

The star's radius is the same as the Sun's. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Oh wait, so the total spot area is 20% of half the star's surface? Because one hemisphere is spotty. Let me think: the star's surface area is 4πR². One hemisphere is 2πR², so 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Wait, no, wait. The filling factor is 20%—so the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * (surface area of hemisphere). The hemisphere's area is 2πR², so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, but when the star rotates, only part of the spots are visible. Because the star is a sphere, and as it rotates, the visible area of the hemisphere with spots changes. But the problem says that photometric observations will show periodic variations due to rotation, and that this situation resembles an exoplanet. So, we need to find the planet radius Rpl such that the maximum dip in brightness is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but in the star's case, the spots are cooler. So when the spots are facing us, the star's overall brightness would drop compared to when the spots are on the far side. So the change in brightness (the amplitude of variation) would depend on the difference in brightness between the spotted and unsp
