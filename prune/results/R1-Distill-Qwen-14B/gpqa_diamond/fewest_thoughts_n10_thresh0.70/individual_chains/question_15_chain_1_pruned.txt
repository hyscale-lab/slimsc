Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They've been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, which I think is important because it affects the transit probability.

The orbital period is key here. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 has a period of P, Planet_1 is P/3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says Planet_1 has a shorter period. "Orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter"â€”so if Planet_2 has period P, Planet_1 is P/3. So Planet_1 is closer to its star because shorter orbital period usually means closer orbit (like with Kepler's third law).

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. That's interesting because a more massive star usually has a larger radius, but here they're the same. So maybe Planet_2's star is a bit evolved, maybe a subgiant or something, but same size as Planet_1's star.

We need to find which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But since the RV method already detected them, their orbits are edge-on enough for RV, but not necessarily for transit. The probability of a transit is higher when the planet's orbital plane is more likely to align with our line of sight.

Wait, but for the transit probability, the main factors are the relative size of the star and the planet, and the likelihood that the orbital plane is edge-on enough. The formula for the probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something related to the orbital inclination.

Wait, no, the transit probability is more accurately given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 + (R_s / a)), where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, maybe I'm mixing
