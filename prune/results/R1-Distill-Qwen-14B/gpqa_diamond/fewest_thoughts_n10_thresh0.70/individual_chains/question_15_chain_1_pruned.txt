Okay, so I have this question about detecting transiting planets and figuring out which one is more likely to transit. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to choose the one with the highest transit probability because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh wait, but both have the same mass. Interesting.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. So Planet_1 orbits much faster? Like, if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. But how does that affect transit probability? I remember that transit probability is related to the orbital distance and the star's size. Oh right, the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is more likely to align with our line of sight. But I think the main factors are the star's size, the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis), and the inclination.

Wait, the probability of a transit is given by the formula (R_s / a), where R_s is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. But actually, I think it's more like (R_s / a) multiplied by something else, maybe the impact parameter or considering the star's position.

Wait, another thought. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from
