Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed determined by the amplitude and the spring constant. But wait, this is relativistic, so I think I have to consider how relativity affects things.

The question says it's a 1D oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are A to D, all involving combinations of c, k, m, and A.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, which looks like the classical result. But since the question is relativistic, that's probably not the correct answer here. Relativity comes into play when velocities approach the speed of light, so I need to adjust for that.

Wait, so in relativity, the energy considerations change. The total energy in a harmonic oscillator is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. Classically, the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But relativistically, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore because of the gamma factor (Lorentz factor). 

So the total energy would include the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy. Let me think about the conservation of energy. At maximum displacement (amplitude A), the oscillator comes to rest momentarily, so all the energy is potential. The potential energy in Hooke's law is (1/2)kx², so at x=A, it's (1/2)kA². But wait, wait, in relativity, is the potential energy still (1/2)kA²? Or does that change?

Wait, no, I think the potential energy is still (1/2)kA² because Hooke's law is F = -kx, so the potential is (1/2)k x², same as before. But the kinetic energy is different. At the equilibrium position (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy at that point.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the rest mass energy is mc², but in the classical oscillator, the total energy is (1/2)kA². So in the relativistic case, when
