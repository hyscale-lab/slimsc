Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a series of reactions and figuring out the number of distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. 

First, let me parse the starting materials and reactions. The first part is combining 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. The product is called 1.

Wait, sodium iodide and elevated temperature... that sounds like an elimination reaction, maybe an E2. But wait, when you have dihalides reacting with something like NaI, it's often a substitution. Oh wait, but wait, the starting material is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of those methyl groups attached to the cyclohexadiene have two bromines. 

So if that reacts with sodium iodide, which is a good nucleophile, probably a substitution. But substitution on a dibromomethyl group would lead to elimination, right? Or perhaps it's a double elimination. Because if each methyl group has two bromines, when you substitute both, you might get elimination. Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced with iodide, but that doesn't seem likely because the reaction is with NaI. Oh wait, sodium iodide can induce an elimination via the E2 mechanism, especially if the leaving groups are on adjacent carbons. 

Wait, the starting diene is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the 5 and 6 positions has a (dibromomethyl) group. So when NaI is added, perhaps each of the dibromomethyl groups will lose two equivalents, each with iodide as the nucleophile. But wait, since each methyl has two Br atoms, perhaps each Br is replaced by I, but that would require two equivalents per group. But the question says 2 equivalents are used in total for the reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That structure sounds familiar.
