Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a meson resonance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of the meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its decay width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty and the time uncertainty is on the order of ħ. But in this case, the width Γ is the energy uncertainty for the particle's lifetime. So, the mean lifetime τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ. But wait, is that correct? Or is it the other way around? I think Γ is the total decay width, so the lifetime is inversely proportional to Γ. So τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). But wait, when you have a resonance, the width is actually related to the lifetime by the equation Γ = ħ/τ. So yeah, τ = ħ/(Γ).

But wait, that's for the lifetime. Then, the mean decay distance is the lifetime multiplied by the velocity of the particle. Because the particle moves at velocity v, so distance L = v * τ.

So first I need to calculate the lifetime τ, then find the velocity, and multiply them to get L.

But wait, how do I find the velocity? The particle has a certain energy E. I think E is the total energy, so it's the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, E_X is given as 8 GeV. The rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the kinetic energy is (8 - 1.2) GeV = 6.8 GeV. Wait, but maybe it's easier to calculate the velocity using the relativistic energy formulas.

E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So gamma = E/(m c²). Let's compute that.

Wait, let me write down the steps:

1. Calculate the Lorentz factor gamma = E / (m c²)
   E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = about 6.6667.

2. Find the velocity v in terms of c. Using gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me solve for v.

Gamma squared is 1/(1 - v²/c²) => 1 - v²/c² = 1/(gamma²) => v²/c² = 1 - 1/(gamma²)
So v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma²)).

Let me compute gamma squared: (8/1.2)^2 = (20/3)^2 ≈ (6.6667)^2 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/gamma² is about 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately, let's see, sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c. So very close to c.

3. Now, calculate the lifetime τ. τ is ħ / Γ. But let's make sure about units.

Γ is given as 320 MeV. Wait, 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. Oh, right, since m_X is in GeV, Γ is 0.32 GeV.

But wait, ħ has units of GeV·s or something? Wait, I think ħc is often used in these units. Let me recall the numerical values.

I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is about 1.6e-10 J, but I'm not sure if I need to convert units here. Alternatively, since we're dealing with energy in GeV and time in seconds, perhaps we can use the appropriate value.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Let me plug in the numbers.

ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 ≈ let's compute that.

6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, wait, wait, because 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds?

Wait, no, wait 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582e-25 / 3.2e-1 = (6.582 / 3.2) * 1e-25 *10 = (2.056875) * 1e-24 s.

Yes, so τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

4. Then, the decay distance L is v * τ. Since v is approximately 0.9887 c, and c is about 3e8 m/s.

So L ≈ v * τ = (0.9887 c) * τ.

Let me compute v * τ:

v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.9661e8 m/s.

τ is 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply them: 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2.9661 * 2.056875e-16 m.

Compute 2.9661 * 2.056875:

Let me calculate that. 3 * 2.05 is 6.15, but more accurately:

2.9661 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute:

2.9661 * 2 =5.9322
2.9661 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.1688 (because 0.05 is 0.1483, 0.006875 is about 0.0205)
So total ≈ 5.9322 + 0.1688 ≈ 6.101.

So L ≈ 6.101e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are 5.0223e-15 or similar. So I'm getting 6e-16 m, but the options are in the range of 1e-15 to 5e-15 m. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of Γ. Let me double-check the parameters.

Wait, the width Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Yes. So that part is correct.

Wait, the production energy is 8 GeV, and mass is 1.2 GeV. So E = 8 GeV.

Wait, maybe I should account for the fact that the energy is much larger than the mass, so the velocity is approximately c. But in my earlier calculation, I had v ≈ 0.9887 c. But wait, if E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, then the kinetic energy is 6.8 GeV, which is a lot, so gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.666..., which is correct.

Hmm, but going back to the calculation of L. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is E/(m c²). Wait, but E is given as the total energy, so E = gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 /1.2 = 6.666... yes.

So, gamma = 6.6667. Then, v = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) * c.

Wait, let's compute 1/gamma^2 for gamma=6.6667: 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1-0.0225=0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So v is about 0.9887 c. So that part is correct.

Then, the lifetime: tau = hbar / Gamma.

But wait, hbar is about 6.582e-25 GeV s. So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 GeV gives tau=6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So that's correct.

Then, v * tau is approximately 0.9887 c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s. So 0.9887 * 3e8 = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau: 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16 m.

So 2.966 * 2.056875: Let me calculate more accurately.

2.966 * 2 = 5.932

2.966 * 0.056875 = let's compute:

0.056875 is 0.05 + 0.006875.

2.966 * 0.05 = 0.1483

2.966 * 0.006875 = approximately 0.02048.

So total is 0.1483 + 0.02048 = 0.16878.

Adding 5.932 + 0.16878 = 6.09978.

So about 6.100e-16 meters.

But the options are in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16. So 6.1e-16 is 6.1 * 1e-16 m.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.0655e-16 m.

Option A: 5.0223e-16 m.

Hmm, none of the options are near 6e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider relativistic units differently. Wait, perhaps I should have used c in the calculation of tau. Or perhaps I messed up the units for ħ.

Wait, let me think again about ħ. The value of ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Is that correct? Alternatively, when using natural units, sometimes ħ is taken as 197.3 MeV·fm, but perhaps that's not the case here.

Wait, but in my calculation, I used ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Let me check if that's correct.

Yes, ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·seconds.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of L is v * tau multiplied by c, but I didn't account for something else. Wait, no, I think that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute the mean decay length using another approach. Let's see.

Alternative approach:

The mean decay length (L) can be calculated using the formula:

L = (c * tau) * beta gamma,

where beta is v/c, and gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, because the particle is moving at velocity v, so the time dilation factor is gamma. So the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So the mean decay length is v * (gamma * tau).

Wait, wait, earlier I thought L = v * tau, but that's in the particle's rest frame. In the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is longer by gamma. So the correct formula should be L = v * gamma * tau.

Oh! I think that's where I went wrong. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer. So let me recalculate.

So, L = v * gamma * tau.

Because in the rest frame, the lifetime is tau, but in the lab frame, it's gamma * tau. So the distance is v multiplied by gamma * tau.

So let's compute that.

We have v = 0.9887c, gamma = 6.6667.

So gamma * tau = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.37125e-23 s.

Then, L = v * gamma tau = (0.9887 c) * (1.37125e-23 s).

c is 3e8 m/s, so 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 1.37125e-23 s: 2.966e8 * 1.37125e-23 = 2.966 *1.37125 * 1e-15 ≈ ?

2.966 * 1.37125 ≈ let's compute:

2 * 1.37 = 2.74

0.966 * 1.37125 ≈ 1.319.

So total is approximately 4.06.

So 4.06e-15 m.

Wait, wait, wait, let me compute 2.966 * 1.37125 more accurately.

2.966 * 1.37125:

Let me compute 2 * 1.37125 = 2.7425.

0.966 * 1.37125 = let's compute:

0.9 * 1.37125 = 1.234125

0.066 * 1.37125 ≈ 0.090 (approx 0.066 *1.37=0.090)

So total is approximately 1.234125 + 0.090 = 1.324125.

So total L = (2.7425 + 1.324125) * 1e-15 ≈ 4.0666e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to this value. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, so previously I forgot to include the gamma factor in the lab frame lifetime, which is why my initial calculation was off. So the correct approach is to multiply by gamma, making the decay length much longer, bringing it into the 1e-15 m range.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the following steps:

1. **Relating Lifetime to Decay Width**:  
   The mean lifetime \( \tau \) of a particle is related to its decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
   \]  
   Here, \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting these values:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Relating Velocity to Energy**:  
   The velocity \( v \) of the particle is determined using its total energy \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and rest mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m_X c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
   \]  
   Using the relativistic relation \( v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \):  
   \[
   v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = c \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = c \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887c.
   \]  
   Thus, \( v \approx 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

3. **Calculating Mean Decay Distance**:  
   The mean decay distance \( L \) is given by:  
   \[
   L = v \cdot \tau \cdot \gamma.
   \]  
   Substituting \( v \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \), and \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \):  
   \[
   L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 6.6667.
   \]  
   First, calculate \( \gamma \cdot \tau \):  
   \[
   \gamma \cdot \tau = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
   \]  
   Then, calculate \( L \):  
   \[
   L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.0667 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   The calculated decay distance \( L \approx 4.0667 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) closely matches option **B**: \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).

Answer: B
