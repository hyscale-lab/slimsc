Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step.

Alright, the problem says the particle has a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times S_z. Oh wait, I remember that the magnetic moment mu is usually given by mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin angular momentum. But wait, in the question, mu is given as gamma times S_z. That's a bit confusing. Oh wait, no, maybe mu is aligned with the magnetic field, which is along +Z initially. So maybe they're considering the component of mu along Z, which would be mu_z = gamma * S_z. But I think the overall magnetic moment is a vector, so mu = gamma * S. But perhaps in this problem, since the initial field is along Z, the initial moment is along Z too.

So the setup: the particle is initially in a magnetic field pointing in +Z. So the magnetic moment would align with it, right? So the spin state is along +Z. But then the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. Then the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, so initially, when the field is along Z, the particle's moment is along Z. Then when the field is suddenly turned off, but then turned on along Y. So the new magnetic field is along Y. So the particle's spin will precess around the Y-axis now.

The average of the z-component of the moment starts oscillating. So we need to find the frequency of these oscillations.

Hmm, I think this is related to spin precession. When you change the direction of the magnetic field, the spin will precess around the new field direction. The frequency of precession depends on the magnetic field strength and the gyromagnetic ratio (gamma here).

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the Hamiltonian. The magnetic interaction energy is given by the Zeeman term, which is H = -mu · B. So when the field is along Y, H = -mu_y * B. Wait, but wait, wait. Let me get this right.

Wait, mu is the magnetic moment, which is gamma times S. So S is a vector, so mu is gamma times the vector S. So when the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B (S · Y) = -(gamma B) S_y.

Wait, but the Hamiltonian in terms of spin would be H = w S_y, where w is the Larmor frequency. Oh wait, the Larmor frequency is omega = gamma B. So yeah, H = - omega S_y.

Wait, no, the sign depends on the direction. Let me think again. The energy is E = - mu · B. So if mu is along Y and B is along Y, then E is negative. But in this case, the magnetic field is along Y, so H would be proportional to S_y.

Hmm, but when you have a spin state in a magnetic field along Y, the energy eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with energies +/- (1/2) gamma B. Wait, no, because the spin is 1/2, so S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energy is E = - gamma B (S_y), so E = - gamma B (± ħ/2 ), which is ∓ (gamma B ħ)/2. So the energy levels have a separation of gamma B ħ.

Wait, but wait. The oscillation frequency comes from the energy difference between the states divided by Planck's constant. So the energy difference is 2*(gamma B ħ)/2) = gamma B ħ. So the frequency would be (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B. Wait, but that's one of the options. Option B is gamma B.

But wait, the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the moment. Hmm. The initial state is along +Z, so before the field is applied along Y, the state is |+z>. When the magnetic field is suddenly changed to Y, the state doesn't change instantaneously, so it's still |+z> in the new basis.

Wait, |+z> is not an eigenstate of S_y. So the state will evolve over time under the new Hamiltonian. The time evolution is given by the time-dependent part of the wavefunction. The state can be expressed as a combination of |+y> and |-y> states, which are the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. So the time evolution will cause transitions between these states, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The time evolution of the expectation value of S_z would involve terms oscillating with frequency determined by the energy difference between the states divided by hbar. The energy difference between |+y> and |-y> is 2*(gamma B ħ/2) = gamma B ħ. So the frequency is (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B. So the average of S_z will oscillate at frequency gamma B. Therefore, the average of mu_z, which is gamma S_z, would oscillate with the same frequency, since mu_z = gamma <S_z>. So that would make the oscillation frequency gamma B.

Wait, but wait another thing. The initial state is |+z>, which can be written in terms of |+y> and |-y>. Let me recall that |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). Because the states |+y> and |-y> are along Y, and |+z> is equally a combination of them.

So when the Hamiltonian is applied, the time evolution of each component is as follows: |+y> evolves with a phase factor exp(-i E t / ħ), where E is the energy. So for |+y>, E is (gamma B ħ/2 ), so the phase is exp(-i (gamma B t/2 )). Similarly, |-y> has energy -gamma B ħ/2, so phase exp( i (gamma B t/2 )).

So the state at time t after the switch is: [ |+y> exp( -i (gamma B t/2 )) + |-y> exp( i (gamma B t/2 )) ] / sqrt(2).

Now, the expectation value of S_z in this state would be calculated as follows.

The expectation value of S_z is <psi| S_z |psi>.

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to express S_z in terms of |+y> and |-y>. Alternatively, compute the expectation value by expanding the state.

Alternatively, perhaps to find the expectation value of S_z, we can compute it as the expectation of S_z in the state that's a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that S_z can be written in the Y-basis. Alternatively, perhaps compute the expectation value using the time-evolved state.

Wait, let's write the state at time t as |psi(t)> = [ |+y> e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} + |-y> e^{i (gamma B t/2)} ] / sqrt(2).

The expectation value of S_z is <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

But S_z in the Y basis (|+y>, |-y>) is a bit tricky. Let me think about the matrix representation. Let me recall that |+y> and |-y> are eigenstates of S_y, and S_z in that basis can be represented as:

S_z = (ħ/2) [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ].

Wait, no. Wait, the standard basis for S_z is |+z> and |−z> with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and −ħ/2. But in the S_y basis, which is |+y> and |-y>, the matrix for S_z is actually (ħ/2) times [[0, i], [-i, 0]]? Or perhaps something else. Alternatively, perhaps using the ladder operators.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_z> directly with the state.

Wait, another approach: the initial state is |+z> when the field is suddenly switched to Y. So the initial state is |+z>, which can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

At time t, the state is [ |+y> e^{-i E_+ t / ħ} + |-y> e^{-i E_- t / ħ} ] / sqrt(2), where E_+ = (gamma B ħ)/2, E_- = - (gamma B ħ)/2.

Wait, the energies for |+y> and |-y> are E_+ = (gamma B ħ)/2 and E_- = -(gamma B ħ)/2, since E = - mu · B, and mu = gamma S. So for |+y>, the energy would be E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2), but wait, wait. No, wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.

The Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B. Since mu is gamma S, and B is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y. So H = - gamma B (S_y). Wait, but S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for spin-1/2. So H acting on |+y> would give H |+y> = - gamma B (ħ/2) |+y>. So the energy E_+ is - gamma B (ħ/2) * (1/2) ? Wait, no. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, S_y |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = - gamma B (S_y) |+y> = - gamma B (ħ/2) |+y>. So E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2). Similarly, E_- = gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, that makes sense because when the spin is aligned with the field, the energy is lower. So when B is along Y, the state |+y> has lower energy (if gamma is positive, which it usually is for spin-1/2 particles like electrons, where mu = gamma S, and gamma is positive).

So the energies are E_+ = - (gamma B ħ ) / 2, and E_- = (gamma B ħ ) / 2.

So the state at time t is:

|psi(t)> = (|+y> exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) + |-y> exp( -i E_- t / ħ )) / sqrt(2)

Plugging E_+ and E_-:

= [ |+y> exp( i (gamma B t/2) ) + |-y> exp( -i (gamma B t/2) ) ] / sqrt(2)

Wait, because E_+ is - (gamma B ħ )/ 2, so - E_+ t / ħ = (gamma B t )/(2).

Similarly, E_- is (gamma B ħ )/ 2. So - E_- t / ħ = - (gamma B t )/(2).

So the state is |psi(t)> = [ e^{i (gamma B t/2)} |+y> + e^{ -i (gamma B t/2)} |-y> ] / sqrt(2).

Now, to find the expectation value of S_z, which is <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

But S_z, in the Y basis, can be represented as the matrix [[0, i], [-i, 0]] multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, because if we have basis vectors |+y> and |-y>, then S_z in this basis can be found by expressing the standard S_z matrix in terms of these basis vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the inner products.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the expectation value using the time-dependent state.

Let me write S_z as (ħ/2) σ_z, where σ_z is the Pauli z matrix.

But wait, in the Y basis, the matrix representation is different. Alternatively, perhaps express S_z in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute <S_z> as follows.

Express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>.

We know that:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)

So, substituting these into the state |psi(t)>:

|psi(t)> = [ e^{i (gamma B t/2)} (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2) + e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2)

Simplify this expression:

Multiply the terms:

= [ e^{i (gamma B t/2)} (|+z> + |-z> ) + e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} (|+z> - |-z> ) ) ] / (2)

Factor out |+z> and |-z>:

= [ |+z> (e^{i (gamma B t/2)} + e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} ) + |-z> (e^{i (gamma B t/2)} - e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} ) ] / 2

Using Euler's formula, e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ} = 2 cosθ and e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 2i sinθ:

= [ |+z> * 2 cos(gamma B t/2 ) + |-z> * 2i sin(gamma B t/2 ) ] / 2

Simplify:

= cos(gamma B t/2 ) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2 ) |-z>

So, the state |psi(t)> is a superposition of |+z> and |-z> with coefficients cos(θ) and i sin(θ), where θ = gamma B t/2.

Now, the expectation value of S_z is <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

Since S_z |+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>, S_z |-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>.

So,

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = [ cosθ* ( < +z | ) + (-i sinθ ) ( < -z | ) ] * S_z * [ cosθ |+z> + i sinθ | -z> ]

= cosθ * cosθ * (ħ/2) + (-i sinθ) * i sinθ * (-ħ/2 )

Wait, let me compute each term.

First term: cosθ * cosθ * (ħ/2) = cos²θ (ħ/2)

Second term: ( -i sinθ ) * (i sinθ ) * (-ħ/2 )

Wait, let me compute this step by step:

The first term comes from |+z><+z| S_z, which is (ħ/2) |+z><+z|.

The second term comes from | -z >< -z | S_z, which is (-ħ/2) | -z >< -z |.

So,

= cosθ * cosθ * (ħ/2) + (-i sinθ) * i sinθ * (-ħ/2 )

Simplify the coefficients:

i * (-i) = 1, because i*(-i) = -i² = -( -1 )= 1.

Wait, let's compute each part:

The coefficient for the second term is (-i sinθ) * (i sinθ) = (-i)(i) (sinθ)^2 ) = (-i^2) (sinθ)^2 = (1) (sinθ)^2, because i^2 = -1.

So, the second term becomes (sinθ)^2 * (-ħ/2) multiplied by the coefficient, which is positive after calculation.

Wait, wait, let me re-express.

Wait, the second term is: (-i sinθ) * (i sinθ ) * (-ħ/2 )

= [ (-i)(i) (sinθ)^2 ] * (-ħ/2 )

= [ ( - (i^2) ) (sinθ)^2 ) ] * (-ħ/2 )

i^2 = -1, so this becomes [ - (-1) (sinθ)^2 ] * (-ħ/2) = [ (1)(sinθ)^2 ] * (-ħ/2 ) = - (sinθ)^2 (ħ/2 )

Wait, but the second term is multiplied by (-ħ/2). Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation here.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the entire expression:

<psi|S_z|psi> = [ cosθ , -i sinθ ] * [ [ ħ/2 0 ], [0, -ħ/2 ] ] * [ cosθ; i sinθ ]

Wait, let me represent the state as a vector. Let me denote |+z> as [1; 0], |-z> as [0; 1].

So |psi(t)> is [ cosθ, i sinθ ]^T.

Then S_z is represented as [[ ħ/2, 0 ], [0, -ħ/2 ] ].

So, the product S_z |psi> is:

[ (ħ/2) cosθ, ( - ħ/2 ) i sinθ ]^T.

Now, <psi | S_z | psi> is the conjugate transpose of |psi> multiplied by S_z |psi>.

Conjugate of |psi> is [ cosθ, -i sinθ ].

So,

<psi| S_z |psi> = [ cosθ, -i sinθ ] * [ [ (ħ/2) cosθ ], [ (- ħ/2 ) i sinθ ] ]

= cosθ * (ħ/2) cosθ + (-i sinθ ) * ( (- ħ/2 ) i sinθ )

= (ħ/2) cos²θ + (-i)(-i) ( ħ/2 ) sin²θ.

Wait, (-i)(-i) = (i)^2 = -1.

So,

= (ħ/2) cos²θ + (-1) ( ħ/2 ) sin²θ

= (ħ/2) ( cos²θ - sin²θ )

= (ħ/2) cos(2θ )

So, <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( 2 theta ), where theta = gamma B t / 2.

So,

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, because 2 theta = gamma B t.

So the expectation value of S_z oscillates as cos( gamma B t ), which has a frequency of gamma B.

But wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z = gamma S_z.

So, <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but wait gamma here is the gyromagnetic ratio, which has units of (rad s^-1 T^-1), or something similar, depending on the units.

But importantly, the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine, which is gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B.

Looking back at the options, option B is gamma B.

Wait, but wait another thing. I thought the Larmor frequency is omega = gamma B, but in some conventions it's gamma times B divided by something. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The energy levels are E_+ = - (gamma B ħ/2 ), E_- = + (gamma B ħ/2 ).

The energy difference is E_+ - E_- = - gamma B ħ.

Wait, no, E_+ is the energy for |+y>, which is - (gamma B ħ/2 ), and E_- is + (gamma B ħ/2 ). So the difference is E_+ - E_- = - gamma B ħ. But when you compute the oscillation frequency, the transition frequency is (E_+ - E_-)/h-bar.

Wait, no, the transition frequency is (E_+ - E_- )/ h-bar. So,

(E_+ - E_- ) = (- gamma B ħ/2 ) - (gamma B ħ/2 ) ) = - gamma B ħ.

So the energy difference is - gamma B ħ. The frequency is (E_+ - E_- ) / ħ = - gamma B.

But frequency can't be negative, so the magnitude is gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

So that's the same as what I found earlier.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B, gamma B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is then switched off and turned on along the $+Y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis

1. **Initial State and Magnetic Interaction**:  
   Initially, the particle is in the state $|+z\rangle$, aligned with the magnetic field along $+Z$. When the field is suddenly switched to $+Y$, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$. The energy eigenvalues are $E_+ = -\gamma B \hbar / 2$ for $|+y\rangle$ and $E_- = \gamma B \hbar / 2$ for $|-y\rangle$.

2. **Time Evolution of the State**:  
   The initial state $|+z\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$:  
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle + |-y\rangle \right).
   \]  
   Under the new Hamiltonian, the time-evolved state becomes:  
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-iE_+t/\hbar} |+y\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\hbar} |-y\rangle \right).
   \]  
   Substituting $E_+ = -\gamma B \hbar / 2$ and $E_- = \gamma B \hbar / 2$, this simplifies to:  
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{i\gamma B t / 2} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\gamma B t / 2} |-y\rangle \right).
   \]

3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The expectation value of $S_z$ is given by $\langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle$. Using the basis states $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, the matrix representation of $S_z$ in this basis is:  
   \[
   S_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   0 & i \\
   -i & 0
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]  
   After computation, the expectation value of $S_z$ oscillates as:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

4. **Oscillation Frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$**:  
   The magnetic moment along $z$ is $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. Thus, the expectation value $\langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle$ oscillates as:  
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]  
   The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of $t$ inside the cosine, which is $\gamma B$.

### Conclusion

The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. This corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
