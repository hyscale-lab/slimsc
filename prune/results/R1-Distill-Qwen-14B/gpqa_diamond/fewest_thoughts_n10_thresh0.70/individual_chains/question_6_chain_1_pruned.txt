Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about a particle in a two-dimensional potential V(r, θ) which is given as (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. They're asking for the energy spectrum of the particle, so I need to figure out what the energy levels look like in terms of the quantum numbers.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with potentials in spherical coordinates, sometimes you can separate the variables and solve the Schrödinger equation in parts. But wait, this is a two-dimensional problem, so maybe it's better to think in polar coordinates (r, θ), which are used in 2D.

Looking at the potential, V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I can factor out some terms here. Let me see: V = (1/2 + 3/2 cos²θ) * (k r²). Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the terms are (1/2)kr² and (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So perhaps I can write it as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ ].

But wait, no, actually, the potential is (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. So that's like (1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ) multiplied by kr², right? So another way to write that is (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2 * kr².

Wait, but I'm wondering if this potential can be expressed in terms of some familiar form. Maybe it's a combination of central and angular potentials. Alternatively, I recall that when the potential depends on cosθ, it might be related to the polar angle, which suggests that the problem can be separated into radial and angular parts.

Wait, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Let me factor out kr². So V(r,θ) = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Alternatively, I can write this
