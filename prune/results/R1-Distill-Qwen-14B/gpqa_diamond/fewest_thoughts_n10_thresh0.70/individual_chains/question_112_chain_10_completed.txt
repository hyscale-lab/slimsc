Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I guess I need to normalize this state because probabilities depend on it. Oh wait, the question says it's proportional, so I'll have to find the normalization constant.

Wait, the first part is about calculating the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of an operator. The operator's matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, else 0. So the matrix would look like a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-up and spin-down states, right? So for a 2x2 matrix, A would have zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]. That looks familiar. Oh yeah, this is similar to the Pauli matrices, but scaled.

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. What are those? The eigenstates for X are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. Right, those are superpositions of |up> and |down> states. The eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/√2, or something like that. Wait, actually, I think it's (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2, but I need to confirm.

Alternatively, since X is the Pauli matrix, its eigenvalues are ±1, and the corresponding eigenvectors are |+x> and |−x>, which are the states I mentioned. So the eigenstates of operator A would be these |+x> and |−x> states.

Wait, but the operator A is (ħ/2) times X. So the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so ± ħ/2.

But the first part of the question is to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of these eigenstates. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates and square the amplitudes to get the probabilities.

But wait, first I need to normalize |alpha>. Let's compute the norm of the given vector. The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The inner product would be (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i), but wait, no. Wait, the inner product is |alpha| squared, which is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each component.

So for |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, the norm is |a|^2 + |b|^2. So |a| is |1+i| which is sqrt(1^2 +1^2)=sqrt(2). Similarly, |b| is |2-i| which is sqrt(4 +1)=sqrt(5). So |a|² is 2, |b|² is 5. So the total norm is 2+5=7. So the normalized state is (1+i)/√7 |up> + (2-i)/√7 |down>.

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/√7 ] |up> + [ (2-i)/√7 ] |down>.

Now, I need to express this state in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |−x>.

Wait, let me write down |+x> and |−x> again. The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/√2, and |−x> is (|up> − |down>)/√2. So any state can be expressed as a linear combination of these.

So let me write |alpha> as c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>.

To find c_+ and c_-, I can take the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |−x>.

So c_+ = < +x | alpha >.

Similarly, c_- = < -x | alpha >.

Let me compute c_+ first.

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/√2.

So < +x | alpha > = [ (1/i) ( < up | + < down | ) /√2 ] · [ (1+i)/√7 |up> + (2-i)/√7 |down> ]

Wait, no. Wait, < +x | is the conjugate transpose of |+x>, which would be ( <up| + <down| ) /√2. So when I compute < +x | alpha >, it's [1/√2] ( <up| + <down| ) ( (1+i)/√7 |up> + (2-i)/√7 |down> )

So this becomes (1/√2)( (1+i)/√7 ) <up|up> + (1/√2)( (2-i)/√7 ) <down|down> .

Since <up|up> is 1, same for <down|down>.

So c_+ = (1/(√2√7)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

Let me compute that. (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 + 0i. So c_+ = 3/(√(14)).

Wait, 1/√2 * 1/√7 is 1/√14. So 3/√14.

Similarly, compute c_-.

c_- = < -x | alpha >.

|−x> is (|up> - |down>)/√2, so < -x | is ( <up| - <down| ) /√2.

So < -x | alpha > = (1/√2) [ <up| - <down| ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Which is (1/√2) [ (1+i)/√7 <up|up> - (2 -i)/√7 <down|down> ]

So that's (1/(√2√7)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ].

Compute the numerator: (1 +i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i = -1 + 2i.

So c_- = (-1 + 2i) / √14.

So now, the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

Compute |c_+|²: (3 / √14 )^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857. So approximately 0.64.

Compute |c_-|²: | (-1 + 2i) /√14 |². The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) = 1 +4=5. So 5/14≈0.357.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, and 5/14 is about 0.357. So 0.64 and 0.36 approximately.

Looking at the options: Option A is 0.64 and 0.36, with average hbar/7. Option D is 0.61, which is closer to 9/14 (0.6428) but not exactly. Let me compute 9/14 exactly: 9 ÷14 = 0.642857..., which is approximately 0.64. Similarly, 5/14 is 0.357, which is approximately 0.36.

So the probabilities are about 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, but wait, 9 +5 =14, so that's correct.

So that's the first part. The probabilities are 9/14 (≈0.64) and 5/14 (≈0.36).

Now the second part is finding the average value of the operator A. The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is a Hermitian operator (because all the elements are real? Wait, no, in this case, A_ij is hbar/2 for i≠j, 0 otherwise. So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]], which is Hermitian because it's symmetric. So yes, A is Hermitian, so the average is real.

Hmm, so to compute <A>, which is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, normalized by 1/√7.

Wait, let me write |alpha> as a column vector. Let's say |up> is [1; 0], |down> is [0;1]. So |alpha> is [ (1+i)/√7 ; (2 -i)/√7 ].

So the matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So compute A |alpha>:

A |alpha> = [0*(1+i) + (ħ/2)(2 -i) ] /√7 
           [(ħ/2)(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ] /√7

Which is:

[ (ħ/2)(2 -i) ] /√7 
[ (ħ/2)(1 +i) ] /√7

So [ (2 -i ) ħ/2 /√7 ; (1 +i ) ħ/2 /√7 ]

Now, <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate of |alpha> dotted with this vector.

|alpha> is [ (1 -i)/√7 , (2 +i)/√7 ].

So the inner product is:

( (1 -i)/√7 ) * ( (2 -i) ħ/(2√7) ) + ( (2 +i)/√7 ) * ( (1 +i) ħ/(2√7) )

Let me compute each term.

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) ħ/(2*7) = [ (2 -i -2i +i²) ] ħ/(14)
i squared is -1, so 2 -3i -1 = (1) -3i. So numerator is (1-3i).
So first term: (1-3i) ħ/(14)

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) ħ/(2*7)
Multiply (2+i)(1+i) = 2(1) +2i +i(1) +i² = 2 +3i -1 = (1 +3i)
So second term: (1+3i) ħ/(14)

Adding the two terms: [ (1-3i) + (1+3i) ] ħ/(14) = (2) ħ/(14) = ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Wait, but let me think again. Because I think I made a miscalculation.

Wait, each term is (1 -i)(2 -i) and (2 +i)(1 +i). Let me recompute these.

First, (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + i*i = 2 -i -2i + (-1) = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Yes, that's correct.

Second, (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i = 2 +2i +i + (-1) = (2-1) +3i = 1 +3i.

So when adding (1-3i) and (1+3i), the imaginary parts cancel, and we get 2. So (2) * ħ/(14) = ħ/7.

So the average is ħ/7. So the average is ħ/7. So among the options, let's see.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, average ħ/7.

Yes, that matches.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29, average 2ħ/sqrt(7). No.

So the correct probabilities are approximately 0.64 (9/14) and 0.36 (5/14), and average is ħ/7.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves an electron in the state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The task is to compute the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be calculated.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |alpha>
The given state is \( |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> \). The norm is computed as:
\[
|a|^2 + |b|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|alpha> = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|up> + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|down>.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, which are:
\[
|+x> = \frac{|up> + |down>}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x> = \frac{|up> - |down>}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Step 3: Express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>
To find the coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \), compute the inner products:
\[
c_+ = \langle +x | alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = \langle -x | alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities are:
\[
P(+x) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle alpha | A | alpha \rangle.
\]
Using the matrix representation of \( A \) and the normalized state \( |alpha> \), the computation yields:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
