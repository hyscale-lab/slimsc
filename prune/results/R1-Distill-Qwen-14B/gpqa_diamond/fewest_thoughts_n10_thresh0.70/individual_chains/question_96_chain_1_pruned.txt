Okay, so I've got this problem about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, let's break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think step by step.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the entropy of the black hole, and the options are orders of magnitude like 10^59, 10^62, etc.

Wait, entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, right? So the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Oh right, A is π r_s², where r_s is the Schwarzschild radius.

But first, I need to find the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole. To find r_s, I should relate the angular size θ to the actual size. Oh right, the angular size formula: θ ≈ r / d, for small angles where θ is in radians. But wait, θ is given in degrees so I need to convert it to radians.

Let's compute θ in radians. θ = 1e-17 degrees. Since 180 degrees is π radians, converting gives θ_rad = (1e-17) * (π/180). Let me calculate that. 1e-17 * π is about 3e-17, divided by 180 gives roughly 1.67e-19 radians.

So θ_rad ≈ r_s / d. Because for small angles, the arc length (which is r_s) is approximately d * θ. So rearranging, r_s = d * θ_rad.

Wait, d is 1e10 parsecs. Oh, wait, I need to convert parsecs to meters. 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs is 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So r_s = d * θ_rad = 3.086e26 m * 1.67e-19 radians. Multiplying that gives... 3.086e
