Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion at rest decays into a muon and a neutrino. The given masses are Pi+ is 139.6 MeV, and mu+ is 105.7 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of kinetic energies.

Wait, so the reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. So the muon and neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. But since the neutrino has negligible mass, its energy would be approximately equal to its momentum. Hmm.

I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the kinetic energies of the products can be found using the conservation of energy and momentum. So let's set up the equations.

The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the energies of the muon and neutrino must add up to this.

Wait, but the muon has its own rest mass. So the energy of the muon (E_mu) will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy (K_mu), right? And the neutrino's energy (E_nu) is just its kinetic energy because its rest mass is negligible.

So energy conservation gives: E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c².

But since the neutrino is massless, E_nu = p_nu c, and because the pion was at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = p_nu.

So, for the muon, E_mu² = (p_mu c)² + (m_mu c²)². And p_mu = p_nu. Also, E_nu = p_nu c = p_mu c.

Putting it all together. Let's denote p as the magnitude of the momentum of the muon (so the neutrino also has momentum p).

So, the total energy after decay is:

E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( (p c
