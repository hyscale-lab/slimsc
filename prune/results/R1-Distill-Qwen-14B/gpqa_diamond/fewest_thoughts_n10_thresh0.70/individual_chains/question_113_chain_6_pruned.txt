Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Alright, the given data includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry results. Let me break down each piece of information.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Hmm, I remember that broad peaks in the IR around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But if it's a broad peak, maybe it's an alcohol or something with hydrogen bonding. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Wait, 1700 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring with substituents.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, so the compound probably has a double bond, maybe in an alkene or part of a ring. So maybe the structure has a conjugated system or something like that.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, what could that be? Common fragments at m/z 45... Let's think. For example, the fragment could be (CH3)2O, which is 45 (since C=12, H=1, O=16: 12*2 + 6 +16= 45). Or maybe another group. Alternatively, a methyl group attached to something else? Wait, another possibility: maybe the CH2O group or another fragment.

Now, the options are all C6H something O or O2. Let's list the options:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

I need to figure out which formula fits the data.

Let me think about the IR data again. The 1700 cm^-1 peak is strong. If it's a carbonyl, esters, ketones, etc. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring or another carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like a carbonyl adjacent to a double bond. Or perhaps it's a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond, which might lower the wavenumber. Alternatively, maybe one is an ester (1700) and another is a conjugated double bond in an aromatic ring (1650). But wait, 1650 is more typical for conjugated carbonyls or maybe
