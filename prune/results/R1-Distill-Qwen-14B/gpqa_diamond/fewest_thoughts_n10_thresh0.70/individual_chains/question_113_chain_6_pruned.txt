Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, the task is to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to analyze each piece of data to narrow it down.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The question says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. If it's very broad, that might suggest an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, because carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H peak due to strong hydrogen bonding. But wait, another peak at 1700 and 1650. Those are strong absorption areas. The 1700 region is often a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe even a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds (like an aromatic C=O or an amide?), but considering the options, probably a carbonyl. Alternatively, it could be an absorption from a conjugated system, like an aromatic ring with double bonds (like in an aromatic ring, the C=C might absorb around 1600-1650 cm^-1). Wait, so maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl? Or perhaps an ester or a ketone.

Wait, if there's a peak at 1700 and 1650, maybe it's a carbonyl and an aromatic ring. Because the aromatic C=C usually shows up around 1600. So 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or a ketone in an aromatic system. Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an α,β-unsaturated ketone? Or maybe an ester group with conjugation.

But the FTIR also shows a broad peak at 3000, which could be O-H in
