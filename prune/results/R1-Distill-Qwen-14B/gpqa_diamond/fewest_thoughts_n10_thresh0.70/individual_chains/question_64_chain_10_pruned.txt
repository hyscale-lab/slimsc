Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about a mixture of salts A and B. They're equimolar and weigh 7.20 grams. When heated to 200°C without air, they produce a mixture of gases. These gases pass through several tubes: Mg(ClO4)2, Ca(OH)2 solution, and red-hot copper. The results are that tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g, and tube 2 doesn't change. The remaining gas is 2.24 liters at STP.

I need to find the total number of all atoms in the salts A and B. The options are 13, 15, 17, 19.

Okay, breaking it down. Let's think about what each tube does.

Tube 1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can react with water. So if the gas mixture passes through here and the weight increases, it means the gas is probably H2O. Because Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb water, forming Mg(ClO4)2·H2O or something. So the increase is due to water being trapped.

So the mass gained in tube 1 is 3.60g. The formula for water is H2O, molar mass is 18 g/mol. So moles of H2O = 3.60 / 18 = 0.2 mol.

Wait, but wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous. When it absorbs water, it becomes Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O. But regardless, the increase in mass is the mass of H2O absorbed. So yeah, that's 0.2 moles of H2O.

Next, tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. If the weight doesn't change, that suggests no reaction. What gases would not react with Ca(OH)2 solution? Well, CO2 would react to form CaCO3 and water. So if no change, maybe the gas doesn't react with Ca(OH)2. So possible gases could be like H2, O2, N2, etc. But wait, maybe the gas is not acidic. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a noble gas, but I'm not sure about that.

But considering the setup, the gases are formed upon heating the salts. So possible gases could include H2O (which was absorbed in tube 1), CO2, NH3, maybe H2S, but probably CO2 is more likely here.

Wait, but if CO2 passed through Ca(OH)2 solution, it would react and form CaCO3 and water. So if tube 2's weight didn't change, perhaps the gas isn't CO2. So maybe the gas that went through was something else.

Alternatively, maybe one of the gases didn't react—like H2 or something inert. Hmm.

Tube 3 is red-hot copper. So any gas that reacts with hot copper would
