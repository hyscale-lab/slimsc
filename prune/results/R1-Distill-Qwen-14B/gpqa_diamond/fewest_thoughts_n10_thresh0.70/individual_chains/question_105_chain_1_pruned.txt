Okay, so I have this astronomy question here. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about a star with some spots on it and how that affects the light curve. They want to compare it to the effect of an exoplanet on the same light curve.

So the star has the same radius as the Sun. Oh wait, okay, that's good to know. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factorâ€”I think that's the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So, 20% of half the star is covered.

The star's effective temperature is 6000K. The spots are cooler because they have a temperature difference of 1000K, so wait, does that mean the spots are at 5000K? Because 6000 minus 1000 is 5000. Or is it 7000K? Wait, no, spots are darker and cooler, so their temperature should be lower than the star's. Oh right, 5000K.

The question says that when you look at the star's brightness over time (photometric time series), you see periodic variations because the star is rotating and the spots come into and out of view. This could look like an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

But the question is, to produce the same amplitude in the brightness variation, what's the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star's radius?

So basically, the brightness dip from the spots should be similar to the dip from a planet transit. We need to find R_pl divided by R_star.

Wait, how does the brightness variation work for spots and a planet?

For a planet transit, the brightness drops by an amount proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is the area of the planet over the star's area. So the fractional change in brightness is (R_p / R_s)^2.

For the spots, though, it's a bit different. Spots cause a variation in brightness because as the star rotates, more or less of the cooler (darker) spots are facing us. So when a spot is on the near side of the star facing us, it's a bit cooler, so the total brightness is a bit lower.

Wait, but how does that compare to the planet blocking
