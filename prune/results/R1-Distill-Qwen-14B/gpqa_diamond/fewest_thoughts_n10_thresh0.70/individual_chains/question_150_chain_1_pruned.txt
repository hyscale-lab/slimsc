Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

The question says the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is C8H9NO. Wait, the molecular formula can be rewritten as C8H9NO. Each degree of unsaturation is a ring or a double bond. The formula for calculating degrees of unsaturation is: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X (halogens) are zero. So substituting, C=8, H=9, N=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3 double bonds and a ring, so that's 4 degrees) plus a double bond or a ring, but wait, wait. Let me think again. Benzene is 3 double bonds and one ring, that's 4 degrees. So 5 total means one more degree. That could be another double bond or a ring. So maybe an aromatic ring plus a double bond elsewhere, or a ring plus a double bond.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H-NMR (ppm): 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H).

Hmm. Let's interpret each peak.

9.72 ppm is a triplet (t) integrating for 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons usually appear around 9-10 ppm. So that suggests the molecule has an aldehyde group.

Next, 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). These look like two doublets, each integrating to two protons. This is typical of para-substituted aromatic protons. So maybe two para-disubstituted benzene rings. Wait, but each double has two H, but the same coupling. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, or maybe each is part of a different ring. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, the aldehyde would be an -CHO group. Then, looking at the other NMR signals. The 6.27 (bs, 2H) might be some vinyl protons, but broad could indicate something else. Alternatively, maybe they're adjacent to an electronegative group or perhaps they're part of a conjugated system. The 3.66 (d, 2H) is a doublet, probably a CH2 group adjacent to something deshielded, maybe an electronegative atom. Like an OCH2 or something similar. Or perhaps a CH2 next to a carbonyl.

But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me see. Let's try to deduce the structure.

The compound has an aldehyde group, which is CHO. Then, perhaps two aromatic rings attached. So maybe it's a diaryl aldehyde. Or perhaps a substituted aldehyde with some other groups. The NMR has two sets of aromatic protons: 6.98 and 6.51, each as d (doublets). That suggests perhaps two para-substituted benzene rings connected to the same or different positions.

Wait, perhaps the compound is something like benzaldehyde with substituents. Alternatively, maybe a di-substituted benzene ring attached to an aldehyde and another substituent.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the carbons.

If the structure is a
