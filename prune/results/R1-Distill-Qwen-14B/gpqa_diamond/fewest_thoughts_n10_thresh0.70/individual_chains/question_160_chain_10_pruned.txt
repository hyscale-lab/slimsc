Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like a polygon, and I need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern when N is infinitely large. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's try to break it down.

Alright, the problem says the aperture is a N-sided polygon. All apothems are the same length a. Wait, what's an apothem again? Oh right, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides. So for any regular polygon, the apothem is the same for all sides.

So when monochromatic light (wavelength λ) falls on this aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern. They're asking about the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field. Far field means we can use the Fraunhofer diffraction approximation, I think.

I remember that for a circular aperture, the minima occur at angles where the path difference from the edges is an odd multiple of half-wavelengths. The first minimum is at θ = 1.22λ/(diameter), but wait, that's for a single slit. But here, the aperture is a polygon. But when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle.

Wait, but the question is about the case when N is infinitely large. So the aperture becomes a perfect circle. Oh wait, so the problem is essentially about a circular aperture? Because a polygon with
