Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that there's a spin-half particle in a linear superposition state, specifically 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And the states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of sigma_z, which I think is the Pauli z-matrix. The task is to find the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated by taking the conjugate of the state, multiplying the operator, and then the state again. So for an operator A, it's ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩. Right, so I should compute this for the given operator.

Breaking down the operator, it's 10σ_z plus 5σ_x. So I can split the expectation value into two parts: 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩. That makes it easier since I can compute each part separately.

First, let's figure out what σ_z and σ_x are. Oh wait, σ_z is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, respectively. σ_x is the Pauli x matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]], so it flips the spin states.

The state of the particle is given as ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. I can write this as a vector, like [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T, since |↑⟩ is [1,0] and |↓⟩ is [0,1].

Wait, but I think it's easier to compute the expectation values of σ_z and σ_x separately using probabilities. Let me think.

For σ_z: since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates, the expectation value is just the probability of being in |↑⟩ times +1 plus the probability of being in |↓⟩ times -1.

So the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. The probabilities are the squares of the absolute values. So |0.5|^2 is 0.25, and |sqrt(3)/2|^2 is (3/4) = 0.75.

So ⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. That makes sense.

Now for σ_x. Hmm, σ_x is a bit trickier. I think the expectation value for σ_x can be found using the formula ⟨σ_x⟩ = |a|^2 (⟨↓|σ_x|↑⟩) + |b|^2 (⟨↑|σ_x|↓⟩) + some cross terms.

Wait, actually, maybe a better approach is to use the eigenstates and how σ_x
