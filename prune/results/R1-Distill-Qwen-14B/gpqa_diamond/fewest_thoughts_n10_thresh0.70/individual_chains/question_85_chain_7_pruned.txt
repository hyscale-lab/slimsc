Okay, so I have this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember that depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh right, the formula is something like T_p = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25, but wait, maybe I got that wrong. Oh wait, maybe it's T_p = T_star * (R_star/(2a))^0.5 * ( (1 - A) )^0.25, yeah that sounds right.

Wait, the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so the (1 - A) part cancels out when taking the ratio. So I can ignore that part.

So, the key is figuring out the ratio of the distances of the two planets from the star because the equilibrium temperature depends on 1/sqrt(a), or actually sqrt(R_star/(2a)), so the ratio would be sqrt( (a2)/(a1) ) because the higher a means lower temperature.

Wait, no, wait. The equilibrium temperature formula is T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ). So if a is larger, the temperature is lower. So, the ratio of T1 to T2 would be sqrt( (a2)/(a1) ) * (R_star/(2a)) terms. Hmm no, wait, let me get the formula right.

The equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L / (16 π σ a²))^(1/4) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). But L is the star's luminosity, which is given by L = 4π R_star² σ Teff⁴. So substituting that, equilibrium temperature T_p is ( (4 π R_star² σ Teff⁴ ) / (16 π σ a²) )^(1/4) * (1 - A)^0.25. Simplifying, that's (R_star² Teff^4 / (4 a²))^(1/4). Which is (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * Teff. So yeah, T_p = Teff * sqrt( R_star/(2a) )

So the ratio of T1 to T2 is sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So if I can find the ratio a2/a1, take the square root, and that's the T ratio.

But how do I find a1 and a2? The problem gives me data from the transit and RV methods. The RV method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis. Wait, because the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which is related to the planet's mass and the semi-major axis.

Wait, the RV method can give the mass of the
