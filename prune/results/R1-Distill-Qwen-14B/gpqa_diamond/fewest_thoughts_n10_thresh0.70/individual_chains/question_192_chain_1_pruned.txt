Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone places a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. They also mention that l and L are greater than R, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, so I remember that when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, right? So when +q is placed inside the cavity, what happens?

Oh right, in electrostatics, the charges in the conductor will rearrange. The inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q, because opposite charges attract. But since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance it out. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that straight.

If the conductor is initially neutral, and +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Because the conductor's material can't have an internal field. So the inner surface is -q, and the outer surface must then be +q since the conductor's total charge was zero, and now the outer surface adds +q to balance the -q inside.

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify: the initial conductor is neutral. The cavity has +q, which induces -q on the inner surface. So the conductor's total charge is now (from the conductor's perspective) the inner surface -q plus the outer surface. Since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q. Because the total charge is (inner) -q + (outer) +q = 0. So the outer surface's charge is +q.

So now, the point P is outside the conductor. The conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q.
