Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about an electron's state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I know is usually denoted as S_z. So, the first thing I need to do is normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Wait, right. The state |alpha> is given as proportional, so I need to find the normalization constant. The steps I remember are: find the inner product of the state with itself, set it equal to 1, and solve for the constant.

So, let me write the state |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let's denote this as |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i) and b = (2-i). 

The inner product <alpha|alpha> should be |a|^2 + |b|^2 because |up> and |down> are orthonormal. So, |a|^2 is (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2. And |b|^2 is (2-i)(2+i) = 4 +1 =5. So, adding them gives 2+5=7. So, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because |alpha> is proportional, so to make it a unit vector, we divide by sqrt(7). So the state becomes |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Next, the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij = ℏ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, what does that look like? Let me think. The matrix is 2x2 because the basis is |up> and |down>. So, the matrix would be:

[0, ℏ/2]
[ℏ/2, 0]

Because when i≠j, the elements are ℏ/2, and when i=j, they are zero. Hmm, that's an interesting matrix. That's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ℏ/2. Oh wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator is (ℏ/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of this operator should be the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.
