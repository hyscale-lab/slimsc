Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read the question again carefully.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm. Let me think about what I know here. So, the electron and positron are annihilating, which is a process that converts their mass into energy, usually in the form of photons. Since they're matter and antimatter, they annihilate each other completely. 

Wait, but the problem says they produce two photons. That makes sense because energy and momentum must be conserved, so two photons would help conserve both. If it were just one photon, that would complicate things because the photon's momentum has direction, and the system's momentum before collision would require the photon to have a particular direction which might not be possible.

So, moving on. Both photons have the same energy. So their energies are equal. Let's denote each photon's energy as E. Since their directions are upper-right and lower-right, their angles relative to the horizontal (the original direction of the particles) would be θ and -θ, maybe? Or perhaps different angles. Wait, but the problem doesn't say their angles are the same, just that one is upper-right and the other lower-right.

But their energies are the same. So each photon has energy E, and their directions make some angles with the horizontal. Let's imagine a coordinate system where the initial motion is along the x-axis. The electron is moving to the right (from left), the positron is moving to the left (from right).

Wait, the electron is moving from the left towards the right, and the positron is moving from the right towards the left. So they are approaching each other along the same line. So when they collide, they annihilate into two photons.

Conservation of energy and momentum must apply. So I need to model this.

But wait, the electron and positron are moving towards each other. So their momenta are in opposite directions.
