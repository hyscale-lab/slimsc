Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on NMR data after a specific reaction. Hmm, let's see.

The compound X is C11H12O. It reacts with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Oh wait, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in the formation of epoxides. Oh right! It's used in the epoxidation of alkenes. So this reaction is probably epoxidizing a double bond in compound X.

So the product after reaction is an epoxide. Let me think about the NMR data given for the product. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra have specific signals. Let me break down the info.

Starting with the 1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet integrating to 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split the signal, maybe an electronegative atom or part of a ring. Like a CH3 group attached to oxygen or something.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet for 3H. Could be another methyl group, maybe adjacent or in a similar environment to the first.
Wait, but wait—could this be two different methyl groups? Like maybe one attached to an oxygen (like an epoxide) and another in a styryl group?

Looking at the aromatic region:
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

So, the aromatic protons are showing a pattern. Let me think about how this would split. Maybe it's a di-substituted benzene? Or perhaps a styryl group (which is a vinyl benzene). The doublets suggest coupling between two protons each. Let me think about a para-substituted styryl group.

Wait, styryl is like a benzene ring with a CH2-CH2 group? No, wait, styryl is actually a vinyl group attached to benzene. So maybe the structure is something like benzene-CH2-CH2, but more accurately, it's benzene-CH=CH2 but connected to another group.

Wait, but the NMR shows four peaks in the aromatic region. Let me think about a para-substituted benzene. But that would have two sets of protons. Alternatively, if it's a styryl group (like CH2=CHPh), the coupling would be different. Wait, in the product, the epoxide would come from the double bond in the starting material. So the starting material must have a double bond that gets converted into an epoxide.

So maybe the starting compound X has a structure like a styryl group attached to an oxygen ring. Oh wait, the options include epoxides
