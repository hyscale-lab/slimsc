Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energy E is given as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), and the options are given in terms of multiples of E.

Hmm. So each particle is in a 1D infinite well, which I remember is also called a particle in a box. The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), which is n²E, since E is defined as (π²ħ²)/(2mL²). So for each particle, the energy depends on the quantum number n squared.

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2, which means they're fermions. Oh right, fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, so no two can occupy the same quantum state. So each state is determined by the quantum numbers n and spin. Since spin-1/2 has two possible states (up and down), each spatial state can hold two particles.

So I need to arrange four fermions in the lowest possible energy states, considering the Pauli exclusion. The problem is about the system's energy, so I need to figure out the configuration of the four particles in the lowest, first, and second excited states.

In a 1D box, the spatial wavefunctions are determined by the principal quantum number n, which can be 1, 2, 3, etc. Each n can have two spin states (up and down), so each n can hold two particles.

So for four particles, let's think about how they'll fill up the energy levels.

The ground state would have the lowest possible energies. Starting from n=1. Since each n can hold two, n=1 can hold two particles. Then n=2 can hold two more. So in the ground state, two particles are in n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the other two are in n=2 (each with opposite spins). So the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, but wait a second. Are the particles spin-up and spin-down in the same n allowed? Yes, because the spin is part of their quantum state. So each spatial state (n) can have two particles with opposite spins.

So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (spin up and down), and the next two go into n=2 (spin up and down). So the total energy for the ground state would be 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2). E_1 is 1²E = E, E_2 is 2²E=4E. So 2*E + 2*4E = 2E +8E=10E? Wait, but wait, no, no, each particle's energy is E_n. So for each particle, E_n = n² E. So for two particles in n=1, each contributes E, so 2E. Then two particles in n=2, each contributes 4E. So 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state energy is
