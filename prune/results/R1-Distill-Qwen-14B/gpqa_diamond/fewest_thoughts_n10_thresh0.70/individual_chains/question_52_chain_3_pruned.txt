Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Hmm, let's start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics, and how spots on its surface affect the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots versus when it does.

Alright, let me jot down the key points:

- The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses.
- When no spots are present, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K.
- When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K.
- The ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots.
- The transition between these levels corresponds to about 1448 Å (which is in the near UV or visible range, I think).
- The photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so Boltzmann equation applies.

I need to find the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2, and how this ratio changes when the star has spots. The question is about the factor, so I think I need to compute (n1/n2) when no spots are present divided by (n1/n2) when spots are present, or vice versa, depending on whether the ratio increases or decreases.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, (n1/n2) is smaller than when there are no spots. So the factor we’re looking for is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots. Let me see.

In LTE, the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights of the two levels.
- E2 and E1 are their energies.
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait: the ratio we're looking for is n1/n2, so that would be the inverse of n2/n1. So:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

So the ratio depends on the temperature, the energies of the levels, and the statistical weights.

But wait, the problem doesn't give us the statistical weights. Hmm, but perhaps they are the same? Or maybe in the absence of knowing, we can assume they are the same, since they are not mentioned. Because without that info, maybe the problem is considering the ratio of the Boltzmann factors only. So perhaps g1 and g2 are the same. Or perhaps it's a typo, and the question is about the ratio (n1/n2
