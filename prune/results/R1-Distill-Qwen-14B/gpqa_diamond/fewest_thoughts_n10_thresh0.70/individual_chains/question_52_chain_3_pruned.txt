Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They're looking at the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2), and when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So the key here is about the ratio of two energy levels in the stellar photosphere. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight and E is the energy difference. So the ratio depends on temperature.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower (5500 K instead of 6000 K). So we're looking at how the ratio changes when T decreases.

Let me think. The ratio of N1 to N2 is proportional to exp( - (ΔE)/(k T) ), because E2 is higher than E1, so ΔE = E2 - E1. If T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the exponential term gets smaller. So N1/N2 would decrease because the denominator (N2) is increasing relative to N1.

Wait, but wait. No, when T drops, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) is smaller. So N1/N2 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So at lower T, this ratio would be lower. So when the star has spots (lower T), N1/N2 is lower. Which matches the problem statement that the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

So the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes. So the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots.

Which would be [ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ] 

The g1/g2 terms cancel out because they're the same in both ratios. So the factor is exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] + [ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

Wait, let me double-check that. So:

Factor = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE
