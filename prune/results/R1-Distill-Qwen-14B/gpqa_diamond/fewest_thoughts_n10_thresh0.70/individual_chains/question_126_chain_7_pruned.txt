Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and think through what's going on here.

The question is about two reactions performed by an organic chemist. After both reactions are done, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. I need to figure out how many peaks the chemist would observe in each case.

Hmm, let's break down the reactions first.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is lithium aluminum hydride, a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones. So the starting material is a ketone. The structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. That means the ketone is on carbon 3, and there's a methoxy group on carbon 5 of a six-carbon chain.

So when LAH reduces a ketone, it becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product should be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait, the configuration might change. Wait, wait, no. LAH is a strong reducing agent but it's not a stereoselective reducing agent. So the ketone is R or S? The starting material is (S) configuration. Wait, no, the configuration of the starting material is (S) at carbon 5, I think. Wait, wait, actually, for (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-something. So the ketone is at C3, and the methoxy is at C5.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw the structure. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-CO-(CH2)3. So 5-methoxy would be at the fifth carbon. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2COCH2CH2CH3, but the 5-methoxy would have a methoxy on the fifth carbon. So the structure is: 

CH2CH2-CO-CH
