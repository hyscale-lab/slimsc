Okay, so I need to figure out how long it will take for this astronaut to reach Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud, right? Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about space travel and relativity. Oh wait, this is a science question, probably involving special relativity because the spacecraft is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

First, the problem gives me the speed as 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is really close to c. So relativistic effects will definitely be important here. I remember that at such high speeds, time dilation and length contraction come into play.

The question is from the astronaut's perspective. So I should think about their proper time, which is the time they experience. Proper time is the shortest possible time between two events, and it's measured in the moving frame of the observer—in this case, the astronaut.

Wait, but what about the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud? Oh, right, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and it's about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact figure. Let me think. I think it's approximately 163,000 light-years. So the distance is D = 163,000 light-years.

Now, in the astronaut's frame, the distance would be contracted because of length contraction. Length contraction in the direction of motion is given by L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length (the distance as measured in the Earth's frame). But wait, since the astronaut is moving at a high speed, the Earth and the galaxy would be moving relative to them. So from their perspective, the distance is shorter.

Alternatively, I could calculate the time from the Earth's frame and then apply time dilation. Which approach is better? Let me think.

The spacecraft is moving at v = 0.99999987c. Let's compute the Lorentz factor gamma first. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me calculate that:

v = 0.99999987c → v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² ≈ very close to c². Let me compute 1 - v²/c².

v = 0.99999987 →
