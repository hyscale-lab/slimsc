Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

First, I think I should figure out the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³, right?

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So the initial concentration M1 is 0.05 M, and V1 is 20 cm³. The new volume V2 is 40 cm³. So the new concentration M2 would be (M1 * V1) / V2. Let me calculate that.

M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, the reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base). The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid will be neutralized to form the acetate ion (CH3COO^-). So at equivalence, the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate.

But before that, let's find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. Wait, but the question asks for pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So maybe I can handle each part separately.

First, let's handle the equivalence point.

At equivalence, the number of moles of NaOH added equals the moles of acetic acid initially present. So first, find moles of acetic acid after dilution.

Moles of CH3COOH after dilution: M = 0.025 M, V = 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L). So moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

NaOH is 0.1 M. Let me find the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence. Moles NaOH = 0.001 mol, so volume V = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. Wait, so the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.
