Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration calculations can be tricky for me. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this is a classic acid-base titration scenario.

First, I think I need to figure out the concentrations after dilution. Let's start with the initial volumes and concentrations. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³, 0.05 M. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. 

When you dilute a solution, the amount of solute stays the same, so I can use the dilution formula C1V1 = C2V2. Here, C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. The new volume V2 is 40 cm³. So the diluted concentration C2 would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that: 0.05 * 20 = 1 mmol. Divided by 40 cm³ gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, the titration with NaOH starts. The NaOH is 0.1 M. So, first, I need to find out how much NaOH is used at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

What's the equivalence point? That's when moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present. Let's calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), concentration 0.025 M. Moles = concentration * volume in liters. So 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. 

Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. 

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the required NaOH has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Now, let's think about each scenario: 25% titration and equivalence point.

Starting with 25% titration. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, the moles of acetic acid initially in the solution is 0.001 mol. The moles of NaOH added (2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M) is 0.0025 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.00025 mol. Since the reaction is 1:1, 0.00025 mol of acetic acid has been neutralized, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate.

So, the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the acetate produced is 0.00025 mol.

The total volume of the solution is original 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ NaOH added. So total volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L). 

Now, the concentrations are [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M and [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since acetic acid is a weak acid and its conjugate base (acetate) is present, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is the negative logarithm of Ka. Given that Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = approximately 4.73 (since log(1.85e-5) is about 4.73 in negative. Wait, wait, wait, wait: wait, pKa = log(Ka^-1). So, let me compute it accurately. 

Ka = 1.85e-5. Log(1.85) is about 0.267. So log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733, approximately 4.73.

So, pH = 4.73 + log( (0.005882) / (0.017647) ) 

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(0.333) is about -0.477. 

So pH is 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. So approximately 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26; option D is 4.57, which is higher than this. So 4.25 would correspond to option A's first value.

Now, moving to the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution will consist of sodium acetate (a salt of a weak acid and strong base) dissolved in water. This will form a buffer solution, but since all the acid is neutralized, the solution will be basic because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid.

The moles of acetate will be 0.001 mol, from the neutralization. The total volume is the initial 40 cm³ plus the 10 cm³ of NaOH added: 50 cm³ (0.05 L). 

The concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Since acetate is the conjugate base, it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be found from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

But wait, that's Kb for acetate. Alternatively, since we have a solution of a weak base (acetate), we can calculate the pH using the Kb.

The formula for the concentration of OH- in a weak base solution is sqrt( Kb * C ), assuming that x is small compared to C.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10, C = 0.02 M.

So, sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.486. So pH = 14 - 5.486 = 8.514.

Wait, that's about 8.51, which is close to option A's second value of 8.52. So at equivalence point, pH is approximately 8.51.

Now, looking at the options, option A is (4.26;8.52). So that matches our calculations for both points.

But
