Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, I need to figure out which compound the spectral data corresponds to. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says the chemist found a white solid, and there are some spectral data provided. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different structures. Let's go through each piece of the data.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and there's another peak at 158 with 32% intensity. Wait, molecular ion is usually the major peak, so 100% at 156 makes sense. The 158 peak is a fragment maybe? Or could it be an isotope? Wait, chlorine has a significant natural abundance. Chlorine's isotopic masses are about 35 and 37. So if the molecular formula has a Cl, the molecular ion would appear as a doublet with 3:1 ratio or something. But the molecular ion here is at 156, but there's a peak at 158. Let me think: if the molecular formula has a Cl, the molecular ion would have a 75% chance of being at m/z = (156) and 25% at 158 because Cl is about 75% 35Cl and 25% 37Cl. Wait, but wait, the molecular ion is at 156 (100%) and another at 158 (32%). That doesn't fit exactly. Hmm, maybe the molecular formula doesn't have Cl, or perhaps I'm looking at something else.

Wait, let me check the options. The options are A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure-wise, that would be Cl on the 3 position, OH on 2, and aldehyde. Molecular formula: C8H7ClO2. What's the molecular weight? Carbon is 12*8=96, H is 7, Cl is about 35.5, O is 16*2=32. So 96 +7 +35.5 +32= 170.5. Wait, but the molecular ion is 156. That doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, let me calculate each option's molecular weight.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is benzaldehyde (C7H6O) but with Cl and OH. So benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding Cl (35.5) and OH (17) but wait, no, wait. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. If it's 2-hydroxy, so that's an OH group added. So the formula becomes C7H6O2Cl. Wait, let me count. Benzaldehyde has 7 carbons (the benzene ring plus the aldehyde group). Wait, no: Benzaldehyde is C6H5CHO, so that's C7H6O. Adding a Cl and an OH? So formula would be C7H5ClO2? Wait, maybe. Let me compute.

C:7*(12)=84, Cl:35.5, O:2*(16)=32, H:5*(1) =5. Total 84+35.5=119.5 +32=151.5 +5=156.5. Oh, so molecular weight is about 156.5. So the molecular ion at m/z 156 would make sense. Then the peak at 158 is 32%—hmm, perhaps it's an isotope. Wait, but if the molecular ion is 156, and the next peak is at 158, which is two mass units higher. That could be if there's a chlorine atom in the molecule. Because Cl has two major isotopes: 35 (~75%) and 37 (~25%). So the molecular ion would have peaks at 156 (35Cl) and 158 (37Cl), right? So the abundance would be roughly 75% at 156 and 25% at 158. But in the data, 156 is 100%, and 158 is 32%. That doesn't align because 37Cl is only 25% abundance. Hmm, so maybe the molecular ion is not the only peak. Or perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the molecular formula doesn't have Cl. Let me think. Let's look at the other options.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's compute: 7*12=84, Cl=35.5, O=32, H=5. So 84+35.5=119.5 +32=151.5 +5=156.5. So same as option A. So molecular ion at 156, and then a peak at 158 (37Cl) at 25% of the molecular ion. But the data shows 158 at 32%. Hmm, that's a bit higher than 25%. Maybe the molecular formula includes another Cl, but the options don't suggest that. Wait, looking again, option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. So structure is Cl attached to the benzene ring opposite the COOH group. So molecular formula is C7H5ClO2, molecular weight 156.5. So the same as option A.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is ClCO-O-C6H5? No, wait, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-R. So phenyl chloroformate would be O=C(O-Ph)-Cl. Wait, no, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph, correct. Molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. So same as the others. Molecular weight 156.5. So the same as A and B.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl on the second position of the benzoic acid. Molecular formula C7H5ClO2. Same molecular weight again.

So all the options have the same molecular formula, same molecular weight. So the mass spectrum can't be used to differentiate between them based on molecular weight. But the isotopic pattern might help. Because all have Cl, so the molecular ion should have two peaks at m/z 156 and 158, with a 3:1 ratio (since Cl is about 75% 35Cl and 25% 37Cl). So the M peak would be at 156 (75% abundance) and 158 would be 25% of the molecular ion. But in the data, the molecular ion is at 156 (100%), and 158 is 32% of what? Is that 32% of the molecular ion? Or is it 32% of the total? Because in mass spec, the relative intensity is sometimes given as a percentage of the base peak, which is the strongest peak. So in this case, molecular ion is at 100%, and the 158 is 32% of that, which would imply that the molecular ion is 100%, and the 158 is 32% of that. So 32% is about 25% * (100/75) if the base peak is at 156 (the 35Cl version). Wait, this might be getting too confusing. Maybe I should move to other spectral data and see if I can find more clues.

IR data: Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which suggests O-H stretching. It's broad, so maybe it's an acidic O-H like a carboxylic acid. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Which type of carbonyl would that be? For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm^-1. For an ester, it's around 1740-1720 cm^-1. For an aldehyde, it's higher, around 2800 and a strong peak around 1710 maybe. Wait, the IR here is 1720, which could be either an ester or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch which is consistent with the 3500-2700 cm^-1. So if the IR has both a broad peak and a strong carbonyl, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: this has a benzaldehyde group (CHO), which would have a strong aldehyde peak around 2800 and 1710 cm^-1. But the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is more in line with an ester or a ketone. Also, the O-H in this compound would be phenolic (since it's 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde). Phenolic O-H has a broad peak, but in the IR, I think it might be around 3200-3500, but the broad peak here is from 3500-2700, which is a bit lower than typical phenolic O-H. But I'm not sure. Also, the aldehyde would have a strong peak around 1710, but the IR here is 1720, which is a bit higher. Maybe that's possible.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: this is a carboxylic acid. So the IR should show a broad O-H stretch (which it does) and a carbonyl around 1700. The given IR is 1720, which is a bit higher. Carboxylic acids typically have lower wavenumbers, around 1680-1720. Wait, maybe 1720 is possible. So this might fit.

C) Phenyl chloroformate: structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. It's an ester. The IR would show a strong carbonyl around 1740-1720 cm^-1. And the O-H in this compound? Wait, phenyl chloroformate is an ester, so there isn't an O-H group. Hmm, but the IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700, which suggests an O-H group. So perhaps this is not C, because no O-H in chloroformate. So C is probably ruled out.

D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: another carboxylic acid. So IR would show broad O-H around 3000 and a carbonyl around 1700. The given data matches this possibility as well.

So from IR, options B and D are possible, maybe A as well, but option C isn't because of the O-H.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:

The NMR shows:

11.0 ppm (s, 1H)
8.02 ppm (d, 2H)
7.72 (d, 2H)

So let's think. A singlet at 11.0 ppm. That's a strong indication of an acidic proton, probably an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid. But wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but in the case of a carboxylic acid, the -OH proton is broad, but in D2O exchange, it disappears. But in the NMR, a singlet at 11 could be a carboxylic acid proton. Or, perhaps it's an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are around 9-10. Hmm, wait, maybe it's an aldehyde. Or maybe it's an aromatic proton in a specific environment. Let me think.

Wait, 11 ppm is quite upfield for an aldehyde. Usually, aldehydes are around 9-10. Alternatively, it's a phenolic -OH, but phenolic protons are in the range of 5-7 ppm, so 11 is unlikely.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's a carbonyl oxygen adjacent proton? No, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but why so upfield? Or perhaps it's an exchangeable proton that's not in an aldehyde or carboxylic acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the singlet at 11 ppm is a carboxylic acid -OH proton. But carboxylic acid protons are usually broad and might not appear as a sharp singlet. Unless the sample was not fully deuterated, but more likely, the singlet is something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but why the shift is higher.

Wait, another thought: maybe the singlet is a ketone's alpha proton, but that's usually around 2 ppm. Or maybe an acidic aromatic proton, like in a para-nitrobenzoic acid, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the aldehyde proton in a conjugated system, which might deshield it more, causing a higher shift. Wait, but 11 ppm is quite high. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure: benzaldehyde with Cl at 3 and OH at 2. So, the aldehyde proton would be at around 9-10 ppm. But the NMR shows a singlet at 11.0, which is a bit higher. Also, the OH proton (phenolic) would be in 5-7 ppm, but in this NMR, there's a singlet at 11 and the other signals are at 8 and 7.7. So perhaps the singlet isn't an OH.

Wait, but in the options, B and D are carboxylic acids. Let's think about their NMR.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure: Cl on the para position relative to the COOH group. The COOH group would have an -OH proton, which is usually broad and may not appear as a sharp singlet unless the solution is not fully exchanging or it's in D2O. Alternatively, the NMR might not show the -OH proton, especially if it's in D2O. But in the given data, there's a singlet at 11.0 ppm. Could that be the COOH proton? Or perhaps it's a different proton.

Wait, in benzoic acid derivatives, the aromatic protons are usually in the 7-8 ppm range. The COOH proton is usually a broad peak around 12 ppm sometimes, but it's often exchanged and not seen. Alternatively, maybe in the case of a deprotonated carboxylic acid (as a carboxylate), the -COO- would not have a proton, but the sample is probably in the acidic form.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's look at the NMR signals.

The NMR has three signals:

- 11.0 ppm singlet (1H)
- 8.02 ppm doublet (2H)
- 7.72 ppm doublet (2H)

The two doublets each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para-substituted rings, the protons are as two doublets each with 2H. For example, if the substituent is at the para position, the adjacent protons (ortho) will split into a doublet, and the meta will also split into a doublet.

Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the two protons adjacent to the substituent (ortho) would be equivalent and as a doublet, and the other two protons (the other ortho to the substituent on the other side) would be another doublet, but wait, no. Wait, para substitution would cause the two sets of ortho protons to be equivalent, so maybe it's a quartet? Or perhaps I'm thinking of meta.

Alternatively, let's take 4-chlorobenzoic acid: the substituents are Cl and COOH at para positions. So the aromatic protons would be in two sets. The Cl is at position 4, and COOH is at position 1. Then the aromatic ring would have protons at positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, but in benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1, and Cl at position 4. So the ring has protons at 2 and 6 (which are ortho to COOH) and 3 and 5 (meta to COOH, ortho to Cl).

Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are Cl at position 4 and COOH at position 1. So the ring is 1-COOH, 4-Cl. So the remaining positions (2,3,5,6) have H.

In such a structure, the protons at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. The protons at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

In such a scenario, the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent due to the symmetry of the molecule. Similarly, protons at 3 and 5 are equivalent.

So in the NMR, we'd expect two doublets. The 2 and 6 protons would be more deshielded (since they are ortho to the electron-withdrawing COOH group), so they would appear downfield. The 3 and 5 protons, which are ortho to Cl (another EWG), would also be deshielded but perhaps less so than the 2 and 6 protons.

Wait, but Cl is also an EWG, but in para position. So the 3 and 5 protons are ortho to Cl, which is at position 4. So both substituents are EWGs. So the ring is symmetric, and the 2,6 protons are in one environment, and 3,5 in another.

In the NMR, the 2,6 protons would be a doublet, integrating to 2H, perhaps around 8.02 ppm. The 3,5 protons would be another doublet, perhaps around 7.72 ppm. That matches the given NMR data.

So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the NMR would show two doublets for the aromatic protons, and the -COOH proton. But in the NMR data, there's a singlet at 11.0 ppm. Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the -COOH proton is usually a broad peak, which may not appear as a sharp singlet. Unless it's a different proton.

Wait, the singlet at 11.0 ppm is 1H. What about the aldehyde? If it were an aldehyde (like in option A), the aldehyde proton would be a singlet around 9-10 ppm. But the given data is at 11.0, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's the -OH proton of a carboxylic acid. But -OH protons are usually broad and may not be observed as a sharp singlet unless the solution is very concentrated or in a particular solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet at 11 is the aldehyde proton in a conjugated or highly deshielded environment. But I'm not sure. Let's think again.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. NMR would have:

- COOH proton: broad, maybe not observed as a sharp peak, but in the data, it's a sharp singlet. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl at position 2, COOH at position 1. So the aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6.

Wait, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So the ring has protons at 3,4,5,6.

The symmetry in 2-chlorobenzoic acid is lower than in the 4-chloro isomer. So the aromatic protons would split into more complex patterns. But according to the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets of 2H each. That suggests a higher symmetry, like the para substitution, which would give two sets of equivalent protons. So perhaps option B is more likely.

Wait, but then why is there a singlet at 11 ppm? Let me think about the other possibilities.

Option C is phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The NMR would have the aromatic protons. But if the chloroformate is present, the O is connected to the benzene as an ester. Since the question says it's a white solid, which matches with a chloroformate, but earlier IR analysis suggested it's a carboxylic acid.

But wait, if it's phenyl chloroformate, it's an ester. So the IR would have a strong carbonyl around 1720, which matches. But the IR also shows a broad peak from 3500-2700. Wait, if it's an ester, where would the O-H come from? There isn't an O-H group in an ester. So the IR O-H peak might not fit option C. So maybe C is not the answer.

Looking again at option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is benzaldehyde with Cl at 3, OH at 2, and CHO at 1. The NMR would have:

- The aldehyde proton: singlet around 9-10 ppm.
- The aromatic protons. Let's see, the structure is:

Positions:
1: CHO
2: OH
3: Cl
4: H
5: H
6: H

Wait, no, benzaldehyde is at position 1, OH at 2, Cl at 3, so positions 4,5,6 would have H.

Wait, 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would have the substituents at 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and 1 (CHO). So the ring has protons at positions 4,5,6.

But in that case, the ring would have which protons? Position 4 is between Cl (position 3) and position 5, which is next to position 6. I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally.

Alternatively, maybe the aromatic protons in this structure are such that there are two sets of doublets each integrating to 2H. Let's think: if the substituents are at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl), then the remaining positions are 4,5,6. Positions 4 and 6 are adjacent to the Cl and the CHO. Hmm, but the symmetry might not create two doublets. Or maybe the protons at 4 and 6 are equivalent, and the proton at 5 is another set. Wait, no, that would lead to a triplet or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents lead to two pairs of protons that are equivalent, giving two doublets. But I'm not sure.

In any case, the aldehyde proton would be a singlet around 9-10 ppm. But the NMR shows a singlet at 11.0, so that's a bit high. So perhaps option A isn't the correct answer.

Alternatively, could the singlet be another proton, like an aromatic proton in a specific environment? Unlikely.

Wait, what about benzoic acid derivatives? For example, para-substituted benzoic acids. Let's think about option B again: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

In that case, the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, as discussed earlier, integrating to 2H each. The -COOH proton would be a broad peak, but in the data, the singlet is sharp at 11.0. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, unless the sample was treated with something, but in the given data, the singlet is at 11.0, maybe it's not the COOH. Alternatively, perhaps it's another proton, like an acidic aromatic proton.

Wait, if the structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The positions 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl; positions 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

In such a case, the 2 and 6 protons would be more deshielded, appearing downfield. Let's say around 8.02 ppm as a doublet (2H), and the 3 and 5 protons around 7.72 ppm as another doublet (2H). That matches the NMR data. So the aromatic protons fit.

Then, what about the 11.0 ppm peak? It's a singlet, 1H. If it's the COOH proton, in the NMR, it would typically be a broad peak, not a sharp singlet. So perhaps the sample was taken in D2O, which exchanges the -OH proton, leading to it not being observed. But in that case, the 11.0 ppm peak would not be present. Alternatively, perhaps the sample was not deuterated, and the -OH proton is observed as a broad peak, but the data shows a sharp singlet. Hmmm.

Wait, another possibility: the 11.0 ppm peak is an aldehyde proton. But in that case, the structure would have an aldehyde, which would fit option A. But earlier analysis suggested it's a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the 11 ppm peak is an NH proton, but none of the options have NH groups.

Wait, another angle: looking at the integration. The 11.0 ppm is a singlet integrating to 1H. If the molecule has an -OH group, and it's exchanging rapidly, the peak might not be sharp. But the data shows a sharp singlet, which suggests it's not an -OH. So perhaps it's an aldehyde proton. But in that case, in option A, the aldehyde is present, but the aromatic protons don't fit as two doublets. Because in option A, the substitution pattern would cause more splitting.

Wait, let's think about option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl at position 2, COOH at position 1. The aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6.

In this case, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl), so the ring has H at 3,4,5,6. The symmetry is lower, so the NMR would have more splitting. But the given NMR shows two doublets of 2H each, which is more indicative of a para-substituted compound, like option B.

So, perhaps the correct answer is B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

But then, why the 11.0 ppm peak? Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the 11.0 ppm is not a proton, but an artifact. Or perhaps it's an exchange with something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a peak from another compound in the sample, but the question states it's a single compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the 11.0 ppm peak is the -COOH proton, but I'm not sure why it would appear as a sharp singlet. Unless it's a deuterated compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the coupling. The two doublets in the NMR are each 2H. So for each, it's a doublet, meaning each proton is coupling with one neighboring proton with the same environment. So in a para-substituted ring, each proton has two neighboring protons, but perhaps in this case, only one is equivalent.

Wait, maybe the substituents are such that the ring is split into two sets of two equivalent protons each, each set being a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet at 11.0 ppm is a different group, like an aldehyde or a ketone. But the IR doesn't support a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet is a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: the 11.0 ppm could be an acidic proton like an aldehyde. But in that case, the structure would have an aldehyde group, like option A.

So, in option A, the structure is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The aromatic protons would be in positions 4,5,6.

Wait, the structure would have:

Position 1: CHO
Position 2: OH
Position 3: Cl

So positions 4,5,6 have H.

But in such a structure, are there two sets of equivalent protons? Let me think.

The ring would have substituents at 1,2,3. So position 4 is adjacent to position 3 (Cl) and position 5. Position 5 is adjacent to position 4 and 6. Position 6 is adjacent to 5 and position 1 (CHO). So the substituents are in such a way that positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. So their protons would be in different environments. Similarly, position 5 is in a unique environment. So the NMR would show more than two sets of aromatic protons, perhaps. So the given NMR with two doublets suggests a para-substituted structure, which option A isn't.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to make a table of each option and their spectral data fit.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Mass: molecular ion at 156 (matches), 158 at 32% (could be 37Cl at 25% of 156, but the data is 32%—maybe some other factor. Maybe the base peak is the 37Cl, but that's unlikely).

IR: Broad peak (O-H, carboxylic acid), 1720 (carbonyl of acid). Fits.

NMR: two doublets for aromatic protons, which would fit the para-substituted structure. The singlet at 11 could be something else, perhaps not the COOH proton.

Wait, another possibility: the singlet at 11 is not a proton. But that can't be, as it's labeled as 1H.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet is due to an aldehyde proton in a different environment. But then the structure would need to be an aldehyde, which would be option A or something else.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again. 

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

Mass: same as others.

IR: same as B.

NMR: would this structure match the NMR? Let's think. 2-chlorobenzoic acid has the substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). The aromatic protons would be at 3,4,5,6.

In this case, positions 3 and 6 are ortho to Cl (position 2) and meta to COOH (position 1). Positions 4 and 5 are meta to Cl and para to COOH.

So the protons at 3 and 6 would be in a similar environment, perhaps as a doublet (each coupled with their adjacent H). Similarly, protons at 4 and 5 might be another doublet. But the symmetry is less than in the para-substituted case, so perhaps the NMR would show more splitting. But the given data shows two doublets of 2H each, which is more in line with a para-substituted structure.

So option D's NMR would not fit the data as well as B.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. 

Mass: same as others.

IR: 1720 (ester carbonyl), but O-H would not be present, so the broad peak in IR doesn't fit. So C is ruled out.

So, going back, the IR suggests a carboxylic acid because of the broad O-H and the carbonyl at 1720. So the options are B and D.

The NMR data indicates two doublets for aromatic protons, which suggests a para-substituted compound, which would be option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid).

Wait, but then what about the singlet at 11.0? Maybe it's an impurity, or perhaps it's a different proton. Alternatively, perhaps in the NMR, the -COOH proton is not observed because it's exchanged with D2O, and the 11.0 ppm is from another source. But the question states that the NMR has a singlet at 11, so it must belong to the compound.

Hmm, perhaps the singlet is the aldehyde proton in a different structure. But earlier analysis suggests the structure is a carboxylic acid. So I'm a bit torn.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet is the -OH of the carboxylic acid. But why is it a sharp singlet? Maybe in the case where the solution is in a non-deuterated solvent, but it's not usual for the -OH proton to appear as a sharp peak. It's more likely to be broad.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the singlet isn't an O-H but an aldehyde. If the structure were 4-chlorobenzaldehyde, then the aldehyde proton would be around 10 ppm, but that's not one of the options. The options don't have that, though.

Alternatively, maybe the singlet is a different group, but I don't see another possibility.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a conjugated carbonyl, like an acid with a conjugated double bond, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: let's think about the integration. The singlet is 1H. So it's a single proton. The aromatic doublets are each 2H. So that's 5H accounted for. Wait, the molecular formula for all options is C7H5ClO2, which has 7 carbons, 5 hydrogens. Wait, wait, wait. For option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the formula is C7H5ClO2. How many H's are present?

Benzoic acid has 5 H's: 4 in the ring and 1 in the COOH. Wait, no, wait. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Then, adding Cl replaces a H, so C7H5ClO2 has 5 H's. The NMR shows 1H at 11, and 4H in aromatic (2+2). That totals 5H, which matches the molecular formula. So that fits.

So, in option B, the 1H at 11 would have to be the -COOH proton. But why is it a sharp singlet? Maybe in some cases, the -COOH proton can appear as a sharp peak, but generally, it's broad. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different proton, but I'm not seeing another one.

Wait, another possibility: the 1H at 11 is the Cl-bearing carbon's adjacent H. No, that's unlikely. Or perhaps it's a solvent peak, but the question says the data is for the compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet is an impurity, but that's probably not the case here.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Wait, but the mass spec has a 32% at 158, which is 2 mass units higher. So for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the molecular ion would be at 156 (35Cl) and 158 (37Cl). So the relative intensities should be approximately 75% at 156 and 25% at 158. But the data shows 100% at 156 and 32% at 158. That doesn't fit well.

Wait, that's a problem. Because if the molecular formula has one Cl, the isotopic pattern should be approximately 3:1 for 35Cl:37Cl. So the 156 peak is 75% and 158 is 25%. But in the data, 156 is 100%, and 158 is 32%. That suggests that maybe the Cl is not present in the molecular ion. Or perhaps the molecular formula doesn't have Cl. But all the options have Cl.

Wait a minute, wait another look at the options. Let me recheck.

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. So it has one Cl. So the isotopic peaks should be at 156 (35Cl) and 158 (37Cl), with 75% and 25% respectively. If the base peak is 156 (35Cl), which is 75% of the total, then 158 would be 33.3% of the base peak (25% /75% is 1/3 ≈ 33%). Oh! The data shows 32% at 158. That's close enough, considering experimental error. So 32% is approximately 33.3%, which fits.

That makes sense now. So the molecular ion is 156 (35Cl), and the 158 is 37Cl, which is 25% of the total, which is 32% of the base peak (since 25 /75 = 1/3 ≈ 33%).

So the mass spec data fits with option B.

Putting it all together:

- IR shows broad O-H (carboxylic acid) and strong carbonyl (1720 cm^-1).
- NMR shows aromatic protons as two doublets (para-substituted), and a singlet at 11 ppm, which I'm still unsure about, but perhaps it's the -COOH proton despite the sharpness.
- Mass spec fits with Cl in the molecule, with the correct isotopic pattern.

So the correct answer is B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


To identify the compound, the spectral data provided was analyzed in detail:

### Mass Spectrometry (MS)
- **Molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)**: This corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound.
- **Peak at m/z = 158 (32%)**: This is consistent with the presence of a chlorine atom, as chlorine has two isotopes, $^{35}\text{Cl}$ (75% abundance) and $^{37}\text{Cl}$ (25% abundance). The ratio of 156 to 158 corresponds to the isotopic pattern of a single chlorine atom, with 156 being the base peak (75% of the total signal) and 158 being the heavier isotope (25% of the total signal). The 32% abundance of the m/z = 158 peak aligns with this explanation.

### Infrared Spectroscopy (IR)
- **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm$^{-1}$**: This indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **Strong sharp peak at 1720 cm$^{-1}$**: This is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a carboxylic acid.

### $^1$H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: A sharp singlet integrating for 1H, likely corresponding to the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid group.
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, each integrating for 2H, consistent with a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of Options
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**
   - This compound contains an aldehyde group, which would produce a characteristic aldehyde proton signal around 9-10 ppm in the NMR. However, the NMR data shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is inconsistent with an aldehyde proton. Additionally, the aromatic proton pattern does not match the two doublets observed in the NMR.
   - **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**
   - This compound contains a carboxylic acid group, which explains the broad O-H peak in the IR and the sharp singlet at 11.0 ppm in the NMR. The para-substitution pattern (Cl and COOH at the para positions) accounts for the two doublets in the aromatic region of the NMR. The molecular weight and isotopic pattern match the MS data.
   - **Matches all spectral data.**

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**
   - This compound contains an ester group, which would produce a carbonyl peak around 1740-1720 cm$^{-1}$ in the IR. However, it lacks an O-H group, making it inconsistent with the broad O-H peak observed in the IR.
   - **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**
   - This compound contains a carboxylic acid group, which would produce a broad O-H peak in the IR and a sharp singlet in the NMR. However, the substitution pattern is meta (Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1), which would result in a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, inconsistent with the two doublets observed.
   - **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion
The compound that matches all the spectral data is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.

**Answer: B**
