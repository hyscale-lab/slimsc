Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which are pericyclic reactions. I remember that pericyclic reactions involve concerted movements of electrons, like in cycloadditions or sigmatropic shifts. Sigmatropic rearrangements involve the migration of a sigma bond along with the movement of pi bonds.

The problem has three parts, each with a reaction and options for the product. I need to figure out each reaction's outcome and match them with the options A, B, C, D.

Let's break down each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ and Heat) â†’ A.

Hmm, so 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is an amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. The structure would be CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Wait, no. Wait, ethanamine is CH2CH2NH2, but 1,1-dimethoxy would be on the same carbon as the amine. So it's CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think. Ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. If it's 1,1-dimethoxy, then the structure is (CH2(OCH3)2)NH2? Or maybe it's (CH2OCH3)2NH? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH2CH2NH2, but with two methoxy groups on the first carbon. So the structure would be (CH3O)2CHNH2? No, wait, 1,1-dimethoxy would be on the same carbon as the amine. So the structure is (CH3O)2CH2NH2? No, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. With two methoxy groups on the first carbon, it becomes (CH3O)2CHNH2. So, the molecule is (CH3O)
