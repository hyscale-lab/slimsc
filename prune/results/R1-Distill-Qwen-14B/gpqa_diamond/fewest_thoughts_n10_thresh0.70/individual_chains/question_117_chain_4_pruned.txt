Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism. The options are four compounds numbered 1 to 4, and the possible answers are combinations of these.

First, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, which are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. These chiral centers make the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image, leading to enantiomers and thus optical activity.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The groups are nitro and a dimethyl ester of a carboxylate.

Wait, is there a possibility of the molecule having a chiral center here? Let's see. The central bond is between two benzyl rings, but I'm more interested in the ester groups. Each ester is on a benzene ring. If the structure is symmetric, maybe not. Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Oh, wait, but in biphenyls, the positions can cause some kind of stereoisomerism due to the possibility of the rings rotating, but I think that's more about conformational isomerism, not optical. Unless there's a chiral center.

Alternatively, maybe the ester groups are attached in such a way that the central carbon isn't a chiral center. Wait, no, in this case, the ester groups are on the benzene rings, which are connected to the biphenyl structure. Each benzene ring is connected via the central bond. Wait, perhaps the carbonyl groups are in such a position that they create a chiral center.

Wait, each ester is on the 2-position. So, each benzene ring has a COOCH3 group at position 2, and another nitro group at position 6. So each ring has two substituents: COOCH3
