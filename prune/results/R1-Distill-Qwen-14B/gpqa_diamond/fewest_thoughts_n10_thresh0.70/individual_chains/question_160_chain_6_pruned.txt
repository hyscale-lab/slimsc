Okay, so I've got this problem about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength Î» is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field diffraction pattern. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Hmm.

Wait, when N is infinitely large, the aperture becomes like a circular shape because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. So maybe this is a problem related to a circular aperture, but I'm not sure. Or is it? Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, right. So for a regular polygon, all apothems are equal. So for a regular N-gon, the apothem 'a' relates to the radius of the circumscribed circle. Oh wait, right! The apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. So as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem 'a' would be the radius of that circle.

Wait, but wait. Wait, if the polygon has all apothems of length 'a', then when N is very large, the shape becomes a circle with radius equal to 'a'. So the aperture is a circle of radius a. Then, when light passes through this, the diffraction pattern in the far field would be the familiar single-slit diffraction.

Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. No, the single-slit diffraction is when you have a slit of some width
