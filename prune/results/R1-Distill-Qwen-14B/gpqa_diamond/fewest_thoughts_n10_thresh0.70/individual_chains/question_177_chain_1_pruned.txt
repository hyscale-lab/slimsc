Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given data is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, but wait, the question is about luminosities. Hmm, I remember that luminosity of stars is often related to both their radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play here.

The question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda is the same, then T is the same. So both stars have the same temperature. That's an important point.

Wait, but wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh, but wait, radial velocity relates to the Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength would be shifted depending on the velocity. But the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So does that mean the emitted wavelengths are the same, or the observed ones after Doppler shift?

Hmm. Because if the stars are moving, the observed wavelength would be different. Oh, wait, the problem says they used spectroscopy to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. So I think this refers to the observed wavelengths, not the emitted ones. Because when you do spectroscopy, you observe the light, which is shifted due to velocity.

Wait, but then the temperatures would not be the same. Because if one star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength is different, which affects the perceived temperature. Hmm, no, wait. Let's think again. The peak emission wavelength (lambda_max) for each star, as per their rest frames, would be determined by their temperatures. But when the star is moving, the observed lambda_max is shifted by the Doppler effect.

So if the observed lambda_max is the same for both stars, that doesn't necessarily mean their temperatures are the same. Because the Doppler shift could cause the observed lambda_max to be same even if their actual temperatures are different.

Wait, but the question says that the astronomers computed the luminosities assuming they radiate as black bodies. So perhaps they used the observed wavelengths to determine the temperatures, but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let me reread the problem statement. It says, "they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the observed lambda_max is same. So for black body radiation, the peak wavelength observed is lambda_max_observed = lambda_max_rest *
