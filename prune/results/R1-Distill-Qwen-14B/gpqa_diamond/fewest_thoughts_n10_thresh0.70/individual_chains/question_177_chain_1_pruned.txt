Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given info is:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, Radius_1 = 1.5 * Radius_2.
- The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. So Mass_1 = 1.5 * Mass_2.
- The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body is related to its temperature. The formula is Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same? Because λ is inversely proportional to T. So T_1 = T_2.

Wait, but wait. That's only if they're perfect black bodies, right? The problem says they radiate as black bodies, so yes.

Now, the problem says the astronomers calculated the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by some factor. We need to find that factor.

I remember the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since both stars have the same T, because their λ_max is same, the luminosity ratio will depend on the radius squared.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, let's compute L1 / L2.

L1 = 4π (R1)² σ T⁴
L2 = 4π (R2)² σ T⁴
So L1 / L2 = (R1² / R2²) = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Wait, that's straightforward, right? So the luminosity should be 2.25 times higher, which would point to option A.

But wait, the options also include other factors. The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm, but that's only considering the radius. Did I miss something?

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect the luminosity calculation?

Wait, wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect, but the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (their peak emission) are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift has been accounted for? Or maybe the radial velocity is given as additional info but not needed here? Because the peak wavelengths are observed to be the same.

Alternatively, maybe the radial velocity affects the calculated temperature? Let me think.

Wait, the observed wavelength maximum is given as the same for both stars. So when
