Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the first part of the problem describes a reaction with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 has some specific peaks, and there's an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. I remember that IR peaks around 1700 are usually carbonyl groups, like ketones or esters. Since KOH is a strong base, maybe an elimination reaction is happening here.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid. When you have vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons), treatment with a strong base like KOH can lead to elimination reactions, forming alkenes. Oh wait, but heating and KOH—another possibility is dehydrohalogenation, which would form an alkene. But wait, wait, the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some other reaction.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons. If each bromine leaves, the structure might form something with a double bond. Let me think: elimination of two equivalents of HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form an alkene. So the product would be 1,3-diene? Or maybe it's a ring-opening?

Wait, no. Wait, if you have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, each Br is on a different carbon. When KOH is used, perhaps each Br is replaced by an -OH group. No, wait, KOH is a base, so it's more likely to cause elimination. So, if each Br is on a different carbon, and the molecule is heated with KOH, perhaps each Br leaves, and the two adjacent carbons form a double bond. So 1,3
