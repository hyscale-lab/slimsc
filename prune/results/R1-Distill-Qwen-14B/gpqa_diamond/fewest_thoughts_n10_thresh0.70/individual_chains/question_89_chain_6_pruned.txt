Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it again and think step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When heated with excess KOH, it forms a product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, producing product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

First, I'll need to figure out what each step does. Let's take it step by step.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with bases, they can undergo elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation. Since adamantane is a highly strained molecule, but wait, wait. Oh no, wait: adamantane is actually a diamondoid structure, quite rigid and not very strained. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure.

Heating with KOH (excess) would likely lead to elimination. That would form an alkene. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, the elimination would form a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, but let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a cage structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on adjacent bridgehead carbons. Eliminating two HBr molecules would form a double bond between those bridgehead atoms. So product 1 is 1,3-diamantadiene? Wait, no, more accurately, maybe 1,3-adamantadiene — but wait, the product description says it's a light yellow solid. Common elimination products are alkenes, and when you eliminate two bromides, you get an alkene. Also, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, that's confusing. Because elimination of HBr from dibromide usually gives an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, so maybe I'm wrong here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. KOH could deprotonate and lead to a substitution. But then again, with two bromides, perhaps it's a double substitution. But then, if both Br- are replaced by hydroxide, you get a diol. But the IR doesn't show O-H stretch (like broad peaks around 3300 cm⁻¹) which would be expected for a diol. So that might not fit. But the IR shows 1720, which is more like a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution leading to a ketone? But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide. If KOH reacts via a substitution, perhaps it's an E2 elimination, but that would be for vicinal dihalides. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: the two bromines are on adjacent carbons (since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, 1 and 3 are probably on adjacent bridgeheads). So when KOH is used, perhaps it's an elimination reaction, but maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait a second, maybe the reaction is a neighboring group participation? Or perhaps this is a case of a base-induced elimination forming a ketone via a different mechanism. Hmm, perhaps the compound undergoes a rearrangement. Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl via a Fittig-like reaction, but that usually requires two aryl halides. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, losing HBr twice, forming a
