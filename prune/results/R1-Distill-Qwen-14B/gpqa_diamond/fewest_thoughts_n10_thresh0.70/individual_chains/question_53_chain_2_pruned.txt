Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Ester groups have specific IR absorptions, like a strong peak around 1740 cm^-1 for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that's a clue.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: six signals. Let's break them down. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons would typically show up as either two doublets (if para substitution) or more complex splitting if it's ortho or meta. Wait, but the question says two signals, so maybe it's para substitution? Because in para, you have two equivalent sets of aromatic protons. Or maybe if the substituents are in positions that create symmetry, like two substituents leading to two types of aromatic Hs.

Then, two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. The signals are one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm, a doublet might indicate coupling with one neighboring proton, while a doublet of quartets suggests coupling with two or more. Maybe this is part of an ester group, like an ethyl ester? Because in ethyl groups attached to an ester, the CH2CH3 group has protons that might split into such patterns. But wait, vinyl protons are more like in a double bond. Oh, wait, maybe it's part of a substituent that's attached to the ring, like an ester with an allyl group or something else. Or maybe it's part of a substituent where the protons are split by adjacent groups.

Also, two signals for –CH3 groups. No –CH2 signals. So the molecule must have two methyl groups, each in a different environment, since their signals are separate. And no CH2 groups anywhere, so all the CH2 would be in positions that are either equivalent or not present.

So putting this together, the molecule is a di-substituted benzene with an ester group. Let's think about possible structures. Ester groups are R-O-CO-O-R' (wait, no, ester is R-O-CO-R'). So maybe one substituent is an ester group. But wait, di-substituted, so two substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group. Let me think about the NMR signals again: the vinyl groups. Hmm, maybe one substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the presence of an ester group and the NMR signals: let's think about the structure. For example, maybe the ring has an ester as one substituent and another group that's an alkoxy or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a methyl group, but that doesn't explain the vinyl protons.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent might be
