Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of calculations. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex here is formed, so I think the problem is about the dissociation of this complex.

Wait, so the formation constant K is given. Formation constants are for the formation of the complex from its ions. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

But wait, the problem gives K as 5e10, which is a big number. That suggests the complex is very stable, so it doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be low.

The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. Because the complex doesn't dissociate much, the concentrations of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4− will be very small.

Let me set up an ICE table. Initial concentrations: [Ca²+] is 0, [EDTA^4−] is 0, and [CaEDTA^2−] is 0.02. Then, when some dissociates, let x be the amount of CaEDTA^2− that dissociates. So:

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is small)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x

Wait, but EDTA in solution can have various protonated forms depending on pH. Oh wait, the problem says pH is ideal. I think that implies that EDTA is in its fully deproton
