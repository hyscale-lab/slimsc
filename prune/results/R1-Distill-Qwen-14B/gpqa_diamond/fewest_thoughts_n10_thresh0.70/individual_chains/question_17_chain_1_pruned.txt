Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me see what the question says.

The problem states that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and it's at a concentration of 0.02 M. So the question is about finding the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

Formation constant, Kf, right? The formation constant (or stability constant) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formula I think is Kf = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, what's the stoichiometry here? The Ca-EDTA complex is probably CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. So the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−, and the Kf is given as 5e10.

So the problem is at equilibrium. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But wait, if the complex dissociates, some of it will break down into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. But if Kf is very large (5e10 is big), that means the complex is very stable. So the extent of dissociation is small, meaning the concentration of free Ca²+ will be very low.

Let me think about the approach. Let's denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4− will also be x because the stoichiometry is 1:1. The concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA²−], will be approximately 0.02 - x. But since Kf is so large, x will be very small compared to 0.02, so
