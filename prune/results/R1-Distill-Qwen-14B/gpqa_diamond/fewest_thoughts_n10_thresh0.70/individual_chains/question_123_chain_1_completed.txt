Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, let me try to break this down. 

The question says that in the ejecta's frame of reference, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, no, actually, the ejecta part is moving towards the galaxy's center, so from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. Or wait, no, the way it's phrased is that from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it. Oh wait, that's the same as saying the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s in the galaxy's frame. Because if you're in the ejecta, you see the galaxy coming towards you at that speed. Right, because speeds are relative in different frames.

The problem is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh wait, time is different in different frames. So we have to account for time dilation, right? Because according to special relativity, moving clocks run slower.

Wait, no. If 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the galaxy's frame? Because each frame will see the other's clock as ticking slower.

So let me think. Let's say the galaxy's frame is S, and the ejecta's frame is S'. In S', the time is 50 seconds, and we need to find the distance the ejecta travels in S, which is the galaxy's frame. 

The speed is given as 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that to meters per second because usually, in relativity, we use meters and kilograms. 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Since 1 km is 1e3 meters, that's 6e7 m/s. Wait, no, wait: 60,000 km is 6e4 * 1e3 meters, so 6e7 meters per second. Wait, 60,000 km/s equals 6e7 m/s? Wait, 60,000 * 1000 meters per second is 6e7 m/s? That's 60 million meters per second. Wait, that's way faster than the speed of light, which is about 3e8 m/s. Wait, 6e7 is 60 million, which is less than 3e8, so that's okay. Because 3e8 is 300 million m/s. So 6e7 is about a fifth of the speed of light. Wait, wait no, 6e7 is 60 million, 3e8 is 300 million, so 60 million is 0.2 the speed of light. So that's under the speed limit, so it's acceptable.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution. So we can treat this as a simple relative velocity problem without considering those factors.

So the key here is that time in one frame is related to time in another via the Lorentz factor. So the time in the galaxy's frame (S) would be longer than the time in the ejecta's frame (S') because from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving. So the moving clock (ejecta) would appear to tick slower. 

The formula for time dilation is t = gamma * t', where t is the time in the stationary frame (galaxy, S), and t' is the proper time in the moving frame (ejecta, S'). 

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So let's compute gamma.

Given v is 6e7 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s.

So v^2 = (6e7)^2 = 36e14 m²/s². c^2 is 9e16 m²/s².

So v²/c² = 36e14 / 9e16 = (36 / 9) * (1e-2) = 4 * 0.01 = 0.04.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame (S'), 50 seconds have passed. So from the galaxy's frame (S), the time elapsed is longer. So the time in S is t = gamma * t' ≈ 51.03 s.

Wait, but wait another thing. Do I have the frames right? Because in the ejecta frame, they are stationary, and the galaxy is moving towards them. From the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy. So the relative speed is v. So gamma is correct as above.

Now, the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is speed multiplied by time in the galaxy's frame. So distance d = v * t.

v is 6e7 m/s, t is 51.03 s.

So d = 6e7 * 51.03 = let me compute that.

Wait, 6e7 m/s is 60,000 km/s, right? Because 1e3 m is 1 km, so 6e7 m is 6e4 km.

Wait, wait, 6e7 m is 60,000,000 meters, which is 60,000 km. So, yeah, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. So for distance in km, we can do 6e4 km/s * t in seconds to get km.

But wait, let me compute the time correctly. So t is approximately 51.03 seconds.

So d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = let's compute that.

60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000. 60,000 *1.03 =61,800. So total is 3,000,000 +61,800=3,061,800 km. Wait, but that can't be right because looking at the options, the maximum is 3,060,000 km (option D). Oh, but wait, my gamma was approximate. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, let me recompute gamma. v is 6e7 m/s. Let me calculate v²/c².

v² = (6e7)^2 = 36e14. c² =9e16. So 36e14/9e16= (36/9) *1e-2 =4 * 0.01=0.04.

So 1 - v²/c² =0.96. So sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5. Hmm, I can compute sqrt(24) as approximately 4.89898. So sqrt(24)/5 ≈4.89898/5=approx 0.9798. So gamma is 1/0.9798≈1.0206. So t=50 *1.0206≈51.03 s.

Wait, but perhaps the exact value is needed. Alternatively, maybe the approximation isn't sufficient, and I should compute gamma more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute gamma using the exact value. Let me compute 0.96's square root more accurately.

Using a calculator approach: sqrt(0.96) = approximately 0.979795897.

So gamma is 1/0.979795897 ≈ 1.020628944.

So t = 50 *1.020628944 ≈51.0314472 s.

So then the distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.0314472 s ≈60,000 *51.0314472 = let's compute that.

Compute 51 *60,000 =3,060,000. Then 0.0314472 *60,000 = approx 1,886.832. So total approx 3,060,000 +1,886.832= 3,061,886.832 km.

Looking at the options:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B) 3,000,000 km.

C) 2,880,000 km.

D)3,060,000 km.

Hmm, the calculation yields approximately 3,061,887 km, which is near option D (3,060,000 km). But why isn't it exactly matching?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is not considering relativistic effects but just using classical mechanics. But the question says both frames are inertial, so perhaps it's a trick question where the time transformation is ignored. Wait, the problem says the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, and in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at v. So with proper time being the shortest time between two events in the object's rest frame.

Wait, wait, but the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy frame would be v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. So we need to calculate the time t in Galaxy's frame (S) corresponding to t' =50 s in ejecta's frame (S').

So t = gamma * t' ?

Wait, no. Wait, according to special relativity, if two events occur at the same place in S', then the time between them is t' (proper time). In S, the time is longer by gamma. So t = gamma * t'.

So in this case, if the ejecta's frame (S') measures 50 s between the events (e.g., the front moving and then stopping), then in the galaxy's frame (S), the time is longer by gamma times.

So the distance in S is v * t = v * gamma * t'.

But wait, let me get this right. The ejecta is moving at speed v relative to the galaxy. So, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's speed is v. So if in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds have passed, then the galaxy's frame would have t = gamma * t' seconds passed.

So the distance would be v * t = v * gamma * t'.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it using velocity addition. But I think the approach I've taken is correct.

Wait, but maybe the correct approach is to compute the distance in the ejecta's frame and then apply length contraction. Or perhaps not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the time from the ejecta's frame and then applying the velocity from the Galaxy's frame. But that's not correct because time in different frames isn't directly multiplicative like that.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the Lorentz transformations. Let me think about the events.

Let's set up the scenario. Let me consider the two events: the front of the ejecta passing a point (event 1), and the back of the ejecta passing the same point (event 2). In the ejecta's frame, these two events are separated by a distance of their own proper length, but wait, but the ejecta is moving, so perhaps the length in the galaxy's frame is contracted.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as the time in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. So in the ejecta's frame, the time between the events is 50 s. The distance covered in the ejecta's frame would be zero because they're stationary and the galaxy is moving towards them. Wait, no, that's not right. Because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them, so the galaxy's center would approach the ejecta over time. So the distance the galaxy's center travels in the ejecta's frame is v * t' = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. But that's in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, but the question is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame, not the other way around. So the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame. So the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

But how to find t when the time in the ejecta's frame is t' =50 s.

So in S (Galaxy's frame), the time between events is longer. So t = gamma * t'. So the distance the ejecta travels is v * gamma * t'.

Let me compute that. So v is 6e4 km/s, t' is 50 s.

Gamma is 1.020628944.

So v * gamma * t' = 6e4 km/s * 1.020628944 * 50 s.

=6e4 * 50 * 1.020628944.

Wait, 6e4 is 60,000, so 60,000 *50=3,000,000. Multiply by 1.020628944: 3,000,000 *1.020628944= 3,061,886.832 km. So approximately 3,061,887 km.

Looking at the options, the closest is D) 3,060,000 km. But why isn't the option exactly that? Perhaps the given answer is intended to be calculated without considering relativistic time dilation and just uses the classical approach, but that would give a distance of 60,000 km/s *50 s =3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that would be incorrect because we have to consider time dilation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is expecting a non-relativistic solution, but the question mentions both frames are inertial, which is a hint towards relativity.

Wait, but 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, so the relativistic effects are small. So the time in the galaxy's frame is about 51.03 s, and the distance is 60,000 *51.03 ≈3,061,800 km, which is close to option D (3,060,000 km). But why isn't it exactly matching?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the approximation that t is approximately t' + (v t'^2)/(2c^2). So using the first-order approximation of time dilation.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.04)) = 1/sqrt(0.96).

Using a calculator, sqrt(0.96)=0.9798, so gamma ≈1.0206.

So t=50 *1.0206=51.03 s. So d=60,000 *51.03=3,061,800 km. Hmm, but the option D is 3,060,000 km. That's 1,800 km less. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute without considering the exact gamma and perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is intended to use the classical approach, ignoring relativity, in which case the distance is 60,000 km/s *50 s=3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that contradicts the initial statement that both are inertial frames, implying that relativity is in play. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is testing knowledge of length contraction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the distance in the ejecta's frame. But no, the question clearly states "what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame".

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the time in the galaxy's frame is less than the ejecta's frame. No, that's not right. Time in the moving frame (ejecta) runs slower, so t' is shorter than t. So our initial calculation was correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculations. Let me compute 50 * gamma with more precise gamma.

Gamma is 1.020628944.

50 * 1.020628944 =51.0314472 s.

60,000 km/s *51.0314472 s =60,000 *51.0314472 =?

Compute 60,000 *50=3,000,000.

60,000 *1.0314472=60,000 *1=60,000; 60,000 *0.0314472=1,886.832.

So 60,000 +1,886.832=61,886.832 km.

Adding to 3,000,000: 3,000,000 +61,886.832=3,061,886.832 km.

Hmm, so approximately 3,061,887 km. But the options don't have that. The closest option is D)3,060,000 km, which is 1,887 km less than my calculation. So perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate gamma with more precise numbers.

Let me compute (v²/c²) again.

v =6e7 m/s.

v²= 3.6e15 m²/s².

Wait, wait, wait: 6e7 m/s is 60,000,000 m/s.

(6e7)^2 = 3.6e15 m²/s².

c is 3e8 m/s, so c²=9e16 m²/s².

v²/c² =3.6e15 /9e16= (3.6/9) *1e-1=0.4 *0.1=0.04. So that's correct.

So 1 -v²/c²=0.96.

sqrt(0.96)=0.979795897.

gamma=1/0.979795897=1.020628944.

So that part is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the velocity as 60,000 km/s, but in the Galaxy's frame, and the time in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. So the distance in the Galaxy's frame would be velocity multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is gamma * t'.

So the calculation is correct. So the answer should be approximately 3,061,887 km, but the options don't have that. The closest is option D:3,060,000 km.

But wait, maybe the problem expects a more precise calculation. Let me compute the exact distance.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately, maybe with more decimal points.

Let me compute sqrt(0.96) with more precision.

0.96 = 96/100=24/25.

sqrt(24) is approximately 4.898979486.

So sqrt(24)/5 =4.898979486/5=0.979795897.

So gamma is 1/0.979795897≈1.020628944.

So t=50 *1.020628944=51.0314472 s.

v=6e7 m/s =60,000 km/s.

So distance d=60,000 *51.0314472=?

Let me compute 60,000 *51.0314472:

=60,000 *51 =3,060,000.

Plus 60,000 *0.0314472=1,886.832.

Total=3,060,000 +1,886.832=3,061,886.832 km.

So the answer is approximately 3,061,887 km.

Looking at the options, the available options are:

A)2,940,000 km.

B)3,000,000 km.

C)2,880,000 km.

D)3,060,000 km.

Hmm. The only option close to 3,061,887 km is option D)3,060,000 km. So the correct answer should be option D. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the relativistic effects and just multiply the velocity by the time in the ejecta's frame, but that can't be right because that would give 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that would be incorrect according to relativity.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of time dilation. Let me think again. If the ejecta's frame is moving at v relative to the galaxy, then in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock runs slower. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, less time would have passed in the galaxy's frame. Wait, no, that's incorrect. 

Wait, no, the moving clock (ejecta) runs slower. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's frame would measure more time. So t=gamma *t' is correct. 

Wait, no, no, because the event is the passage of 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. Let me clarify: when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, the galaxy's clock shows longer than 50 seconds. So the galaxy's time is longer, so the distance covered would be higher. So the calculation I did earlier is correct.

So the correct answer is approximately 3,061,887 km, but since the options don't have this, the closest is option D:3,060,000 km. But perhaps the exact calculation is needed, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects us to use the formula for length contraction. Because in the ejecta's frame, the distance between the galaxy's center and the ejecta is contracted. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the distance the ejecta travels in its own frame, but that would be zero because in their frame, they're stationary. So that's not helpful.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be a trick question, and the distance in the galaxy's frame is simply v * t', which would be 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km (option B). But that would neglect time dilation, which is not correct. But perhaps the problem is designed that way.

Wait, but the problem states that both are inertial frames, which suggests that we should consider relativity. So the correct answer should involve the calculation using gamma, which leads to option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 3,000,000 km. Let me reevaluate the setup.

Wait, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the ejecta's frame is S', and the galaxy's frame is S.

In S', the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in S, the ejecta is approaching the galaxy at 60,000 km/s.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the distance using the time in S' but multiplied by the velocity in S. But that's not correct because time in S' is different from time in S.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased such that the time in the ejecta's frame is the proper time, and we need to find the distance in the galaxy's frame. So the proper time is the shortest time between two events, which occurs in the rest frame of the object (the ejecta). So the galaxy's frame would have a longer time.

Thus, the time in S is t = gamma * t' =1.0206 *50≈51.03 s.

So the distance in S is v * t =6e4 km/s *51.03 s=6e4 *51.03=3,061,800 km.

So the options don't have that, but perhaps the intended answer is option D, 3,060,000 km, as the closest option. Alternatively, if the problem expects an approximate calculation, perhaps it's using gamma as 1, which gives 3,000,000 km (option B), but that would be incorrect.

Wait, but why would the problem give a speed that's a significant fraction of c if it's expecting a classical solution? That seems unlikely. So perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more precisely. Let me think.

We can compute sqrt(0.96) using a Taylor expansion or binomial approximation.

sqrt(1 - x) ≈1 -x/2 -x²/8 for small x.

Here, x is 0.04. So sqrt(0.96)=sqrt(1-0.04)≈1 -0.02 - (0.04)^2/8=1-0.02 -0.0016/8=1-0.02 -0.0002=0.98 -0.0002=0.9798. Hmm, that's the same as before. So gamma is approximately 1.0206.

So perhaps the intended answer is D)3,060,000 km.

But wait, looking at the options, perhaps the answer is 3,060,000 km, which would correspond to 51 seconds exactly.

Because 51 *60,000=3,060,000 km. So perhaps the problem assumes that gamma is approximately 1.02, leading to t=50.999... seconds, which when multiplied by 60,000 gives 3,059,940 km, which rounds to 3,060,000 km.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 3,060,000 km, and the options are rounded.

So, given the options, the correct answer is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference, considering relativistic effects due to the high velocity of the ejecta (60,000 km/s, or 0.2c). The goal is to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:  
   In special relativity, time dilation occurs between two inertial frames moving relative to each other. The relationship between the time in the ejecta's frame (\(t'\)) and the Galaxy's frame (\(t\)) is given by:
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]
   where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\).  
   Here, \(v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} = 6 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\).  
   Compute \(\gamma\):  
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = \frac{(6 \times 10^7)^2}{(3 \times 10^8)^2} = \frac{36 \times 10^{14}}{9 \times 10^{16}} = 0.04
   \]
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]

2. **Time in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   Using \(t = \gamma t'\), substitute \(t' = 50 \, \text{s}\):  
   \[
   t = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
   \]

3. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is given by:
   \[
   d = v \cdot t
   \]
   Substituting \(v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(t = 51.03 \, \text{s}\):  
   \[
   d = 60,000 \times 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated distance (\(3,061,800 \, \text{km}\)) is closest to option D (\(3,060,000 \, \text{km}\)). The small discrepancy likely arises from rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **D) 3,060,000 km**, as it is the closest match to the calculated value.

Answer: D
