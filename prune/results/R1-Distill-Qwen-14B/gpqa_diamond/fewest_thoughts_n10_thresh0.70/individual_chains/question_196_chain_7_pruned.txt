Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed is given by something like v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), right? But wait, this is a relativistic case, so I guess special relativity comes into play here. 

The question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is F = -kx, so it's obeying Hooke's law. I'm supposed to find the maximum speed, v_max. The options are given with some involving c, the speed of light, so relativity definitely affects it.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max² → v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but since this is relativistic, that can't be the right answer.

Relativistically, energy considerations are a bit different. The total energy in relativity is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The oscillator's total energy should be the same at all points in its motion. At maximum displacement (amplitude A), the potential energy is maximum, and kinetic energy is zero. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the kinetic energy is maximum, and potential is zero.

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn
