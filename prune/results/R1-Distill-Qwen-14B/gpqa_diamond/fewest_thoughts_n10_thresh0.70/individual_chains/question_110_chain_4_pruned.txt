Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO and HIRES. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives me five stars with various parameters. The key is to figure out for each star whether it's bright enough to be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. Because each spectrograph has a different brightness limit.

From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Oh wait, no, waitâ€” the question says "brighter than 17 mag," but wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter. So if a star's V magnitude is less than or equal to 17, it's bright enough for ESPRESSO. Because higher magnitudes are dimmer. Wait, no: the problem says "brighter than 17 mag." So wait, actually, the observable magnitude is less than 17, right? Because higher magnitude is fainter.

Wait, no, let me get this straight. Apparent magnitude: lower means brighter. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than V=17, that means apparent magnitude less than 17. Because like, the Sun is -26, which is super bright. So for a star to be visible, its apparent magnitude should be <= 17 for ESPRESSO, since it's 'brighter than 17'. Wait, but the way the question is phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, wait, that's a bit confusing. Because in astronomy, "brighter than" in magnitudes can be a bit tricky because of the way the scale works.

Wait, let me think again. The magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So a star that's brighter than magnitude 17 would have an apparent magnitude less than 17. Because, like, a star with V=16 is brighter than a star with V=17. So if the instrument can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that would mean stars with
