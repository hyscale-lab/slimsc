Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me try to think through each part of the question step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and then match them with the options given.

Starting with reaction A:
The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. I think sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates the alpha position of the malonate to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because the enolate is resonance stabilized.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, wait. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-p-tolyl, but I think the structure is more like CH2-CH(C6H4-4Me)-CO-OCH3. Wait, no. Wait, the acrylate is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with the substituents on C3. So maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. But here it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. The substituent would be on carbon 3, so maybe it's CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, wait. Let's
