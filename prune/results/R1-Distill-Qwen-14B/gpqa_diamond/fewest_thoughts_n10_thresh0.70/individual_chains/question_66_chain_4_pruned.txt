Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my SMEFT, but I remember that in the effective theory, you have a set of operators that are classified by their dimension. The idea is that you write down all possible operators that are consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the operators must respect those symmetries.

Wait, Standard Model symmetry includes gauge symmetry, Lorentz symmetry, and some others like P, C, and T symmetries. But wait, the question is about what SMEFT operators must respect. I think that the SMEFT framework is built from operators that are invariant under the Standard Model's gauge group and Lorentz symmetry. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must, that's option 1.

Poincaré symmetry is a bit trickier. Poincaré includes Lorentz and translation symmetries. If the theory is Lorentz invariant, it's usually also translation invariant, but I'm not sure if that's automatically the case in SMEFT. Wait, SMEFT is an effective theory valid at a certain scale, but it's still built in a way that respects the same symmetries as the Standard Model. So the Standard Model has Poincaré symmetry, so SMEFT
