Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, let me think about parallax and star distribution.

Okay, parallax is a measure of how far away a star is from us. The formula I remember is that the distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax (plx), so d = 1/plx. So as parallax increases, the distance decreases. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Wait, so it's the density of stars in terms of parallax. Since stars are uniformly distributed, I think it relates to how their distances are spread out.

If stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means there are the same number of stars in each spherical shell as you go outwards. So the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dr is proportional to the surface area of the shell. The surface area of a sphere is 4πr², so for a thin shell, it's 4πd² dr. So the number of stars per unit volume increases with d².

But wait, we need to relate this to parallax. Since d = 1/plx, let's substitute that. So d² would be (1/plx)² = 1/(plx)^2.

But wait,
