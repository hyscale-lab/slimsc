Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed. So that means the number of stars per unit volume is constant, right? But wait, when they talk about the number per unit range of parallax, I need to relate parallax to distance.

Parallax, plx, is related to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Now, the problem is about how the number of stars changes with respect to plx. So I'm guessing I need to find the number of stars per unit plx interval. Let's denote N as the number of stars, and plx as p.

Since the distribution is uniform in space, the number density n is constant. So in a volume V, N = n * V. But how does this relate to parallax?

Wait, parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. Let's consider a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dd. The volume of this shell is approximately 4πd² * dd. Because the volume of a spherical shell is 4πr² dr, where r is radius.

So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd. But we're interested in how many stars there are per unit change in parallax (p). So we need to express this in terms of p instead of d.

Since p = 1/d, then dd = - (1/d²) dp. Because differentiating p with respect to d gives dp = -dd/(d²). So substituting d = 1/p, we get dd = - (1/( (1/p)^2 )) dp = - p² dp.

Wait, maybe it's easier to change variables. Let me think. Let's express the number of stars per unit p range.

The number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is N = n * 4πd² dd.

But since p = 1/d, dd = - (1/p²) dp. Hmm, because d = 1/p, so dd = -1/p² dp. Substituting back, N = n *4π (1/p)^2 * ( -1/p² dp )
