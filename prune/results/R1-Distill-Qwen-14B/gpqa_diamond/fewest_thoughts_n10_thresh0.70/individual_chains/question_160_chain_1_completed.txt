Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and in the far field, it creates intensity maxima and minima. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large, and they say we can approximate tan(theta) as theta because the angles are small.

Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about diffraction patterns. When light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, creating a pattern of bright and dark fringes. The simplest case I know is the single slit, where the minima occur at certain angles determined by the slit width.

Wait, but the problem says the aperture is a polygon with N sides, and as N approaches infinity, it becomes a circle? Or maybe something else. Oh wait, no. Wait, if all apothems are the same length, then it's a regular polygon. And as N increases, the polygon approaches a circle. But wait, a circle's apothem is the same all around, so that makes sense.

Wait, but in the single-slit case, the minima are given by a sin(theta) = m lambda, where m is an integer. The first minima are at m=1, so theta is arcsin(lambda/a). But the question is about the first two minima when N is large. Wait, but wait, if N is approaching infinity, the pattern becomes a circular aperture, right? Because the polygon becomes a circle.

Wait, but the circular aperture's diffraction pattern is the Airy disk. The first dark ring occurs at a certain angle. But wait, the question is about the first two minima. Wait, the Airy pattern has a central bright spot, then the first dark ring, but maybe the first minima are when the pattern starts to drop below the central maximum. Hmm, I might be getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps when N is very large, the polygon approximates a circle, but perhaps this is a case of a circular aperture. Wait, but the problem says "aperture which shapes like a N-sided polygon" and all apothems are same length. Wait, wait a second. For a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So, if the apothems are all the same, then each side is the same length. So when N is large, the shape is a circle with radius equal to the apothem a?

Wait, no. Wait, the apothem of a regular polygon is given by a = (s/2) cot(pi/N), where s is the side length. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. So for a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem a is the radius of the inscribed circle. So the circumscribed circle (the one passing through the vertices) has a radius R = a / cos(pi/N). So when N is very large, R approaches a, since cos(pi/N) approaches 1.

Wait, but perhaps that's complicating things. Maybe when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. So the effective aperture is a circle of radius a.

But wait, wait. No. Because in the case of a single slit, the width is the slit's width. For a circle, the radius is a, so the diameter is 2a. But in the single-slit case, the minima are at a sin(theta) = m lambda. So the first minima would be at theta = lambda/a, but wait, no, because a is the slit width. So the first minima is at theta = lambda/a when a is the slit width.

But wait, in the case of a circular aperture, the minima are not as straightforward as the single slit. The minima in the Airy disk occur at angles where the Bessel function derivative is zero, but for the first minima, the angle is approximately 1.22 lambda/(diameter of the circle), which is 1.22 lambda/(2a) because the diameter is 2a. Wait, so the first minimum is at theta = 1.22 lambda/(2a) = 0.61 lambda/a. Hmm, that's option A.

Wait, but the question is about the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Wait, but when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, so the diffraction pattern is the Airy disk. The first dark ring (minimum) occurs at about 1.22 lambda/(diameter). So the first minimum is at theta = 1.22 * lambda/(2a) = 0.61 lambda/a. But wait, the problem is about the first two minima, so maybe the first and second minima are at 1.22 and 2.39 (approx) lambda/(2a) or something like that.

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So if the first minima is at 1.22 lambda/(2a), and the second at 2.39 lambda/(2a), then the difference would be (2.39 -1.22) * lambda/(2a) = 1.17 * lambda/(2a) ≈ 0.585 lambda/a. But looking at the options, option B is 0.5 lambda/a, option D is 0.506 lambda/a. Hmm, that's close.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about this incorrectly. Because perhaps for a circular aperture, the minima are at (m * pi)/(a * k), where k is the wavenumber, but wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the case not as a circular aperture, but something else.

Wait, another approach. The problem says the apertures are N-sided polygons, all with apothems a. So for the polygon, the width (the diameter across apertems) is 2a, but wait, no. Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the width (the distance between two opposite sides) is 2a, because the apothem is a. So the diameter of the polygon's inscribed circle is 2a. Wait, that makes sense because the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle.

So the polygon's width (the maximum dimension) is 2a. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a, so the diameter is 2a. So when light diffracts through this, the single-slit diffraction would have the minima at a sin(theta) = m lambda, where a is the width of the slit. Wait, but wait, in single-slit, the width is the slit's width, which in this case is 2a, because the apothem is a, and the width is twice that. So the width is 2a, so a in the formula is 2a. So the minima would be at sin(theta) = m lambda/(2a). So the first minima is at m=1: sin(theta) = lambda/(2a). So theta is approximately lambda/(2a), since for small angles, theta ≈ sin(theta). So the first minima is at theta ≈ lambda/(2a). The second minima would be at m=2: sin(theta) = 2 lambda/(2a) = lambda/a. So theta is approx lambda/a. So the angular distance between the first two minima is lambda/a (from m=1 to m=2) minus lambda/(2a) (m=1) is lambda/(2a). So the distance is lambda/(2a), which is option B: 0.500 lambda/a.

Wait, but wait, I thought the polygon becoming a circle would lead to the Airy pattern. But maybe the problem is treating it as a single slit because the width is 2a, so the first minimum is at lambda/(2a), and the second at 2lambda/(2a) = lambda/a.

But wait, that can't be right because in the single-slit case, the minima are at a sin(theta) = m lambda, where a is the slit width. So if the width here is 2a, then m=1 would be at (m lambda)/(2a) = (lambda)/(2a). So the first minimum is at theta1 = lambda/(2a), the second at theta2= 2lambda/(2a)= lambda/a. So the angular separation between first and second minima is theta2 - theta1 = (lambda/a) - (lambda/(2a)) )= lambda/(2a) = 0.5 lambda/a, which is option B.

But wait, earlier I thought about the circular aperture, which gives a first minimum at about 1.22 lambda/(2a) = 0.61 lambda/a. But that's if the diameter is 2a, so that the radius is a. So the question is, is the problem considering this as a single-slit scenario, or as a circular aperture?

The problem states that the aperture is a polygon with all apothems a. When N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a, so the width is 2a. So the single-slit formula would apply, with a being 2a (slit width), giving minima at theta = m lambda/(2a). So the first minimum at m=1: theta = lambda/(2a), and the second at m=2: theta= lambda/a. So the distance between them is lambda/(2a). So the answer would be option B, 0.500 lambda/a.

Wait, but the options include option C) 1.220 lambda/a, which is the first minimum for a circular aperture. So perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a circle, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a multi-slit scenario, but as N becomes large, the interference becomes more like a continuous aperture, but perhaps the diffraction pattern is still more like a single slit.

Wait, but in the question, the light falls vertically on the aperture, which suggests it's a single aperture, not multiple slits. So single-slit diffraction applies.

Wait, but the polygon's apothems are all a, so each side is a certain length, but for an N-gon, the width is 2a. So the effective slit width is 2a. So the single-slit minima occur at a sin(theta) = m lambda, where a is 2a. So m=1: sin(theta)= lambda/(2a), so theta ≈ lambda/(2a). Second minima at m=2: lambda/(a). So the separation is lambda/(2a), which is option B.

But wait, why the option C is 1.220 lambda/a. That's the first minimum for a circular aperture. If the problem is treating the polygon as a circle (with radius a, so diameter 2a), the first minimum would be at 1.22 lambda/(diameter) = 1.22 lambda/(2a) = 0.61 lambda/a, which is option A. So that's the first minima. But the question is about the first two minima, so perhaps the first and second minima are at 0.61 and 1.22*(2)= 2.44? Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the general case of an aperture with a certain shape. The diffraction pattern is determined by the Fourier transform of the aperture function.

But perhaps for a regular polygon with a very large N, the diffraction pattern approaches that of a circle. So the minima would be similar to those of a circular aperture. But wait, the minima in a circular aperture are not given by the same formula as the single slit. The minima in the Airy pattern occur where the Bessel function J1 has its zeros. The first minimum is at j_{1,1}= 3.8317, but the approximate value is taken as 1.22, so the angle is (1.22 lambda)/(diameter), which is (1.22 lambda)/(2a) = 0.61 lambda/a, so option A.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minima is at theta1 = 1.22 lambda/(2a), and the second minima is at (2.39 lambda)/(2a), perhaps? Because the zeros of J1 occur at approximately 3.83, 7.02, 10.18, etc. So the first zero is at 3.83, so theta = (3.83 lambda)/(2a) ≈ 1.915 lambda/a. Wait, no, 3.83/(2) is 1.915, so 1.915 lambda/a. Hmm, that doesn't fit the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the zeros wrong.

Wait, perhaps the first minima in the Airy pattern is at theta = 1.22 lambda/(2a) (where the first zero of J1 is at 3.83, so 3.83 * lambda/(2a) ≈ 1.915 lambda/a. Then the second minima would be at 7.02 lambda/(2a) ≈ 3.51 lambda/a. The difference between 3.51 and 1.915 is 1.595 lambda/a, which is not among the options. So perhaps the problem isn't about the circular case.

Wait, but the question says when N is infinitely large, so perhaps the polygon becomes a circle, so the first minima is at 1.22 lambda/(2a) = 0.61 lambda/a (option A). But the problem is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minima is at 0.61 lambda/a, and the second minima would be the next zero of J1, which is around 7.02 lambda/(2a) ≈ 3.51 lambda/a. So the difference is 3.51 - 0.61 = 2.90 lambda/a, which is not an option. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the polygon's diffraction pattern for large N is similar to a single slit, so the minima are at m lambda/(2a), as before. So first minima at m=1: 0.5 lambda/a, second at m=2: 1.0 lambda/a. So the angular separation is 0.5 lambda/a, which is option B.

But wait, why is option C) 1.220 lambda/a present? Because that's the first minima of the Airy pattern, but perhaps the problem is mixing up the concepts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a slit, but the width is a, not 2a.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the slit width. The apothem is a, which is the radius of the inscribed circle. For a regular polygon, the side length s is 2a tan(pi/N). So when N approaches infinity, tan(pi/N) ≈ pi/N, so s ≈ 2a (pi/N). But as N approaches infinity, s approaches zero, but the polygon's width becomes 2a. Wait, no, because the apothem is a, so the width of the polygon is 2a, so the effective slit width is 2a. So the single-slit formula would use a=2a, so the minima are at m lambda/(2a).

Wait, but in the problem statement, the apothems are all of length a, so the width of the polygon is 2a, making the slit width 2a. So the first minima is at theta= lambda/(2a), the second at 2 lambda/(2a) = lambda/a. So the separation is lambda/(2a), which is option B.

But if the problem is about the first two minima in the far field, perhaps it's considering the diffraction pattern as the single-slit, which gives minima at m=1 and m=2, leading to a separation of lambda/(2a).

So the correct answer would be option B: 0.500 λ/a.

But wait, another approach. Perhaps the problem is not considering a single slit, but an aperture that's a polygon, and when N is large, it's a circle. So the diffraction pattern would be that of a circular aperture, which has a central maximum surrounded by rings. The first dark ring occurs at an angle theta given by the first zero of the Bessel function, which is about 1.22 λ/(diameter). Since the diameter is 2a, that gives theta = 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a, which is option A. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima, which would be the first and second zeros of the Bessel function. Let me look up the zeros of J1.

J1 has its first zero at approximately 3.8317, and the next at 7.0156. So the first minima is at (3.8317 λ)/(2a), the second at (7.0156 λ)/(2a). The difference is (7.0156 -3.8317) λ/(2a) = (3.1839 λ)/(2a) ≈ 1.592 λ/a. But none of the options match this. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming the polygon is acting as a multi-slit with N slits, but as N becomes large, it's treated as a continuous aperture. But when N approaches infinity, the interference becomes more like a diffraction pattern. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, going back to the problem statement: it's a monochromatic light falling vertically on the aperture, creating a series of maxima and minima in the far field. The problem says to approximate tan(theta) as theta because angles are small. So perhaps this is a Fraunhofer diffraction scenario.

For a single slit, the minima are at a sin(theta) = m lambda. The angular separation between the m=1 and m=2 minima would be (2 lambda/a) - (lambda/a) )= lambda/a divided by something? Wait, no, the angles themselves are theta_m = arcsin(m lambda/a). For small angles, theta ≈ m lambda/(a). So the separation between m=1 and m=2 is (2 lambda/a) - (lambda/a) )= lambda/a. But that can't be right because the options don't have lambda/a; they have fractions like 0.5 or 0.61 times lambda/a.

Wait, maybe I confused the slit width. The apothem is a, but perhaps the slit width is 2a, making the first minima at m lambda/(2a), so the separation between m=1 and m=2 is (2 lambda/(2a)) - (lambda/(2a)) )= lambda/(2a) = 0.5 lambda/a, which is option B.

So putting it all together, the first two minima are at m=1 and m=2, so the angular separation is 0.5 lambda/a. So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves a monochromatic light of wavelength $\lambda$ falling vertically on an aperture shaped like an $N$-sided polygon, where all apothems are of length $a$. As $N$ approaches infinity, the polygon approximates a circle with radius $a$. The task is to determine the angular distance between the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern, assuming small angles where $\tan\theta \approx \theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Polygon Approximation as a Circle**:  
   For large $N$, the polygon becomes a circle with radius $a$, and the diameter is $2a$. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is described by the Airy disk, where the minima occur at angles determined by the zeros of the Bessel function $J_1$. The first minimum occurs at approximately $\theta_1 = 1.22 \lambda / (2a) = 0.61 \lambda / a$, and subsequent minima occur at higher-order zeros of $J_1$.

2. **Single-Slit Diffraction Analogy**:  
   If the polygon is treated as a single slit of width $2a$ (where $a$ is the apothem), the minima in the diffraction pattern are given by $a \sin\theta = m\lambda$, with $a = 2a$ (since the width of the polygon is $2a$). For small angles, $\theta \approx \sin\theta$, so the minima occur at:
   - First minimum: $\theta_1 = \lambda / (2a)$
   - Second minimum: $\theta_2 = 2\lambda / (2a) = \lambda / a$

   The angular separation between the first and second minima is:
   \[
   \Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{a} - \frac{\lambda}{2a} = \frac{\lambda}{2a} = 0.5 \lambda / a
   \]

3. **Comparison of Options**:  
   - **Option A ($0.610 \lambda / a$)**: This corresponds to the first minimum in the Airy pattern for a circular aperture, but it does not represent the angular separation between the first two minima.  
   - **Option B ($0.500 \lambda / a$)**: Matches the angular separation between the first and second minima when the polygon is treated as a single slit of width $2a$.  
   - **Option C ($1.220 \lambda / a$)**: This is the first minimum in the Airy pattern for a circular aperture, not the angular separation between the first two minima.  
   - **Option D ($0.506 \lambda / a$)**: This is close to $0.5 \lambda / a$ but slightly overestimates the angular separation.

### Conclusion:
The angular separation between the first two minima is best described by the single-slit diffraction formula, where the width of the polygon is $2a$. The angular separation is $\Delta\theta = \lambda / (2a) = 0.5 \lambda / a$, corresponding to **Option B**.
