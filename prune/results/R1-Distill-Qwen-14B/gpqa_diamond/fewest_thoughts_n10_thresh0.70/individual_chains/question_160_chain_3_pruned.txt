Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diffraction patterns. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says we have an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light, wavelength λ, is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field intensity maxima and minima. The main thing is to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. They also mention using the small angle approximation where tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm, so an infinitely large N-sided polygon... Wait, as N approaches infinity, a regular polygon becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with so many sides would approximate a circle. So maybe this problem is similar to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

Oh wait, but wait. In the case of a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot, and the first minima occur at a certain angle. I remember the formula for the first minimum in single-slit diffraction, but wait that's a single slit, not a circular aperture. Wait, no, single-slit is a slit, which is different from a circular aperture. Circular apertures, like in a lens, produce a different diffraction pattern.

Wait, for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is called the Airy disk. The angular position of the minima in the Airy disk is given by θ = 1.22λ / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture. Oh wait, no, wait. The formula I might be mixing up. Let me think again.

Wait, in the single-slit diffraction, the minima occur at a sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer. For the first minimum, m=1, so sinθ = λ/a, where a is the slit width. But that's for a single slit.

For a circular aperture, the situation is different. The diffraction minima occur when the path difference between light coming from the edge of the aperture and the central part leads to destructive interference. But I think the formula for the minima in circular diffraction is similar to the single slit, but with a different factor. Like for the first minimum, it's about 1.22 times something.

Wait, the problem says that the apothems are all the same length 'a'. Wait, what's an apothem? Oh right, the apothem of a regular
