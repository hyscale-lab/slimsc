Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature relates to how much heat a planet absorbs from its star compared to how much it emits. Since all the planets have the same albedo, the albedo factor cancels out in the ratio.

The planets are in orbital resonance with periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, Planet_2 twice that, Planet_3 2.5 times, and so on. Wait, but how does the orbital period relate to the equilibrium temperature?

Oh right, the equilibrium temperature formula is something like T = T_eff * (L / (16 * pi * sigma * D^2))^0.25, but considering albedo, it's adjusted by (1 - A)/4. But since albedo is the same for all, that part (1-A) is a constant, so when taking the ratio of temperatures between two planets, that part cancels out.

The key thing is the distance from the star. The further out a planet is, the lower its temperature because the star's light spreads out more. So the distance D is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period, right? Because Kepler's third law says P^2 is proportional to D^3. Wait, let me think again. Kepler's law is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³, where a is the semi-major axis. So a is proportional to (P)^(2/3). Because if P increases, a increases as well.

So if Planet_4 has a period that's 3.5 times Planet_1's, its distance is (3.5)^(2/3) times Planet_1's distance. Similarly, Planet_2 is 2 times Planet_1, so a is (2)^(2/3) times farther.

But wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse of the square root of the distance. Because flux is proportional to 1/D², and temperature is proportional to (flux * (1-A)/4 )^0.25. So the temperature is proportional to (1/D²)^0.25 = 1/D^0.5. So T is inversely proportional to the square root of D.

So let's model this. Let’s denote T as the equilibrium temperature.

For a planet, T ∝ (1/D)^0.5. So the ratio of
