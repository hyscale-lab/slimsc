Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, and it contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H₃PO₄ are given as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. The options are A to D with various concentrations.

Alright, so I remember that orthophosphate ion is PO₄^3-. But wait, I think in solution, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. Since the problem involves both KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄, maybe these are going to form a buffer solution, right? Because they’re conjugate acid-base pairs.

So, KH₂PO₄ is the potassium salt of H₂PO₄⁻, which is the dihydrogen phosphate ion. And Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is the sodium salt of HPO₄^2-, the hydrogen phosphate ion. Oh wait, but wait, when you add these two, they can form a buffer because H₂PO₄⁻ can act as an acid (donate a proton to become HPO₄^2-) and HPO₄^2- can act as a base (accept a proton to become H₂PO₄⁻).

So the solution is a buffer solution consisting of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄^2-.

In a buffer solution, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Since we're dealing with the second ionization here (because the second dissociation is between H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄^2-), the relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So the pKa would be the negative log of that.

But wait, the question isn't directly asking about pH, it's asking about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO₄^3-. Hmm. Because orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, but I think under these conditions, the solution might not have much of that, since the second and third dissociations are much weaker.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. H₃PO₄ can lose three protons to become PO₄^3-. The first dissociation is H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4⁻, the second is H2PO4⁻ ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-, and the third is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

But the presence of both KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O introduces H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2- into solution. So the major species would be H2PO4⁻ and HPO4
