Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about a chemical reaction involving Substance X and Liquid Y, producing a gas W and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. Also, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X. Hmm.

First, I'll break down what I know. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, since protons and neutrons have the same count, that makes it a noble gas probably because noble gases are monoatomic and their atoms have balanced protons and neutrons. Let me think: The noble gases have atoms where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons for some isotopes. Wait, but the molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. No, wait, wait, the molecule of the gas has same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, no, the molecule's protons and neutrons? Or maybe each atom?

Wait, the problem says the molecule of gas W has same number of protons and neutrons. So, the molecule would be an atom because noble gases are monoatomic. So if the number of protons equals the number of neutrons, then the isotope has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about noble gas isotopes.

For example, helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons in He-4. That would make sense. Or maybe carbon-12 for CO2? Wait, no, W is a gas when released, so maybe it's a noble gas. So, the possible noble gases and their atoms where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let's see:

- He (helium): He-4 has 2 protons, 2 neutrons. So protons equal neutrons (2 each). So the gas could be helium. Because He is a noble gas and monoatomic.

Another possibility: Ne (neon) has atomic number 10, so 10 protons. For the number of neutrons to be 10, the isotope would be Ne-20. That's a possible isotope, but neon's primary
