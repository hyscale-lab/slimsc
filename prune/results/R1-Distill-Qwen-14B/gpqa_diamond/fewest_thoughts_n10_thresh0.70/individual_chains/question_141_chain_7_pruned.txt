Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, wait, wait a second. "1-bromobenzene-2-d" â€“ I think that's a typo. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2-diethylaminobenzene or something else? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Because the way it's written is a bit confusing. Oh, wait, I think "2-d" might be a substituent. Maybe it's 2-dimethylamino or another group. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromobenzene-d2, but that seems less likely.

Wait, another way: maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. Because "d" could stand for diethyl or dimethyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-diethylaminobenzene. Or maybe the "d" refers to deuterium. Hmm, not sure. Wait, the question is about substitution or elimination. Let me think about the reaction.

The reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. That's a strong base, often used for elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation to form alken
