Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember the Cope rearrangement is a pericyclic reaction, right? It involves 1,5-dienes rearranging under certain conditions like heat or light. The question gives two reactions leading to products A and B, and I need to choose the correct options from A to D.

Let me look at the first part: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. The reaction is with BuLi followed by H+. Wait, BuLi is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. So maybe it's deprotonating something here. The structure is a bit complexâ€”benzene ring with an OCH2 group, which is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group.

Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, wait. Let's write it correctly. The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but wait, 3-methyl would make it CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the structure is OCH2CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 attached to benzene. Wait no, maybe it's OCH2 connected to CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the molecule is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl benzene. That would be:

Ph-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2
