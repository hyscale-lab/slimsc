Okay, so I've got this problem about the Cope rearrangement and some major products. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let's try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the first part of the question is about a reaction involving BuLi and then H+. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. I remember that BuLi is a strong base, so it might deprotonate something. But wait, where are the acidic hydrogens here?

Looking at the structure, the molecule has an ether group: (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy attached to a methyl group which is connected to benzene. The butenyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2... Wait, no, wait: 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH(CH3)- something? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out mentally. The butenyl group is four carbons long with a double bond starting at position 2. So it's CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- but wait, no, the substituents. Wait, the structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy. So the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? No, wait, but it's 3-methyl, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, but but is four carbons. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but the butenyl is four carbons total, with a double bond from C2 to C3. So 1-yl is the end, so structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between 2 and 3, but wait, that can't be. Oh wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- no, wait, no, but 1-yl is the first carbon. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH
