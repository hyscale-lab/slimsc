Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the electric field outside a spherical conductor with a cavity. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: there's a spherical conductor that's uncharged, radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity with radius r. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor, and since r < R, the cavity is entirely inside. Now, they've placed a small positive charge +q somewhere inside the cavity.

The question asks for the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s (the distance between the two centers) is theta.

Wait, so the point P is outside the conductor, which has radius R. So L is greater than R. The point is outside, so the conductor's own charges should influence the field. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. Then, when we place a charge inside the cavity, what happens?

I remember that in electrostatics, when a charge is placed inside a conducting cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge. Since the conductor was neutral, the inner surface will have a charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the enclosed charge. Because the conductor is a sphere, the inner surface's charge distribution should be uniform, right? Because the conductor is a sphere, the charges on the inner surface will arrange themselves to cancel the electric field inside the conductor material. So the inner surface has -q.

But what about the outer surface? Since the conductor as a whole was neutral, and the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q. Because the total charge of the conductor is the sum of inner and outer charges. So outer charge is +q (since initially, the conductor was neutral, so inner is -q, outer must be +q to balance).

Now, considering the point P outside the conductor. The electric field outside a charged conducting sphere is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So for a point outside, the field is due to the total charge on the conductor.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor's outer surface has
