Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, with a Lorentz factor around 20 on average. Now, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. So, the options are A) 54, B)68, C)40, D)28. 

Wait, okay, I remember that the Lorentz factor is gamma, which relates to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. Because the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime due to time dilation. So the distance they can travel before decaying depends on their speed.

I think the formula for the distance a particle travels before decaying is L = gamma * c * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame). 

In the original scenario, with gamma_1 = 20, one third of the particles reach the detector's walls. So, the particles that reach the walls have a lifetime long enough to travel the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. 

Wait, but wait, the problem says "on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector's inner walls." So does that mean that one third have a lifetime long enough to reach 30 meters? Or maybe it's about the probability of decaying before reaching the wall.

Hmm, maybe it's more about the probability of decay. The particles have a certain lifetime, and the probability that they survive to reach the wall depends on their lifetime compared to the time it takes them to reach the wall.

In the lab frame, the time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is t = R/(gamma*c) or wait, no. Wait, the time to reach the wall is t = (distance) / (velocity). But in the lab frame, the particle's velocity is v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2
