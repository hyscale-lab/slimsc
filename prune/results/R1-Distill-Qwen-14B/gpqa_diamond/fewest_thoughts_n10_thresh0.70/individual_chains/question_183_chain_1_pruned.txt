Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained from a reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A to D, with numbers 1, 3, 5, 0.

I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also known as the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), is calculated based on the formula: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is halogens and N is nitrogens. But in this case, the molecule doesn't have any halogens or nitrogens, I think. So the formula simplifies to (2C +2 - H)/2.

So first, I need to figure out what the product looks like after the reaction. The reagents are red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, right! That's the reaction where phosphorus is used in the presence of HI for the hydrolysis of carbonyl groups. Specifically, I think it's the hydrolysis of ketones, aldehydes, or esters. Wait, wait, red phosphorus and HI are used to convert carbonyl groups into alcohols. So, for example, a ketone would become a secondary alcohol, an aldehyde a primary alcohol.

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, I remember that when you have a carbonyl group (like an aldehyde, ketone, ester, etc.) and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it's called the Clemmensen reduction. Oh wait, Clemmensen uses HCl and Zn(Hg), but I might be mixing things up. Oh right, another reaction: the use of PCl3 with H2O gives hydrolysis, but that's different. Alternatively, maybe it's the hydrolysis of an ester? Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but that's not this case. Alternatively, maybe it's the reduction of carbonyl groups to alcohols. So, the starting material has a formyl group (CHO) and a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-), and an ene in the cyclohexene ring.

So the starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me sketch its structure mentally. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond at position 3 (so between C3 and C4). At position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? No, vinyl is CH₂=CH- attached. So the substituents are at positions 2, 3, and 5.

Wait
