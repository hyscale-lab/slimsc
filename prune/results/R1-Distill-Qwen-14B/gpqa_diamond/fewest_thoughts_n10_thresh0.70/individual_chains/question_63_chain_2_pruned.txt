Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are all different momenta, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, a diatomic molecule's energy levels are quantized. The molecule can vibrate and rotate, and these motions contribute to its energy. The energy levels depend on both the vibrational and rotational states.

The fundamental state is probably the lowest energy state, which I think corresponds to the ground state of both the vibration and rotation. So, the molecule is in the v=0 vibrational state and the lowest rotational state, maybe J=0 or J=1? Wait, for a diatomic molecule, the rotational quantum number J starts at 0, but the ground state might have J=0 or J=1 depending on the selection rules. Oh right, the selection rules for rotational transitions are ΔJ=±1. But for the vibrational part, Δv=±1.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental vibrational state is v=0. So if it absorbs a photon, it can either go to v=1, or possibly change its rotational state. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, I think the lowest energy transition would be the one where the molecule goes to the next higher energy state, which is probably a combination of vibrational and rotational changes.

Alternatively, maybe the next state is the first excited vibrational state, v=1, and J remains the same? Or does it change J? Wait, but in the quantum model, transitions can involve both vibrational and rotational changes, but for the lowest energy next state, perhaps it's just a vibrational transition, or maybe a rotational transition with the same vibrational state.

Wait, the model is the rotation-vibration model, which combines both rotational and vibrational energies. So the energy levels are split into vibrational and rotational parts. The energy of the ground state would be the sum of the ground vibrational energy and the ground rotational energy. The next state would be the next possible energy level, which could be either the first vibrational excited state (v=1) with the ground rotational state, or the next rotational state (J=1) with the ground vibrational state. Which one is lower in energy?

Hmm, I think the vibrational energy levels are more spaced out than the rotational ones. Wait no, actually, the vibrational energy levels are more spaced because the vibrational energy is given by E_vib = (v + ½) h w, where w is the angular frequency. Whereas the rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. So whether the vibrational or rotational transition leads to a lower energy depends on the values of w and B.

Wait, I should compute both possibilities. Let me think about the energies.

The energy levels for rotation-vibration are usually given by E = E_vib + E_rot. The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0, so E_initial = (½) h w + (0)(0+1) B = (½) h w.

The possible next states are:

1. v=1, J=0: E1 = (3/2) h w + 0 = (3/2) h w.

2. v=0, J=1: E2 = (½) h w + B*(1)(2) = (½) h w + 2B.

So the difference in energy for each transition:

ΔE1 = E1 - E_initial = (3/2 h w) - (½ h w) = h w.

ΔE2 = E2 - E_initial = (½ h w + 2B) - (½ h w) )= 2
