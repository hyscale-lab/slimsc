Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that in such models, the molecule can be treated as a quantum rotor and a quantum harmonic oscillator. The question is about determining the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to transition to the next lowest energy state.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the ground state, so the lowest energy state. When the molecule absorbs a photon, it will move to the next state. But wait, what's the next state? I think the states are quantized, so the transition would involve either a change in vibrational or rotational state, or both.

Wait, the question says it's modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. So the energy levels are a combination of the two. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). But I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

But the problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. So I need to find the photon's momentum that will take it to the next lowest state. The next state could be the next vibrational state (v=1) or a transition to the next rotational level (J increases by 1), but which one gives the lower energy? Or perhaps a combination of both?

Wait, no. The problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the
