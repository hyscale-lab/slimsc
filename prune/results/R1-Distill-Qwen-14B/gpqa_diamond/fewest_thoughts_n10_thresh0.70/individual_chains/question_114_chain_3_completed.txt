Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question involves two reactions, and I need to pick the correct reagents A and B from the options provided. Let me break it down step by step.

First reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with a cyanide source like NaCN, I'm thinking of the formation of a cyanohydrin.

Cyanohydrin formation usually involves adding a cyanide ion to the carbonyl group. The mechanism is that the base deprotonates the alpha hydrogen, which then attacks the carbonyl carbon. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So in this case, butan-2-one would add CN- in a nucleophilic addition. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, no. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons, but the substituents... Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Butan-2-one has three carbons (since it's (CH3)2CO), so when I add CN, it would form a four-carbon chain? Or maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that's a three-carbon chain with a CN and OH on the same carbon. Oh wait, but that's 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, isn't it? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO (which is three carbons) and adding CN- would give a four-carbon molecule? Wait, no, butanenitrile is four carbons. So maybe the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would have a four-carbon chain, where the second carbon has both a hydroxyl and a methyl group, plus a nitrile group.

Wait, maybe I should think about the cyanohydrin formation. The general reaction is ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. The reaction is typically done in a basic condition. So, for that, the ketone would react with a cyanide ion, and a base is often used to deprotonate the alpha hydrogen.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the reagent A is added along with NaCN. So what's the role of A here? If NaCN provides the cyanide ion, then perhaps A is an acid or a base. Wait, in the cyanohydrin formation, sometimes you need a base to deprotonate the alpha hydrogen so that the enolate can attack the carbonyl. Or wait, no, the base is more for aldol reactions. For cyanohydrin, the reaction is usually done under acidic conditions because the CN- is a nucleophile, and in the presence of acid, the carbonyl becomes more electrophilic.

Wait, wait, I think the cyanohydrin formation can be done under either acid or base conditions. Let me think. When a ketone reacts with NaCN in acidic conditions, like H3O+ (which is option A or B), the H+ would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. The CN- would attack, then the proton would be on the adjacent carbon, and then water would leave, forming the OH group.

Wait, but the product here is a cyanohydrin, which is formed by the addition of CN- and water (or another nucleophile). So NaCN and H3O+ would make sense as reagents for the first step. So in the first reaction, A would be H3O+ because that's the acid that helps in the formation.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+.

Now, looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm, why would someone use NaHSO3 here? Maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: if the first reaction is a nucleophilic substitution or something else. Wait, no, butan-2-one is a ketone, not an alkyl halide. So the reaction must be addition. So back to the thought that A is H3O+.

So now, moving to the second reaction. The product from the first reaction, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, is then treated with reagent B (in the presence of H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, wait, the second reaction is perhaps oxidation. Because nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids under certain conditions.

So the second reaction is converting a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How is that done? Typically, nitriles are oxidized with strong oxidizing agents. For example, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions, or other oxidizing agents like HClO4 or HNO3, but more commonly, in the presence of water and acid.

Wait, the reagent B is given, and the reaction is done with H2O. So perhaps B is an acid. Let's think: the oxidation of nitrile to carboxylic acid could involve a two-step process. First, the nitrile is converted to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid. Or perhaps, using a strong acid with an oxidizing agent.

Wait, maybe the reaction is using HCl as the acid. Because when you oxidize a nitrile, you often use HCl as an acid catalyst. For example, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done under strong acidic conditions. Alternatively, using H2SO4 as a catalyst.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the nitrile group is at the end, and when oxidized, it becomes a carboxylic acid. So the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid, which would have a COOH group at the end.

So the reaction is probably a hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. But wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. Let's think about the conditions.

In acidic conditions, nitriles are hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids. The reaction typically uses a strong acid like HCl, with heat, and water. The general reaction is RCN + H2O (acid) → RCOOH.

So in the second step, reagent B is likely HCl, because the reaction is done in H2O, so adding HCl would create the acidic condition needed for the oxidation.

Wait, but what if the conditions are different? Another possibility is that the nitrile is converted to an amide first, but under strong acidic conditions, it goes all the way to the acid.

So in the second reaction, reagent B is HCl. Now, looking at the options, let's see which options have A as H3O+ and B as HCl.

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl. So that fits.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH. So B would be acetic acid. But I'm not sure if that's a strong enough acid for this reaction. Usually, strong acids like HCl are used.

Options C and D have A as NaHSO3. But from the first reaction, I thought A was H3O+, so options C and D are probably not correct.

So, putting it together: the first reaction uses H3O+ (A) and NaCN to form the cyanohydrin. The second reaction uses HCl (B) to oxidize the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but let me think again about the first reaction. Could the first reaction be a different mechanism?

Another possibility: is the first reaction a nucleophilic substitution? No, because butan-2-one is a ketone, and nucleophilic substitution typically happens with alkyl halides. So perhaps the first reaction is an addition of NaCN with H3O+ as the acid.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the first reaction is an example of the Stephen's reaction, but I don't think that's it. Or perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed addition.

So, the first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

The second reaction is the nitrile group being oxidized to a carboxylic acid using HCl as the reagent.

So the correct reagents are A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires the carbonyl group to react with a cyanide ion (CN⁻), which is facilitated under acidic conditions. Here, NaCN provides the cyanide ion, and the reagent A, identified as H₃O⁺, creates the acidic environment necessary for the reaction. This results in the formation of 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

The second reaction involves the oxidation of the nitrile group (-CN) in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This transformation typically occurs under acidic conditions, where HCl (reagent B) acts as the strong acid catalyst, facilitating the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to the carboxylic acid. The presence of water (H₂O) supports this process.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While A is correct, CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is not a strong enough acid for the second reaction, making this option incorrect.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it does not provide the necessary acidic conditions for cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both reagents are incorrect for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, corresponding to **Option A**.

Answer: A
