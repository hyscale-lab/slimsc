Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs, but they have different capabilities in terms of how bright the stars need to be for detection.

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different properties. I need to figure out which of the options (A to D) correctly states which stars can be observed by both instruments.

First, let me parse the given information. The ESPRESSO spectrograph can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, it says brighter than 17 mag. Wait, actually, the question states, with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Oh wait, no—wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, no—hold on. The way it's phrased: "can be observed" meaning that the instrument can detect them. Oh, wait, no. Wait, if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter than 17 (which means magnitude is lower, since lower magnitude is brighter), then ESPRESSO can observe them. Because higher magnitudes are fainter. So, for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17, so ESPRESSO can see it.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So stars with V magnitude less than or equal to 16 can be observed by HIRES.

So for a star to be detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES, its apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16 mag, because HIRES can't see beyond 16. Because ESPRESSO can see down to 17, but HIRES only down to 16.

Wait, no. Wait, wait, if a star is at V=16.5, it's brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe it, but HIRES can't. Because HIRES only goes down to 16. So only stars with V ≤16 can be observed by both.

Wait, no. The question is asking which stars can be detected with both. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Because ESPRESSO can handle up to 17, but HIRES only up to 16.

So now I need to compute the apparent V magnitude for each star and see if it's ≤16.

Wait, but some of the stars only give absolute magnitude and distance, so I need to calculate their apparent magnitude.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Star1:
- Absolute V magnitude (Mv) = 15.5 mag
- Distance = 10 pc
Apparent magnitude formula: mv = Mv + 5 log10(d/10)
So d=10, so log10(1)=0. So mv = 15.5 +0 =15.5. So V=15.5. Which is less than 16, so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it.

Star2:
- Apparent V magnitude is given as 16.5 mag. Which is fainter than 16, so HIRES can't observe it. But ESPRESSO can (since 16.5 <17). So Star2 can be observed by ESPRESSO, but not HIRES.

Star3:
- Apparent V magnitude is 15.5 mag. But wait, there's extinction. E(B-V)=0.6. The formula is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So Av = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction) plus the extinction. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the star's apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, but that's the observed value, right? Or is it the intrinsic?

Wait, the question says: Star3 has apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, and E(B-V)=0.6. Oh, wait, the apparent magnitude is already the observed value, so that includes extinction. So the question is a bit confusing. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me re-read. The question states: Star3 has apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6. Note that the total absorption in V band is 3.1*(B-V). Wait, wait no, the note says "total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess with a coefficient of 3.1." So Av = 3.1 * E(B-V).

Wait, so if E(B-V)=0.6, then Av=3.1 *0.6=1.86 mag. So the star's actual apparent magnitude without extinction would be mv = 15.5 - 1.86 =13.64 mag. Because the observed mv is the intrinsic plus extinction. Wait no, extinction makes stars appear fainter. So observed mv = intrinsic mv + Av. So, if the observed mv is 15.5, and Av is 1.86, then the intrinsic mv is 15.5 -1.86=13.64. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the extinction-corrected apparent magnitude. Or is the given apparent magnitude already corrected? Hmm, the way the question is phrased is a bit unclear.

Wait, let's think again. Star3: apparent V magnitude is 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6. The absorption (extinction) in V is Av=3.1 * E(B-V), which is 1.86. So the star's light is dimmed by 1.86 mag. So the apparent magnitude we observe is the intrinsic (without extinction) plus the extinction. So, if the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, the intrinsic is 15.5 - 1.86 =13.64. But I'm not sure if the given apparent magnitude includes extinction or not.

Wait, the question says Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V) is 0.6. So, the observed V magnitude is 15.5, which is higher (fainter) than the actual. So to find the actual (intrinsic) V magnitude, we subtract the extinction. So mv_intrinsic = mv_observed - Av. So mv_intrinsic = 15.5 -1.86=13.64.

Now, the question is, do we use the intrinsic or observed magnitude when considering if the instrument can detect it? Because the spectrograph's limit is based on the apparent magnitude, which is the observed (including extinction) value.

Wait, the problem says that the apparent V magnitude is given. So Star3's apparent V is 15.5. So for detection, the instrument's limit is based on the apparent magnitude as observed. So Star3 has an apparent V of 15.5, which is brighter than 16, so it's within both ESPRESSO and HIRES' capabilities. So it can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait, the extinction affects the observed apparent magnitude. Wait, but in the question, the given Star3's apparent V is 15.5. So that's the observed value, already including extinction. So the observation would be that the star appears at 15.5. So, for both instruments, if the observed magnitude is ≤16, it can be observed by HIRES. Since 15.5 <16, it's observable by both.

But wait, if the star's true apparent magnitude is mv_intrinsic=13.64, but the observed is 15.5 due to extinction, that is, the star actually looks dimmer than it is. So in terms of detectability, the observed V is what matters for the instrument. So Star3's apparent V is 15.5, which is within both ESPRESSO (≤17) and HIRES (≤16). So yes, Star3 can be detected by both.

Star4:
- Absolute V =15.5, distance=10 pc.
So mv = Mv +5log10(10/10) =15.5 +0=15.5. So apparent V is 15.5.

But wait, Star4 has E(B-V)=0.4, so Av=3.1 *0.4=1.24 mag. So the observed apparent V would be mv_observed = mv_intrinsic + Av. So 15.5 +1.24=16.74 mag. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, no. If the star's actual (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is 15.5, but the extinction adds 1.24, then the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Wait, but this is confusing. I think I'm mixing up the concepts. Let's clarify.

The absolute magnitude is Mv, which is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So for Star4, Mv=15.5, distance=10 pc, so apparent magnitude is 15.5.

But wait, that's the intrinsic apparent magnitude, without extinction. But the star is located at 10 pc. So the observed apparent magnitude would be mv_obs = mv_intrinsic + Av.

But Star4's E(B-V)=0.4, so Av=1.24. So the observed mv is 15.5 +1.24=16.74. Which is greater than 16. So Star4's apparent magnitude, considering extinction, is 16.74. So for HIRES, which can observe up to 16 mag, this star would be too faint. Because 16.74 >16, so HIRES can't observe it. But ESPRESSO can, since 16.74 <17. So Star4 can be observed by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says for Star4, it's absolute V magnitude is 15.5, located at 10 pc, so apparent V is 15.5. But that doesn't account for extinction. So the actual observed apparent magnitude is 15.5 plus extinction. So 15.5 +1.24=16.74. Which is higher than 16, so HIRES can't observe it.

Star5:
- Absolute V=16.5, distance=5 pc.
Apparent magnitude: mv = Mv +5 log10(d/10).
d=5, so d/10=0.5, log10(0.5)= -0.3010.
So mv =16.5 +5*(-0.3010) =16.5 -1.505=15.0 mag.

Wait, but that's intrinsic, without extinction. Oh, but the question doesn't mention any extinction for Star5, so E(B-V)=0. So the observed apparent magnitude is 15.0.

So Star5's apparent V is 15.0, which is ≤16, so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.

Wait, but wait. Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5, which is higher than the other stars.

Wait, so for each star, I need to find if its apparent V is ≤16 mag. Because both instruments can detect it only if it's within their limit. Since HIRES can't go beyond 16, any star with V>16 can't be observed by HIRES, even if ESPRESSO can.

Let me tabulate each star:

Star1:
mv =15.5 → yes, both.

Star2:
mv=16.5 → ESPRESSO can (16.5 <17), HIRES can't (16.5>16). So only ESPRESSO.

Star3:
mv=15.5 → both can.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought Star3's observed mv is 15.5. But wait, Star3's given apparent V is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6, which causes Av=1.86. So does that mean the actual apparent V (as observed) is 15.5? Or was the 15.5 the intrinsic, and the observed is higher?

I think the given Star3's apparent V is already the observed value, which includes extinction. Because the question states "apparent V magnitude of 15.5." So in that case, the observed magnitude is 15.5, which is less than 16, so both can detect.

Star4:
mv apparent is 15.5 (intrinsic), but with Av=1.24, observed mv =15.5 +1.24=16.74 → which is >16, so HIRES can't.

Star5:
mv=15.0 → both can.

Wait, but wait in Star4, the absolute magnitude is 15.5 at 10 pc, so apparent is 15.5. Then E(B-V)=0.4, so Av=1.24. So the observed mv is 15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So Star4's observed V is 16.74, which is higher than 16. So HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can because 16.74 <17. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Wait, but what about Star5? It's absolute magnitude is 16.5, distance 5 pc.

mv =16.5 +5 log10(5/10)=16.5 +5*(-0.301)=16.5 -1.505=14.995, so about 15.0.

Star5's E(B-V) is not mentioned, so we assume 0. So mv is 15.0, which is ≤16, so both can detect.

So the stars that can be detected by both:

Star1: yes
Star3: yes
Star5: yes

Wait, no, wait. Let's check again.

Star1: mv=15.5 → both can, yes.

Star3: mv=15.5 → both can, yes.

Star5: mv=15.0 → both can, yes.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can be seen by both.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be seen by HIRES.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

So the question is which pair can be detected by both spectrographs.

So which stars can be detected by both?

Looking at each star:

Star1: Apparent V=15.5 → yes.

Star2: 16.5 → HIRES can't.

Star3: 15.5 → yes.

Star4: 16.74 → HIRES can't.

Star5: 15.0 → yes.

So the stars that meet both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

Now looking at the options:

Option B is Star3 and Star5 → both can be seen by both instruments.

Option D is Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be.

So the correct answer would include Star3 and Star5. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option B is Star3 and Star5 → yes.

Wait, but wait, let me check Star5 again. Its apparent magnitude is 15.0, which is within both instruments.

So the answer should include Star3 and Star5, which is option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think about Star4 again. Star4's absolute magnitude is 15.5 at 10 pc, so mv=15.5. But then E(B-V)=0.4, so Av=1.24. So the observed mv is 15.5 +1.24=16.74. So Star4's apparent magnitude is 16.74. Which is fainter than 16, so HIRES can't detect it. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Hmm, so in the options, which include both stars detectable by both?

So the possible pairs are:

- Star1 and Star5: both can be detected by both.

- Star3 and Star5: same.

Wait, but looking at the options: option B is Star3 and Star5. So that's correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star5 is detected by both. So yes, option B includes two stars that can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check Star3's calculation.

Star3: absolute magnitude not given. It's given as apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6.

Wait, no, Star3's apparent V is given as 15.5, which is the observed value. So that's the V magnitude as seen from Earth, including any extinction. So no need to calculate its apparent magnitude. So Star3's V is 15.5, which is less than 16, so both can detect.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 (15.5), Star3 (15.5), and Star5 (15.0).

Looking at the options, only option B (Star3 and Star5) and option D (Star1 and Star4) and option A (Star4 and Star5) are options.

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4:16.74 (can't be seen by HIRES), Star5:15.0 (both). So only Star5 can be seen by both.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can be seen by both.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2:16.5 (ESPRESSO can, HIRES can't). Star3:15.5 (both). So only Star3 can be seen by both.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1:15.5 (both), Star4:16.74 (only ESPRESSO). So only Star1 can be seen by both.

So the only option where both stars can be detected by both instruments is option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, no. Wait, option B is Star3 and Star5.

Wait, let me confirm the apparent magnitudes:

Star3: 15.5, which is <=16 → both detect.

Star5:15.0 → both detect.

So yes, both can be detected by both.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤17, while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:
1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M_V = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m_V = M_V + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5
     \]  
   - \( m_V = 15.5 \leq 16 \), so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m_V = 16.5 \).  
   - \( m_V = 16.5 > 16 \), so HIRES cannot detect it, but ESPRESSO can.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m_V = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
     \]  
   - The given apparent V magnitude already includes extinction, so \( m_V = 15.5 \leq 16 \).  
   - Both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M_V = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m_V = M_V + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5
     \]  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
     \]  
   - Observed apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - \( m_V = 16.74 > 16 \), so HIRES cannot detect it, but ESPRESSO can.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M_V = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m_V = M_V + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 + 5(-0.301) = 15.0
     \]  
   - \( m_V = 15.0 \leq 16 \), so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.

### Conclusion:
- Stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES: **Star1, Star3, Star5**.  
- Evaluating the options:  
  - **A)** Star4 and Star5: Star4 cannot be detected by HIRES.  
  - **B)** Star3 and Star5: Both can be detected by both instruments.  
  - **C)** Star2 and Star3: Star2 cannot be detected by HIRES.  
  - **D)** Star1 and Star4: Star4 cannot be detected by HIRES.  

Thus, the correct answer is **B**, as both Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both spectrographs.  

**Answer: B**
