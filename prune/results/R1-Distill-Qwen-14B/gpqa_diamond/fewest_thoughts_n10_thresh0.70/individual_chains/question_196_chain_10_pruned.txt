Okay, so I’ve got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that harmonic oscillators are systems that experience a restoring force proportional to their displacement. But wait, this is a relativistic one, so I guess I need to consider special relativity effects.

The question is about finding the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

I remember that in the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², right? So the maximum speed v_classical would be sqrt(kA²/m), because (1/2)mv² = (1/2)kA² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so classical formulas might not apply directly.

In special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to account for that.

The oscillator's potential energy is also different in relativity? Or wait, maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)k x²? Because Hooke's law is F = -kx, so the potential is (1/2)k x², same as before. But in relativity, energy and momentum are linked, so maybe the total energy isn't just the sum of kinetic and potential as in the classical case.

Wait, for a harmonic oscillator, the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. In the non-relativistic case, that's E = (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, especially at high speeds near c, the kinetic energy will change the mass (relativistic mass), but I think in this problem, m is the proper mass, and relativistic effects come into play through gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum speed occurs when the potential energy is maximum, which is (1/2)kA², but converted into relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, no. In the case of a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is when the system passes through the equilibrium position (x=0). At that point, all the energy is kinetic
