Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. The molecular formula can sometimes give clues about the structure. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea. The formula is C8H9NO. Breaking it down: for each degree of unsaturation, it's one ring or double bond. The formula for calculating is Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X here is halogens, which isn't present here. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees), a double bond or ring (another degree), maybe an aldehyde group (which is a double bond), and an amide or something else. Hmm, but wait the formula has an O and a N. Maybe an aromatic ring (like benzene) with substituents that include a nitro group or something else? Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with a substituent that's an amine or an amide.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H-NMR (ppm):
- 9.72 (t, 1H)
- 6.98 (d, 2H)
- 6.51 (d, 2H)
- 6.27 (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 (d, 2H)

Let me try to interpret this. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. Thatâ€™s a high chemical shift, possibly an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but they are typically singlets or maybe split into a doublet if coupled with something. But in this case, it's a triplet. So maybe it's an enol or something else, but another possibility is that
