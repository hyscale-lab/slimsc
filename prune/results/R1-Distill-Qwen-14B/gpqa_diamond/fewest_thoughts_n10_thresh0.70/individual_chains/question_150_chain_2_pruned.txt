Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and there are three reagents used in sequence. I need to find out what the final product is from the options given.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The peaks are at 9.72 ppm (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). Hmm, some of these peaks might correspond to aromatic protons or maybe some substituents.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees: probably a benzene ring (3), a double bond or ring (maybe an enal?), and an amine or something else... Wait, the formula includes an O, so maybe a carbonyl group, which is a double bond.

Looking at the NMR, the peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet, integrating to 1H. That's a high chemical shift, so likely an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm, and a triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehydes usually are at the end, like RCHO, so maybe the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system, like an enal.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each with 2H. These are probably aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. The 6.27 is a broad singlet for 2H. That's a bit trickyâ€”could be something like a diene or maybe an enol proton. The 3.66 is a doublet for 2H, maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Or perhaps a methylene group next to a carbonyl.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something with a benzene ring attached to a side chain that includes an aldehyde and another group. Let's think about the possible structures.

The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl: This is usually for diazotization, used in reactions like the Sandmeyer reaction or for making diazonium salts. But wait, it's followed by H2O and then aqueous KOH with heat.

Wait, but the starting material has an -NO group? The molecular formula is C8H9NO; so N is present
