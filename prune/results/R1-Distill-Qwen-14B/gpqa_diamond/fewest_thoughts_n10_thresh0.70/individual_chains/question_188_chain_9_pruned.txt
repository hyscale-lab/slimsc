Okay, so I have this problem about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, let me think.

First, I remember that interplanar distances are related to the crystal structure and the Miller indices. The formula I think I need is something involving the reciprocal of the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) - 2(hk \cos\gamma)/(a b) - 2(k l \cos\alpha)/(b c) - 2(h l \cos\beta)/(a c) ) } }

Wait, is that right? Because rhombohedral crystals have all edges equal and all angles equal, so a = b = c, and α = β = γ. That should simplify the formula a lot.

So, in this case, the lattice parameter a is the interatomic distance, which is given as 10 Angstrom. All a, b, c are 10 Å. The angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. And the plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

Let me plug these values into the formula. Since a=b=c, let me denote them as a.

The formula becomes:

d = 1 / sqrt( (1^2/a²) + (1^2/a²) + (1^2/a²) - 2*(1*1*cos γ)/(a*a) - 2*(1*1*cos α)/(a*a) - 2*(1*1*cos β)/(a*a) )

Since α=β=γ=30°, cos 30° is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So substituting, each cos term is 0.8660.

So the denominator inside the sqrt is:

[3*(1/a²) ] - [ 2*(1/a²)*( (cos30) + (cos30) + (cos30) ) ) ]

Wait, because each term has two cosines multiplied by 1*1, so each cross term is (2*1*1 cosθ)/(a²). There are three such terms, each with cos30°, so 3*(2 * cos30°)/(a²). Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express the denominator:

Denominator = (h² + k² + l²)/a² - 2*(hk cosγ + kl cosα + hl cosβ)/a².

Since h=k=l=1, this becomes:

Denominator = (3)/(a²) - 2*( (1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30 ) ) / a².

So that's 3/(a²) - 2*(3 cos30°)/a².

Which can be factored as [3 - 6 cos30°]/a².

Wait, because 2*3 cos30 is 6 cos30.

So Denominator = [3 - 6*(√3/2)] / (a²).

Simplify the numerator inside the brackets:

3 - 6*(√3/2) =3 -3√3.

So denominator becomes [3 -3√3]/a².

Thus, the entire expression for d is:

d = 1 / sqrt( [3 -3√3]/a² )

Which can be rewritten as:

d = a / sqrt(3 - 3√3 )

Wait, let me compute the denominator. 3-3√3 = 3(1 -√3).

So sqrt(3(1 -√3)) = sqrt(3) * sqrt(1-√3).

Hmm, but 1 -√3 is negative since √3≈1.732. So 1 -√3 ≈ -0.732. The sqrt of a negative number is imaginary, which can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the signs somewhere?

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Oh wait, the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that in a rhombohedral system, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + kl + hl) cosθ } }, where θ is the angle between the axes, which is 30 degrees here.

Wait, that's a simpler formula for rhombohedral systems because a=b=c and angles are equal.

So, yeah, for rhombohedral, the formula simplifies to d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + kl + hl) cosθ ).

Let me double-check this. Oh right, because when a=b=c and α=β=γ, then the denominator inside the sqrt is (h² + k² + l²) - 2hk cos γ - 2 kl cos α - 2 hl cos β. But since all the cos terms are the same, it's (h² +k² +l²) - 2hk cosθ - 2 kl cosθ - 2 hl cosθ. Which is equal to (h +k + l)^2 - 2cosθ (hk + kl + hl) - 2(hk + kl + hl) cosθ? Wait, no, let me compute.

Wait, (h +k + l)^2 is h² + k² + l² + 2hk
