Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, molecular formula tells me about the possible structure. The NMR data is given, which I should look at carefully. Then, the compound is reacted through a series of reagents, and I need to figure out the final product from the options.

Let me start by analyzing the NMR. The 1H-NMR data is:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

I remember that in NMR, the chemical shifts can give me an idea of the functional groups present. The 9.72 ppm is a triplet, which is quite upfield for an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm and are deshielded. But wait, sometimes if there's an adjacent substituent with electron-withdrawing groups, the shift can be a bit different. But a triplet suggests that the proton is next to two equivalent protons. Hmm, maybe it's part of a conjugated system?

Looking at the 6.98 and 6.51 peaks. Those are in the aromatic region. The 6.98 is a doublet (2H), and 6.51 is also a doublet (2H). That makes me think of para-substituted aromatic rings, perhaps with substituents that cause coupling. Like two substituents across from each other on a benzene ring. So maybe two phenyl groups attached elsewhere?

The 6.27 peak is a broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad singlet could be either an aromatic ring with no coupling, or maybe some protons in an enol form, like in a ketone or aldehyde in an enol tautomer. Or maybe it's a conjugated diene or something else.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. This is around the region for CH₂ groups that are next to oxygen, like OCH₂ or something similar. Wait, but 3.66 is a bit upfield for OCH2, which is more like 3.3-3.7 typically. So maybe it's an OCH2 group adjacent to something else, like another oxygen or perhaps part of an ester or ether.

Now, putting this together. Let's think about the possible structure. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 + 2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be from one ring and four double bonds, but that's unlikely. More probably, one ring and a couple of double bonds. Let's think about possible structures.

The NMR suggests the presence of aromatic rings (the 6.98 and 6.51 regions), so two benzene rings perhaps. Wait, but wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Benzene has 6 carbons. So if there are two benzene rings, that would be 12 carbons, which is way more than 8. So that can't be. So perhaps only one benzene ring, but looking at the NMR, the aromatic signals add up to 4H, which is two protons each in two doublets, which would make sense for two substituents on a benzene ring. Wait, or maybe two different para-substituted rings attached to another structure.

Wait, maybe it's a substituted benzaldehyde with some substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diphenolic structure, but then the O would be in a phenol group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde with substituents. Let me think: the aldehyde proton is at 9.72 as a triplet. That could suggest that it's next to two equivalent protons, maybe on a CH2 group. So maybe the structure is R-CHO, where R is a group with a CH2 adjacent to the aldehyde. 

Looking at the 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H: that could be OCH2something. So perhaps the structure is something like CH2-O-Ph or similar. Alternatively, if it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen and another group.

Wait, let's try to draw a possible structure. Let's say, for example, the structure is an aldehyde group attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to an oxygen, which is then connected to a benzene ring. Maybe like Ph-O-CH2-CHO? Or perhaps (Ph-O-CH2)-CH2-CHO? Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the integration.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm is for 2H, which could be the CH2 next to oxygen. Let's say it's OCH2, perhaps as part of an ether or an ester or something else.

Another approach: looking at the options might help
