Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out what the final product is after a series of reactions. Let's start by breaking it down step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, so C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2 = 9/2=4.5. Wait, that can't be right because it should be an integer. Did I do that right? Oh wait, maybe I should recount: (2*8 +2) = 18. Minus H (9) gives 9. Then plus N (1) because X is 0, so 9+1=10. 10/2=5. Wait, that makes sense. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a ring and a double bond, or multiple rings, etc.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that's probably an aldehyde proton, since aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm and typically a triplet due to coupling with adjacent groups. Wait, but wait, an aldehyde is usually a singlet unless coupled. Oh wait, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Or perhaps it's an enol form or something else. Or maybe it's something else like an aromatic proton with a particular coupling. Hmm, I'm not sure yet.

6.98 (d, 2H) – probably aromatic protons. A doublet suggests coupling with one adjacent proton. So maybe para-substituted aromatic rings? Or maybe ortho substitution.

6.51 (d, 2H) – also aromatic. Another doublet, could be another set of aromatic protons. If I pair this with the 6.98, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, two protons in para positions, each as doublets.

6.27 (bs, 2H)
