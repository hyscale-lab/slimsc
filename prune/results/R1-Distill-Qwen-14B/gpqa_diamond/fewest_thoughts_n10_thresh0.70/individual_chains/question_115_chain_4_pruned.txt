Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured—one is upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Hmm, I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce gamma-ray photons. But since they're moving, the photons' directions and energies depend on the initial momenta of the particles.

Wait, Lorentz factors. The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for the electron, gamma_e is 4, and for the positron, gamma_p is 2.

I think the first thing I need to do is find the total energy and momentum before the collision because energy and momentum should be conserved.

Let me think about each particle's energy and momentum. The rest mass of an electron (and positron, since they're the same mass) is m_e = about 9.11e-31 kg, but I might not need the exact value because I can work with units where c=1 or something.

The total energy of each particle is gamma * m_e * c². For the electron, E_e = gamma_e * m_e c² = 4 * m_e c². Similarly, the positron's energy E_p = gamma_p * m_e c² = 2 * m_e c². So the total energy before collision is E_total = E_e + E_p = 6 m_e c².

As for momentum, the electron is moving to the right (since it's moving from the left along the horizontal axis), so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving to the left (from the right), so its momentum is negative. Wait, no, wait: the positron is moving from the right along the horizontal axis. So if the electron is moving from left to right (positive direction), and the positron is moving from right to left (negative direction), but wait, wait again. No, wait, the problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis but from the right. So if the electron is moving to the right (from left), the positron is also moving to the right? No, wait, the axes are horizontal. Let me get this straight.

Wait, the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so its direction is to the right. The positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right, so its direction is to the left? Or wait, no—moving from the right along the horizontal axis would imply it's moving towards the left. Because if you're on the right and moving along the axis, you're going left.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think: If I'm moving along a horizontal axis from the left, I'm going right. If I'm moving from the right, along the same axis, I'm going left. So the positron is moving to the left.

So the electron has momentum in the positive x-direction, and the positron in the negative x-direction.

The momentum p is given by gamma * m_e * v. Alternatively, since p = gamma m v, and since v = c² * (p/(gamma m)), but perhaps it's easier to use the relativistic momentum formula.

Wait, another approach: The momentum can be expressed as p = gamma * m_e * v. But v can be expressed in terms of gamma. Because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which can be rearranged to v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma²)). Alternatively, since for each particle, the velocity is v = beta * c, where beta = v/c.

Alternatively,
