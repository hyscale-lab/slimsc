Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Let's try to break this down step by step.

First, the question describes a series of reactions starting with a specific compound. Let me parse each step carefully.

The initial compound is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on bicyclic compounds. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene means it's a norbornene derivative, right? So norbornene has a bridge structure. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So, that's an oxygen connected to a tert-butyl group attached to the norbornene structure.

Next, this is combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and when dibromomethyl groups are present, maybe some kind of nucleophilic substitution or elimination is happening.

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two double bonds, but wait, 1,3-diene would have conjugated double bonds. But the structure is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl), so at positions 5 and 6 of the cyclohexene, there are CH2Br2 groups. Each CH2 has two Br atoms attached.

So, when this reacts with sodium iodide, perhaps an SN2 reaction occurs. Each of the dibromomethyl groups would substitute Br with iodide. But wait, sodium iodide in such reactions usually leads to the substitution of bromides. So each CH2Br2 group would replace one Br with iodide, but since there are two Brs on each CH2, maybe two equivalents would substitute both, leading to CH2I2 groups?

Wait, but wait. The starting material has two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So perhaps each molecule of that cyclohexadiene would react twice, each substitution using one equivalent of NaI. So with two equivalents
