Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Hmm, binary star systems, eclipses, radial velocities... I remember that binary stars orbit around a common center of mass. The question is about finding out which system is more massive and by what factor.

The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. Wait, the period is the time between two primary eclipses. Oh right, the orbital period is the same as the eclipse period because they orbit each other, so when one star passes in front of the other from our viewpoint, that's an eclipse. So the period here is the orbital period.

Then, the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes are given for each system. For system_1, the stars have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2's are 15 and 10 km/s. I think radial velocity amplitude relates to the mass of the companion star. Because the more massive star would cause the less massive star to have a higher velocity as it orbits.

Wait, right, in a binary system, the more massive star has a smaller orbit. So the velocity amplitude (which is the maximum speed) is inversely proportional to the mass. So if star A is more massive than star B, star B will have a higher radial velocity amplitude.

But how does this tie into the mass function? Oh right, the mass function relates the radial velocities to the masses and the orbital period. The formula, as I recall, involves the cube of the velocity amplitudes and the orbital period. Let me try to write it down.

The mass function for a binary system is given by:

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But wait, when you have both components observed, like in a spectroscopic binary where you can see both stars' Doppler shifts, you can get more information. In this case, both stars' velocities are known.

Wait, another approach: the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the masses of the two stars. So in system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. So the ratio is 10:5 = 2:1. That would mean the masses are inverse, so M1/M2 = 1/2. So M1 is half of M2 in system_1.

Wait, no, wait. Because velocity amplitude is proportional to (M2 / (M1 + M2)) times the orbital speed. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the mass ratio.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit a common center of mass. The more massive star has a smaller orbit. The velocity of each star (v1 and v2) is inversely proportional to their masses. So v1/v2 = M2/M1.

So for system_1, v1 is 10 km/s, v2 is 5 km/s. So v1/v2 = 2. So M2/M1 = 2. So M2 = 2 M1. So the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = 2. So total mass is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1. So M1 is one third of the total mass. Wait, but how does this relate to the mass function or finding the total mass?

Wait, the problem is to find the mass of each system. The mass is the sum of the two stars. So for system_1, M_total_1 = M1 + M2 = M1 + (2 M1) = 3 M1. Similarly, for system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10. So v1/v2 = 15/10 = 3/2. So M2/M1 = 3/2. So M2 = 1.5 M1. So M_total_2 = M1 + M2 = M1 + 1.5 M1 = 2.5 M1.

Wait, but wait, that's using the same M1 for both systems. Wait, no, each system has their own M1 and M2.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the mass function for each system. The mass function is given by:

f(M) = (v1^3 P) / (2.156e5) )

But wait, the exact formula might vary with units. Alternatively, the mass function can also be written as:

f(M) = ( (K1^3) * P ) / (241 * (1 - e^2)^1.5 )

But since we don't know the eccentricity, perhaps assuming e=0 (circular orbit) would be okay. But wait, in this case, since we have two stars' velocity amplitudes, perhaps we can find the mass ratio and thus the total mass.

Wait, for each system, the mass ratio q = M2 / M1 = v1 / v2.

In system_1: v1=10, v2=5. So q1 = 10 /5 = 2. So M2 is twice M1.

Total mass of system_1: M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 =3 M1.

Similarly, system_2: v1=15, v2=10. So q2 =15/10 = 3/2 = 1.5. So M2 =1.5 M1.

Total mass: M1 + 1.5 M1 = 2.5 M1.

Wait, but in this case, the M1 in system_2 is not the same as M1 in system_1. So I can't directly compare the total masses yet.

Hmm, so what else can I use? The orbital period. The period is related to the masses via Kepler's third law. The formula is:

P^2 = (4 π² G )^{-1} (M1 + M2) a^3,

where a is the separation between the two stars.

Wait, but I don't know the separation a. Alternatively, the formula can be written as:

(M1 + M2) = (4 π² a³) / (G P²)

But without knowing a, perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps using the velocity amplitudes and the period to relate masses. Let me think.

The orbital velocity of each star is v = (2 π a_i ) / P, where a_i is the radius of the orbit of star i. a1 is the orbit of M1, a2 for M2.

But since the center of mass requires M1 a1 = M2 a2. So a2 = (M1/M2) a1.

The sum a1 + a2 is the separation a = a1 + a2 = a1 (1 + M1/M2 )

But the velocities are v1 = 2 π a1 / P, v2= 2 π a2 / P.

But since a2 = (M1/M2) a1, then v2 = (M1/M2) * v1.

So the ratio v2/v1 = M1/M2. Wait, but earlier I thought v1/v2 = M2/M1.

Wait, let me double-check. Since a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a, and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) a.

So v1= (2 π a1 ) / P = (2 π a M2) / [ (M1 + M2) P ]

Similarly, v2 = (2 π a M1) / [ (M1 + M2) P ]

So the ratio v1/v2 = M2 / M1.

So in system_1, v1 is 10, v2 is 5. So v1/v2 = 2 = M2/M1.

So M2 = 2 M1.

Total mass M_total1 = M1 + M2 = 3 M1.

In system_2, v1=15, v2=10. v1/v2=3/2. So M2 = (3/2) M1 for this system.

Wait, but each system has its own M1 and M2. Let me denote system_1's stars as M_A and M_B, and system_2's as M_C and M_D.

So for system_1:

vA=10, vB=5. So vA/vB=2 = M_B / M_A. So M_B = 2 M_A.

Total mass system_1 = M_A + M_B = 3 M_A.

For system_2:

vC=15, vD=10. So vC/vD=3/2 = M_D / M_C. So M_D = (3/2) M_C.

Total mass system_2 = M_C + M_D = M_C + (3/2 M_C) = (5/2) M_C.

Now, how to relate M_A and M_C?

Hmm, perhaps we can use Kepler's third law which relates the period and the total mass.

The formula I know is:

P^2 (M1 + M2) = (4 π² a³ ) / G

But without knowing 'a', the separation, but I can relate the velocities.

Wait, from the velocities, since v = 2 π a_i / P.

We have v1 and v2 for each system.

But wait, for each system, a = a1 + a2.

But since a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a, and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) a.

So a = a1 + a2 = (M2/(M1 + M2) + M1/(M1 + M2)) a = a. So that's consistent.

Alternatively, I can express the velocity in terms of the masses and the period.

From the velocity expressions:

vA = (2 π a_A) / P1
vB = (2 π a_B) / P1

But a_A = (M_B / (M_A + M_B)) a_1_total.

Similarly for a_B.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the mass function. Let me recall that the mass function is:

f(M) = (v1^3 P) / (241.3 )

But wait, units might be in km/s, years, solar masses.

Alternatively, the mass function for a spectroscopic binary is:

f(M) = ( (K1^3 P) ) / (242 )

Where K1 is the semi-amplitude of the velocity curve in km/s, P is the period in years, and f(M) is the mass function in solar masses.

The mass function is given by:

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But if the orbit is edge-on, sin i =1, so f(M) = M2^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But without knowing the inclination, we can't get the actual masses, unless we have another condition.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's possible to determine the mass ratio, but not the absolute masses. Or maybe there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the mass functions can be used, because the inclination would be the same for both stars in a given system. But since the problem compares two systems, it's possible that the actual mass ratios could be determined.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the total mass and the velocity ratio.

Wait, in system_1, the total mass is 3 M_A.

In system_2, it's (5/2) M_C.

But I need to find a relationship between M_A and M_C.

Wait, perhaps using Kepler's third law for each system.

Kepler's third law in terms of period and mass is:

P² (M1 + M2) = (4 π² / G) a³

But a can be expressed via the velocity. Since v = 2 π a_i / P.

Wait, for a binary system, a is the separation. So a = a1 + a2.

We can express a1 = (vA * P ) / (2 π )

Similarly, a2 = (vB * P ) / (2 π )

So a = (vA * P + vB * P ) / (2 π ) )

= ( (vA + vB ) * P ) / (2 π )

So a = (vA + vB ) * P / (2 π )

Then, substitute into Kepler's law:

P² (M1 + M2 ) = (4 π² / G ) (a)^3

= (4 π² / G ) [ ( (vA + vB ) * P / (2 π ) ) ]^3

Simplify:

P² (M1 + M2 ) = (4 π² / G ) * ( (vA + vB )^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3 )

Simplify denominator: 8 π^3

So,

P² (M) = (4 π² * (vA + vB )^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3 G )

Divide both sides by P²:

M = (4 π² (vA + vB )^3 P ) / (8 π^3 G )

Simplify: 4/8 = 1/2; π² / π^3 = 1/π.

So,

M = ( (vA + vB )^3 P ) / ( 2 π G )

Wait, let's plug in the numbers.

But wait, units need to be consistent. Let's make sure everything is in SI units.

But perhaps there's a better way. Let me think about the ratio of the masses between the two systems.

Let me denote M1 as the total mass of system_1 and M2 as the total mass of system_2.

We can write for each system:

M1 = (vA + vB )^3 P1 / (2 π G )

M2 = (vC + vD )^3 P2 / (2 π G )

So the ratio M1/M2 = [ (vA + vB )^3 P1 ] / [ (vC + vD )^3 P2 ]

Because the denominators are the same and 2 π G cancels.

So, let's compute that.

System_1: vA=10, vB=5 → sum=15; P1=2.

System_2: vC=15, vD=10 → sum=25; P2=1.

So,

M1/M2 = (15^3 * 2 ) / (25^3 * 1 )

Calculate 15^3 = 3375, 25^3=15625.

So,

= (3375 * 2 ) / (15625 )

= 6750 / 15625

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 270 / 625.

Wait, 270 divided by 625 is equal to 0.432.

So M1 is approximately 0.432 times M2. Which means M2 is about twice as massive as M1.

Wait, no, wait, the ratio M1/M2 is 0.432. So system_1's mass is about 0.432 times system_2's mass.

But the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2.

Wait, wait, the question says, "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" Hmm, so if system_1 is less massive, the factor would be less than one.

Wait, but according to the calculation, M1 is 0.432 * M2. So system_2 is more massive by a factor of about 1/0.432 ≈ 2.315.

But the question is about how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2. So if system_1 is less massive, then the factor would be 0.432, meaning it's about 0.43 times as massive as system_2.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, B is ~0.6, D is ~0.7.

0.432 is closest to option A (~0.4), but wait, 0.432 is about 0.43, which is closer to 0.4 than to 0.6. So the answer would be approximately 0.4 times as massive, so system_1 is 0.4 times more massive than system_2.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, the formula I derived was M = ( (v1 + v2 )^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

Wait, but I think I might have made an error in the substitution.

Let me rederive the mass formula.

The orbital period is P, which is the same as the orbital period of the system. The orbital separation a is the sum of the two stars' orbits: a = a1 + a2.

But from the velocity amplitudes:

v1 = (2 π a1 ) / P → a1 = v1 P / (2 π )

Similarly, a2 = v2 P / (2 π )

So a = a1 + a2 = (v1 + v2 ) P / (2 π )

Now, using Kepler's third law:

P² = (4 π² a³ ) / ( G (M1 + M2) )

Rearranged,

M1 + M2 = (4 π² a³ ) / ( G P² )

Substitute a:

M = (4 π² ( (v1 + v2) P / (2 π ) )^3 ) / ( G P² )

Simplify the expression:

= (4 π² ( (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3 ) ) ) / ( G P^2 )

= (4 π² * (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3 G P^2 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4/8 = 0.5, π² / π^3 = 1/π.

P^3 / P^2 = P.

So,

M = (0.5 * (v1 + v2)^3 P ) / ( π G )

Wait, that's the same as before. So the ratio remains the same as before.

So M1 = ( (vA + vB )^3 * P1 ) * ( 1 / (2 π G ) )

M2 = ( (vC + vD )^3 * P2 ) * ( 1 / (2 π G ) )

So the ratio M1/M2:

M1/M2 = [ (vA + vB )^3 P1 ] / [ (vC + vD )^3 P2 ]

Which, as computed earlier, is (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 *1 ) = 6750 / 15625 = 0.432.

So system_1's mass is 0.432 times that of system_2.

The question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but the question says "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2." So if system_1 is 0.4 times as massive, it's 0.4 more massive. But wait, that's confusing wording.

Wait, the term "factor more massive" usually implies a multiplier. So if system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2, that means it's 0.4 times the mass, so it's 0.4 times as massive. So the factor is 0.4.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" That could be interpreted as (M1 / M2) = factor. So if M1 is 0.432 M2, then the factor is 0.432, which is ~0.4. So the correct option is A.


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between radial velocity amplitudes, orbital periods, and total system mass. The total mass of a binary system can be expressed as:

\[
M = \frac{(v_1 + v_2)^3 P}{2 \pi G}
\]

where \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars, \(P\) is the orbital period, and \(G\) is the gravitational constant. Since the ratio of the masses depends only on the relative values of \((v_1 + v_2)^3 P\), we calculate the ratio of the total masses of the two systems:

\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{(v_{A} + v_{B})^3 P_1}{(v_{C} + v_{D})^3 P_2}
\]

### Step 1: System_1
- \(v_A = 10 \, \text{km/s}, v_B = 5 \, \text{km/s}\)
- \(v_A + v_B = 15 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Orbital period \(P_1 = 2 \, \text{years}\)

### Step 2: System_2
- \(v_C = 15 \, \text{km/s}, v_D = 10 \, \text{km/s}\)
- \(v_C + v_D = 25 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Orbital period \(P_2 = 1 \, \text{year}\)

### Step 3: Compute the mass ratio
\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{(15)^3 \cdot 2}{(25)^3 \cdot 1}
\]

1. \(15^3 = 3375\), \(25^3 = 15625\)
2. \[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{15625} = \frac{6750}{15625} \approx 0.432
\]

### Step 4: Interpret the result
The total mass of system_1 is approximately \(0.432\) times the total mass of system_2. This means system_1 is about \(0.4\) times as massive as system_2. Among the given options, the closest value is **0.4**.

ANSWER: A
