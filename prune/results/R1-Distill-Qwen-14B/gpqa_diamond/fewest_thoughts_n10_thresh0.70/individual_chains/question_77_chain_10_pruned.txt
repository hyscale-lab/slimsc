Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement and some other reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has two parts. The first part is about a reaction involving BuLi and then some H+. The second part is a Cope rearrangement done with heat. The goal is to find the major products A and B from these reactions and choose the correct option among A, B, C, D.

Let me start with the first reaction. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So, I'll try to draw that structure. Benzene ring with a substituent that's an OCH2 group, and the O is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Breaking that down, the butenyl group is CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bond at position 2? Wait no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2- ?

Wait, but the substituent is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. But with a methyl on the 3rd carbon. So structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-. Wait, but the numbering: 1,2,3,4. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be structure where the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the substituent is on C1. So, it's 1-pentenyl, but wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-CH2- so the substituent is on the first carbon. Hmm, actually, but-2-en-
