Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct major products for two reactions. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to recall what I know.

The first part of the problem is about the Cope rearrangement. Wait, no, actually, looking at the problem, the first reaction is a 1,5-diene undergoing a reaction with BuLi and then H+. Hmm, wait, no, the first reaction is the Cope rearrangement. Wait, no. Let me read the question again.

The question says that the Cope rearrangement is a reaction where a 1,5-diene rearranges, and it can be initiated by heat or light. The first part of the question is about a molecule reacting with BuLi and H+ to give product A. The second part is a complex molecule undergoing a Cope rearrangement upon heating to give product B. Then, we have four options for A and B.

Wait, no, maybe I misread. Let me look again. The question says:

The first part is: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methylbenzene + (1. BuLi, 2. H+) --> A.

The second part is: a complex molecule + heat --> B.

So the first reaction isn't the Cope rearrangement. The second reaction is a Cope rearrangement because the question says that the Cope rearrangement is the reaction in the second part.

Wait, the first reaction is BuLi and H+. BuLi is a strong base, so maybe it's a deprotonation or an alkylation or something else. Let's focus on
