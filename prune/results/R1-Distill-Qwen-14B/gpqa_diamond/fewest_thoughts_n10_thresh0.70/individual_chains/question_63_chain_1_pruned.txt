Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and its energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

So, the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The options are given as A to D.

The given data are: mass of X is 20 amu, Y is 2 amu, bond length R is 2 angstroms, and angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the fundamental state in quantum mechanics often refers to the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. But when they say 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy', I think they're talking about the next higher energy state. But I need to clarify what this transition is about.

In the rotation-vibration model, the molecule's energy comes from both rotational and vibrational states. But for diatomic molecules, especially when considering the quantum models, the energy levels are quantized. The fundamental vibrational state is the lowest vibrational state, v=0. The rotational states depend on the quantum number J, starting at J=0 (the ground state for rotation).

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I'm a bit confused here. Does the 'fundamental state' refer to the vibrational ground state, or the rotational ground state, or a combination? Hmm, the term can sometimes be a bit ambiguous.

But considering the context of the question, which is about absorbing a photon that changes the state, I think it's about a transition that involves both rotation and vibration. But wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the molecule is in the ground state for both rotation and vibration, and the photon causes a transition to the next higher state, but what's the next state? The next in terms of energy might be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But which has lower energy?

Wait, vibrational energy levels are quantized as (n + 1/2)ħω, where n is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational energy levels are (J(J+1)ħ)/(2I
