Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. The general formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) is a sum over l of (something involving the spherical harmonics and the phase shifts δ_l). But wait, the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts except the ones given. So maybe I don't need to consider higher l values beyond what's given.

The phase shifts provided are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. So l goes from 0 to 4 here. Each δ corresponds to a specific orbital angular momentum quantum number l.

The scattering amplitude f is given by a formula that includes the sum over l of (something) * e^{iδ_l} * (some terms involving spherical harmonics). But since the question is about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, I think the direction simplifies things. When the scattering is along the beam direction, which is typically the direction where θ=0°, so the scattering angle is zero. Wait, but in that case, the spherical harmonics Y_{l,m} might depend on θ and φ. Alternatively, maybe the imaginary part of f is
