Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem states: A light beam is propagating through a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? They've given c=1, so I can treat c as 1 for simplicity.

Hmm, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction. I remember that when objects are moving relative to each other, you have to consider the frame of reference. Since the glass is moving, this is likely a scenario where I need to apply either the relativistic velocity addition formula or perhaps think about how the index of refraction affects the speed.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n. But that's in the rest frame of the medium, right? So if the glass is moving, the speed observed in the lab frame might be different due to the movement of the glass itself.

Let me think about the principles involved. Oh, right, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The formula for adding velocities is more complicated. The relativistic velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). But wait, in this case, the light is inside a medium, so its speed relative to the glass is c/n. So from the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, we might have to apply this formula.

Wait, wait. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed c/n towards the observer. But from the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, how does this affect the observed speed?

Alternatively, maybe I should model this as the lab frame seeing the glass moving towards them with speed v. So the glass's frame is moving at speed v relative to the lab. So the speed of the light in the glass's frame is c/n, but we need to find its speed in the lab frame using the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the direction matters. The glass is moving towards the observer, so v is in the direction opposite to the light's propagation? No, wait the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.
