Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the problem is about. Hmm, it's about particle physics and the CERN Bubble Chamber. A decay process occurs where a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is given as τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The options are A to D with different units.

Wait, I remember that the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when we observe it, due to time dilation, the lifetime appears longer. Oh right, because of special relativity. So the observed lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by τ₀, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

But how does that relate to the resolution? Oh, I think the resolution in the bubble chamber has to do with the length over which the decay products can be detected. Because if the particle is moving, the decay products will appear in a small track, but if the lifetime is longer due to speed, the track is longer. So the minimum resolution needed would relate to the length that the particle travels before decaying, so that we can detect it.

Wait, the problem wants at least 30% of the decays to be observed. So we need to find the minimum resolution (I think resolution here refers to the detector's ability to distinguish particles, maybe the spatial resolution
