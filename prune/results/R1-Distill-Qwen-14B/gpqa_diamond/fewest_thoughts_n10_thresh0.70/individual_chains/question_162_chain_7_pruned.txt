Okay, so I've got this metric here, and I'm supposed to find the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The metric is given as ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a line element in a two-dimensional space, maybe? Because it's in terms of dx and dy, so it's a 2D metric. Oh right, because when you have ds² in terms of dx² and dy², that's two-dimensional.

Wait, but what's the significance of this metric? I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of geometries. For example, the usual Euclidean metric is just ds² = dx² + dy², but this one has a factor in front that depends on x and y. So the geometry isn't flat here.

The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). That makes me think of a sphere. Because, in spherical coordinates, the radius squared is x² + y² (assuming z isn't involved here, maybe it's a 2D sphere embedded in 3D? Or is this a different context? Hmm.)

Wait, but pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. But wait, here we have a metric that might be describing a space of constant curvature, but I'm not sure if it's negative or positive. Let me think.

The general form for a metric in 2D with constant curvature is something like ds² = (dr
