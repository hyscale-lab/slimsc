Okay, so I've got this question about general relativity or differential geometry. Hmm, the metric given is ds² equals 32 divided by (4 minus x² minus y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). And the question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Oh wait, pseudosphere is like a hyperbolic space, right?

Wait, first, I'm a bit confused. What's a pseudosphere? I remember that in two dimensions, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But here, maybe they're referring to a hyperbolic plane? Because in higher dimensions, the term pseudosphere might be used differently. Or perhaps it's a 2-dimensional surface with a metric given here.

Wait, looking at the metric: ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So this is a 2-dimensional metric, since it's in terms of dx and dy. So it's a surface in 2D. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Hmm, that reminds me of the metric for the hyperbolic plane, but I need to think about how it's usually represented.

The standard hyperbolic metric in Poincaré coordinates is usually something like dr² + (a²/(1 - r²))² dθ² for 2D, but that's in polar coordinates. Wait, but here it's in Cartesian coordinates. Alternatively, another form of hyperbolic metric in 2D is (dr² + r² dθ²)
