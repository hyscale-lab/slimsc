Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through each reaction carefully.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me draw that structure in my mind. So, cyclohexanone ring with substituents: on carbon 3, a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), and on carbon 5, a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like a vinyl group attached at the middle carbon. So it's (CH2)C=CH2? Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2? Wait, no, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 but the double bond is between 1 and 2, so it's CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, structure of prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C=CH2? No, that's isopropenyl. Wait, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-, but attached at the middle carbon. So the structure would be CH2=C-CH2? No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: propene is CH2=CHCH3. So, prop-1-en-2-yl group would be CH2=CH-CH2- attached via the central carbon. So the group is CH2-C(=CH2)-. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH2â€“ but attached at the second carbon. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2, so the substituent is a vinylic group. Maybe it's better to think of it as (vinylmethyl) or maybe as an isopropenyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2)2C=CH2, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should just proceed, and if I get stuck, come back.

First step: the starting compound is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming
