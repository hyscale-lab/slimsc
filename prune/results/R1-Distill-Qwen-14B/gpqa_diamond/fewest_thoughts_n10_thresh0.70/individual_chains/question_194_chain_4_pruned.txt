Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). I need to find the partition function Z. The options are A to D, so I should probably figure out each possible state's energy and then sum the Boltzmann factors.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), where beta is 1/(kT). But wait, in this case, the energy E is negative J times the sum of the products. Oh wait, but each term is S_i S_j. Since each S is ±1, the product S_i S_j will be +1 if they are the same and -1 if different. So each term can contribute either +1 or -1.

But the energy is E = -J (sum of these terms). So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be between, let me think, for three spins, each product being ±1. So the maximum sum is 3 (all same), and the minimum is -3 (all opposite). Wait wait, no. Let's think: each term can be +1 or -1, so adding three terms gives a total sum ranging from -3 to +3 in steps of 2, depending on the combination.

Wait, but let's think differently. Each pair contributes S_i S_j. So for three spins, there are three pairs. Each pair contributes either +1 or -1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can take the values 3, 1, -1, -3, depending on how the spins are aligned.

Wait, let's enumerate all possible states. Each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 =8 possible states. But maybe some states have the same energy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to group the states based on their energy.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me consider each possible combination of the three spins and compute the sum.

But that's a bit time-consuming, but since there are only 8 states, let's list them all.

Each state is (S1, S2, S3). Let's list all 8 possibilities:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
Sum: (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = 1 +1 +1 =3
E = -J*(3) = -3J

2. (+1, +1, -1)
Sum: (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 =-1
E = -J*(-1) = J

3. (+1, -1, +1)
Sum: (+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)= -1 +1 -1 =-1
E = J

4. (+1, -1, -1)
Sum: (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)= -1 -1 +1 =-1
E = J

5. (-1, +1, +1)
Sum: (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) =-1 -1 +1 =-1
E = J

6. (-1, +1, -1)
Sum: (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) =-1 +1 -1 =-1
E = J

7. (-1, -1, +1)
Sum: (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) =1 -1 -1 =-1
E = J

8. (-1, -1, -1)
Sum: 1 +1 +1 =3
E = -3J

Wait, so looking at all these possibilities, the energies are either -3J or J. Let's count how many states have each energy.

Energy -3J occurs only in states 1 and 8. So two states.

Energy J occurs in the other 6 states (states 2 to 7). So six
