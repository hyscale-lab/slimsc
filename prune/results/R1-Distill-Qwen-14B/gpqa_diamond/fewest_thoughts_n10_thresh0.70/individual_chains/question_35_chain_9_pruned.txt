Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the angular momentum operator. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A. They represent it as a 2x2 matrix Ay. The setup says that Ay equals c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. Oh right, the first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, eigenvalues of a matrix operator... right, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation, which is det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

Let me write down the matrix S first. S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Then, c is h/(4π), so Ay = c * S. So that makes Ay:

[ 0      -i*c ]
[ i*c     0 ]

But wait, let me compute that. c is h/(4π), so each element becomes:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S:

First row: 0 and (-i * h/(4π))
Second row: (i * h/(4π)) and 0.

So the matrix Ay looks like:

[ 0           -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0          ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (Ay - a I). The matrix becomes:

[ -a          -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)     -a        ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ].

Calculating each part: (-a)^2 is a². The other term is [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))^2 ].

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So the second term is [ (1) * (h²/(16 π²)) ].

So the determinant equation is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0. Because the determinant is (-a)(-a) - [(-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π))] = a² - [ (i*(-i)) (h²/(4π)^2) ) ].

Wait, wait, more accurately, the product of the off-diagonal elements is (-i c) * (i c) = (-i)(i) c². Which is (-i²) c² = (-(-1)) c² = c². So the determinant is a² - (c²) = 0.

So a² = c² → a = ±c.

Since c is h/(4π), substituting gives a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, so the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Both are real numbers. So the imaginary
