Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound by an enolate. Let me think through each part step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each with different reactants and conditions. I need to find out the major products for each and match them with the options given.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, under NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). I remember that sodium ethoxide is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile itself because it can form an enolate. So, in the presence of a base like NaOEt, the malonate will deprotonate to form an enolate ion.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would be something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait no, wait. Wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be at the third position. Oh wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the CH2 group? Wait, maybe I need to get the structure right. Let me draw it. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So the substituent is on the CH2 end. So the E configuration means that the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. So in this case, methyl and the (E) means that the p-tolyl group is on the same side as the COOCH3? No, wait, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Let me think again. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So if it's 3
