Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct products of the Michael addition reactions given. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through this step by step.

First, the question describes three different reactions (A, B, C) and gives options for the products. I need to determine which option (A to D) correctly lists the products for each.

Starting with reaction A: It's dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a dienolate; sodium ethoxide is a strong base that deprotonates it to form the enolate. So, the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl system.

In the Michael addition, the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. This should form a new carbon-carbon bond. The structure of the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. Wait, noâ€”wait, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, wait. Let me think: acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; but in this case, it's methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2-CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3, but wait, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, right? So it's CH2=CH-C-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Oh wait, perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait no. The substituents on the acrylate. Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p
