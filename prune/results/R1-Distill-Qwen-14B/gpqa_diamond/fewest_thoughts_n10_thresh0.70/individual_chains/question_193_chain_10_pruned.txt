Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Wait, so the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. I'm trying to remember how parallax relates to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I remember is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. So, I think I need to express N as a function of distance and then find how it changes with r. Let me think about the steps.

First, since N is proportional to 1/plx^5, I can write N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But plx is 1/d, so substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Simplifying that, 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Wait, but wait, that's the number of stars in a region at distance d. But the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range.

Wait, I'm maybe mixing something up. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be the surface density (stars per unit area) multiplied by the surface area of that shell. Oh, right, that's probably the right approach.

So surface density σ is stars per square parsec. If N ∝ 1/plx^5, then N = k/(plx)^5, where k is a proportionality constant. Since plx = 1/d, N = k d^5. So the surface density σ is proportional to d^5.

Then, the number of stars in a thin shell is σ multiplied by the area of the shell. The area of a thin spherical shell is 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell, dN, would be σ * 4πd² dr. Substituting σ as proportional to d^5, we get dN ∝ d^5 * d² dr. That's d^7 dr. Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have r^7.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Oh wait, the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5 → N ∝ d^5. But wait, no, because N is the number of stars in the region. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused between surface density and the total number.

Let me think again. The number of stars per unit area (surface density) is proportional to 1/plx^5. Because when you look in a certain direction, the number you count depends on how far away the stars are. So if a star is at distance d, its parallax is 1/d. So the surface density σ (stars per square parsec) is proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5 → σ ∝ d^5.

But when you consider a thin shell between d and d+dr
