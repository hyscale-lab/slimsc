Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. Let me see what the question is about.

The unknown compound's been analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec. Let's go through each piece of data one by one.

Starting with the FTIR: The broad peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait, a very broad peak could also suggest something else, maybe like an amide or something with hydrogen bonding. But since the other peaks are at 1700 and 1650, that's more in the range of carbonyl groups.

At 1700 cm^-1, that's a strong peak which often signifies a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. Then another peak at 1650. Hmm, that's a bit lower than 1700. Could that be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring? Like an aromatic ketone or maybe an ester with conjugation, or an amide? Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl in a conjugated system, so the absorption is a bit lower.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have a double bond. Maybe it's part of an ester group or something else. Alternatively, it could be part of a ring, like a cyclohexene or something similar.

Now the mass spec: a fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about what that could be. Common fragments at 45 include possibly (CH3)2CHO- which is 59, but wait, 45... Hmm. Wait, 45 is the mass of C3H7O? Or maybe something else. Alternatively, 45 could be (CH2)2O, but that's 44. Or perhaps it's an ethyl group losing something. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group attached to something else. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight for CH3COO- (which is 60? Wait, no, CH3COO is 59 (12*2 + 1*3 +16*2= 24+3+32=59). Hmm. Or maybe it's the tropylium ion, which is C7H7+ but that's 91. Not matching.

Wait, wait, another approach. Let me think about common fragments. The molecular ion would be the molecular weight of the compound. Let's think about the options given:

The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

So for each possible option, the molecular weight would be:

C6H12O2: 6*12 +12*1 +2*16=72+12+32=116
C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98
C6H10O2:72 +10 +32=114
C6H12O:72+12+16=100

So the molecular ion would be around 116, 98, 114, or 100. The mass spectrum shows a peak at 45. So perhaps 45 is a fragment, like a loss of a larger group. Alternatively, it could be a neutral loss, but probably a cleavage.

So what would give a fragment of 45? Let's think about splitting the molecule. Let's think of esters because we have a carbonyl group. Esters have the structure R-O-CO-R'. The cleavage could break between the ester oxygen and the carbonyl, leading to a fragment with the R-O- part and the CO-R' part. 

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something like a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But not sure.

Wait, the FTIR has two carbonyl peaks. Hmm, 1700 and 1650. That's unusual for a single carbonyl group. Wait, maybe it's an ester and a conjugated group. For example, an ester has a carbonyl around 1700, and maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl, but maybe not. Alternatively, it could be an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. Because in that case, the carbonyl might shift a bit. For example, an ester with a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl, leading to the lower absorption at 1650. That makes sense because conjugation lowers the carbonyl stretching frequency.

So if the compound has an ester group (so O and another O from the ester) and a double bond, that would explain the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR.

So the formula is likely to have two oxygen atoms, because an ester would have O from the ester group (O in COO). So looking at the options, the choices with two oxygen atoms are A) C6H12O2 and C) C6H10O2.

Now, the molecular formula: let's consider the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 - H -0)/2.

For option A: C6H12O2. H=12. So DoU = (14 -12)/2 = (2)/2=1. Which could be one ring or one double bond. But wait, considering the NMR shows vinyl H, that's a double bond. So DoU would be at least 1. But O's don't affect DoU. So for A: DoU is 1. But wait, the IR has two carbonyl peaks which suggests two double bonds or rings, but that's getting complicated.

Option C: C6H10O2. H=10. DoU=(14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: could be two double bonds, or one double bond and one ring, or two rings. But in our case, the NMR has vinyl H, so at least one double bond. So perhaps another ring, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe a double bond and an ester group.

Wait, maybe the molecule is a cyclic ester, which would have a ring (DoU 1 for the ring) and a double bond (DoU 1, so total 2). That would fit option C.

So, for the mass spec, if it's an ester, what would fragment at 45? Let's think about a possible structure.

Suppose the compound is something like methyl cyclohexene carbonate, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a cyclic structure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible molecular formulas and their molecular weights. Let's say the molecular ion is broken into a fragment. For example, maybe the molecule is losing a group of 45. So,
