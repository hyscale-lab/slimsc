Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying hydrogens and oxygen counts.

Let me start by breaking down each piece of data given.

First, the FTIR spectrum. They mentioned a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. A broad peak suggests hydrogen bonding, maybe in an alcohol or carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait. If it's a very broad peak, maybe it's a carboxylic acid since they tend to have broad O-H stretches around 3000. Alternatively, an alcohol would have a broad peak too, but maybe a bit lower in wavenumber. Hmm.

Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). Now, the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could be another carbonyl, like maybe an ester, conjugated carbonyl, or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a ketone, or maybe an amide? Wait, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not an amide. So, perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is a ketone or ester, and 1650 is an aromatic ring with C=C stretching? Or maybe it's something else like an acid.

Wait, but if there's a carbonyl at 1700, that suggests maybe an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. Let me think. A carboxylic acid's carbonyl is usually around 1700, but if it's a conjugated carbonyl, maybe the absorption is shifted a bit. Alternatively, if the compound has an ester, the carbonyl is around 1740-1700. Wait, but sometimes stretching can be lower if there's resonance or if it's a cyclic ester. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is for an aromatic ring's C=C, which typically absorb around 1600-1680 cm⁻¹, but it's a strong peak, so maybe it's part of a conjugated system.

But let's hold that thought for a moment. Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond. That suggests maybe an alkene is present, so perhaps the structure includes a double bond.

Now, the mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm. What fragments have a mass of 45? Let me think. The molecular ion could break into smaller fragments. Common fragments include CH3CO+ (which is 43), but that's not 45. Wait, wait. Maybe it's a ketene ion? Or perhaps it's a fragment like (CH3)2CO, but that's 58, I think. Alternatively, maybe a CH2O group? No, that's 30. Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be from a methyl ester group. Wait, 45 could be the molecular weight of a fragment. Let me calculate: 45 corresponds to C3H7O, maybe? Or C3H3O2? Let's see, for formula CxHyOz: 12x + y + 16z =45.
