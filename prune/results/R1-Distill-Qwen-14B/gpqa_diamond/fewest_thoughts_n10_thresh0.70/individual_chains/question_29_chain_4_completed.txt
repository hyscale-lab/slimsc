Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about barley mutants and anti-nutritional compounds. Hmm, let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar but it has this anti-nutritional compound. So, the problem is to remove that compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and looked at the gene sequences.

The intact gene sequence is given, and there are four mutants. We need to figure out which mutation would eliminate the compound. I think this means the mutation should disrupt the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or changing the protein in a way that it doesn't produce the compound anymore.

Looking at the sequences, all mutants have changes in the first exon. Let's look at each mutant's changes.

The intact gene starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So any mutation here could affect the protein.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the wild type, which starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTA... So at position 4, wild type has TTT. Mutant 1 has TCTACGCT. Wait, maybe I should look for where the difference is. Let's line them up.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

Wait, maybe I should look for the exact differences. The first part of the sequence:

Intact: starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Wait, let me compare each position. The intact sequence has 'TTTCTC', and the mutant1 has 'TCTACG' in that area. So, at some point, a change occurs. Hmm, but wait, the first part, position 4: in the intact, it's TTT, and in mutant1 it's TCT. So, the third nucleotide is different. So, the third T in wild type becomes a C in mutant1. Let's see the codons.

The first codon is ATG (start). Next codon in wild type is TTT (which is Phe), then CTC (Leu). In mutant1, after ATG comes TTC (which is still Phe), then TAC (which is Tyr). So, the second codon remains the same, but the third changes from CTC (Leu) to GCT (Ala) perhaps? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for where the mutation is leading to a stop codon or a frameshift. Let me check each mutant.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutations cause a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated, nonfunctional protein.

Let's look at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

So, let's see the changes. The intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me compare each position. So, in the intact gene, after ATG, it's TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

In mutant1, after ATG, it's TTC TAC GCT GCT...

Wait, maybe the exact nucleotide changes are:

At position 4: the intact has T, mutant1 has T. Hmm, perhaps I should write out the sequences aligning them.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for where the changes are in the reading frame. Let's count the nucleotides.

The initial part of the gene is the start codon, then the next codons:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ...

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ...

So, the first codon is the same (ATG). Second codon: wild type is TTT (Phe), mutant1 is TTC (also Phe). So no change. Third codon: wild type is CTC (Leu), mutant1 is TAC (Tyr). So, the third codon changes from Leu to Tyr. So, position 3: CTC becomes TAC. So, the second codon is same, third is changed. So, the mutation in mutant1 is in the third codon, changing from Leu to Tyr. That's a missense mutation, but not a frameshift. So the rest of the protein would be altered, but not a premature stop. Unless the change leads to a stop downstream.

Wait, but let me check if any of the mutants have a frameshift or an in-frame stop codon.

Looking at mutant2:

Mutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, let's compare. The intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So, after the first two codons, in wild type, it's CTC (third codon) and then GCT (fourth codon). In mutant2, the third codon is TAA, which is a stop codon (TAA is stop). Wait, wait no. Let me see: the third codon after ATG is the second codon in the mRNA. Wait, no, let's think about this properly.

Wait, the DNA is 5' to 3', so when transcribed into mRNA, it's the same but T becomes U. So the mutation is in the DNA sequence, so the mRNA would have the same change, except T to U.

So in mutant2, the DNA sequence after ATG is TTC TAA GCT... So, the mRNA would be AUA UAA GCU... So, the first codon after start is AUA (Ile), then UAA which is a stop codon. So, in mutant2, the second codon after the start is a stop. That would result in a very short protein, just two amino acids (start, then Ile, then stop). So, the protein would be truncated. This could disrupt the function of the gene, leading to no compound being made. So, this might be a viable option.

But let me check the other mutants.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to the intact:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Ah, so after ATG, the second codon is TTT (Phe), same as wild type. Third codon in wild type is CTC (Leu), in mutant3 it's TAC (Tyr). Fourth codon in wild type is GCT (Ala), in mutant3 it's GCT (same). Wait, but the next part: in wild type, after that, it's GGT ACT TCT... In mutant3, it's GTGTC ACT TCT... So, at a later position, perhaps a change.

Wait, the mutant3 sequence is: ...TACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Wait, so after some point, the wild type is ...GCTGGTACTTCT... and mutant3 is ...GCTGGTGTCACT...

So in the wild type, the sequence after the fourth codon is GCT GGT ACT TCT. In mutant3, it's GCT GGT GTC ACT. So, in the sixth codon, it changes from ACT (Thr) to GTC (Val). So, that's a missense mutation. No stop codon, so the protein is altered but not truncated. So, this might not eliminate the compound; perhaps it's still functional but with a different structure.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, comparing to the wild type, which is ...GCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4 has ...GCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, the wild type after GCT is GGT ACT TCT GTG... In mutant4, perhaps after GCT it's ACT TCT. So, let's see. The wild type's third codon is CTC (Leu), and then GCT (Ala), then GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), etc.

Wait, in mutant4, the DNA is ...TACGCTACTTCT... So, the mRNA would be ...UA CGC UAC UUC...

Wait, perhaps I should look for where the changes are in terms of codons.

Wild type in the segment: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant4: ...GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, so let's break it into codons:

Wild type: GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu)...

Mutant4: GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA...

Wait, but after GCT in mutant4, the next codon is ACT (Thr). So, the sequence is GCT ACT TCT...

Whereas in wild type after GCT comes GGT.

So in mutant4, the third codon after GCT is ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). So, this is a substitution.

But wait, what's the position of the mutation? Let me think about the reading frame.

Wild type: positions 1-3: ATG, positions 4-6: TTT, 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT, 13-15: GGT, etc.

Mutant4's sequence: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Wait, in mutant4, after the start, it's ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, the first three codons are ATG (start), TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr). Then GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), etc. So, the reading frame is the same as wild type, no frameshift.

So, in this case, the mutation is changing the fourth codon from GCT (Ala) to TAC (Tyr?), no wait, wait. Let me see. The DNA for mutant4 is:

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, the first part is ATG followed by TTTTACGCTACTTCT...

Wait, wait, let me write the sequence:

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, the first three codons are same (ATG, TTT, TAC). Wait, TAC would be the third codon. So, the third codon in wild type is CTC (Leu), but in mutant4, it's TAC (Tyr). So, the third codon changed. But no frameshift.

So, all these mutations don't introduce a frameshift, but possibly a missense. Except for mutant2, which introduces a stop codon early on.

So, looking back, the question is which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That likely requires the gene to be nonfunctional. So, the best way is to disrupt the gene so it doesn't produce the compound.

Mutant2 introduces a stop codon after two amino acids. So, the protein would be very short, likely nonfunctional. That would probably eliminate the compound.

Mutant1: changed third codon from Leu to Tyr. So, a missense, but the rest of the protein is altered. It's possible that the protein is still functional, just different. So, the compound might still be produced.

Mutant3: a change in a later codon, so possibly still functional.

Mutant4: perhaps a change in codon 4 or another position, again a missense, but perhaps the protein is still produced, so the compound might still be made.

So, the best bet is Mutant2, which introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a nonfunctional gene. Therefore, the anti-nutritional compound wouldn't be made.

Looking at the options:

A) Mutant2

B) Mutant3

C) Mutant1

D) Mutant4

So, the correct answer would be option A.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations for their potential to disrupt the gene's function. The goal is to identify a mutation that renders the gene nonfunctional, such as through a premature stop codon or a frameshift that alters the protein structure significantly.

### Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Mutant 1**:  
   - The sequence shows a change in the third codon from **CTC (Leu)** to **TAC (Tyr)**.  
   - This is a **missense mutation**, altering the protein but not introducing a premature stop codon.  
   - The protein is likely still functional, so the anti-nutritional compound may still be produced.  

2. **Mutant 2**:  
   - The sequence introduces a **stop codon (TAA)** in the second codon after the start codon.  
   - This results in a **truncated protein** with only two amino acids (start + Ile + stop).  
   - The gene is rendered nonfunctional, meaning the anti-nutritional compound is unlikely to be produced.  

3. **Mutant 3**:  
   - The sequence shows a change in the sixth codon from **ACT (Thr)** to **GTC (Val)**.  
   - This is another **missense mutation**, altering the protein but not introducing a premature stop codon.  
   - The protein is likely still functional, so the anti-nutritional compound may still be produced.  

4. **Mutant 4**:  
   - The sequence shows a change in the fourth codon from **GCT (Ala)** to **TAC (Tyr)**.  
   - This is a **missense mutation**, altering the protein but not introducing a premature stop codon.  
   - The protein is likely still functional, so the anti-nutritional compound may still be produced.  

### Conclusion:
The most effective mutation for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound is **Mutant 2**, as it introduces a premature stop codon, rendering the gene nonfunctional. This ensures that the compound is no longer synthesized.
