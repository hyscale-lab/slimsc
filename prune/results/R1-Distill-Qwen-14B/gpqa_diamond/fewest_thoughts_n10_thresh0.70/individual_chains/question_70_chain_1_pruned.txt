Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question again and see if I can figure it out.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and from that, we need to identify the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. I'm not too familiar with symmetry groups, but maybe I can work it out.

First, let's parse the reactions described.

Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C. I'm thinking about possible reactions where a solid reacts with a gas in such a ratio. Maybe like a metal reacting with a halogen? Or perhaps something else. The product is bright red, so that's a clue. Maybe C is a compound with a red color.

Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C + 2D → E. Gas D reacting with C... Hmm.

Reaction 3: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. So C + H2O → A + F + G. Since it produces two acids, perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, gives two acids. Or maybe C is a metal sulfide or something else that when reacted with water would form two acids. Wait, another thought: when a nitrate salt is hydrolyzed, maybe it doesn't produce two acids, but I'm not sure.

Reaction 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D + B → H. H is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, etc., but maybe something else.

Let me try to figure out what A, B, C, D, etc., could be.

Starting with reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. Since F is a strong acid and G is weak, perhaps F is HNO3 (nitric acid) which is strong, and G is H2SO3 (sulfurous acid), which is weak. Wait, but other possibilities exist.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate salt. Let's think about that. Suppose A is a metal, like copper. Then B could be something like concentrated sulfuric acid perhaps. But wait, the ratio is 8 equivalents. Hmm, maybe B is a diatomic gas? For example, if B is Cl2. But 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles per mole of A. Not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about reaction 4: D + B → H, a solvent. If H is a solvent, perhaps it's something like H2O or something else. If B is, say, Cl2, then D could be something else. Alternatively, think of B as O2 and D as H2, but that would form H2O. But H2O is a solvent, so maybe that's the case.

Wait, another idea: Maybe B is Cl2 (chlorine gas), D is H2 (hydrogen gas). So, when they react in a
