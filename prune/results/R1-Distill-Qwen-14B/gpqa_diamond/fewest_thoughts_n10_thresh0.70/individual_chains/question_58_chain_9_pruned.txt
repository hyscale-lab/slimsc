Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which physical theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm. Let me think about what regularization means. From what I remember in my physics classes, regularization is a process used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinities that pop up in calculations. These divergences can make the math blow up, so regularization is a way to handle them by introducing some sort of cutoff or other method to make the math manageable again.

I think regularization is often needed when dealing with loop diagrams in perturbation theory. For instance, in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), you have processes where particles emit and absorb virtual photons, leading to loop integrals that can diverge. Without regularization, these would cause problems, but in QED, they can be renormalized. So QED does require regularization, I'm pretty sure. So option C, I can probably rule out because QED does need it.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD has asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, and perturbative methods work. But wait, does QCD require regularization? I think yes, because even though it's asymptotically free, when you calculate loop diagrams, you still get divergences. These need to be handled by renormalization, which often involves regularization. So option B, QCD, probably does require regularization. So B is not the correct answer.

Superstring Theory. Oh right, string theory is a theory of quantum gravity, and it's supposed to be a background-independent theory that doesn't have the same kind of divergences as point particle theories. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this. In string theory, instead of particles, you have strings, and interactions happen as strings exchange. I think that string theory doesn't have the same loop divergences as in QED or QCD because the calculations are different. Or wait, maybe it's that in string theory, the perturbative expansion is organized differently, and perhaps higher-order terms don't have the same kind of problems. Or maybe because it's a theory that includes gravity, the divergences are handled differently. Hmm. Alternatively,
