Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physical theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are situations where calculations give infinite results, which don't make physical sense. So regularization is a way to handle these infinities by introducing a cutoff or something, and then you remove it later, hoping the bad parts cancel out or are rendered harmless.

So, which theories don't need this? Let me consider each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. That's the theory of electricity and magnetism as described by Maxwell's equations. Since it's classical, it doesn't involve quantum mechanics. So would it need regularization? Well, regularization is a quantum field theory concept. In classical theories, you don't deal with divergences the same way because you don't have the same kind of infinities. Wait, but do classical theories ever have issues with infinities? Like in electromagnetism, maybe? For example, the electric field near a point charge is infinite, but that's a different kind of problem—more about the mathematical model breaking down at certain points, not about quantum divergences. So in the context of regularization, which is more about the quantum approach, I think classical theories don't require it. So D might be the answer.

But wait, let's look at the other options. Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), which is a quantum field theory. I remember that QED does require regularization because when you calculate loop diagrams, like the electron self-energy, you get divergent integrals. So you need to regularize them, maybe using a method like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, or Pauli-Villars regularization. Otherwise, the calculations blow up, and you can't get meaningful results. So QED does require regularization, so option C is out.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which deals with the strong force. QCD definitely has issues with divergences because of things like the running coupling constant and the behavior at different energy scales. So yes, QCD would require
