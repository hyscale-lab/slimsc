Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. 

I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The problem states that the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Stochiometric probably means a 1:1 ratio, so each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA^4- molecule. 

The given K value is 5x10^10. Wait, K is the formation constant. The formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2−, and Kf is [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the way the problem is phrased, the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I think that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But I have to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+].

At first, I'm a bit confused. If the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, then the initial concentrations before dissociation would be [CaEDTA] = 0.02
