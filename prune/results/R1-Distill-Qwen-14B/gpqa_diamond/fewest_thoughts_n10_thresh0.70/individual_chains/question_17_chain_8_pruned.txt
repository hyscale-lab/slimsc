Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a certain concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium.

The problem states that the solution has 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in its proper deprotonated form to form the complex effectively. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. I'm a bit fuzzy on how to approach this, but let me think.

Wait, I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with EDTA, the reaction can be written as Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant Kf is given, which is the equilibrium constant for this reaction. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem gives K_Ca-EDTA as 5e10. I think that's the same as the formation constant, Kf. So Kf = 5e10.

The solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. We need to find [Ca²+] in the solution.

But wait, in solution, there might be some dissociation of the CaEDTA complex. So, the complex doesn't stay completely intact; some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. However, the formation constant is very large (1e10), which suggests that the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low.

But how do I calculate this? Let me model the dissociation. Let's say the concentration of CaEDTA is 0.02 M initially. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So, [Ca²+] = x, and [EDTA
