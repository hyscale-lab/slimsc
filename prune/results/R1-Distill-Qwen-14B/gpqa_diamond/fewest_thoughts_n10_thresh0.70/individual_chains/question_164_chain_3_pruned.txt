Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about binary star systems and their masses. Hmm, right, binary stars are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass.

So, the problem says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Wait, the period is the time between two primary eclipses, so that's the orbital period of the binary system, right? So system_1 has a longer period than system_2.

Then, there's spectroscopic data about radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 km/s and 10 km/s. I remember that in binaries, each star orbits the center of mass, and their velocities are related to their masses. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity amplitude, because it's closer to the center of mass. So the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses.

Wait, let me think. The radial velocity method in exoplanets uses the Doppler shift. For a binary system, each star's velocity is measured. The more massive star moves slower. So if one star has a velocity amplitude K1 and the other K2, then the mass ratio q is K2/K1. Because the more massive star has lower velocity. So if q = M2/M1, then because M1*q = M2, the velocities would be K1 = (2π a1 sin i)/P and K2 = (2π a2 sin i)/P. But since a1 + a2 = a (the separation), and a is related to the masses, I think the velocities K1 and K2 are inversely proportional to the masses M1 and M2. So M1/M2 = K2/K1 = q' where q' is the inverse of the mass ratio.

Wait, let me clarify that. Let's say M1 is the mass of the first star, M2 the second. The center of mass is such that M1 * a1 = M2 * a2. So M1/M2 = a2/a1. Since a1 + a2 = a (the separation), if a1 is smaller, M1 is larger
