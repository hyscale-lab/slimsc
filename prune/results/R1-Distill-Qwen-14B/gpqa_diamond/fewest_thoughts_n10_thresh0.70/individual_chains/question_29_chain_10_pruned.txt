Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations. Hmm, let me try to think through it. So, the question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They did EMS mutagenesis, and now they've sequenced the target gene in all mutants.

The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. I remember that anti-nutritional compounds are often proteins, so if the gene is for synthesis, a mutation that disrupts the gene product (like a protein) would be good.

Looking at the options, I need to see which mutations cause changes that would likely inactivate the gene. The intact gene is given, and each mutant shows a change in the first exon area.

Let me go through each mutant:

Intact gene sequence starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Mutant 1: The sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.
Comparing the first part: Intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTG, Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCTG. So, the fourth and fifth nucleotides might have changed. Let me count: Intact has TTTCTC. Mutant 1 is TTCTA C. So, the third T becomes A, and perhaps the C is a different change. Wait, maybe it's a substitution. So, perhaps a point mutation. But I'm not sure what that would do.

Mutant 2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.
In the first part: Intact is TTTCTC, Mutant 2 is TTAAGC. So, maybe a substitution where CTC becomes TAG. So, like a TAG would be a stop codon. Wait, but depends on the frame. Since this is the first exon, maybe it's part of the coding region.

Mutant 3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.
First part: Intact is TTTCTC, Mutant 3 is TTTTAC. So, changes here. Let me see, the intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... So, perhaps the third codon is changing. Intact has TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), etc. In Mutant 3, after ATG, maybe the next T's are different. So, ATG TTT TAC... So, maybe the third codon is TAC, which is Tyr. So, maybe a substitution from Leu to Tyr? Or perhaps a frameshift? Wait, the question says the mutations are in the first exon
