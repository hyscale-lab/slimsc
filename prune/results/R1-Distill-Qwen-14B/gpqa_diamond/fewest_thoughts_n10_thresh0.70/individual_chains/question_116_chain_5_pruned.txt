Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's take it step by step.

The question starts with compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, NMR signals can tell us a lot about the structure. Let me remember what these splitting patterns mean.

A triplet usually comes from a CH2 group next to another CH2, maybe like in an ethyl group. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests that it's probably a CH2CH3 group since each CH3 would give a triplet when next to a CH2. But wait, 6H in a triplet—so maybe two equivalent CH2CH3 groups? Because each CH3 has 3H, so two of them would make 6H. So, two ethyl groups attached to something else.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H—quartet means it's a CH2 next to another CH2. 4H would be two CH2 groups. Wait, so maybe we have a structure where there are two CH2 groups, each adjacent to another CH2. Like a butyl group, maybe a (CH2)2CH2 group? Or perhaps it's part of a ring.

Wait, putting it together. The triplet for 6H and quartet for 4H—could this be a cyclohexane derivative? Let me think. If the molecule is 2,2-dimethylbutane or something, but no, the NMR doesn't fit that. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group connected to something else.

Wait, another approach. The triplet for 6H and quartet for 4H suggests that the molecule has two ethyl groups (each CH2CH3) and a central structure. So maybe the structure is something like (CH2CH3)2CH2CH2... Oh, wait, but that's getting complicated. Or perhaps a cyclopropane ring with substituents? No, I think more likely a cyclopropane isn't right.

Wait, another thought: the triplet for 6H could be two ethyl groups attached to a central CH2. So the structure would be CH2CH2
