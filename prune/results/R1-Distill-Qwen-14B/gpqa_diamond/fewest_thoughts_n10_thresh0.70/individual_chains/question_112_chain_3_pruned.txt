Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the problem is about finding the probabilities of measuring certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. The state given is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, and the operator's matrix has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. So that's a 2x2 matrix, right?

First, I need to normalize the state |alpha> because it's only given as proportional. Let's write down the state. The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2-i) for |down>. The state vector is a column vector in the basis |up>, |down>, so it's [1+i, 2-i]^T.

The normalization condition is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients. So, |1+i|² is (1² +1²)=2, and |2-i|² is (2² +1²)=5. Adding them gives 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7), meaning |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Wait, but the problem says it's proportional to that vector, so the actual state is (1/sqrt(7)) times that vector.

Next, the operator's matrix. Let me construct it. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (since the basis is |up> and |down>), and A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So the matrix would be:
[ [0, ħ/2],
  [ħ/2, 0] ].

Wait, that's a matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2, because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of this operator will be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, because they're proportional. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up>
