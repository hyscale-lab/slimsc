Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about high-energy gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking at what energy the gamma-rays' lifetime in the universe is limited by this annihilation process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. The options are in the GeV range, which is pretty high energy.

I remember that this process is related to the photon-photon interaction and pair production. I think the basic idea is that a high-energy gamma-ray can collide with a low-energy photon from the CMB, and if their combined energy is enough, they produce an electron and a positron.

Wait, the reaction is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. So for this to happen, the center-of-mass energy needs to be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so the center-of-mass energy needs to be at least 1.022 MeV. But wait, the gamma-rays are high energy, and the CMB photon is low energy. So how does that translate to the required gamma energy?

I think the threshold condition is when the product of the energies of the two photons is equal to the square of the electron mass. Or something like that. Oh right! The condition for pair production from two photons is that their combined energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least 2m_e c², which is 1.022 MeV. 

So the formula I remember is εγ * εph ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / 4. Wait, no, maybe it's more precise. Let me think. The invariant s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. For two photons, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. But since photons are massless, E = pc. So for the two photons, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 * (cosθ)^2, where θ is the angle between them. That simplifies to s = (E1 E2)(4 -
