Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a density matrix and where it's located geometrically in the qubit space. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). And there are four options for the position vector r.

Hmm, I remember that a qubit is a two-level quantum system, so any state can be represented as a point in a 2D space, but density matrices are a bit more involved. I think density matrices are 2x2 Hermitian matrices with trace 1 and positive semi-definite.

Wait, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Oh right! I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

But wait, what exactly defines the position on the Bloch sphere? For a pure state |ψ⟩, the Bloch vector r is given by the coefficients in the state's expression. Like, |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|0⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1⟩, and the Bloch vector is (x, y, z) = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ).

But wait, the given ρ is a density matrix. So first, is it a pure state or mixed?

Let me compute: The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Each of |0⟩ and |1⟩ are projectors, so when you add them, you get the identity matrix I, because |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]], so together they sum to [[1,0],[0,1]], which is I. So ρ becomes (1/2) I, meaning it's a completely mixed state.

Oh right, the completely mixed state for a qubit is represented by the density matrix (I/2). So where is that on the Bloch sphere? I remember that the completely mixed state is at the center of the Bloch sphere, which would correspond
