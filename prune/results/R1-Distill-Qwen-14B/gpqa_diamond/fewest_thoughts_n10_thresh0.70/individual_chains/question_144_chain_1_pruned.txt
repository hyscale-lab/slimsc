Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're composed of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, what's a resonance in this context?

The question gives me some specific values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all very small distances on the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. So I'm thinking this has to do with the particle decaying and the distance it travels before doing so.

I think the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime. The longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel. But wait, how do I relate these given values to the decay distance?

I recall that the mean lifetime τ of a particle is related to its decay width Γ by the equation τ = ħ / Γ. Oh right, because Γ is the total decay width, and it's connected to the inverse of the lifetime. But I have to be careful with the units here.

Wait, but what about the production energy and mass? Oh, maybe the energy affects the velocity of the particle, which in turn affects how far it travels before decaying. Because the particle is moving, the mean decay length would be the product of its velocity and lifetime.

So the steps would be something like:
1. Calculate the lifetime τ using Γ.
2. Find the velocity of the particle based on its
