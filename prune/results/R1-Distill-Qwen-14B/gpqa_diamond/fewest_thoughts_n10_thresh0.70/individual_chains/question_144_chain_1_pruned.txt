Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. They're asking for the mean decay distance, and there are four options to choose from.

Wait, mesons are subatomic particles, right? And when they decay, their mean decay distance depends on how long they live. Oh right, the mean lifetime is related to the decay width. The formula I remember is τ = ħ / Γ, where Γ is the width. But wait, since Γ is given in energy units, I think I need to convert it properly.

So first, I should calculate the lifetime τ. But before that, maybe I need to find the velocity of the meson because decay length also depends on how fast it's moving. Or wait, decay length is the speed multiplied by the lifetime. So, L = v * τ.

How do I find the velocity? Well, for a relativistic particle, energy E is related to mass m and momentum p. The energy-momentum relation for a single particle is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So I can solve for p.

But wait, production energy is given as 8 GeV. But the mass is 1.2 GeV. So that's a big difference, implying that the meson is moving at a high speed, probably relativistic.

So let me write down the equation for momentum p. E² = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Rearranging for p: p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / (c^2) ? Wait, no. Let me double-check the units. E is in GeV, m c² is also in GeV (since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², so m c² is GeV). So the equation is E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So p^2 c² = E² - (m c²)^2. So p = sqrt( (E² - (m
