Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

Wait, first, I should probably identify what nucleus X is. Lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that means the isotope is Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So X is Li-6.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96 times the speed of light. I'm trying to remember the formulas for relativistic energy. Oh right, the total energy E of a particle is gamma times mc squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

So E = gamma * m * c². My goal is to find E, but I probably need to find gamma first because I have v given.

Let me plug in the numbers. v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2, which is 0.9216. Then 1 minus that is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly. Oh, right! So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28, which is approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now, I
