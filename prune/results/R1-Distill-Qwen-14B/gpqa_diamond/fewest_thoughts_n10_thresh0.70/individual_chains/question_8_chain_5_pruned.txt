Okay, so I have this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine plants. The goal is to figure out which conclusion about the genes' functions and interactions is correct based on the provided data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the setup: They did an experiment looking for genes involved in resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. They identified three genes, G1, G2, and G3. They made knock-out mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The question tells me that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others.

They tested the resistance levels of these mutants compared to the wild-type, which has 100% resistance. The data shows:

- g1: 75% (so less than wild-type but not super bad)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half as resistant)
- g1g3: 10% (much worse)
- g2g3: 0% (again, no resistance)
- g1g2: 0% (no resistance)

Hmm. I remember that gene interaction can be additive or epistatic. Epistasis is when one gene's effect masks another. So, the phenotype depends on the order of the genes in the pathway. If a gene is upstream, its mutation (knockout) would be epistatic to downstream genes.

Let's think about each mutant:

1. Wild-type: 100%, so the normal state is highly resistant.
2. g1: 75% resistance. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance but not completely. So G1's function is important but perhaps not essential by itself.
3. g2: 0% resistance. So knocking out G2 makes the plants completely susceptible. This suggests that G2 is a critical gene. If G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream, its knockout would disable a pathway, leading to loss of resistance.
4. g3: 50% resistance. So knocking out G3 reduces resistance but not as much as g2. So G3 might be downstream of G2, perhaps. Or maybe part of a parallel pathway. Or maybe G3 has a partial role.
5. Double mutants: Let's look at these.

- g1g3: 10% resistance. Both G1 and G3 knocked out. So this is worse than either single mutant. So when both are gone, the resistance plummets. So perhaps G1 and G3 are redundant or act in parallel pathways. Because their combined knockout is worse than either alone.
- g2g3: 0% resistance. So when G2 and G3 are both knocked out, the resistance is the same as when only G2 is knocked out. Hmm. So in this case, adding G3 knockout doesn't make it worse than just G2. That suggests that G3 might be downstream of G2, or maybe G2 is epistatic to G3. Because if G2's function is upstream and necessary, then without G2, adding G3's knockout doesn't change the outcome because G2's absence is already blocking the pathway.
- g1g2: 0% resistance. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is as bad as G2 alone. So perhaps G1 is downstream of G2. Because if G2 is upstream and you knock both out, the pathway is blocked, same as knocking out G2 alone. Alternatively, maybe G1 is epistatic to G2, but that doesn't seem to fit the single knockout data because g1 has 75% resistance, which is better than g2's 0%.

Wait, but g1 is 75%, which is worse than wild-type but not completely. So G1's function is important but it's not the only gene contributing. Now, for the double mutants, let's try to model the interactions.

If G2 is a transcription factor upstream, let's say it activates downstream genes, maybe including G1 and G3. So without G2, those downstream genes can't be expressed, leading to loss of resistance.

Looking at the g2 mutant: 0% resistance. So any downstream genes aren't expressed. So G1 and G3 might be downstream of G2. Therefore, if you have g2 (no G2), then G1 and G3 can't function because their expression is controlled by G2. But wait, in the data, the g1 mutant has 75% resistance. So their G2 is functional, but G1 is not. So that suggests G1's product may contribute to resistance but isn't absolutely required because G2's function is sufficient when G1 is present.

Wait, but if G2 is a TF upstream, perhaps G1 and G3 are targets of G2. So when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 can't be expressed, leading to 0% resistance. That matches the data for g2, which is 0%. But when only G1 is knocked out (g1), G2 is still functional, so G3 may be expressed, providing some resistance. So in g1, G3 is present and functional, leading to 75% resistance. But wait, in the data, g1 has 75% and g3 has 50%. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait no, if G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, but G3 is expressed when G2 is present, but not G1. Wait, but in g1, G2 is functional. So why is the resistance 75%? If G2's downstream genes include G1, which when present, contributes to resistance. So in g1, you have G2 and G3 active, but not G1. So the resistance is 75% from g1 but 50% in g3. So G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, perhaps additively.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are both activated by G2, but G1 contributes more than G3. So when G1 is knocked out, G3 is still active, giving 50% resistance (but wait, in the data, g3 is 50% and g1 is 75%). Hmm, perhaps I have this backwards.

Wait, let's think about the double mutants. Consider g1g2: 0% resistance. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, it's as bad as g2 alone.
