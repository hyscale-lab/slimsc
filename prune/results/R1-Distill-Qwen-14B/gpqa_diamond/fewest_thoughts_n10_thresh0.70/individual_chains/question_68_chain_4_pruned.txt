Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me read it again. Alright, so the scenario is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu. The magnetic moment is given by mu equals gamma times Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I can figure it out. So, let's break it down. Spin-1/2 particles have spin up or down states, right? Their magnetic moments are quantized along the direction of the magnetic field.

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the particle's spin is aligned with this field. That means the spin state is probably along the z-axis. Now, the magnetic moment mu is gamma times Sz. Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. So, for spin-1/2, Sz can be ± ħ/2. But wait, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, right? So mu would be gamma*(ħ/2) times the spin state.

But then the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along Y. So the field direction changes from Z to Y. Both have the same magnitude, B. I'm trying to visualize this. When the field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes because the magnetic interaction depends on the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field.

The original Hamiltonian when the field is along Z would be H_initial = -mu · B. Since mu is gamma Sz, and B is along Z, H_initial = -gamma B Sz. But wait, I think the actual form is the energy, which is -mu·B, so the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B.

When the field is turned off and then turned on in the Y direction, the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -mu · B', where B' is along Y. So mu is still gamma Sz, but B is now along Y. So H_final would be -gamma B (S · Y direction). Wait, S is the spin vector, which includes Sx, Sy, Sz components.

Wait, let me think. The spin operators Sx, Sy, Sz follow the angular momentum commutation
