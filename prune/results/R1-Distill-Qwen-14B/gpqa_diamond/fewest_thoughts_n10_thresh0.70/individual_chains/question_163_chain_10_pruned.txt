Okay, so I've got a chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says we need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, we have to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to do this. Also, we need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each giving different pH values and volumes.

First, I think I should figure out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. Then, find out how much H+ ions are needed to dissolve it, because when Fe(OH)3 reacts with a strong acid, it should form Fe³+ ions and water. 

So, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, and when it reacts with a strong acid like HCl, for example, it should produce Fe³+ and water. The reaction would be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. Right, because each OH⁻ from Fe(OH)3 would react with H+ from the acid.

But wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so maybe it doesn't fully dissolve in water. But in this problem, we're using a strong acid, so the acid should fully protonate the hydroxide.

So, first, let's find the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron is Fe, which has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, and Hydrogen is 1. So, Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + (3*(16 + 1)) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

We have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. The number of moles is mass divided by molar mass. So 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 moles. Let me calculate that more accurately. 0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 9.358e-4 moles.

Now, each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ ions. So, the moles of H+ required would be 3 * 9.358e-4 ≈ 0.0028074 moles.

The strong acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol/L. Since we're dealing with volume in cm³, which is liters when divided by 1000, the volume (V) needed can be found by moles = Molarity * Volume (in L). So, V = moles / Molarity.

So, V = 0.0028074 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028074 L. Converting to cm³, multiply by 1000. So that's 28.074 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. That seems close, but wait, maybe I made a rounding error.

Wait, let me double-check the molar mass. Fe is 55.845, O is 16.00, H is 1.008. So Fe(OH
