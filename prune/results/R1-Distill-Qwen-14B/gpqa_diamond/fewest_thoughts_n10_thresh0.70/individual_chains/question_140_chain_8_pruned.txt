Okay, so I'm trying to solve this science question. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. The question involves a reaction between Substance X and liquid Y, which releases gas W. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated gives B. B has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms.

First, I need to figure out what these substances are. Let me break it down step by step.

The gas W is described as having a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Wait, that sounds familiar. Which gases have molecules where protons equal neutrons? Let's think. Hydrogen has one proton and one neutron? No, wait. Hydrogen has isotopes, but the common ones are H (1 proton, 0 neutrons) and deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron). Oh wait, but if the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, maybe it's something else. Like, maybe CO2? No, that wouldn't fit. Wait, another thought—what about NH3? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe H2O? No, that doesn't fit either. Alternatively, maybe CH4? No, that's not it. Wait, maybe O2? No. Oh, wait, what about Ozone, O3? No, but O3 has 16 protons each, and each oxygen has 8 neutrons in the common isotope. Wait, let me think again. Oh, perhaps it's a diatomic molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let me consider: Is there any gas where each molecule has atoms where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons?

Wait, another approach. If the molecule is diatomic, say O2, each O has 8 protons. If the number of protons equals the number of neutrons, each O would have 8 neutrons. So the O would be the isotope with mass number 16 (8 protons +8 neutrons). But O normally has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in the common isotope (O-16). So O2 would fit, but O2 has a molecule where each atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the number of protons equals the number of neutrons per molecule—wait, no. Each molecule of O2 has 2 atoms, each with 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So per molecule, total protons would be 16, and total neutrons 16. So 16 each. So yes, the total protons and neutrons are equal. So gas W is O2? But O2 is a diatomic molecule. Alternatively, maybe it's H2O? No, because H2O has 2 H's (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and one O with 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So in H2O, total protons are 2+8=10, neutrons are 0+8=8. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps it's another gas. Let's think of other diatomic gases. Maybe Cl2? Chlorine has 17 protons and 18 neutrons (for the common isotope, Cl-35 and Cl-37). So each Cl atom has 17 protons and 18 neutrons. So in Cl2, each molecule would have 34 protons and 36 neutrons. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, another thought. If the molecule is H2, then each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (assuming H-1). So for H2, two protons and 0 neutrons. That's 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the molecule is something else. Let's think of noble gases. Argon is monoatomic, Ar has 18 protons and 22 neutrons. So Ar molecule would have 18 protons and 22 neutrons. Not equal. Neon has 10 protons and 10 neutrons in Ne-20. So Ne has 10 each. So Ne would fit, but Ne is monoatomic. So the molecule would be Ne, which is monoatomic, so the number of protons (10) equals the number of neutrons (10). So that fits. But wait, the question says "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So if the molecule is Ne, then that's 10 protons and 10 neutrons. So that would work. But Ne is a
