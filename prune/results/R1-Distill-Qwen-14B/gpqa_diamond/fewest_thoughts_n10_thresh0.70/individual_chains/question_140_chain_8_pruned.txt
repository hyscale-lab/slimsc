Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit involved, but I'll take it step by step. So, the question is about a reaction involving substance X, liquid Y, and various products. I need to figure out what X is and then determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

First, let's break down the problem. The reaction between X and Y is violent and releases gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh right, when the number of neutrons equals protons, that's a noble gas, right? Because noble gases have atoms with complete valence shells. So possible candidates for W could be like He (2 protons, 2 neutrons?), wait no, He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons? Wait, no, helium-4 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So W is helium gas? Because He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons in its most common isotope.

Wait, but W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, the molecule—does that mean each molecule? So each molecule of W has an atom where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. So for He, each molecule is just a single atom, so 2 protons and 2 neutrons. That fits. So W is helium.

Next, the reaction produces a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K. Let me think, 277 K is about 3 degrees Celsius. Substances with a melting point around there... Hmm. Maybe it's water? No, water's melting point is 273 K, which is 0 degrees. Oh wait, 277 K is slightly higher, about 4 degrees. Another thought: maybe it's a metal or something else. Alternatively, could it be some kind of salt?

Wait, when heated, G releases B. So G might be a carbonate or something that decomposes upon heating. Let me think: if G is a carbonate, like calcium carbonate, heating would produce CO2 and the metal oxide. But B's melting point is around 277 K, which is a bit higher than room temperature. Alternatively, if B is something like sodium hydroxide? No, that's solid at room temp. Wait, maybe B is a solid with a low melting point.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G is probably a metal hydroxide. If X reacts with Y (maybe an acid) to produce a metal hydroxide. For example, if X is sodium metal, Y is water, but that wouldn't fit the W being He part. Alternatively, perhaps Y is something else.

Wait, but let's think about the other part. The product of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So a keto acid reacting with X gives a product with two O atoms. Keto acid is like a ketone with a carboxylic acid group. So, for example, maybe the keto acid is something like acetone acid, but more likely, it's reacting with X, perhaps in a nucleophilic attack or something.

Wait, what if X is a strong base, like NaOH? Then reacting with a keto acid (like a ketone that's also an acid, maybe a beta-keto acid) would neutralize it, but I'm not sure about the product. Alternatively, if X is something like a Grignard reagent, but Grignard reagents are usually Mg-based, not sure.

Wait, let's circle back. Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope. So, perhaps X is a metal that has a heavy isotope, like chlorine-35 vs. 37, but more likely, maybe something like sulfur having a heavier isotope? Or perhaps X is a diatomic molecule with one heavier isotope. Wait, but if X is a diatomic molecule where one atom has a heavier isotope, but that's not necessarily the key point—maybe it's about the element with a heavy isotope contributing to X's properties.

Wait, the other thing is that when X reacts with Y (liquid), it forms precipitate G and releases He. So, what's a reaction that releases He? Maybe a metal reacting with an acid. But how would that produce He? Hmm, perhaps another approach. If X is sodium, and Y is water, but that would produce H2, not He. Alternatively, if X is something reacting to release helium gas. Wait, maybe X is a metal that when it reacts, produces helium as a byproduct. I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more about the decomposition. For example, if X is a compound that, when reacted with Y, releases He. Wait, perhaps X is a salt that decomposes. Hmm, not sure. Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps Y is a liquid like liquid nitrogen or something else, but that might not fit. Alternatively, Y is a strong acid, like H2SO4, but I'm not making a connection yet.

Wait, another clue: the melting point of B is close to 277 K. Let's calculate 277 K in Celsius: 277 - 273.15 = 3.85°C. So B has a melting point near 4°C. What solid has a melting point around that? Maybe ammonium nitrate? But that's more about solubility. Alternatively, maybe something like ice, but ice melts at 0°C. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: could B be a carbonate salt that's a solid and when heated, decomposes. For example, sodium carbonate? No, sodium carbonate's melting point is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate. Let's think: if G is calcium carbonate, CaCO3, and upon heating, it decomposes into CaO and CO2. But CO2 is a gas, so B would be CaO. What's the melting point of CaO? I think it's about 2880°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G is a hydroxide. Suppose G is Mg(OH)2, which is a precipitate. When heated, it decomposes to MgO and H2O. Water boils at 373 K, so that's way higher than 277 K. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is a substance that's solid at room temperature but melts just above 0
