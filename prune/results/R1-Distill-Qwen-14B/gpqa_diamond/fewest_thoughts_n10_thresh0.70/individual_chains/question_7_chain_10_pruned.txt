Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The reaction given is gamma gamma -> e+ e-. The question is asking from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by this process. And the options are given in the range of GeV.

Right, so I remember that the CMB has a certain average photon energy. The problem states it's around 1e-3 eV. That's super low energy, but the gamma-rays in question are high energy, so maybe in GeV range.

I think this has to do with photon-photon interactions. When a high-energy gamma-ray interacts with a low-energy photon (like a CMB photon), they can annihilate into electron-positron pairs. So the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited because it can't travel too far without interacting with the CMB.

Wait, the concept here is probably about the mean free path of the gamma-ray. If the gamma-ray's energy is high enough, the probability of it interacting with a CMB photon becomes significant, so it can't propagate far without annihilating. So the lifetime is limited by the time it takes for such interactions to occur.

I remember that the cross-section for gamma-gamma annihilation into e+e- has a certain dependence on the energies of the photons involved. The cross-section might be proportional to some function of their energies because higher-energy photons would have a higher chance of interaction.

The formula for the cross-section, sigma, for this process is probably sigma ~ (alpha^2 / s) * something, where alpha is the fine-structure constant, and s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Or maybe it's sigma proportional to 1/(E^2) or something similar. Wait, I think the cross-section for e+ e- production from gamma gamma collisions is given by sigma = (4 * pi * a_e^2) * (m_e^2) / (s), where a_e is the fine-structure constant, and m_e is the electron mass. Because at high energies, the cross-section tends to decrease as 1/s, which is the same as 1/(E^2) when s is dominated by E^2.

Wait, no, s is the square of the center-of-mass energy, so s = (E1 + E2)^2 when they are moving in opposite directions. Since the CMB photon is at low energy, E2 is much smaller than E1 (the gamma-ray), so s ≈ (E1)^2. So sigma ≈ (4 pi alpha^2 m_e^2) / (E1^2). Because E1 is much larger than E2.

So the cross-section sigma is inversely proportional to the square of the gamma-ray energy, E. So sigma ~ 1/E^2.

But wait, the cross-section also depends on the photon density. The CMB photon density n is the number per unit volume. The CMB has a photon density of about one per cubic centimeter, but I might need to think about the exact number. Wait, the CMB photon density is approximately 400 photons
