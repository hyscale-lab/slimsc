Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electric potential energy between a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let's see what I remember from my classes. Alright, the setup is a charge q placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system.

Wait, I think when dealing with potential energy in electrostatics, I should consider the work done in assembling the charges. Or maybe it's about the potential due to each charge and their interaction. Since the sphere is conducting, the charge will induce some charges on its surface.

Oh right, for a grounded conductor, any excess charge on it will reside on the surface. And because the sphere is neutral initially, when you bring a charge q near it, the sphere will have induced charges. But wait, the sphere is grounded so the potential on it must be zero. Or wait, no, the potential on a conductor is the same throughout, but since it's grounded, any excess charge can flow away.

Wait, maybe I should think about image charges. I remember that in the method of images, when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, you can model the induced charges with an image charge inside the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the image charge might be different.

Let me think, the image method for a conducting sphere: when a charge +q is placed outside, the sphere being conductor will have induced charges. The image charge for a conducting sphere is (I think) q' = -q (R/d)^2. Wait, more precisely, for a conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge when a charge q is placed at a distance d from center is q' = (R^2/d) * q. But wait, I might be mixing things up. Wait, for a point charge outside a conducting sphere, the image charge is inside the sphere, right?

Wait, no. Let me recall. The image method says that the induced charges on the sphere can be represented by a charge located at the image point. The image charge q' is such that it's located at a distance d_image from the center, where d_image = R^2 / d. And the magnitude of q' is (R^2/d) * q. But wait, the sign depends on the charge. So if q is positive, then the image charge inside the sphere is negative. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the image charge is such that the potential due to the image charge and the original charge q must match the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere. Hmm, maybe I should look it up, but since I can't, I have to think it through.

Alternatively, since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface must be zero. So the potential due to the charge q and any induced charges must be zero on the sphere's surface.

Wait, but how does that help me find the potential energy?

Potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble the charges. But in this case, the sphere is conducting and grounded, so the charges can move. So when I place charge q at distance d, the induced charges on the sphere would be such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So the induced charges would be such that the system's potential is minimized.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the sphere as a capacitor. Wait, no. Alternatively, because the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. So the potential at the surface is zero. The potential due to charge q and the induced charges must sum to zero on the sphere.

But perhaps I should think about the potential energy as the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to distance d from the sphere. Wait, but the sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero.

Alternatively, the potential energy U is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to the point d away, considering the potential there due to the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential at every point on it is zero. Hmm, but the potential at the point where q is placed would be due to both q and the sphere.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each configuration. So, when we bring the charge q near the sphere, the sphere's induced charges will interact with q, contributing to the potential energy.

Wait, the sphere being grounded complicates things because it's allowed to exchange charges with the earth. So, the system's potential energy would involve the work done in assembling the charges, but since the sphere is grounded, any charges induced on it can flow to earth, so the potential on the sphere is zero.

Wait, maybe I should model the sphere as a conductor with some induced charge, but since it's grounded, the potential on it is zero. So when I bring charge q near it, the sphere will have an induced charge -Q, but since it's grounded, Q can flow away, maintaining the potential at zero. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy of the system is the potential energy between the charge q and the image charge induced on the sphere. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the potential energy can be calculated by considering the work required to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the sphere. But the sphere's potential at point d would be the same as its surface potential, but wait, the sphere is conducting, so inside the conductor, the potential is the same as the surface. So the potential at point d (external point) due to the sphere when it's grounded is zero.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the sphere is a conductor, the potential is the same everywhere on its surface, but when it's grounded, that potential is set to zero. So the potential at the point d is due to charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere's induced charges, when considered, would have a potential at point d. So the potential energy U would be q multiplied by the potential at point d due to the sphere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the potential at point d. The potential there is due to the induced charges on the sphere. But the sphere is grounded, so the sum of the potentials due to all charges must be zero on its surface.

Alternatively, maybe the induced charge on the sphere can be found by considering the potential at the surface of the sphere due to the charge q. Since the sphere is grounded, the potential must be zero. So the potential due to q at the surface of the sphere is V = kq / (d - R), assuming d is the distance from the charge to the center. Wait, no, because the charge is placed at a distance d from the center, so the distance from the charge to the surface would be (d - R), but if d < R, that would be negative, which doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, because if d is the distance from the center, then the distance from the charge to the surface is (d - R) only if d >= R. But in the problem statement, it's just placed at distance d from the center; perhaps it's outside the sphere, so d > R.

Wait, maybe let's clarify: the charge is placed at a distance d from the center of the sphere, so if the sphere has radius R, the distance from the charge to the sphere's surface is d - R, assuming d > R. So the potential at the sphere's surface due to charge q is kq/(d - R). But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. Therefore, the potential due to the induced charges must cancel this.

So, the sphere must have an induced charge -q_ind such that the potential on the surface is zero. So the potential at the surface is V_surface = V_q + V_induced = 0.

Wait, no, the sphere is a conductor, so the induced charges are on the surface. So the potential at the surface due to all charges must be zero, because the conductor's surface is an equipotential.

So, the potential at the surface due to charge q is V_q = kq/(d - R) (since the distance from q to surface is d - R when d > R), and the potential due to the induced charge on the sphere is V_induced = k Q / R, because the induced charge Q distributes on the surface, so the potential at the surface due to Q is k Q / R. Since the total potential at the surface must be zero, V_q + V_induced = 0.

So:

k q/(d - R) + k Q / R = 0 → Q = - ( q R )/(d - R )

Wait, wait, no. Let me write that again.

If the sphere's potential is zero, then the sum of potentials at the surface due to q and the induced charge Q must be zero.

So:

k q/(d - R) + (k Q)/R = 0

Solving for Q:

k Q / R = -k q/(d - R) → Q = - q R / (d - R )

Hmm, but wait, the radius is R, and the distance from q to the center is d. So the distance from q to the surface (if d > R) is d - R.

Wait, but what if d < R? Then the charge is inside the sphere, but since the sphere is a conductor, induced charges would be on the inner surface and the outer surface. But the problem probably assumes d > R because the sphere is grounded and the charge is placed outside.

Wait, the problem statement says "distance d away from the center", but it's not specific. Hmm. Well, in any case, let's proceed with the assumption that d > R so that the charge is outside the sphere.

So, the induced charge Q is Q = - q R/(d - R )

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me check the calculation again.

Potential at the sphere's surface due to charge q is V_q = k q / (d - R )

Potential due to induced charge Q is V_Q = k Q / R (since Q is on the sphere, the potential at the surface is k Q / R )

Sum to zero:

kq/(d - R) + k Q / R =0 → Q= - (q R)/(d - R )

So that's correct.

Now, the potential energy of the system would be the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the sphere.

Wait, but what's the potential at the point where q is placed? It's the potential due to the sphere's induced charge.

Because the sphere is grounded, the potential at the surface is zero. But the point where q is placed is outside the sphere, so the potential there would be due to the induced charge Q.

Wait, no. The potential at the position of q is the sum of the potentials due to all charges present. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. But the potential that q contributes at its own position is irrelevant because we're considering the system's potential energy.

Alternatively, the potential energy U is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential from all other charges (including the induced ones on the sphere).

But wait, the sphere is neutral overall. Because it's grounded, any induced charge can flow away, but in this case, the sphere must have induced charges to maintain zero potential on its surface.

Wait, no, wait. The sphere starts as neutral, then when q is brought near, the sphere gets induced charges. But because it's grounded, the induced positive and negative charges can leave or enter the earth, so the sphere's net charge remains zero. Wait, but in our earlier calculation, the induced charge Q is negative, so that suggests that the sphere would lose that negative charge to the earth. Or wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, in our earlier equation, we have:

k q/(d - R) + k Q/R = 0 → Q = - q R/(d - R )

So when d > R, the denominator is positive. So if q is positive, then Q is negative. So the sphere would have a negative induced charge Q, which would flow into the earth (since it's grounded), leaving the sphere with zero net charge. Wait, but that can't be right because the sphere would have to have an image charge to maintain the potential.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's think again.

When a positive charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's inner surface will have an induced negative charge, and the outer surface will have an induced positive charge. But because the sphere is grounded, the outer induced charge can flow away, leaving the sphere with a net negative charge. Wait, no, because the sphere was initially neutral. So when you bring a positive charge q near, the sphere's inner surface gets a negative induced charge, and the outer surface a positive. But since the sphere is grounded, the positive charge on the outer surface can leave the sphere (enter the earth), leaving the sphere with a net negative charge.

Wait, but that would mean the sphere now has a net charge, which contradicts the fact that it was neutral and grounded. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts here. When the sphere is grounded, any induced charges can flow into the earth, so the net charge on the sphere can change. Wait, no, the sphere was initially neutral. When you bring q near, the sphere's inner surface gets induced charge -q, and the outer surface gets +q. But since the sphere is grounded, the +q on the outer surface can flow into the earth, leaving the sphere with a net -q. But that would mean the sphere has a net charge, which is possible because it's grounded. So the sphere can have a net charge after being grounded.

Wait, but no, because when the sphere is grounded, the potential on the sphere is the same as the earth's potential, which is zero. So the potential due to any charges on the sphere must be such that the total potential at the surface is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere's net charge after grounding is zero, but it's just the distribution of induced charges that changes.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach.

The potential energy of the system can be calculated as the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position d away from the center of the sphere, considering the potential at that point due to the sphere's induced charges.

Wait, but the sphere being grounded affects the potential. Alternatively, the potential energy is the work done to assemble the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

But perhaps a better way is to calculate the potential energy as the sum of the self-energy of the induced charges and the interaction energy between q and the induced charges.

Wait, the system consists of the charge q and the conducting sphere with induced charges. The potential energy U is the work done to bring q near the sphere, considering the induced charges.

Wait, the induced charges on the sphere are due to the presence of q. So the work done in bringing q is equal to the charge q multiplied by the potential at its position due to the sphere's induced charges.

But because the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential at the point where q is placed (distance d from center) is due to the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but how do I find the potential at distance d due to the induced charges?

Since the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges reside on the surface. The potential at a point outside a sphere due to a charge Q on it is the same as if all the charge were at the center. So the potential at distance d due to the induced charge Q is V = k Q / d.

So, the potential at q's position (distance d from center) is V = k Q / d.

The potential energy U is q * V = q * (k Q / d).

But from earlier, we found that Q = - q R/(d - R)

So plugging that in:

U = q * (k (- q R)/(d (d - R)) )

Simplify:

U = - (k q^2 R ) / [ d (d - R) ) ]

Hmm, but looking at the answer options, I don't see this expression. Let me see the options again.

Option A: U = -(1/2) k q^2 d/(d² + R² )

Option B: U =-k q² d/(d² - R² )

Option C: U= -(1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R² )

Option D: U= - (1/2) k q^2 R/(d² - R² )

Hmm, none of these match my current expression. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in finding Q.

Wait, earlier I had Q = - q R/(d - R )

But perhaps I should re-calculate the potential at the sphere's surface.

Wait, the sphere is grounded, so the potential at the surface is zero. The potential due to charge q is V_q = k q / (d - R )

The potential due to the induced charge Q on the sphere is V_Q = k Q / R

So:

V_q + V_Q = 0 → k Q / R = -k q/(d - R )

So Q = - q R/(d - R )

Wait, that seems correct. So then, the potential at point d (where q is placed) due to the induced charge Q is V = k Q / d = k (-q R)/(d (d - R) )

So potential energy U = q * V = q * [ -k q R / (d (d - R) ) ] → U = - (k q² R ) / [ d (d - R) ) ]

Hmm, but none of the options match this. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the sphere's induced charge is such that the potential at the point d is due to both the sphere and the charge q.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the method of images. For a conducting sphere, the image charge method is used to find the potential due to external charges.

In the method of images, when a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere of radius R, the sphere can be considered as having an image charge q' located inside the sphere, such that the image charge is at a distance R²/d from the center, on the same line as q and the center.

The image charge q' is negative if q is positive, and the magnitude is (R²/d) q.

Wait, so the image charge is q' = - (R² / d ) q.

Wait, no, actually, I think the image charge is located at a distance R²/d from the center, so if the original charge is at distance d, then the image is at R²/d from the other side. So the image charge q' is located at a distance (d' = R²/d ) from the center, in the opposite direction of q.

So the image charge is q' = - ( R² / d ) q.

Wait, perhaps the image charge is q' = (R²/(d)) q, but with opposite sign.

Wait, yes, because in the method of images, the image charge for a sphere is inside the sphere, and its magnitude is (R^2 / d) multiplied by the charge q. But the sign depends on the charge.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I think the image charge q' is given by q' = - ( R² / d ) q.

Wait, so the potential at the point where the charge q is placed is due to the image charge q'.

But wait, the presence of the image charge q' would account for the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

So, the potential at q's position is V = k q' / d', where d' is the distance between q and the image charge q'.

Wait, no, because the image charge is at a distance R²/d from the center. So the distance between q and q' is d - R²/d.

Wait, more accurately, the image charge is at a distance d' = ( R² ) / d from the center, in the opposite direction. So the distance between q and q' would be d - d' = d - ( R²/d )

So then, the potential at q's position due to q' is:

V = k q' / (d - d') = k q' / [ d - (R²/d) ) ].

But q' = - ( R² / d ) q.

So plugging in:

V = k [ - ( R²/d ) q ] / [ (d² - R²)/d ) ]

Simplify denominator: (d² - R²)/d = (d - R)(d + R)/d.

So:

V = (k (- R² q / d )) * [ d / (d² - R²) ) ] 

The d's cancel:

V = ( - k R² q ) / (d² - R² )

So the potential at q is V = - k R² q / (d² - R² )

Thus, the potential energy U is q * V = q * [ - k R² q / (d² - R² ) ]

So U = - k q² R² / (d² - R² )

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is U = -(1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R² )

Hmm, so my current calculation gives U = -k q² R²/(d² - R² ), but option C has a 1/2 factor.

So where did I go wrong?

Ah, wait a second. The method of images gives the potential due to the image charge, but in reality, the potential energy also includes the energy stored in the induced charges on the sphere. Because the image charge method accounts for the potential energy between the external charge and the image charge, but the image charge itself represents the effect of the induced charges. So perhaps the potential energy of the system is not just the energy due to q and q', but also includes the self-energy of the induced charges.

Wait, but the induced charges on the sphere are part of the system. So the total potential energy should include the energy in the induced charges and the energy between q and the induced charges.

Hmm, but in the method of images, the potential energy between q and the sphere's induced charges is equal to the potential energy between q and the image charge q'. So the potential energy U is the work done to bring q from infinity, which is the same as the work done to bring q and q' into their positions. But since the image charge is inside the sphere, and the sphere is grounded, perhaps the potential energy is half of the value calculated.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere is equal to the energy stored in the system, which can be found by using the image charge method. But the method of images may give the potential energy as the sum of the energies between q and q', but we have to account for the fact that the image charge is an internal effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is U = (1/2) q V, where V is the potential at the point where q is placed due to the sphere.

Wait, why would it be half? Because when calculating the potential energy between two charges, the energy is symmetric, so each contributes half. But in this case, maybe the image charge approach is double-counting.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the potential energy as the sum of the work done to bring charge q and the induced charges into place. The induced charges are due to q, so perhaps their energy is already accounted for in the image charge method.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

In the method of images, the potential energy of the system (external charge and induced charges) is equal to the potential energy of the external charge and the image charge. So U = k q q' / (d - d') )

Wait, earlier I found that the image charge q' is at a distance R²/d from the center, so the distance between q and q' is d - R²/d.

So U = k q q' / (d - R²/d )

But q' = - (R²/d) q.

So plugging in:

U = k q (- R²/d q ) / [ (d² - R² ) / d ) ]

Simplify denominator: (d² - R²)/d = (d - R)(d + R)/d.

So,

U = [ - k R² q² / d ] * [ d / (d² - R² ) ) ]

Simplify:

U = - k R² q² / (d² - R² )

So the potential energy is U = -k q² R² / (d² - R² )

But looking at the options, option C is:

C) U= -(1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R^2 )

Why is there a 1/2 factor here? Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps because the method of images counts the energy twice. Because the energy between two charges is k q1 q2 / r, but in reality, the induced charges on the sphere are not actual charges but an image, so maybe I should take only half of that energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the energy between q and the image charge, but since the image charge is a representation, the actual energy is half that.

So U = (1/2) * (-k R² q² ) / (d² - R² )

Which would make it:

U = - (1/2) k q² R² / (d² - R² )

Which matches option C.

Why would it be half? Because when calculating the potential energy between two charges, the energy is considered once, not twice. So perhaps in the image method, the potential energy is counted twice, so we divide by two.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: the potential energy stored in the electric field due to the induced charges is the same as the potential energy between the charge and the image charge, but since the image charge is inside the sphere and cannot exist without the sphere, perhaps the energy is half.

Wait, I'm a bit confused, but looking at the options, option C has the 1/2 factor, and my calculation without the 1/2 gives something not in the options. So perhaps the correct approach is to include the 1/2 factor, making option C the correct answer.

But wait another thought: in the image method, the potential energy U is calculated as the work done to bring the charge q and the image charge q' into their positions. But since the image charge is not a real charge, only represents the effect of the induced charges, perhaps the real potential energy is U = (1/2) k q q' / r, where r is the distance between q and q'.

Wait, no, perhaps the potential energy is simply the energy due to the external charge and the induced charges. The image charge is a mathematical construct, so perhaps the energy is U = (1/2) k q q' / r.

But in our case, the image charge is q' = - (R²/d) q, and r = d - R²/d.

So,

U = (1/2) * [ k q (-R² q/d ) ] / (d - R²/d )

= (1/2) * [ -k R² q² / d ] / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

The d's cancel:

= (1/2) [ -k R² q² ] / (d² - R² )

So U = - (1/2) k R² q² / (d² - R² )

Which matches option C.

So the correct answer must be option C.


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we consider the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the induced charges on the grounded conducting sphere. The sphere is grounded, meaning its potential at the surface is zero. When the charge \( q \) is placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of the sphere, it induces charges on the sphere's surface. These induced charges can be represented using the method of images as a single image charge \( q' \) located inside the sphere.

### Key Steps:
1. **Image Charge Calculation**:  
   Using the method of images, the image charge \( q' \) inside the sphere is given by:
   \[
   q' = -\frac{R^2}{d} q
   \]
   The image charge is located at a distance \( R^2/d \) from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the charge \( q \) and the center of the sphere.

2. **Potential Energy Formula**:  
   The potential energy \( U \) of the system is the work done to bring the charge \( q \) from infinity to its position, considering the interaction between \( q \) and the induced charges (represented by \( q' \)). The potential energy is:
   \[
   U = \frac{k q q'}{r}
   \]
   where \( r \) is the distance between \( q \) and \( q' \). Since \( q' \) is located at \( R^2/d \) from the center, the distance between \( q \) and \( q' \) is:
   \[
   r = d - \frac{R^2}{d} = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}
   \]

3. **Substitute \( q' \) and \( r \)**:  
   Substituting \( q' = -\frac{R^2}{d} q \) and \( r = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \) into the potential energy formula:
   \[
   U = \frac{k q \left(-\frac{R^2}{d} q\right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   U = -\frac{k R^2 q^2}{d^2 - R^2}
   \]

4. **Account for Symmetry**:  
   The method of images sometimes double-counts the energy because it represents the interaction between the charge and the induced charges. To correct this, we divide by 2:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k R^2 q^2}{d^2 - R^2}
   \]

### Final Expression:
The net potential energy of the system is:
\[
U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R^2}{d^2 - R^2}
\]

### Matching with Options:
From the given options, this matches **Option C**:
\[
U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R^2}{d^2 - R^2}
\]

ANSWER: C
