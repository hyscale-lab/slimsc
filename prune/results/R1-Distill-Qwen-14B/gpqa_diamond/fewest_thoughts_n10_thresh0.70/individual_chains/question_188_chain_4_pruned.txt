Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Let's see, what do I remember about rhombohedral structures?

Rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal too. Oh right, they're a type of cubic system but with angles that aren't 90 degrees. The interatomic distance here is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. Wait, but wait, in a rhombohedral structure, are the lattice parameters a, b, c all the same? I think so. So a = b = c = 10 Angstroms.

The interplanar distance for a crystal plane is usually found using the formula derived from the Bragg's Law considerations. The formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) multiplied by some trigonometric factors because the angles aren't 90 degrees. Oh, right, in a general case, the formula includes the cosines of the angles between the lattice vectors.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma between the sides is:

1/(d_{hkl})² = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (
