Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to work through each reaction and see what the final product looks like. The question is about the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4. Hmm, I remember that NMR signals depend on the environment of the hydrogen atoms, so each unique environment gives a different signal.

Starting with the first reaction: acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Oh right, that sounds like a bromination reaction. Wait, acetic acid has a -COOH group. When you brominate it, typically you get an acyl bromide. But wait, the presence of pyridine makes me think it's an acetylation reaction. Or maybe it's a substitution. Wait, no, wait. Bromine (Br2) with a base like pyridine would abstract a proton, generating a good leaving group. Oh wait, acetic acid is treated with these reagents—I think that's a bromination of the alpha position. Because acetic acid has the structure CH3COOH. When you add Br2 in presence of pyridine, it's usually for alpha-bromination. So the alpha carbons (the CH3 next to the COOH) would get a bromine. But wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution on the carbonyl. No, bromine in such conditions is more likely to add to the carbonyl, but that's in the presence of something like H2O or another nucleophile. Wait, wait, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts type situation, but acetic acid isn't an aromatic compound. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the reactions.

Wait, another angle: treatment of acetic acid with Br2 and pyridine. Oh wait, I think this is a bromination of the alpha carbon. So, the reaction would substitute one of the hydrogens on the methyl group (CH3) adjacent to the carbonyl with a bromine. So the product would be bromoacetic acid, specifically 2-bromoacetic acid. So the structure would be CH2BrCOOH. Wait, but wait, acetic acid is CH3COOH. If the alpha position is brominated, then it becomes CH2BrCOOH. So product 1 is 2-bromoacetic acid.

Next step: product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2. Hmm. So, heating an acid (bromoacetic acid) with ethanol and H2SO4 suggests an esterification reaction. Or maybe a substitution where the bromide leaves. Wait, 2-bromoacetic acid would have a Br on the CH2. In acidic conditions, perhaps the Br leaves as Br- and ethanol acts as a nucleophile. So that would be a nucleophilic substitution. So the product would be the ester: ethyl bromoacetate? Wait, no, wait. The structure is CH2BrCOOH. Reacting with ethanol in acid would lead to the formation of the ester. So the Br would be replaced by OEt (ethoxide). So product 2 would be ethyl 2-bromoacetate. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in an acid-catalyzed substitution, the Br would be replaced by an -OEt group. So the structure becomes CH2OEtCOOH. Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Because the COOH is a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester formed between the acid and ethanol. Because when you have a carboxylic acid and an alcohol with acid, you typically get an ester. So in that case, the reaction would be CH2BrCOOH + ethanol → CH2BrCOOEt. So product 2 is ethyl 2-bromoacetate.

Wait, but wait, wait. Another possibility: the Br is in the alpha position, and under acidic conditions, maybe it's a substitution where Br is replaced by an ethoxy group. So product 2 would be ethyl 2-ethoxy acetate? No, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination. But more likely substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's an esterification of the carboxylic acid group, but the Br is still present. Oh wait, the esterification of the carboxylic acid would replace the -OH of the COOH with an OEt group, but the Br is on the adjacent CH2. So the structure would be CH2BrCOOEt. So product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate.

Moving on, product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN), forming product 3. So, what's the reaction here? Sodium cyanide is a nucleophile. So looking at product 2: CH2BrCOOEt. The Br is on the CH2, and the ester is OEt. In a substitution reaction, CN- would attack where? The Br is a good leaving group. So the Br on CH2 would be replaced by CN. So product 3 would be CH2CNCOOEt. Wait, but wait, the structure would be CH2CN-COOEt? Or maybe the substitution is on the CH2Br group, giving CH2CNCOOEt. So yes, product 3 is 2-cyanoethyl acetate? Wait, no, wait. Structure-wise, it's CH2CN attached to the carbonyl group. So the structure is CH2CN-CO-OEt. So product 3 is ethyl (2-cyano)acetate.

Next step: product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming product 4. NaH is a strong base, often used to deprotonate compounds, especially where acidic protons are present. 1,5-dibromopentane is a dihalide, probably acting as a source of H- or perhaps undergoing elimination or substitution. Wait, NaH is a strong base, so it would deprotonate the cyano group? Wait, but the cyano group (CN) is electron-withdrawing, so the alpha protons (if any) would be acidic. Let me see: product 3 is CH2CNCOOEt. So the structure is: 

O
||
OEt-C-O-C-CH2-CN

Wait, no. Wait, product 3 is ethyl 2-cyanoacetate. Structure: O

        OEt
        |
O=C-O-C-CH2-CN ?

Hmm, wait, no. Wait, product 2 is ethyl 2-bromoacetate, which is CH2BrCOOEt. So product 3 is CH2CNCOOEt. So the structure is:

O
||
OEt-O-C-CH2-CN

Wait, no. Wait, the correct structure for ethyl 2-cyanoacetate would be CH2CNCOOEt. So, the structure is CH2CN attached to a carbonyl group, which is attached to an OEt group. So, the molecule is CH2CN-C(=O)-O-Et.

Now, when product 3 is treated with NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane. NaH is a strong base, so it would deprotonate something. Where are the acidic protons in CH2CNCOOEt? The alpha protons adjacent to the cyano and carbonyl groups. The cyano group is an electron-withdrawing group, so the alpha protons (on the CH2CN) would be more acidic. So NaH would deprotonate the CH2CN group, generating an enolate.

So, CH2CNCOOEt would lose a proton from the CH2, forming a carbanion. Then, 1,5-dibromopentane is present. 1,5-dibromopentane is BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. When it reacts with a strong base like NaH, perhaps it forms a Grignard-like reagent, but with NaH as a base, perhaps it's a conjugate addition or some kind of alkylation.

Wait, another possibility: the enolate (from the deprotonation of CH2CNCOOEt) would attack the 1,5-dibromopentane. But 1,5-dibromopentane has two Br atoms on either end. Alternatively, perhaps the enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the Br-substituted carbons.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: the NaH would deprotonate the CH2CNCOOEt to form an enolate. Then, 1,5-dibromopentane would provide a carbon chain. Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane has two Br atoms on the ends. So perhaps it's acting as a dihalide, and the enolate would attack one of the ends.

Wait, but wait, in the presence of a strong base like NaH, 1,5-dibromopentane might undergo elimination to form an alkyne? No, that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but more likely, it's about alkylation.

Wait, but in the presence of the enolate, perhaps an alkylation occurs. The enolate (which is a strong base) would abstract a proton from 1,5-dibromopentane? Or maybe the enolate attacks the dibromide.

Wait, another thought: when NaH is present, it could deprotonate the CH2CNCOOEt to form the enolate (CH2⁻CNCOOEt). Then, the enolate would attack the 1,5-dibromopentane. But 1,5-dibromopentane has two bromine atoms on the two ends. So the enolate could attack one of the ends, leading to a substitution reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double alkylation.

Wait, perhaps each enolate can attack both ends. Let me think. The enolate would attack the Br-C bond, substituting the Br with the enolate's carbon. But since there are two Br atoms, maybe two alkyl groups are added.

Wait, let me structure this. The enolate is at the CH2CN group. So, when it attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, perhaps adding a five-carbon chain between the two ends. Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane is Br(CH2)5Br. So if one Br is replaced by the enolate, the product would have a chain attached. But wait, let's think step by step.

The enolate is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the Br in 1,5-dibromopentane. So the enolate (CH2⁻CNCOOEt) attacks one end of the pentane dihalide. So the Br on the first carbon is replaced by the enolate's carbon. But wait, the enolate is a carbanion attacking the electrophilic carbon adjacent to Br. So substitution occurs, leading to the enolate's carbon attaching to the first carbon of the pentane.

So after substitution, the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-O-CO-C-CH2CN? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the enolate's carbon (the one that was deprotonated) would attach to the end of the pentane, which was previously attached to Br.

Wait, perhaps the enolate attacks the first carbon (Br attached) of 1,5-dibromopentane, leading to a new bond between the enolate's carbon and that carbon. So the product after substitution would be CH2(CN)COOEt connected to a CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 group. Wait, but wait, the pentane is Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br. So when the enolate attacks one end, it would become:

CH2(CN)COOEt-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br.

But that leaves another Br on the other end. Alternatively, perhaps both ends are attacked by the enolate, leading to a longer chain.

Wait, but wait, maybe each enolate can substitute both Br atoms. So the enolate attacks one end, then the other end in a second substitution. Because there's excess NaH, perhaps multiple substitution occurs. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a dimer.

Wait, perhaps the enolate can attack both ends of the dihalide, leading to a coupling of two enolate-derived units. So the enolate (CH2⁻CNCOOEt) would attack each end of the dihalide, leading to a molecule where two CH2CNCOOEt groups are connected via a five-carbon chain.

Wait, that might be possible. Let me think: the enolate attacks the first Br, adding a CH2CNCOOEt group to that end. Then, the other Br could be attacked by another enolate, adding another CH2CNCOOEt group to the other end. So the resulting molecule would be CH2CNCOOEt-(CH2)5-CH2CNCOOEt. Wait, but wait, 1,5-dibromopentane is Br-(CH2)5-Br. So the product would be CH2CNCOOEt attached to each end of the (CH2)5 chain. So the structure would be:

CH2CNCOOEt-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CNCOOEt.

Wait, but that's seven CH2 groups between the two CH2CNCOOEt groups, because the pentane has five CH2 groups, and each substitution adds one more CH2. Wait, no, the original pentane is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with Br on each end. So attaching the enolate to each end would result in CH2CNCOOEt-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CNCOOEt.

Wait, but that makes the chain between the two substituents as five CH2 groups. Because 1,5-dibromopentane is Br-(CH2)5-Br, so when you substitute both ends, you get (CH2)5 in the middle. So the product would be CH2CNCOOEt-(CH2)5-CH2CNCOOEt.

So product 4 is di-ethyl 2-cyanoacetate pentane diyl. Or, more accurately, the structure is:

CH2CNCOOEt-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CNCOOEt.

Wait, but that would be a symmetric molecule, right? Because both ends are the same. So each end has a CH2CNCOOEt group attached to a CH2 chain.

Wait, but wait, the starting material after substitution would be:

[CH2CNCOOEt]-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-[CH2CNCOOEt]

So each CH2CNCOOEt is connected by a five-carbon chain.

Hmm, so now the structure of product 4 is a symmetrical molecule with two identical groups connected by a five-carbon chain.

Now, let's think about the NMR spectrum of product 4. We need to count the distinct hydrogen environments.

Each CH2CNCOOEt group is identical, and the chain between them is symmetric. Let's break down the structure:

- Each end has a CH2CNCOOEt group.
- The central chain is -(CH2)5-.

Wait, but the chain is -(CH2)5-? Or is it -(CH2)4-CH2-? No, wait, product 4 is [CH2CNCOOEt]-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-[CH2CNCOOEt]. So each end is attached to a CH2 group of the chain. So the entire chain is five methylene groups between the two substituents.

Wait, but wait, that would make the chain seven carbons long, right? Because each CH2CNCOOEt is one carbon (the CH2), then five CH2 in between, and another CH2 at the end. No, wait, the dihalide was 1,5-dibromopentane, which is Br-(CH2)5-Br. So when you substitute both ends, each CH2 is added to the ends.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think of it as:

Enolate (from CH2CNCOOEt) attacks the first bromide, adding a CH2CNCOOEt group to the first carbon, which was previously Br. Then, another enolate attacks the fifth carbon's Br, adding another CH2CNCOOEt group. So the resulting molecule is:

CH2CNCOOEt-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CNCOOEt.

Wait, no, because the starting dihalide is CH2Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2Br. So when both ends are substituted, the product would be CH2(CNCOOEt)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2(CNCOOEt).

So the molecule is a symmetric one with two identical substituents at each end of a six-carbon chain? Wait, no, wait: the dihalide is for pentane, which has five carbons. So each substitution adds a group to each end, making the chain between them five carbons. So the chain is five CH2 groups, each attached to the substituents on either end.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to draw it as:

CH2CNCOOEt-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CNCOOEt.

Wait, that's a seven-carbon chain? No, the dihalide is Br-(CH2)5-Br. So substituting both ends would give [CH2CNCOOEt]-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-[CH2CNCOOEt]. So that's two substituents connected by five CH2 groups. So the total chain is seven carbons, but the substituents are on the first and seventh carbons.

Wait, perhaps I should number the carbons. Let's say the substituents are on carbons 1 and 7. So the structure is:

1: CH2CNCOOEt

2: CH2

3: CH2

4: CH2

5: CH2

6: CH2

7: CH2CNCOOEt

Wait, no, that can't be. Because the chain between would be five carbons. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the two substituents on each end of a five-carbon chain. So substituents on carbons 1 and 6 (if the chain is five carbons). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a symmetrical molecule with each substituent attached to each end of the dihalide. So each substituent is on a CH2 group, and the chain between them is five CH2 groups.

Now, about the NMR. Let's analyze the structure of product 4.

The molecule is symmetric, so some of the protons may be equivalent, leading to fewer signals.

Let me break down the structure:

Each substituent is a CH2CNCOOEt group, which is -CH2-CN-COOEt. The chain between them is five CH2 groups.

Wait, but wait, each substituent is a CH2 connected to CN and COOEt. So the substituent is -CH2-C≡N-CO-OEt.

Wait, no, the structure is CH2CNCOOEt. So each substituent is a CH2 group attached to a cyano group, which is attached to a carbonyl group, which is attached to an OEt group.

So each substituent is a CH2CNCOOEt group. So the substituent is: 

CH2- (connected to the chain)

Then, CN

Then, COOEt.

So each substituent is a CH2 group attached to a cyano and a carbonyl group.

Now, the chain between the two substituents is five methylene (CH2) groups.

So the molecule is:

CH2CNCOOEt - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2CNCOOEt.

Wait, but that would make the chain five CH2 groups long, connecting the two substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

(CH2CNCOOEt) - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - (CH2CNCOOEt)

But that would make the chain five CH2 groups between the substituents, so the substituents are on either end of a five-carbon chain. So the entire molecule is symmetric.

Now, the NMR signals depend on the environments of the hydrogens.

Let's identify the unique environments:

1. The CH2 groups adjacent to the substituents (positions 1 and 7 in a seven-carbon chain, but if the chain is five, then positions 1 and 6).

Wait, perhaps it's better to number from the substituent end.

Each substituent is at position 1 and 6 of a seven-carbon chain. Wait, no, the substituents are on each end of a five-carbon chain, so positions 1 and 6.

Wait, I think I'm getting lost in the structure. Another approach: each substituent is at the end of a chain of five methylene groups.

So the molecule is symmetrical around the center. Let's list the types of protons:

a) The CH2 groups directly attached to the substituent (position 1 and 6).

b) The CH2 groups adjacent to these (position 2 and 5).

c) The middle CH2 groups (position 3 and 4).

Wait, but since the molecule is symmetric, the protons on position 1 and 6 are equivalent, as are those on 2 and 5, and 3 and 4. Wait, no, because each substituent is at the end, the chain is symmetric, so each end's CH2 is equivalent. So in the NMR, the CH2 groups attached to the substituents (each) would be one signal. The next CH2 groups would be another, and the middle ones another.

But wait, let's think in terms of the actual structure. Each substituent is CH2CNCOOEt, attached to a CH2 group which is part of a longer chain.

Wait, let me think of the chain as:

Substituent-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Substituent.

Wait, that's a six-carbon chain, with substituents at both ends. No, because 1,5-dibromopentane is a five-carbon chain with Br on each end. So when you substitute both ends, you have substituent-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-substituent. So the chain is five CH2 groups, with substituents on each end.

So the molecule is:

Substituent-(CH2)5-Substituent.

Now, the substituent is CH2CNCOOEt.

So, each substituent is a CH2 group attached to a cyano and a carbonyl group.

Now, considering the NMR:

The molecule is symmetrical, so the protons on the same carbon will be equivalent on both ends.

Looking at the chain:

1. The first CH2 (attached to substituent) on each end.

2. The second CH2.

3. The third CH2.

4. The fourth CH2.

5. The fifth CH2 (attached to substituent on the other end).

Wait, but since the molecule is symmetrical, the first and fifth CH2 groups are equivalent, as are the second and fourth. The middle (third) CH2 is unique.

Additionally, the substituent itself has a CH2 group attached to the chain. Each substituent's CH2 has a certain environment.

Wait, but the substituent's CH2 is connected to a cyano group and a carbonyl group, so the protons there are in a unique environment.

Wait, let's break it down:

- The substituent's CH2 (attached to the chain) is one type.

- The CH2 groups along the chain:

   a) The outermost CH2 (position 1 and 5) — but wait, no, in this case, the substituent is on position 1 and 6 (if the chain is five carbons, then the substituents are on carbons 1 and 6), but wait, no, the substituent is on each end. So the substituent is on position 1 and 6 of a six-carbon chain. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck.

Maybe a better approach is to count each unique proton environment.

1. The protons on the substituent's CH2 group: each substituent has a CH2 connected to the chain, which is connected to a cyano and a carbonyl. So these CH2 protons are unique. Let's call this environment A.

2. The CH2 groups in the chain:

   a) The CH2 groups directly attached to the substituent (positions 1 and 6). These are adjacent to substituents, so their environment is different from the others. Environment B.

   b) The CH2 groups next to substituent CH2s (positions 2 and 5). Environment C.

   c) The middle CH2 group (position 3 and 4). Environment D.

Wait, but with five CH2 groups in the chain, the substituents are on positions 1 and 6. Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane has five carbons, so substituents are on the first and fifth carbons, which becomes positions 1 and 5 after substitution. So it's a five-carbon chain with substituents on both ends.

So the chain is substituent-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-substituent.

So the substituent is on each end of a five-carbon chain. So the chain has five CH2 groups:

1. Substituent-CH2-

2. CH2

3. CH2

4. CH2

5. CH2-Substituent

So the chain is:

Substituent-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Substituent.

Wait, that's five CH2 groups between the substituents. So the substituents are on positions 1 and 6 (if we consider the chain as having six carbons, but it's actually five, so substituents are on positions 1 and 5).

But I'm getting confused again. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the chain is five CH2 groups, with substituents on each end. So each substituent is attached to the first and fifth carbons of the chain.

So the chain is:

1: Substituent-CH2-

2: CH2

3: CH2

4: CH2

5: CH2

6: Substituent

Wait, that can't be right because 1,5-dibromopentane has five carbons. So the substituents are on positions 1 and 5, making the chain:

Substituent-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Substituent.

Wait, that's six carbons in the chain, which can't be right because the starting dihalide is pentane. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain is five carbons, with substituents on each end. So the structure is:

Substituent-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Substituent.

Wait, that would make the chain five CH2 groups, with substituents on each end. So each substituent is on a CH2 group, which is attached to the chain.

So, each substituent is a CH2 group connected to the chain, which is connected to a cyano and carbonyl group.

So, the chain is:

Substituent-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Substituent.

So, the substituent on each end is a CH2-CN-COOEt group.

So, in terms of NMR signals:

The substituent's CH2 group (attached to the chain) is a unique environment (A).

The first CH2 in the chain (adjacent to substituent) is another environment (B).

The middle CH2 groups (second and fourth in the chain) are another environment (C), but wait, in a five-carbon chain, the middle is the third group. So:

1: substituent-CH2-

2: CH2

3: CH2

4: CH2

5: CH2-substituent.

Wait, no, the substituents are on 1 and 5. So the chain is substituent-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-substituent.

So the chain has five CH2 groups, with substituents on each end.

So the protons on each of these positions are as follows:

- Position 1 (substituent-CH2-): these are the CH2 groups attached to the substituent. Their protons are in environment A.

- Position 2 (CH2-CH2-): these are next to the substituent. Environment B.

- Position 3 (middle CH2): Environment C.

- Position 4 (CH2-CH2-): same as position 2, environment B.

- Position 5 (CH2-substituent): same as position 1, environment A.

Wait, but since the molecule is symmetrical, the protons on position 1 and 5 are equivalent, so one signal. Positions 2 and 4 are equivalent, another signal. Position 3 is unique, another signal.

Additionally, the substituent's CH2 (position 1 and 5) has its own set of protons. Wait, no, the substituent is attached to the chain at position 1 and 5. So the substituent's CH2 (which is part of the chain) is the same as position 1 and 5. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the substituent's structure.

Wait, the substituent's CH2 is part of the chain. So the substituent is at each end of the chain, making the chain five CH2 groups long, with substituents on each end. So the substituent is not a separate group but part of the chain ends.

Wait, perhaps I should correct myself. The substituent is CH2CNCOOEt, which is attached to the chain's CH2. So each substituent is a CH2 group attached to the chain, which is then connected to the cyano and carbonyl.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to draw the structure:

The substituent is CH2-C≡N-CO-OEt.

So, each substituent is:

CH2- (attached to the chain) -> C≡N -> CO-OEt.

So the substituent is a CH2 group attached to the chain, then a cyano group, then a carbonyl group, then an OEt group.

So each substituent is a CH2 group attached to the end of the chain. So the structure is:

CH2-C≡N-CO-OEt - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2-C≡N-CO-OEt.

Wait, but this would imply a seven-carbon chain, which doesn't align with the starting material. I think I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a di-substituted compound where each substituent is a CH2CNCOOEt group attached to a five-carbon chain.

So, the molecule is:

CH2CNCOOEt-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CNCOOEt.

Wait, that makes a seven-carbon chain, which might not fit with the starting dihalide. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Let me recap the reactions:

1. Acetic acid + Br2, pyridine → 2-bromoacetic acid (CH2BrCOOH).

2. 2-bromoacetic acid + ethanol, H2SO4 → CH2BrCOOEt (ethyl bromoacetate).

3. CH2BrCOOEt + NaCN → CH2CNCOOEt (ethyl 2-cyanoacetate).

4. CH2CNCOOEt + excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane → ?

In step 4, NaH deprotonates CH2CNCOOEt to form an enolate. Then, the enolate attacks 1,5-dibromopentane. Since there are two bromines, perhaps two substitutions occur, adding a chain between the two enolate units.

So, each enolate attacks each end of the dihalide, leading to a molecule where two CH2CNCOOEt groups are connected by a five-carbon chain.

So the structure is:

CH2CNCOOEt-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CNCOOEt.

Wait, that would be a seven-carbon chain (five from the dihalide, plus two from the substituents). But the dihalide was pentane, so perhaps the chain is five carbons with substituents on each end.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

(CH2CNCOOEt)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2CNCOOEt).

So the chain between the substituents is five CH2 groups.

Now, in the NMR, how many distinct signals?

The substituent's CH2 groups (positions 1 and 7) are attached to a cyano and carbonyl group, so their protons are in a unique environment (signal 1).

The adjacent CH2 groups (positions 2 and 6) are next to the substituent. They are in a unique environment (signal 2).

The middle CH2 groups (positions 3 and 5) are in another environment (signal 3).

The central CH2 group (position 4) is in a unique environment (signal 4).

Wait, but wait, in a five-carbon chain (positions 1 to 5), with substituents on 1 and 5:

1: substituent-CH2-

2: CH2

3: CH2

4: CH2

5: CH2-substituent.

So the substituent is on positions 1 and 5. So the chain is:

1: substituent-CH2-

2: CH2

3: CH2

4: CH2

5: CH2-substituent.

So the substituent is on each end.

In this case, the environments are:

- Position 1 and 5: same environment (signal A).

- Position 2 and 4: same environment (signal B).

- Position 3: unique environment (signal C).

Additionally, the substituent's CH2 (position 1 and 5) is part of the chain, so the substituent's CH2 is the same as position 1 and 5.

Wait, but the substituent is CH2CNCOOEt, so the CH2 is attached to both the chain and the cyano group. So the protons on that CH2 are unique (signal A).

The next CH2 groups (positions 2 and 4) are next to the substituent's CH2, so their protons are in another environment (signal B).

The middle CH2 (position 3) is another environment (signal C).

So that's three signals from the chain.

But wait, the substituent's structure is CH2CNCOOEt, which has its own set of protons. The CH2 in the substituent is attached to the chain on one side and to a cyano and carbonyl on the other. So the protons on that CH2 are in a unique environment (signal A).

But wait, this CH2 is part of the chain, so perhaps it's already accounted for in the chain's position 1 and 5.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to model the structure again:

The final product is a symmetrical molecule where two CH2CNCOOEt groups are connected by a five-carbon chain. So the structure is:

(CH2CNCOOEt)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2CNCOOEt).

Each substituent is CH2CNCOOEt, and the chain between them is five CH2 groups.

So, the substituent's CH2 is at each end of the chain.

So, the positions are:

1: CH2CNCOOEt-CH2-

2: CH2

3: CH2

4: CH2

5: CH2

6: CH2CNCOOEt.

Wait, no, because 1,5-dibromopentane is five carbons, so substituents are at positions 1 and 5 of a five-carbon chain. So the chain is:

1: CH2CNCOOEt-

2: CH2

3: CH2

4: CH2

5: CH2CNCOOEt.

Wait, that can't be because the chain is five carbons, but substituents are on each end, making it a five-carbon chain with substituents on 1 and 5.

So, the substituent is on each end, making the structure:

(CH2CNCOOEt)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2CNCOOEt).

But that's six CH2 groups, which doesn't make sense because the starting dihalide is five carbons. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is:

(CH2CNCOOEt)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2CNCOOEt).

Wait, that's seven carbons in the chain, which doesn't fit. I think I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-substituted compound with the substituents on the ends of a five-carbon chain. So the structure is:

(CH2CNCOOEt)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2CNCOOEt).

So each substituent is at the end of a four-carbon chain. No, that doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on the same carbon as the Br, leading to the chain being:

(CH2CNCOOEt)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

But that doesn't make sense.

I think I'm stuck on the structure. Perhaps I should think about the NMR signals more abstractly.

The substituent's CH2 is in an environment with adjacent cyano and carbonyl groups, so its protons would be deshielded and give a unique signal.

The CH2 groups adjacent to the substituent (the first and last in the chain) would be in another environment, perhaps a bit more shielded.

The middle CH2 groups would be in a less deshielded environment.

In a five-carbon chain, the substituent is on each end, so the chain is:

Substituent-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Substituent.

So, the substituents are on the first and fifth carbons.

Each substituent's CH2 is attached to the chain and to the cyano and carbonyl groups.

So, the protons on the substituent's CH2 (positions 1 and 5) are one signal.

The CH2 groups at positions 2 and 4 are another signal (since they're next to the substituents' CH2).

The CH2 group at position 3 in the middle is another signal.

Additionally, the substituent's CH2 (positions 1 and 5) has a unique environment.

Wait, but the substituent's CH2 is part of the chain, so the substituent's CH2 is the same as the first and fifth CH2 groups.

So, the chain's CH2 groups are:

1: substituent (CH2CNCOOEt)-CH2-

2: CH2

3: CH2

4: CH2

5: CH2-substituent (CH2CNCOOEt).

So, the substituent's CH2 is part of position 1 and 5.

So, the protons on position 1 and 5 are in the same environment (signal A).

The protons on position 2 and 4 are in the same environment (signal B).

The protons on position 3 are in a unique environment (signal C).

That's three signals from the chain.

But wait, the substituent's CH2 (position 1 and 5) has a unique environment because it's attached to the cyano and carbonyl groups. So the protons on those CH2 groups (the ones attached to the substituent) are in a different environment than the others. But in the chain, position 1 and 5 are the substituent's CH2 groups, so their protons are in environment A.

But in the substituent, there's a CH2 group attached to the chain, which is part of the substituent's structure. So the substituent's CH2 is in environment A.

Wait, but the substituent is CH2CNCOOEt, so the CH2 is connected to the chain on one side and to the cyano and carbonyl on the other. So the protons on that CH2 are in a unique environment.

So, in the NMR, the substituent's CH2 (positions 1 and 5) would be one signal (A).

The adjacent CH2 groups (positions 2 and 4) would be another signal (B).

The middle CH2 (position 3) would be another signal (C).

Additionally, the substituent's cyano group is -C≡N, which may cause some deshielding, but that's already considered in the substituent's CH2.

So, that's three signals from the chain and substituent.

But wait, the substituent itself has a structure CH2-CN-CO-OEt. So the substituent's CH2 is next to a cyano group, which is electron-withdrawing, so the protons on that CH2 are in a unique environment (signal A).

The chain's CH2 groups are:

- The two end CH2 groups (positions 1 and 5) are the substituent's CH2 (A).

- The next CH2 groups (positions 2 and 4) are another environment (B).

- The middle CH2 (position 3) is another environment (C).

So, three signals from the chain.

But wait, the substituent's CH2 is part of the chain's end, so it's already counted as A.

So, chain contributes:

A (positions 1 and 5), B (positions 2 and 4), and C (position 3).

That's three signals.

Additionally, the substituent's structure: the CH2 group is connected to CN and COOEt. The COOEt group is an ester, which is electron-withdrawing, so the CH2 protons are deshielded and give a unique signal (A).

Are there any other protons in the substituent? The cyano group (CN) has no protons. The COOEt group has an OEt which has a CH2CH3 group, but the ester's CH3 group is split into a singlet in the NMR, but in this case, since the substituent is ethyl, each substituent's OEt has a CH2CH3 group. However, since the substituents are on both ends of the chain and the molecule is symmetrical, the OEt groups would be equivalent, leading to a single signal for their CH2 and CH3 groups. Wait, but OEt groups are part of the substituent, which is attached to the chain.

Wait, the substituent is CH2CNCOOEt. So the structure is CH2-C≡N-CO-OEt. The OEt is an ethyl group (CH2CH3). So each substituent has an ethyl group attached to the carbonyl.

So the ethyl groups are part of the substituent.

In the NMR, the ethyl groups' protons would be split into how many signals?

The ethyl group is -O-CO-CH2-C≡N-CH2- (no, wait, the structure is CH2-C≡N-CO-OEt.

Wait, correct structure: the substituent is CH2-C≡N-CO-OEt. So the OEt is CH2CH3.

The ethyl group in the substituent is attached to the oxygen. The ethyl group's protons are split into two signals: the OCH2 and the CH3.

But since there are two identical substituents on both ends of the chain, the ethyl groups are symmetrical. So the OCH2 and CH3 would each give a single signal.

So, the ethyl groups contribute two signals: one for the OCH2 (which is adjacent to oxygen) and another for the CH3.

So, now, adding these to our previous count:

Chain contributes 3 signals.

Ethyl groups contribute 2 signals.

Additionally, the substituent's CH2 (already counted as A).

Wait, but the substituent's CH2 is part of the chain's positions 1 and 5, so it's already counted as A.

So total signals so far: 3 (chain) + 2 (ethyl) = 5.

But wait, there's also the possibility of the substituent's CH2 being split into a different environment due to the substituent's structure. But I think it's already accounted for in the chain's A.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Are there any other protons in the molecule?

The substituent's structure is CH2CNCOOEt. The CH2 is attached to CN and COOEt.

So, the substituent's CH2 is one set (A), the COOEt's CH2 (OCH2CH3) is another (two signals: OCH2 and CH3).

So, total signals:

A (substituent CH2) → 1

B (chain positions 2 and 4) → 1

C (chain position 3) → 1

OCH2 → 1

CH3 → 1

That's 5 signals.

Wait, but the substituent's CH2 is part of the chain, so is it already included in A? Yes. So the substituent's CH2 is in A, the chain has B and C, and the ethyl groups have OCH2 and CH3.

So that's 5 signals.

But wait, I'm getting 5 signals, but the options don't have 5 as the correct answer. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 8

B) 5

C)10

D)12

Hmm, option B is 5. But I'm not convinced I'm correct.

Wait, perhaps I missed some environments.

Wait, in the substituent's ethyl group, the OCH2 is next to oxygen, so its protons are in a unique environment (signal D), and the CH3 is another (signal E).

The substituent's CH2 is signal A.

The chain's positions 2 and 4 are signal B.

The chain's position 3 is signal C.

So that's 5 signals. But that would correspond to option B.

But wait, the substituent's CH2 is connected to a cyano and a carbonyl. The ethyl group is connected to the carbonyl. So the substituent's CH2 is in a unique environment (A), adjacent to the substituent's CH2 in the chain (B), the middle CH2 (C), the OCH2 (D), and the CH3 (E). That's five signals.

But wait, perhaps the substituent's CH2 is split into more signals. Wait, no, the substituent's CH2 is a single group, so it's one signal.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's structure leads to more signals. Let me think: the substituent is CH2CNCOOEt. The CH2 is attached to CN and COOEt. The COOEt group is an ester, which has an ethyl group. So the substituent's structure is:

CH2-C≡N-CO-OCH2CH3.

So the substituent has:

- The CH2 (which is connected to the chain, CN, and COOEt).

- The CN group.

- The COOEt group (which has OCH2CH3).

But the substituent's structure doesn't have any other protons besides the CH2 group.

So, the CH2 group in the substituent is one signal (A).

The substituent's OCH2CH3 contributes two signals (D and E).

The chain's CH2 groups contribute three signals (A, B, C).

Wait, but A is already the substituent's CH2, so in the chain, the first and fifth CH2 are the substituent's CH2 (signal A), the second and fourth are B, and the third is C.

So, substituent's CH2 (A), chain's B, C, substituent's OCH2 (D), substituent's CH3 (E).

That's 5 signals.

But the options have 5 as an option (option B). So the answer would be 5.

Wait, but earlier I thought the substituent's CH2 is part of the chain and counted as A. So that's correct.

But wait, perhaps the substituent's CH2 is not part of the chain, but a separate group. Let me re-examine the structure.

Wait, no, in the product, the substituent is connected to the chain. So the substituent's CH2 is part of the chain's end.

So, the NMR would have:

- substituent CH2 (A) → 1
- chain CH2 adjacent (B) → 1
- middle chain CH2 (C) → 1
- OCH2 (D) → 1
- CH3 (E) → 1

Total 5 signals.

But wait, the substituent's CH2 is part of the chain, so it's already counted as A. So the substituent's CH2 is the same as the chain's end CH2.

So yes, 5 signals.

But I'm not entirely confident because I might have missed some environments. Let me think again.

Another approach: when you have a symmetrical molecule, the number of signals can be determined by symmetry.

Product 4 is a symmetrical molecule with two identical substituents connected by a chain. Each substituent is CH2CNCOOEt.

So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry in the center, making certain protons equivalent.

So, the substituent's CH2 (on both ends) → 1 signal.

The CH2 groups adjacent to substituents (on both sides) → 1 signal.

The middle CH2 groups → 1 signal.

The OCH2 groups in the substituent's ester → 1 signal.

The CH3 groups in the ester → 1 signal.

That totals 5 signals.

But wait, the substituent's CH2 is attached to the chain, which is part of the chain's CH2 groups. So the substituent's CH2 is the same as the chain's end CH2.

So, substituent CH2 (A) → same as chain end → 1.

Chain's middle CH2 (B) → 1.

Chain's adjacent CH2 (C) → 1.

Ester's OCH2 (D) → 1.

Ester's CH3 (E) → 1.

Total 5. So the answer is 5, option B.


To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4, we analyze the structure of the molecule and the environments of its protons. The final product is formed through a sequence of reactions starting with acetic acid and ending with treatment of ethyl 2-cyanoacetate with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane. The resulting structure is a symmetrical molecule where two identical CH2CNCOOEt groups are connected by a five-carbon chain.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of Product 4**:  
   The molecule is symmetrical, with the structure:  
   **(CH2CNCOOEt)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH2CNCOOEt)**.  
   Each CH2CNCOOEt group is attached to a five-carbon chain, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry in the center.

2. **Unique Proton Environments**:  
   - **(A) The CH2 groups directly attached to the substituents (CH2CNCOOEt)**: These protons are in a unique environment due to the electron-withdrawing cyano and carbonyl groups. This contributes **1 signal**.  
   - **(B) The CH2 groups adjacent to the substituents**: These protons are in a distinct environment, slightly shielded by the chain but distinct from the substituent-attached CH2 groups. This contributes **1 signal**.  
   - **(C) The middle CH2 group in the chain**: This proton environment is unique due to its position in the center of the chain. This contributes **1 signal**.  
   - **(D) The OCH2 groups in the ester (COOEt)**: These protons are adjacent to the oxygen atom and form a distinct environment. This contributes **1 signal**.  
   - **(E) The CH3 groups in the ester (COOEt)**: These protons are in a unique environment due to their attachment to the CH2 group of the ethyl ester. This contributes **1 signal**.

3. **Symmetry Considerations**:  
   The molecule's symmetry ensures that protons on equivalent carbons (e.g., the first and fifth CH2 groups in the chain) are not split into separate signals but instead contribute to the same signal.

### Total Signals:
Adding the contributions from each unique environment:  
- **(A) Substituent CH2**: 1 signal  
- **(B) Adjacent CH2**: 1 signal  
- **(C) Middle CH2**: 1 signal  
- **(D) OCH2**: 1 signal  
- **(E) CH3**: 1 signal  

Thus, the total number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4 is **5**.

ANSWER: B
