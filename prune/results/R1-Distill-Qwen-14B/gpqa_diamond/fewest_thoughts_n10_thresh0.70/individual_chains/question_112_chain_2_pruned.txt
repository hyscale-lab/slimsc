Okay, let's try to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot. 

So, the question is about finding the probability of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and calculating the average value of an operator. Hmm. Let's read the problem again carefully.

We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, proportionality might mean we need to normalize it. Right, because the sum of the probabilities should be 1. So first step, probably normalize the state.

Then, the operator in question has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. Wait, so that's a 2x2 matrix, since we're dealing with up and down states (which are two in number). Let me write that matrix. 

For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero because when i=j, A_ij is 0. The off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix looks like this:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[hbar/2  0    ]

Wait, that's interesting. That's a spin operator? Or maybe related to spin in a different basis. Oh, wait, but the operator's eigenstates are what we need to find the probabilities for. Because the problem says to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator.

Right, so the operator's eigenstates are the states in which a measurement will give a definite eigenvalue. So we need to find those eigenstates and then project |alpha> onto them to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps we can diagonalize the operator A. Because the eigenstates are the basis that diagonalizes A. Let me think about how to diagonalize A.

The matrix A is [[0, h/2], [h/2, 0]], where h is hbar. So this is a symmetric matrix, right? Because it's equal to its transpose. So it should be diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and an orthogonal set of eigenvectors.

The eigenvalues can be found by solving det(A - λI) = 0.

So the matrix A - λI is [[-λ, h/2], [h/2, -λ]]. The determinant is λ^2 - (h/2)^2 = 0.

So λ^2 = (h/2)^2 → λ = ± h/2. Oh, so the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors... For λ = hbar/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0 → [ [-λ, h/2], [h/2, -λ] ] [v1; v2] = 0.

Substituting λ = h/2, the first equation becomes (-h/2) v1 + (h/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1. So the eigenvector is proportional to [1; 1].

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

The equation becomes (h/2) v1 - (h/2) v2 = 0 → v
