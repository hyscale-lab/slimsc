Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem starts by describing a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So I know that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which is the usual Pauli z matrix. So the state is given in terms of the z-basis.

The first part of the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, let's think about that matrix.

Wait, the operator's matrix is given. Let's consider it's a 2x2 matrix because the states are |up> and |down>, so the spin-1/2 system. So the matrix would have 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal. So the matrix A would look like:

[ 0      ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0  ]

Wait, but wait, the question says A_ij is ħ/2 if i is not equal to j, else 0. So yes, exactly as above. So this operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2, with eigenvalues +1 and -1 for σ_x, so the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), i.e., ħ/2 and -ħ/2.
