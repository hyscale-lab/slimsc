Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question says the concentration is 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions, and the options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the stability constant tells us how stable that complex is. So the higher the K, the more stable the complex. But how does that relate to the concentration of Ca²+ ions?

I think the formula for the stability constant is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh wait, yeah, that's right. Since the complex is Ca-EDTA, the dissociation would release Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So initially, [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M. But some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. But if the K is very large (like 5e10), that suggests the complex is very stable. So the dissociation should be minimal, meaning [Ca²+] is very small.

So in that case, the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would be really low. Because the K is huge, the reaction strongly favors the formation of the complex. So most of the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex, leaving very little free.

So let's set up the equation. The stability constant is:

K = [Ca-EDTA] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

Assuming that the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA and it dissociates a little, let’s say x is the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. Then, [Ca-EDTA] would be approximately 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 since x is probably very small.

Similarly, [Ca²+] would be x, and [EDTA^4-] would also be x because each complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA. So [Ca²+] = [EDTA
