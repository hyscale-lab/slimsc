Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction between 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out which reagent (A) and catalyst (B) were used.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I should probably draw the structures to visualize what's happening. 3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. The methyl group is on the third carbon. The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine. The cyclohexylidene part suggests a cyclohexene ring (since it's like a cyclohexane with a double bond), and the 'methyl' part indicates a CH2 group attached. So, the structure is probably a bicyclic compound where the pyrrolidine is connected via a methylene group to a cyclohexene ring.

Wait, so the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. That would mean the substituent is at the 1-position of pyrrolidine, which is the nitrogen's adjacent carbon. So, the reaction is adding a cyclohexylidene methyl group to the pyrrolidine.

Now, what reaction would do that? Acid-catalyzed reactions with amines often involve alkylation or acylation. But looking at the product, it's an addition of a cyclohexylidene group. Wait, cyclohexylidene is similar to a cyclohexenyl group. So, maybe it's an alkylation where the alkylating agent is a cyclohexenyl group attached via a methylene bridge.

But how do you get that? Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening or some kind of addition reaction. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation? No, wait, pyrrolidine is a cyclic amine, not an aromatic ring. Friedel-Crafts is for arenes.

Wait, another thought: the product has a cyclohexene
