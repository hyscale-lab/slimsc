Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy and redshifts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength. I remember that the Lyman alpha line is a specific emission line in hydrogen, corresponding to a transition between energy levels. The wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range, right?

Wait, the question says these clouds absorb the light. So when a quasar emits light, some of it passes through these neutral hydrogen clouds, and the hydrogen absorbs at the Lyman alpha wavelength. But since the light has to reach us through the intergalactic medium or something, there's a redshift involved.

So the observed wavelength would be longer than the rest wavelength. The formula I remember for redshift is z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength) / rest wavelength. So z = (λ_obs - λ_rest) / λ_rest.

But wait, the clouds are neutral hydrogen, which means they're probably in the early universe or in regions where reionization hasn't occurred. Or maybe they're just intervening clouds along the line of sight. But the key here is that the absorption occurs at the Lyman alpha wavelength, but since the background quasar is at a higher redshift, the absorption line is observed in the optical range.

Wait, the issue is whether the absorption line can be observed from the ground. Optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths beyond the atmosphere's cutoff. The atmosphere is opaque to much of the UV, so ground-based telescopes can't see wavelengths below about 300 nm, but the Lyman alpha is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. That's in the far UV, so Earth's atmosphere blocks it. So how can we observe it?

Ah, right, if the quasar is at a high enough redshift, then the Lyman alpha absorption line is redshifted into the optical range. So the observed wavelength λ_obs must be greater than 300 nm (since optical is roughly 400-700 nm, but maybe the cutoff is lower). Let me think. The Lyman alpha is 1216 Å (121.6 nm). If the cloud is at redshift z, then the observed wavelength is λ_rest * (1 + z). So for the observed wavelength to be in the
