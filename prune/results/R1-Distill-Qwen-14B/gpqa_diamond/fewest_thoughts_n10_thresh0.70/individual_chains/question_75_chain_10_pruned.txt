Okay, so I have this question about a genetics experiment, and I'm trying to figure out what went wrong. Let me read it carefully.

The scenario is about a researcher who wants to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection using a mouse model. They made a transgenic mouse with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G gene. They also want to affinity-purify this protein to find its binding partners after infecting the mice with the virus.

To do this, they modified the gene's coding sequence by adding the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic determinant at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. Then they transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they started testing, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected.

The problem is that the plus strand sequence they obtained doesn't produce the protein. They're looking for why. The options are A to D.

Hmm, so what's the issue here? Let me think about the steps involved. They added an HA tag at the N-terminus. So the construct should be HA-GADD45G. But they're not getting the protein expressed.

Looking at the given DNA sequence, I should check for any obvious issues. The start codon is at the beginning, right? The sequence starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. So that's good.

Wait, but the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the HA coding sequence should come before the GADD45G coding sequence. Let me see: the first part of the DNA is 5' ATG TAC CC..., which is the start codon followed by the HA sequence. Wait, HA is a specific peptide; its coding sequence would be a few codons, right?

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, about 11 amino acids. Let me think about the DNA sequence of the HA tag. The HA epitope is usually YPYDVPDYA, which corresponds to the DNA sequence TAC TAC CCC ATG GAT TCA GCC. Wait, but in the given plus strand, the start is ATG TAC CCC ATG..., so that's the first few codons. Let me break it down.

ATG is Met, TAC is Tyr, CCC is Pro, ATG is Met again. Wait, that's Met Tyr Pro Met, which doesn't make sense for the HA tag. Because HA's peptide is YPYDVPDYA. So their HA sequence is wrong.

Wait, but the HA is added at the N-terminus. So the DNA would have the HA coding sequence followed by the GADD45G sequence. Let me think about the correct sequence. The HA tag is a specific peptide, so the DNA sequence for HA should be at the beginning.

Wait, the first part is ATG TAC CCC ATG..., which translates to Met Tyr Pro Met. That doesn't match the HA tag. Because the HA tag should be, as
