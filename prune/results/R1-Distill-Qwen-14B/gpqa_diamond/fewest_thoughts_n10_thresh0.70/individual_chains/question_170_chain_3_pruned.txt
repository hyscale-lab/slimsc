Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that notation represents a two-component spinor. So, the state vector is a column vector with the first component 3i and the second component 4. Oh right, spinors have two components because the electron has spin-1/2.

The question is about finding the expectation value of S_y, the spin along the y-axis. I remember that the expectation value is calculated using the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, where ψ is the state vector. So I need to compute this using the given state.

But wait, what is S_y in terms of matrices? Oh right, the Pauli matrices. The σ_y matrix is given as:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

But S_y is ħ/2 multiplied by σ_y, right? Because for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators are S = (ħ/2) σ. So σ_y is the Pauli matrix, and S_y would be (ħ/2) times that matrix.

So σ_y is:
0   -i
i    0

So S_y is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

The expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ. Let me write down ψ.

ψ is a column vector:
[ 3i ]
[ 4 ]

So ψ† is the conjugate transpose, which would be [ -3 , 4* ]? Wait, wait, no, wait. The components are 3i and 4. So ψ is (3i, 4) as a row vector. But in the column vector, it's [3i; 4]. So ψ† would be the transpose and the conjugate. So ψ† is [ -3, 4 ] as a row vector because 3i becomes -3 when conjugated, and 4 is real so stays 4.

Wait, wait. Let me get that straight. The conjugate of 3i is -3i? No, wait, the conjugate of 3i is -3i. Oh wait no, the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i. Right. So ψ† is the row vector [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, wait—no, because the original vector is [3i;4]. So the conjugate is [ -3i;4^* ] (but 4 is real, so 4* is 4). Then the transpose makes it [ -3i, 4 ] as a row vector.

So ψ† is [-3i, 4].

Now, S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So let's compute ψ† * S_y * ψ.

Breaking it down:

First, compute S_y ψ. Let's compute S_y ψ.

S_y
