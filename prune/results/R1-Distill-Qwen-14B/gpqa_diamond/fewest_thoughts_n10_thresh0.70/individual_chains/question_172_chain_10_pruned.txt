Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. 

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, so the excitation here refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy state relative to a lower one, I think. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor comes into play here. 

The Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between those levels. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. 

In this problem, the energy difference is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Wait, that's actually equal to k, since k is approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. Interesting, so E = k*T would mean something here. 

Wait, the ratio is given as n1 = 2*n2, but wait the question says star_1 has twice as excited. So for star_1, the number in the excited state is higher. Let me think. Let me denote for star_1: n1_1 (excited) and n1_2 (ground?), but wait, the problem says "twice as excited", so perhaps the ratio for star_1 is n1_upper/n1_lower = 2 times star_2's ratio. Wait, no, the question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, so maybe n_upper/n_lower in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or perhaps the actual number in the higher level is twice as much as in star_2. Hmm, the question isn't entirely clear. Let me re-read.

It says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So maybe n_upper in star_1 is twice n_upper
