Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, when they’re in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms can be explained using the Boltzmann equation. 

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2 for the same energy level. Let me think about the Boltzmann distribution here.

The Boltzmann factor tells us that the population of a particular energy level is proportional to exp(-E/(k*T)), where E is the energy of the level, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since the energy difference between the levels is given, I should consider the ratio of the populations between the two stars.

Wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, that's interesting because k (Boltzmann constant) is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So E = delta E = k * delta T? No, wait, E is the energy gap between the two levels. So for each star, the population ratio depends on their respective temperatures.

Let me denote the populations as N1 and N2 for the two stars. The problem states that N1 = 2 * N2. But wait, in the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of the populations between two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights. But since the question is about the same energy level in each star, perhaps we can consider the ratio for the same transition in each star.

Wait, maybe I should model it differently. For each star, the ratio of population in the excited state to the ground state (or another state) is given by the Boltzmann factor. Let's assume that both stars have the same energy difference ΔE between the levels we're considering. So for star 1, the ratio is N1_upper / N1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1
