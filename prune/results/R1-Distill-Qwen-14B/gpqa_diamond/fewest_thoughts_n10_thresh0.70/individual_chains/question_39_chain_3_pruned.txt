Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that can move along a tube (the x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Oh wait, wait, that can't be right. Because the wave function should have a modulus squared that integrates to 1, right? So the wave function must be normalized. But the imaginary part is 0.5i? Wait, no, the expression is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Hmm, that's a complex wave function. But wait, for a stationary state, the wave function is usually real or purely imaginary, but maybe in this case, it's a complex function. But I'm not sure if that matters for the normalization.

Wait, but normalization is about the integral of the absolute square of the wave function being equal to 1. So the wave function is Î¨(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. So the absolute value squared is [a / sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you square the magnitude, (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i) equals (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5
