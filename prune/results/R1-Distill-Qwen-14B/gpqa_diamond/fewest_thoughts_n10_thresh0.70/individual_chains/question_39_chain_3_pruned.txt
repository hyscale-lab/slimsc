Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. We're told that when measuring the position, all particles are found between x=1 and x=3, nowhere else. We need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that the wave function must satisfy some normalization conditions. Oh right, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should be 1.

Wait, wait. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh, so it's a complex function. The absolute square would be the modulus squared. That is, if psi(x) = real part + imaginary part, then |psi|^2 is (real)^2 + (imaginary)^2.

So let me write psi as psi(x) = (a/(sqrt(1+x))) - 0.5i. Then, |psi|^2 is (aÂ²/(1+x)) + (0.25), since (0.5i)^2 is (0.5)^2 * (i)^2. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the imaginary part is -0.5i, so the square is (-0.5i)^2, which is (0.5)^2 * (i^2) = 0.25 * (-1) = -0.25. But when you take the modulus squared, you're actually taking the square of the magnitude, which is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So the imaginary part here is -0.5, so its square is 0.25. So the modulus squared is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.25).

But wait, the wave function is given only in the region where it exists, which is x between 1 and 3. Outside, it's zero? Or is it non-zero only between 1 and 3? Because the
