Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the hydrogen atom. Hmm, let's read it carefully. The question is about the state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I need to find the correct transition route and the corresponding probability from the options given.

Wait, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electron transitions are governed by the dipole selection rules. So the selection rules for the hydrogen atom in non-relativistic theory are that the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can change by ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, ±1. Also, the principal quantum number n can change by ±1, ±2, etc., but in dipole transitions, the change is usually ±1. But wait, the problem says it's via two dipole transitions, so from 3 to 1, that's a change of 2 in n. So each transition must change n by 1.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. It can't go directly to |1,0,0⟩ in one step because n changes by 2. So it must go through an intermediate state. So there must be an intermediate state with n=2.

What are the possible states for n=2? The possible l values for n=2 are 0, 1. Since the initial state is l=0, the first transition must go to l=1, because the selection rule for l is Δl = ±1. So the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ must go to a state with l=1. So the intermediate state is |2,1, m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, the initial m is 0. So the change in m can be 0, ±1. So from m=0, the first transition could go to m=0, +1, or -1. So possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

Now, from that intermediate state, we go to |1,0,0⟩. Let's see: the intermediate state is |2,1, m⟩. From that, we go to n=1. So the next transition must lower n by 1. The l
