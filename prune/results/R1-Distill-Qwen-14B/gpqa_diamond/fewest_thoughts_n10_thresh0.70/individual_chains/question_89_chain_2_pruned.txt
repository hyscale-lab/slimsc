Alright, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid and having four bridged rings. The molecule has two bromine atoms attached at the 1 and 3 positions.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so this might be an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (adjacent halides) react with strong bases, they usually undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes via an E2 mechanism. So, each Br would leave, and the two adjacent carbons would form a double bond. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal; the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. So maybe it's a di-elimination, but perhaps leading to a more complex structure.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the positions. Adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead is a carbon. So 1 and 3 might be two bridgeheads across the structure. Oh, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so when KOH is added, perhaps each Br leaves, but since they're not adjacent, maybe there's a different mechanism. Hmm, but wait, perhaps it's more likely that each Br is eliminated, but in a way that forms a ring. Wait, could the reaction be a double elimination, resulting in an allene or some conjugated diene? Or perhaps forming a cyclopropane ring, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is adjacent to a bridge, leading to the formation of a double bond between the bridgeheads. Wait, but the structure of adamantane is such that each bridgehead is connected to two other bridgeheads via single bonds. So, if the Brs are on 1 and 3, perhaps elimination would form a bridge across those positions, resulting in a ring-opening or a new structure.

Wait, another approach: The product is a light yellow solid. The NMR data shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), a multiplet between 2.41-2.23 (10H), and a singlet at 1.94 (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe the product is an epoxide? Or a ketone?

Wait, wait, 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So the product after KOH heating is likely a ketone. So how does that happen?

Wait, another reaction possibility: When a dibromide reacts with KOH, if the two bromides are on adjacent carbons, it's elimination to form an alkene. But if they're not adjacent, perhaps it's a substitution. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br on 1 and 3. Oh, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but the structure is such that the two eliminations lead to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation, but that would form a conjugated diene, but the IR suggests a ketone. So perhaps it's more likely that one of the Brs is eliminated, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the KOH isn't just a base but also a nucleophile. Wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction, but substitution of two Brs? That would form an alkane, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Oh wait! Maybe it's a Hofmann elimination scenario, but I think that's for amines. Alternatively, could it be a Fittig reaction? No, that's for aryl halides.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction involves elimination followed by some rearrangement. Alternatively, think about the product's NMR.

The NMR has 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a triplet. That's probably adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an alcohol. But wait, if it's a triplet, maybe those two hydrogens are next to another set of hydrogens. The 2.41-2.23 region is 10H, which sounds like a lot of equivalent hydrogens, perhaps in a bridge structure like adamantane. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be another set, perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So maybe the product is an ester or a ketone. Since it's from a dibromide and KOH, perhaps it's forming an epoxide, but wait, epoxides have a different NMR pattern. Alternatively, maybe it's a diepoxide, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another angle: 1
