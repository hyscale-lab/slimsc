Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully again.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, giving a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Finally, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

First, I think I need to figure out what each reaction step does. Let's start with the first step: heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH.

I remember that when vicinal dihalides (dihalides where the two halogens are on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically forming an alkene. The reaction is probably dehydrohalogenation. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons (since it's 1,3 positions, wait no, wait. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the positions 1 and 3 are on adjacent carbons? Hmm, maybe I should draw the structure of adamantane.

Adamantane has a structure similar to a diamond, with each carbon connected to four others. The structure is quite rigid. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two carbons that are not adjacent. Wait, no. Wait, in adamantane, each carbon is part of a chair-like structure, but more accurately, it's a diamondoid. The 1 and 3 positions are actually adjacent. Because in the diamond structure, each carbon is connected to four others. Wait, maybe I need to confirm that. Alternatively, perhaps the 1 and 3 positions are on the same face, making them adjacent.

Wait, no, perhaps in the case of 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two bromines are on carbons that are not adjacent. Because in adamantane, the structure is such that the 1 position is a primary carbon, and the 3 positions are on adjacent secondary carbons? Hmm, I might be getting confused here. Alternatively, maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a diastereomer or whether they're actually on adjacent carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the positions are such that the two bromines are on carbons that are two apart, making them non-adjacent.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product formed. When KOH is used, it's a strong base and a good nucleophile. But with vicinal dihalides, it's an E2 elimination. So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, it would eliminate two equivalents of HBr and form an alkene. Wait, but wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a diegeminal dihalide? No, wait, geminal is same carbon. Vicinal is adjacent carbons. So if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, then it's a vicinal dihalide; otherwise, it's a different case.

Wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So, if the two carbons where the Brs are attached are not adjacent, then elimination wouldn't form a double bond between them. Hmm, but elimination reactions typically form double bonds between adjacent carbons. So maybe in this case, heating with KOH would cause dehydrohalogenation but perhaps a different pathway?

Wait, maybe in adamantane, the 1 and 3 positions are in a way that the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, but perhaps not directly. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but some kind of substitution. But with KOH, which is a strong base, substitution would require a good leaving group. But in a dihalide, maybe two elimination steps happen.

Wait, another thought: in the first step, the product is a light yellow solid. That makes me think it's an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol. Wait, KOH in a high-temperature reaction with a dihalide could lead to elimination (if vicinal) to form an alkene, or perhaps substitution if something else happens.

Wait, when dibromides are heated with KOH, especially vicinal, they typically eliminate to form alkenes. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr molecules, forming an alkene between the 1 and 3 positions. Wait, but if the two bromines are on non-adjacent carbons, can they eliminate to form
