Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism, right. That's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, leading to different optical properties. So, they must have chiral centers or some kind of stereogenic elements.

The question gives four different organic moieties and asks which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each combining different numbers.

Let's go through each one step by step.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl rings connected at position 1,1'. The substituents are at 2 and 2' positions, and 6 and 6' have nitro groups. So, the structure has two phenyl rings connected. Are there any chiral centers here? Let me think. Each of the two benzene rings has substituents. The dimethyl ester groups are at 2 and 2', and nitro at 6 and 6'. So each benzene ring has four substituents? Wait, no, each has three substituents. Because the biphenyl is connected—so each ring has two substituents from the other ring? Wait, no. The structure is [1,1’-biphenyl], so one ring is connected to the other at the 1 and 1’ positions. Then, on each ring, at position 2 and 2’ are the ester groups (the carboxylate esters). Additionally, position 6 and 6’ are nitro groups. So each ring has three substituents: a methyl ester, another group, and a nitro. So each ring is connected to the other and has substituents at 2, 6, and 1’ (the biphenyl linkage). 

Wait, but the biphenyl linkage itself can have a certain kind of isomerism. Because the two phenyl rings are connected at the 1 and 1’ positions. Depending on the substituents, the compound can have different arrangements. But wait, in biphenyls, if the substituents are in positions that can lead to different configurations. Wait, but the substituents in this case are at 2 and 2’, which are meta to the biphenyl linkage on each ring. Hmm. Wait, but each ring has substituents at 2, which is adjacent to the point of connection (1). So, substituents at 2 and 6. Wait, the positions are 2, 2’, 6, 6’. So for each ring, substituents are at 2 (ester), 6 (nitro), and the other ring is connected at 1. So the substitution pattern around each ring is such that each has three groups: the ester, nitro, and the biphenyl connection. So each ring has three substituents. But a benzene ring with three substituents can’t have a plane of symmetry if arranged in a particular way, but wait, does it have a center of symmetry? Or are the substituents arranged in a way that leads to a lack of symmetry, making the molecule chiral?

Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl system itself can have stereoisomerism. Because the two rings can rotate around the single bond connecting them, but if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the two mirror images are not superimposable, it could lead to optical isomerism. Wait, biphenyls with substituents in certain positions can exhibit what's called cis-trans isomerism, but that's more about the relative positions, like whether the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides of the bond. But for optical isomerism, we need chirality, which requires a non-superimposable mirror image. So, if the biphenyl has substituents that make it impossible for the molecule to be superimposed on its mirror image, it would have optical isomers.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and
