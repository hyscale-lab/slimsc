Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Alright, the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, wait, I think that notation represents a two-component spinor. So the spinor is χ = [3i, 4]^T. Right, because electrons have spin-1/2, so the state is a two-dimensional vector.

The question asks for the expectation value of S_y, which is the spin operator along the y-axis. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an observable is given by the bra-ket product of the state with the operator acting on the ket. So formula-wise, it's ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩.

But wait, what's the matrix representation of S_y? Oh right, the Pauli matrices. The spin operator S_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli sigma_y matrix. So sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so S_y = (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

So let me write out S_y explicitly. That would make it:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ].

Now, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is calculated as χ† S_y χ, where χ† is the conjugate transpose of χ.

Let me write down χ first. χ is [3i, 4]^T. So the conjugate transpose, χ†, would be [ -3, 4* ] since the conjugate of 3i is -3, and 4 is real, so remains 4.

Wait, wait. Wait, 3i's complex conjugate is -3i. But when taking the transpose, the first component becomes the first element of the row vector. So χ† = [ -3, 4 ].

So now, I need to compute χ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by χ.

Let me break it down step by step. First, compute S_y multiplied by χ.

Multiplying the matrix S_y by χ:

S_y * χ = (ħ/2) * [ [0
