Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy it uses to accelerate a certain type of nucleus. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Oh wait, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, Li is lithium, right? So, Li typically has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6, since 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6.

I remember that the energy of a particle in a collider is related to its kinetic energy, but wait, in relativistic terms, we might be dealing with total energy, which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. Oh, right, the total energy (E) of a particle is gamma times its rest mass energy (m0c²). So E = gamma * m0c².

But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider. I think that in colliders, the energy usually refers to the total energy each beam has. So each nucleus is accelerated to a certain energy, and the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy.

So first, I need to find gamma, the Lorentz factor, for a speed of 0.96c. The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that.

v = 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, right? Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28.

Calculating that, 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Hmm, wait, let me check: 0.28 times 3 equals 0.84, 0.28 times 3.5 is 0.98. Wait no, 0.28 times 3.5714. Let me compute 1/0.28 accurately.

0.28 is 28/100, which is 7/25. So 1/(7/25) is 25/7 = approximately 3.57142857...

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy E0 is m0c². The mass m0 is the mass of the nucleus. Since it's Li-6, the molar mass is about 6 g/mol. But wait, the actual mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Because each nucleon (proton or neutron)
