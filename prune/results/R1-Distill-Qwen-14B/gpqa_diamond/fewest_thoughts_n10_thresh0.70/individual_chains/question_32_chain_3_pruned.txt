Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the nuclei it accelerates. Hmm, the question says that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to understand what nucleus X is. The problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that would be Li-6, right? Because Li has atomic number 3. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making a total mass number of 6. So the nucleus is a lithium-6 nucleus.

Now, the RHIC is a collider, so it accelerates ions to high speeds, probably in opposite directions, and they collide. The energy they're asking for is the energy each nucleus has, I think. Or maybe the total energy per nucleus.

The speed is given as 0.96c. So, I'll need to use relativistic equations here. When objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we can't use classical mechanics; we have to use special relativity.

The key formula I remember is the total energy of a particle, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, calculated as 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First, I'll calculate gamma for v = 0.96c. Let me compute that. So v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2, which is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Taking the square root of that gives sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, 0.0784 is 0.28 squared because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me see, 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714... Wait, 0.28 times 3.57 is about 1, right? Because 0.28 *3=0.84, 0.28*3.5=0.98, 0.28*3.5714=1 exactly, because 0.28 * 3.5714 is 0.28 multiplied by (25/7), since 3.5714 is approximately 25/7 (which is about 3.5714). Let me calculate 25/7: 3.5714... Yep. So gamma is 25/7, which is approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now I need to find the rest mass energy of the lithium nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c², where m is the rest mass.

The lithium-6 nucleus has a mass. Looking up the mass of a lithium-6 nucleus, but I don't remember it exactly. Alternatively, I can calculate it using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 atomic mass units (u). Wait, why? Because each proton is about 1.007276 u, each neutron about 1.008665 u. So Li-6 has 3 protons and
