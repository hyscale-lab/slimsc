Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let's see. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between those levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. They want to know the correct equation relating the effective temperatures T1 and T2, assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles among energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states. The formula is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE / (k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, both stars have their own temperatures, T1 and T2. So for each star, we can write their own ratio. Let's say for star_1, the ratio is n1_upper / n1_lower, and for star_2, it's n2_upper / n2_lower.

The problem states that star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited. So maybe n1_upper is twice n2_upper? Or wait, perhaps the ratio n_upper/n_lower is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. Let me think. The problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So the excitation is higher, which suggests more atoms are in the higher energy level relative to the lower one. So the ratio of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2.

So the ratio for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

Each R is given by the Boltzmann factor. So R1 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and R2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)), assuming that the statistical weights g are the same for both stars, since the same element (iron) is considered.

Wait, but wait. The question says the energy difference is the same for both stars, right? Because it's the same energy levels being compared. So ΔE is the same for both.

So let's write R1 as (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and R2 as (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

Since the g's are the same for both stars, when we take the ratio R1/R2, those factors will cancel out. So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ).

But we also know that R1 = 2 R2, so R1
