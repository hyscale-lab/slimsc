Alright, let me try to work through this problem. Okay, so we've got two stars, star_1 and star_2. The question says that the iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation level is higher in star_1. 

I remember that in stellar atmospheres, under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the excitation of atoms depends on the temperature. The Boltzmann equation probably comes into play here. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels in a gas in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like n_j / n_i = (g_j/g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k*T) ), where n is the number of particles in each state, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's call that delta E. The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, for star_1, n_j is twice that of star_2's n_j. Hmm, but wait, does that mean n1_j / n1_i is twice n2_j / n2_i? Or is it that n1_j = 2 * n2_j? Or maybe the ratio n1_j/n1_i is twice the ratio n2_j/n2_i?

Wait, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the excitation (like the population of the upper state) is higher. So, n_j for star_1 is twice that of star_2's n_j, but the question is about the ratio of the populations in each star.

Wait, no. Let me reread the question. It says the iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So perhaps the excitation, meaning the number of atoms in the excited state, is twice. So n1_j is twice n2_j. But wait, the same energy levels
