Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. But wait, what's the structure of a density matrix for a qubit?

A qubit's density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. For a pure state, it's a projector, like |ψ><ψ|. But when it's a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture of projectors. So in this case, the density matrix is (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. That should be a mixed state because it's an ensemble of two orthogonal states each with equal probability.

Wait, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit confused about what that means. Oh right, qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation where each point on the sphere corresponds to a unique quantum state.

But how does the density matrix relate to the Bloch sphere? I recall that any density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. So
