Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem presents a density matrix:

ρ = 1/2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| )

And asks about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are given as points in some space, like (1,1,0), etc. Hmm.

I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. A pure state is a density matrix that's a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But this one seems different because it's a sum of two projectors, each multiplied by 1/2. Oh wait, that's the density matrix for a completely mixed state in a qubit system.

Wait, in a qubit, the space is two-dimensional. The state can be represented on the Bloch sphere, right? The Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation for qubits. For a pure state |0⟩, it's at (1,0,0), and |1⟩ is (0,0,1) in the Bloch sphere coordinates, I think. Wait, no, wait. The Bloch sphere is usually represented with coordinates (x,y,z), where z corresponds to the probability amplitude of |1⟩. So |0⟩ is (1,0,0), and |1⟩ is (-1,0,0), but wait, that's another point. Or wait, maybe I should think about the parameterization.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, the Bloch vector for a state ρ is given by r where ρ = (I + r · σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Oh right! That's the formula. So if I can write ρ in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices, then r will be the coefficients of σ_x, σ_y, σ_z.

Let me compute that. Let's express ρ as:

ρ = (1/2) ( |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| )

But |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly for |1⟩⟨1|. So adding them gives a diagonal matrix with [1 0; 0 1], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (1/2) I.

Wait a minute, that's interesting. Because the identity matrix is the maximally mixed state. So in terms of the Bloch vector formula, ρ = (I + r · σ)/2. So I'm setting that equal to (I)/2 because r · σ would be zero. So r must be (0,0,0).

Wait, but let me double-check. If r is (0,0,0), then the density matrix is (I + 0)/2 = I/2. Which matches our ρ. So that would mean the point is at (0,0,0), which is the origin in the Bloch sphere. But wait, the Bloch sphere is a unit sphere, so does the origin correspond to the completely mixed state?

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the parametrization. Let me think again. The density matrix ρ can be written as (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2. So if ρ is ½ I, then all the terms with σ are zero. That would mean r_x, r_y, r_z are all zero. So the vector r is (0,0,0). So the geometrical position in the qubit space (Bloch sphere) is the origin. Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait—some sources might
