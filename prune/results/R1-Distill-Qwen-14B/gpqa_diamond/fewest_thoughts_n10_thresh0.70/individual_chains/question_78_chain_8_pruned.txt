Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking about the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain point r and time t. The charge q is moving with a trajectory s(t), and we're interested in the fields at a time t where t is greater than tr, the time when the field was generated. Oh right, tr is the earlier time when the charge was at the position that created the field we're observing now.

So, the setup involves retarded time. Because the electromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, the fields at point r and time t depend on the position and velocity of the charge at an earlier time tr, which is such that the light would take (r - s(tr)) distance to reach r. But maybe I don't need to get into that detail here.

Wait, the problem gives me some vectors. Vector d is the vector from the field generating point (where the charge was at time tr) to the observation point r. So d is r minus s(tr), I think. And the velocity v is the velocity of the charge at time tr.

The options are four possible sets of expressions for V and A. Let me recall the expressions for the potentials in the context of a moving charge.

From what I remember, the scalar potential V due to a charge q is similar to the static case, but with a correction due to the motion. The static scalar potential is q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, you have to consider the retarded time. But wait, in the options, some have terms with c and v and d.

The vector potential A is another matter. For a charge at rest, A is zero if it's static because the current is zero. But when the charge is moving, it produces a current, so A would be non-zero.

Wait, the general expressions for potentials in electrodynamics are:

The scalar potential V is given by the retarded potential formula. For a charge moving with velocity v, the scalar potential is (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/(r') ] where r' is the distance from the charge's position at tr to r. But r' is equal to d (
