Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator and eigenvalues. Hmm, I remember from my quantum mechanics class that the Hamiltonian is an operator that represents the total energy of a system. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian give the possible energy levels of the system.

The problem says the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli spin matrices. Right, Pauli matrices are a set of three 2x2 matrices, σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And n is a unit vector, so it's pointing in some arbitrary direction. So σ · n would be the dot product, which is σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z.

Wait, but each Pauli matrix is a 2x2 matrix. So when we take the dot product, we get another 2x2 matrix. Then H is ε multiplied by this matrix. So H is a 2x2 matrix.

I need to find the eigenvalues of H. Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(H - λ I) = 0, where λ are the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.

But wait, I remember that Pauli matrices have some special properties. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. Oh, but here they're scaled by ε and the direction n. Since n is a unit vector, the trace of σ · n is zero, because each Pauli matrix has trace zero, right? Because σ_x, σ_y, σ_z each have trace zero, and the sum over their components multiplied by
