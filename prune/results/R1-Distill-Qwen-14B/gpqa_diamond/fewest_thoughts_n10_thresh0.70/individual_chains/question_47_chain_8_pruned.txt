Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Let me think about what each part of the data tells me.

First, the IR data: there are medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. Those are broad peaks, which usually indicate either N-H or O-H stretches. Since the compound also has an N and O in its formula, which of these it is depends on the other data. Also, there's a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a carbonyl stretch, probably from an ester or amide group. Esters typically show around 1720-1740 cm⁻¹, while amides are a bit lower, around 1650-1700. So maybe this is an ester?

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t, 3H). That's likely a methyl group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ethyl ester. Because in an ethyl group, the CH2CH3 would split into a quartet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CH3. Wait, but here, the triplet is at 1.20, which matches the CH3 of an ethyl group.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad singlet for 2H. That might be an OCH2 group, but wait, OCH2CH3 is more like a quartet around 4.1 for the CH2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an NH group? But that's usually a broad peak, maybe in the 2-4 ppm region.

Wait, in the IR, we saw possible N-H or O-H. If this is an amide, the N-H would show up as a broad peak in NMR. But the 4.0 ppm is a singlet for 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 connected to an electronegative atom, like O or N. Or perhaps a methylene group adjacent to an amide or ester.

- 4.5 ppm, quartet (q, 2H). Quartet with 2H. That's a classic sign of the CH2 in an ethyl group next to an oxygen, like in OCH₂CH3. The splitting comes from the adjacent CH3. So the quartet at 4.5 ppm is likely the OCH2 of an ethyl ester. So maybe we have an ethyl group attached to an oxygen.

- 7.0 ppm, doublet (d, 2H). 8.0 ppm, doublet (d, 2H). This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The two doublets imply two sets of protons, each integrating for 2H, possibly in a meta or para arrangement. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons ortho to the substituent would be deshielded and appear as a doublet. Wait,
