Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two particles of each A⁺ and A⁻. Interesting. I remember that in annihilation processes, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, I guess that means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy, but wait, no—the problem says it's slowly moving, so maybe its velocity is small compared to the speed of light. Or perhaps it's moving at a significant fraction, but not too high. Hmm, not sure yet.

The mass given is mA c² = 300 MeV. Wait, protons have a rest mass energy of about 938 MeV, right? So each proton and antiproton has a rest mass of around 938 MeV, but the product particles are much lighter, only 300 each. So, each A has a much smaller mass than the initial particles.

Now, the question is about finding the velocity of particle A. So we need to apply conservation laws here. Let's think about conservation of energy and momentum.

First, let's consider the initial setup. The antiproton is moving, but the proton is probably at rest. Or wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let's assume that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it. So the initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton.

So initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy. The proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton's energy is its rest energy plus its kinetic energy. Since it's moving slowly, maybe the kinetic energy is not too large compared to its rest mass energy. Wait, but if mA c² is 300 MeV and m_p c² is about 938 MeV, the initial rest mass is much larger than the products. So perhaps most of the energy goes into kinetic energy, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the initial particles (proton and antiproton) have a combined rest mass of 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV
