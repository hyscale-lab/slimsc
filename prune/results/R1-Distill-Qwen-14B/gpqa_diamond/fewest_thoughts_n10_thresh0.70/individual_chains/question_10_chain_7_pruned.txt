Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me think about what I know.

The question gives four options, a to d, each describing a different planet. I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So for each option, I should calculate the density and compare them.

Let me start by recalling the formula for density: density = mass/volume. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. Since all the planets are presumably similar in radius to Earth, I can maybe compare based on mass and radius ratios.

Option a) says Earth-mass and Earth-radius. So density would be Earth's density. I think Earth's density is around 5.5 g/cm³. I remember that because Earth is denser than water but less than some other rocky planets.

Option b) is a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, the density is given here. So that's straightforward; its density is 5.5 g/cm³. But wait, does that mean it's the same as Earth? Because option a is also 5.5, but maybe that's a trick. Let me think—no, wait, Earth's density is about 5.5, so option a must be 5.5. So option b has a density of 5.5 as well. So same as a, but if the question is about the highest, they might be tied. But I think the options are designed so that only one is correct.

Option c) is a planet with same composition as Earth but five times Earth's mass. Oh, same composition implies same density, right? Because composition affects density. So if it's same as Earth's, density is same as a, which is 5.5.

Option d) same composition as Earth but half the mass. So same density as Earth, 5.5.

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, option b says a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5. So that's the same as Earth? So why would it have the same density when it's more massive? Because density is mass/volume. So if the mass increases but the radius increases proportionally, the volume increases, which can affect the density.

Wait no, wait. Option b says the planet has 2
