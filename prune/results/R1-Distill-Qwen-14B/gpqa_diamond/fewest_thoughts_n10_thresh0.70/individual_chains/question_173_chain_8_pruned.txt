Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle has something to do with the uncertainty in position and momentum being related. Right, the formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, but sometimes people just approximate it as Δx * Δp ≈ ħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

The question says an electron is moving along the x-direction with a speed v of 2e8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nm. Wait, 0.1 nm is 0.1 nanometers. Let me convert that into meters because all the units should be consistent. Oh right, 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters.

We need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. Hmm, how does that tie in? I think I need to find Δp first because the uncertainty in momentum relates to the uncertainty in velocity. Oh wait, because the electron's speed is given, maybe I can find the uncertainty in momentum using the speed and the uncertainty in position.

Wait, no. The uncertainty principle gives a relationship between Δx and Δp. So if I have Δx, I can find the minimum Δp. Then, since energy is related to momentum, I can find ΔE from Δp.

Right, so let's start with Δx. Δx is 1e-10 meters. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.05457
