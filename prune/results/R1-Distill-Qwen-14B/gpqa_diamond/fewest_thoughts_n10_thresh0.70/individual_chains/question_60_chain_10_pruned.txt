Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about space travel and time dilation, right? So, the question involves an alien spacecraft traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old and wants to get to Earth. I need to figure out how long the trip takes from the astronaut's perspective. 

Wait, time dilation. Oh right, that's a concept from Einstein's theory of relativity. When you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time slows down for the traveler relative to a stationary observer. But from the astronaut's point of view, their own time isn't dilated. So, I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

The given speed is 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super close to c. That's like almost the speed of light, so relativistic effects will be significant.

Wait, the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud. I think the LMC is about 160,000 to 170,000 light-years away. But wait, the question doesn't specify the distance. Oh, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, the time experienced by the astronaut would be the proper time, which is shorter than the time observed by someone on Earth.

But wait, the options are in years, and the astronaut is 22. So if the trip takes longer than their
