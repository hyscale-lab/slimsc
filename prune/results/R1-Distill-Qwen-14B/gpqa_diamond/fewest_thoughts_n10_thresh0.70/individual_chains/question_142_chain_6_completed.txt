Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are given as four points in three-dimensional space.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what the "geometrical position" refers to. Oh right, I think this is about the Bloch sphere representation. Qubits can be represented as points on a unit sphere, called the Bloch sphere. Each pure state |ψ⟩ corresponds to a point on the surface of this sphere, and mixed states are points inside or as statistical mixtures.

But wait, the density matrix given here is ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) / 2. That looks like it's an equal mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩. So this must be a mixed state.

I remember that for a qubit, any density matrix can be written in terms of Bloch vectors. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (the Bloch vector) of length ≤1, and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So, let's write out ρ in terms of the Pauli matrices. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is a projector, same for |1⟩⟨1|. Let me compute this.

The identity matrix I for a qubit is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The projectors |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]] and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is I. So ρ is (I)/2, because (I/2) is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2.

So ρ = I/2. Now, let's write this in terms of Bloch vectors. The general expression is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. Comparing this to our ρ, which is I/2, it implies that the coefficients of the Pauli matrices must be zero.

The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, the equation would be I/2 = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. Multiplying both sides by 2: I = I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

So each coefficient must be zero. That means r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z = 0. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).

Wait, but what does a Bloch vector of (0,0,0) represent? That's the completely mixed state. Because when the Bloch vector is zero, the state is (I/2), which is the maximally mixed state. So that makes sense.

Looking at the options:

Option C) r=(0,0,0). That's the correct one.

So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically an equal mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a qubit, any density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector. The length of \(\mathbf{r}\) determines whether the state is pure (\(|\mathbf{r}| = 1\)) or mixed (\(|\mathbf{r}| < 1\)).

For the given \(\rho\), we observe that:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that the coefficients of the Pauli matrices \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) in the general expression must be zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is:

\[
\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0).
\]

A Bloch vector of \((0, 0, 0)\) corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is consistent with the given density matrix. Comparing this result with the options:

- **Option A**: \((1, 1, 0)\) — Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state.
- **Option B**: \((0, 0, 1)\) — Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different mixed state.
- **Option C**: \((0, 0, 0)\) — Correct, as this represents the maximally mixed state.
- **Option D**: \((1, 1, 1)\) — Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space is:

**Answer: C**
