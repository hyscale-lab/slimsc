Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR calibration curves. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The setup is a scientist making a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran three technical replicates at each of several concentrations. The efficiency is 100%, which is perfect. R2 is 1, so the data fits perfectly, and the slope is -3.3. Wait, I remember that the slope in a qPCR calibration curve is related to the efficiency. The formula for slope is usually based on ln(N) vs Ct, so for 100% efficiency, the slope should be -3.3219... So a slope of -3.3 is about right. That makes sense.

Looking at the data points, each concentration's Ct values are in triplicate. Let's list them:

100000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5 → average ~34.2
10000: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2 → ~30.9
1000: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9 → ~27.6
100: 24, 24.3, 24.6 → ~24.3
10: 20.7, 21, 21.3 → ~21.0

Wait, each concentration is a tenfold dilution. So from 100000 to 10000 is a 10x decrease, which should correspond to a 1 Ct difference per 10x, assuming 100% efficiency. Let me think: the formula is Ct = Ct_ref - (log10(N) * slope) or something like that. Wait, the standard equation is usually Ct = intercept + (slope × log10(N)). Wait, no, because when you plot Ct vs log10(N), for 100% efficiency, the slope is -3.3219. So higher concentrations (more copies) should have lower Ct values, right? Because you reach the threshold faster with more copies.

Looking at the data: as
