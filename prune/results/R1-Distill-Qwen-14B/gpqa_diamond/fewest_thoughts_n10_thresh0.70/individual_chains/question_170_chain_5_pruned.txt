Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve some matrix operations, right? Let me think through this step by step.

The electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, that's a two-component vector, so it's a spin-½ particle. The state can be written as a column vector:

ψ = [3i; 4]. Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an operator is the conjugate transpose of the state multiplied by the operator acting on the state.

So the operator for S_y is given. The Pauli matrix σ_y is:

[0  -i]
[i   0]

And since S_y is ħ/2 times σ_y, the operator S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. Oh wait, because the spin operators are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices.

So the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is the conjugate transpose of ψ multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ.

Let me write this out. First, compute ψ†, which is the conjugate transpose. So ψ is [3i, 4]^T, so conjugate transpose would be [ -3, 4] because the conjugate of 3i is -3. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: 3i's conjugate is -3i? No. Wait, wait, 3i is a complex number. Its complex conjugate is -3i, because i becomes -i. So when you take the conjugate transpose, each element's complex conjugate is taken and then transposed.

So ψ is [3i; 4]. So the conjugate is [ -3i ; 4 ], and then transpose gives [ -3i, 4 ] as a row vector. So ψ† = [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, ψ is a column vector: [3i; 4]. The conjugate would be [ -3i; 4 ], because 3i's complex conjugate is -3i. Then, the transpose would just switch it to a row vector, so ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the conjugate of 3i is -3i (because 3i becomes 3*(-i) = -3i). The conjugate of 4 (which is real) is 4 itself. So ψ† is [ -3i , 4 ].

Wait, no, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The original vector is ψ = [3i, 4]^T. So the first component is 3i, second is 4.

Conjugate each component:

First component: 3i → -3i.

Second component: 4 → 4.

Then transpose (which just makes it a row vector), so ψ† = [ -3i, 4 ].

Yes, that's correct.

Next, the operator S_y is (ħ/2) times the σ_y matrix. So S_y = (
