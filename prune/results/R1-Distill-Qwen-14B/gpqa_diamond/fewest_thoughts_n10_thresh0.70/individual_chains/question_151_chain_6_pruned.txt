Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting the value 0. 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by matrices, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that matrix. So the first thing I need to do is find the eigenvalues of the matrix P because those will give me the possible results when I measure the observable.

The matrix P is given as a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out to visualize it better. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. 

So P looks like this:
[ 0       1/√2      0     ]
[1/√2     0       1/√2   ]
[ 0       1/√2      0     ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. The determinant of (P - λI) should be zero.

Calculating the determinant might be a bit tricky. Let me try expanding it. 

The matrix (P - λI) would be:
[-λ      1/√2      0     ]
[1/√2   -λ        1/√2   ]
[0       1/√2     -λ     ]

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 * [something, but it's zero anyway]

Wait, let me compute it properly. The determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Maybe expansion is easier here.

Expanding along the first row:

det = -λ * det[ (-λ, 1/√2), (1/√2, -λ) ) ] - (1/√2) * det[ (1/√2, 1/√2), (0, -λ) ) ] + 0 * something.

So the first term is -λ multiplied by [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ].

Which is -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ].

The second term is -(1/√2) multiplied by the determinant of the submatrix from row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3 of P - λI.

Wait, the submatrix for the second element (column 2) is:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3. So the first column is [1/√2, 0], and the third column is [1/√2, -λ].

Wait, no, the submatrix for the (1,2) element would be the minor matrix when you remove row 1 and column 2. So the minor matrix is:

Row 2 and 3: first and third columns.

So minor matrix is:
[1/√2, 1/√2]
[0,    -λ   ]

So the determinant of that is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) = (-λ)/√2.

So the second term is -(1/√2) * [ (-λ)/√2 ] = -(1/√2) * (-λ/√2) ) = (λ)/(2).

So putting it all together:

det = -λ [λ² - 1/2 ] + (λ/2) + 0.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck that. The expansion is:

det = (-λ) * ( (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) - (1/√2) * ( (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) + 0 * (something).

So that becomes: 

-λ (λ² - (1/2)) - (1/√2) * ( (-λ)/√2 - 0 ) 

Which is:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + (1/√2)(λ/√2)

Because the second term is subtracting (1/√2) times (something negative), so it becomes positive.

So let me compute that:

First term: -λ^3 + (λ)(1/2)
Second term: (1/√2)*(λ/√2) = (λ) (1/2)

So adding the terms:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ^3 + λ.

So the equation is:

-λ^3 + λ = 0.

Factor out λ:

λ (-λ² + 1) ) = 0.

So the solutions are λ=0, and -λ² +1=0 => λ²=1 => λ=1 and λ=-1.

Wait, but wait, wait. That can't be right, because when I calculated the determinant, I think I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the expansion.

The first term is from the (1,1) element: -λ, multiplied by the determinant of the minor matrix, which is:

[ -λ    1/√2 ]
[1/√2   -λ ]

So the determinant is ( (-λ)(-λ) ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) = λ² - (1/2).

So the first term is (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ)(1/2).

The second term is from the (1,2) element, which is 1/√2. The sign for this term is (-1)^(1+2) = -1. So the term is: (1/√2) * (-1) * (determinant of the minor matrix).

The minor matrix for (1,2) is rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3 of (P - λI). So the minor is:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2]

Row 3: [0, -λ]

So the determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) )= (-λ/√2).

So the term is (1/√2) * (-1) * (-λ/√2) ) = (1/√2)(λ/√2 )= λ/(2).

So adding this to the first term, the total determinant is:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2 ) = -λ³ + λ.

Set this equal to zero:

-λ³ + λ = 0 → λ( -λ² +1 ) =0 → λ(1 - λ^2 )=0.

So the solutions are λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. So the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, and -1.

The problem asks for the probability that the measurement yields 0. So I'm looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.

Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the state is given as a column vector, and the observable is a matrix. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude when the state is projected onto the corresponding eigenvector.

So, to find the probability, I need to find the eigenvector(s) of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then project the given state onto that eigenvector and find the modulus squared.

So first, find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

The equation (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So the matrix P is as above, and we need to solve P |v> = 0.

P is:
0       1/√2      0
1/√2     0       1/√2
0       1/√2      0

So the equations are:

(1) 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 +0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

(2) (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) =0 → v1 + v3 =0.

(3) 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 +0*v3 =0 → same as equation (1): v2=0.

So, from equation (1) and (3), v2=0. From equation (2), v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 can be written as any vector where v2=0 and v1 = -v3.

So let's express the eigenvectors as |v> = a (1, 0, -1) + ... ?

Wait, the general solution is v1 = a, v2=0, v3 = -a. Because v1 = -v3 → v3 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors are any scalar multiple of (1, 0, -1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1).

But wait, let me check: Let me write the system again.

Equation (1): v2=0.

Equation (2): v1 + v3 =0 → v3 = -v1.

Equation (3): v2=0.

So the solution is v1 = a,
