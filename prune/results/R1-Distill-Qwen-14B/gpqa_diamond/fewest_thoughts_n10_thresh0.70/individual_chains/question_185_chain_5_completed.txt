Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is H = ε times the dot product of σ and n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli vector, right? So σ is made up of the Pauli spin matrices σx, σy, σz. And n is a unit vector, so it's like pointing in some direction.

I remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are related to its properties. Oh wait, each Pauli matrix when multiplied by a unit vector component and summed gives a matrix whose eigenvalues are plus and minus the magnitude. So maybe this has to do with that.

Wait, the general form of a Pauli matrix operator is something like H = a·σ, where a is a vector. The eigenvalues of such an operator would be ±|a|, right? Because the Pauli matrices are traceless and have eigenvalues ±1. So if you scale them by a factor, the eigenvalues scale accordingly.

In this problem, H is ε multiplied by the dot product of σ and n. Let me think, σ·n would then be a matrix where each component is multiplied by the corresponding component of n. So σ·n is like n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. Since n is a unit vector, the magnitude of this operator would be 1, but it's scaled by ε.

Wait, so each Pauli matrix (like σx, etc.) has eigenvalues ±1. So when you multiply the entire sum by ε, the eigenvalues become ±ε * 1. Because the eigenvalues of each term would be ±ε when multiplied by 1, since each term's eigenvalue is ±1, and you scale that by ε. So the overall eigenvalues would be plus and minus ε.

Looking at the options, option B says plus ε and minus ε. That seems right. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, sometimes people include factors of ħ, like in energy expressions, but here the problem states that ε has the dimension of energy, so perhaps it's already including any constants. So the eigenvalues should just be ±ε.

Wait another thing: the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so any matrix of the form a·σ would have eigenvalues ±|a|. Here, a is ε times the unit vector n. The magnitude of a is ε times 1 (since n is unit), so the eigenvalues are ±ε. So yeah, option B is correct.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \(\vec{n}\) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian of the form \( H = a \cdot \vec{\sigma} \), where \(a\) is a vector, are known to be \(\pm |a|\). In this case, \(a = \varepsilon \vec{n}\), and since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, the magnitude of \(a\) is \(|\varepsilon \vec{n}| = \varepsilon\). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \(+1, -1\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues depend on \(\varepsilon\), which is given as an energy constant.
- **Option B**: \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\) is correct, as derived above.
- **Option C**: \(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are not scaled by \(\hbar/2\).
- **Option D**: \(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues depend on \(\varepsilon\), not just \(\hbar/2\).

Thus, the correct answer is **B**, as the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Answer: B
