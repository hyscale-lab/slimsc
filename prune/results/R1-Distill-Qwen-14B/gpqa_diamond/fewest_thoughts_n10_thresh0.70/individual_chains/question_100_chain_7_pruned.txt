Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. I think C3H6 is propene, right? Because propene is C3H6, and it's an alkene. Then, it undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form Compound B. Wait, bromination of alkenes usually leads to dibromide. But wait, when alkenes react with bromine (Br2), it's an addition reaction. So if the starting material is propene (CH2=CHCH3), adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane or maybe the more substituted product. But wait, propene has CH2 on one end and CH3 on the other. So when Br2 adds across the double bond, it would add to each carbon. So Compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane, right? Or maybe 1,1-dibromopropane? No, wait, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's 1,2-dibromopropane. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromide) react with alcoholic KOH, they undergo elimination, usually E2 mechanism, forming an alkene. So the reaction would remove two Br atoms and form a double bond. So compound C would be propene again? Wait, but wait. Wait, propene is the starting material. Oh, but wait, maybe the addition of Br2 in CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride) is a diaddition, so the product is 1,2-dibromide. Then, with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate HBr twice to form the alkene. But wait, the alkene formed could be the same as the starting material, but perhaps with a different structure. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond
