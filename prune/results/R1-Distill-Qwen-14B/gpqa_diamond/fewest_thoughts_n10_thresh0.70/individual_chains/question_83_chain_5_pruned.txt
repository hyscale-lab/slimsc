Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should involve neutralization. 

The problem says that we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid and then dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, let me get the steps right. First, I should calculate the diluted concentration of acetic acid after mixing. Then, determine the equivalence point, and find the pH at 25% of that point and at the equivalence itself.

So, initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be (volume1 × concentration1) divided by total volume. Let me compute that.

0.05 M * 20 cm³ / 40 cm³ = (0.05 * 20) /40 = 1/40 /40? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.05 M is 0.05 mol per liter, and 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After dilution to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the concentration is moles / volume. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate the moles of acetic acid: 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is (moles)/(concentration) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So, at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the problem is at 25% titration and at equivalence. 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

First, find pH at 25% titration. At this point, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Let's calculate the moles of
