Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D, each providing two pH values.

Hmm, okay. So, let me break this down. First, I think I need to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution. Then, determine how much NaOH is added at 25% titration and at equivalence, and calculate the pH for each situation.

Starting with the initial dilution. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we dilute it with an equal volume of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³, which is 0.04 liters.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) can be calculated using Molarity = moles/volume (L). So moles = Molarity × Volume. So that's 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

After dilution, the new volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so the new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, I need to find the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.

So initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol. Volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point. So 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the volume at equivalence is 10 cm³ as I calculated.

So 25% titration would be adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So, let's think about the situation at 25% and at equivalence.

First, let's handle the 25% titration.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added to 40 cm³ of the acetic acid solution. Let me find out the moles of NaOH added.

Moles of NaOH = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Since acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na^+ + H2O.

So, the moles of CH3COOH initially in the diluted solution is 0.001 mol. Moles reacted with NaOH is 0.00025 mol. So the remaining moles of CH3COOH is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

The moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 mol.

So, the solution now contains CH3COOH and CH3COO^- in a buffer solution. So the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So, pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

Log(1.85) is around 0.267. So log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So, pH = 4.733 + log( (0.00025) / (0.00075) )

Simplify the ratio: 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(1/3) is negative, approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.733 -0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, and option D is 4.57 and 6.92. So the first value would be around 4.26. So perhaps option A or D isn't the one. Wait, wait, what about the solution's volume? Because when you add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH to 40 cm³, the total volume is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L. Oh, but in the Henderson equation, we're using concentrations, which are moles per liter. Since both the acid and conjug
