Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think step by step. 

First, I remember that a synchrocyclotron is a type of cyclotron that uses a varying magnetic field. Unlike the regular cyclotron, where the magnetic field is constant, the synchrocyclotron's field changes with time. This allows it to accelerate particles to much higher energies. 

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈0, and it undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? Hmm, maybe it's accelerated twice, perhaps in each of the two regions? Or maybe it's about the number of times the voltage alternates? Not exactly sure yet.

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given is Φ0 = π/4, and U0=190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes.

I recall that in cyclotrons, the number of revolutions a particle makes is related to the time it spends in the accelerator and the frequency of the applied voltage. But since this is a synchrocyclotron, things are a bit different because the magnetic field isn't constant. So the frequency of the voltage needs to be adjusted as the particle's speed increases.

Wait, in a cyclotron, the frequency at which the voltage is applied has to match the particle's cyclotron frequency. But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is varied so that the cyclotron frequency remains in tune with the applied voltage. So the frequency ν(α) probably depends on the angle α, which relates to the particle's momentum.

The key here is to find the time it takes for the proton to reach 950 MeV and then find out how many times the voltage has cycled during that time. Each cycle would correspond to a certain number of revolutions.

Wait, another approach: In a cyclotron, the number of revolutions N is given by the total time of acceleration divided by the period of the cyclotron motion. But since the magnetic field is changing in a synchrocyclotron, the period might not be constant. Hmm, maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, the energy gained by the proton is related to
