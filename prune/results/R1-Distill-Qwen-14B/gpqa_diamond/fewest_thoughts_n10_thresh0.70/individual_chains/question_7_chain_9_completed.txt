Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by the process gamma-gamma -> e+ e-. So, these gamma-rays are annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. I remember that this process is relevant in astrophysics for understanding photon propagation and perhaps the attenuation of gamma-rays from distant sources.

So the key here is to find the energy of these gamma-rays. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. I think the process involves cross-sections and photon density, but I'm not exactly sure of the formula.

Wait, I remember that the interaction rate of a gamma-ray with the CMB depends on the cross-section for the annihilation process and the number density of the CMB photons. The interaction length or the mean free path determines the lifetime of the gamma-ray before it annihilates.

The formula for the mean free path (lambda) is given by lambda = 1 / (n * sigma * v), where n is the number density of the target photons, sigma is the cross-section for the interaction, and v is the relative velocity of the gamma and CMB photons. But wait, since we're dealing with high-energy gamma-rays, maybe the velocity v is approximately the speed of light, so v ≈ c.

Wait, but for high-energy photons, the cross-section for gamma-gamma annihilation depends on the energy of the gamma and the energy of the CMB photon. The cross-section sigma for this process can be approximated as sigma ≈ (8π/3) * (α^2 / (s)) * (m_e^2 / (E_γ E_photon)) ), but I'm not entirely confident about that formula. Alternatively, I've heard that the cross-section for gamma-gamma to e+ e- is sigma ≈ (8π/3) * (α^2 / (s)) * (m_e^4)/(E_γ E_photon) ), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the threshold energy.

Wait, the threshold energy for the production of an e+ e- pair from gamma-gamma collision is when the combined energy is just enough to create the rest mass of the pair. The rest mass is 2 m_e c^2. So, E_gamma * E_photon >= (m_e c^2)^2. But wait, because in the center-of-mass frame, the sum of the energies must be at least 2 m_e c^2. Oh wait, that's not exactly correct because the energy in the center-of-mass frame is gamma1 + gamma2 (their energies), but that's when they're moving in opposite directions.

Wait, no, the condition for the reaction gamma + gamma → e+ + e- to occur is that the center-of-mass energy is at least 2 m_e c^2. The center-of-mass energy squared s is given by s = (E_γ + E_photon)^2 - (p_γ c + p_photon c)^2. But since both photons are massless, their energies are equal to their momentum times c. So,

s = (E_γ + E_photon)^2 - ( (E_γ/c) + (E_photon/c) )^2 c^2.

Wait, that's getting complicated. Let me compute it:

s = (E_γ + E_photon)^2 - ( (E_γ + E_photon) )^2 (since p_γ = E_γ/c and p_photon = E_photon/c, so their sum squared times c squared is (E_γ + E_photon)^2 )

Wait, so s = (E_γ + E_photon)^2 - (E_γ + E_photon)^2 * c^2 / c^2? Because p_γ c = E_γ, right? Because for photons, E = pc c. So, p = E/(c). So, (p_γ c + p_photon c)^2 = (E_γ + E_photon)^2.

So s = (E_γ + E_photon)^2 - (E_γ + E_photon)^2 = 0? That can't be right. Wait, maybe I messed up the units. Oh wait, no, because s is the square of the total four-momentum. When you have two photons moving in opposite directions, their momenta vectors are opposite. So the total momentum is (p_γ - p_photon) if they are moving in opposite directions. Hmm, perhaps I should consider their directions.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of energy and photon energies. The threshold occurs when the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is just enough to produce the rest mass. The condition is (E_γ + E_photon)² >= (2 m_e c²)². Wait, no, because if the photons are moving in opposite directions, their energies add in the center-of-mass frame. So for the threshold, the sum of their energies in the center-of-mass frame must equal 2 m_e c².

Wait, but for photons moving in opposite directions, their energies would add up in the center-of-mass frame. So the condition is that E_γ * E_photon >= (m_e c²)^2 / 4. Because when they're moving head-on, their energies in the center-of-mass frame add. So the square of their sum must be at least (2 m_e c²)^2. So,

(E_γ + E_photon)^2 >= (2 m_e c²)^2.

Wait, but that would imply that E_γ + E_photon >= 2 m_e c^2. Hmm, but wait, photons can have different energies. The CMB photons have an average energy of 10^-3 eV, so if E_photon is about 1e-3 eV, then E_γ must be such that E_γ * E_photon is about (m_e c^2)^2 / 4.

Wait, let's think of the threshold condition for two photons. The threshold occurs when the sum of their energies in the center-of-mass frame is exactly 2 m_e c², which is the rest mass of the electron and positron pair.

The formula for the threshold condition is E_γ * E_photon >= (m_e c^2)^2 / 4.

Wait, let me check that. The general threshold condition for two particles colliding is that the product of their energies in the center-of-mass frame multiplied by their Lorentz factor squared is at least the square of the sum of their rest masses. But since the photons are massless, their rest mass is zero. So maybe the condition is E_γ * E_photon >= (m_e c^2)^2 / (4 c^4) )? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the invariant quantity s, which is (E_γ + E_photon)^2 - (p_γ c - p_photon c)^2, assuming they are moving in opposite directions. Wait, no, if they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are in opposite directions, so the total momentum would be p_γ - p_photon. But for the threshold, the electrons and positrons are produced at rest in the center-of-mass frame, so the total momentum should be zero. So the condition is that the photons have opposite momenta, making the total momentum zero. So, p_γ = p_photon. But since E_γ = p_γ c and E_photon = p_photon c, this would require E_γ = E_photon. But wait, that's only when the photons are moving head-on.

Wait, no, if they are moving in the same direction, their momenta add, and the center-of-mass frame would have higher energy. But for the threshold condition, the photons would have to be moving in opposite directions, so their momenta cancel each other in the center-of-mass frame.

Wait, perhaps I should use the invariant s = (E_γ + E_photon)^2 - (p_γ c - p_photon c)^2 (since for opposite directions, p_photon = -p_photon'). Hmm, but it's getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use the relation for the center-of-mass energy squared.

s = (E_γ + E_photon)^2 - (p_γ c - p_photon c)^2.

But since photons have E = pc, so p_γ = E_γ/(c), and same for the other photon. So,

s = (E_γ + E_photon)^2 - ( (E_γ/(c)) - (E_photon/(c)) )^2 c^2.

Simplify that:

= (E_γ + E_photon)^2 - ( (E_γ - E_photon)^2 ) c^2 / c^2 ?

Wait, no, the units might not be right. Let me write it more carefully.

s = (E_γ + E_photon)^2 - (p_γ c - p_photon c)^2.

Since p_γ = E_γ/(c), and p_photon = E_photon/(c), so p_γ c = E_γ, p_photon c = E_photon.

So,

s = (E_γ + E_photon)^2 - (E_γ - E_photon)^2.

Expanding that,

= (E_γ² + 2 E_γ E_photon + E_photon²) - (E_γ² - 2 E_γ E_photon + E_photon²)

= 4 E_γ E_photon.

So the condition for the threshold is that s must be at least (2 m_e c^2)^2.

So,

4 E_γ E_photon >= (2 m_e c^2 )^2.

Which simplifies to:

E_γ E_photon >= (m_e c^2 )^2.

Wait, because 4 E_γ E_photon >= 4 (m_e c^2 )^2 → E_γ E_photon >= (m_e c^2 )^2.

Ah, so that's the condition. So the product of the gamma-ray energy and the photon energy must be at least (m_e c^2 )^2.

Given that the average photon energy of the CMB is E_photon = 1e-3 eV, so E_photon = 1e-3 eV.

So,

E_γ >= (m_e c^2 )^2 / E_photon.

What's m_e c^2 in eV? The rest mass energy of the electron is about 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV.

So,

(m_e c^2 )^2 = (0.511e6 eV )^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 eV^2.

So,

E_γ >= (0.261e12 eV^2 ) / (1e-3 eV ) = 0.261e15 eV.

Wait, 0.261e12 eV² divided by 1e-3 eV is 0.261e15 eV.

Wait, 0.261e15 eV is 2.61e14 eV. Since 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, that's 2.61e14 eV = 261 GeV. But the answer options are in the 1e5 GeV range. Hmm, that's way lower than the options given. So I must have messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the threshold condition. Let me double-check.

Wait, the product E_γ E_photon must be greater than or equal to (m_e c^2 )^2. Wait, but the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, so that would require E_γ >= (0.511e6 eV )² / (1e-3 eV ) = (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3.

Wait, 0.511e6 is 5.11e5 eV. Squared is (5.11e5)^2 = approx 2.61e11 eV^2.

Divide by 1e-3 eV: 2.61e11 / 1e-3 = 2.61e14 eV.

Which is 261e9 eV, which is 261 GeV. But none of the options are anywhere near that. The options are all around 1e5 GeV, which is 1e5 GeV = 1e14 eV.

Wait, that suggests that I must have made an error in the threshold condition. Because the calculation gives 261 GeV, but the options are much higher. So perhaps I misunderstood the threshold condition.

Alternatively, maybe the gamma-ray's energy is much higher than the CMB photon, so E_photon << E_γ. Then, the condition E_γ E_photon ≈ (m_e c^2 )^2 would imply E_γ ≈ (m_e c^2 )^2 / E_photon.

Wait, but let's compute the numbers again.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

(m_e c^2 )^2 = (0.511e6)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 = approx 0.261 * 1e12 eV² = 2.61e11 eV².

E_photon = 1e-3 eV.

So,

E_γ = 2.61e11 eV² / 1e-3 eV = 2.61e14 eV.

Which is 2.61e14 eV = 261,000 GeV = 2.61e5 GeV.

Wait a second! Oh! Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e5 GeV, since 2.61e14 / 1e9 = 2.61e5. So that's 2.61e5 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV.

Ah, that makes sense now. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but why did I get confused earlier? Oh, I think I forgot that 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e5 GeV. So when I initially thought it was 261 GeV, that was wrong because I wasn't converting GeV correctly.

So the calculation leads to E_γ ≈ 2.6e5 GeV, which matches option C.


To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$, we analyze the threshold condition for this interaction. The process requires the center-of-mass energy to be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, $2m_e c^2$. The threshold condition for this reaction is given by the requirement that the product of the gamma-ray energy $E_\gamma$ and the CMB photon energy $E_{\text{photon}}$ satisfies:

\[
E_\gamma \cdot E_{\text{photon}} \geq (m_e c^2)^2.
\]

The average photon energy of the CMB is given as $E_{\text{photon}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. The rest mass energy of the electron is $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$. Squaring this gives:

\[
(m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511 \times 10^6)^2 = 0.261 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2.
\]

Substituting $E_{\text{photon}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$ into the threshold condition:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{photon}}} = \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Converting this to GeV (since $1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_\gamma \geq 0.261 \times 10^{15} / 10^9 = 0.261 \times 10^6 \, \text{GeV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus, the gamma-ray energy must be at least $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ for the annihilation process to occur. Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

**C) $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**.
