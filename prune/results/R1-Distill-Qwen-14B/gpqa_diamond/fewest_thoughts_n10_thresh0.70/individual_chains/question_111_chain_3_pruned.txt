Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question has two parts, A and B, and I need to determine the major products for each reaction. Then, I have to choose the correct combination from the given options.

Let's start with the first reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong base, so I'm thinking this might be an enolate formation reaction. Enolate chemistry is a big deal in organic reactions, especially in ketones.

The starting material is a cyclohexanone derivative. The structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Wait, let me draw this out mentally. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone group at position 1. Then, at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group (because 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl—so two substituents at C2). And another methyl at C6. So the substituents around the ring are a bit bulky.

When the base (t-BuOK, a strong, bulky base) deprotonates the ketone to form an enolate, the position of deprotonation depends on where the alpha hydrogens are and which site is more stabilized. But wait, in cyclohexanones, the enolate can form at different positions depending on the structure.

In this case, the ketone is at C1. The alpha carbons would be C2 and C6, maybe? Because in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at C1, and the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. Wait, no. Wait, in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at C1, so the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. But here, the molecule is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So at C2, there are substituents—ethyl and methyl, and at C6, a methyl group.

When deprotonating to form the enolate, the base will abstract an alpha hydrogen, but which one? The enolate
