Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the potentials in an electromagnetic field. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r at time t. The setup involves the charge's velocity v at an earlier time tr, which I think is the retarded time. 

I remember that when charges are moving, the potentials are not just static like in Coulomb's law. Instead, they involve the velocity of the charge because of the motion. So I'm thinking about retarded potentials here.

The scalar potential V for a moving charge. From what I recall, the scalar potential due to a charge in motion isn't just q/(4πε₀ r), because that's the static case. But with motion, there's a correction factor. Oh wait, wait, the static case is when the charge isn't moving, so V would be q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, I think there's a term involving the velocity. Or wait, maybe the scalar potential is actually static and the vector potential is what depends on the velocity. Hmm.

Wait, no. I think the scalar potential for a moving charge might still be similar, but perhaps with some relativistic correction. Or maybe the scalar potential depends on the velocity in a specific way due to the way the fields transform. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, the options have different forms. Let me look at the options. Option A says V is q/(4πε₀ r) and A is (v squared over c squared) times V. Option B has V the same, and A proportional to v/(c squared) times V.

Option C and D have more complicated expressions with terms involving d and v. d is the vector from the field generation point (at time tr) to r. So d is the distance vector, and in the denominator, terms like d c minus d dot v. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh, right, the Liénard equations for the potentials involve terms like c(t - tr) minus d·v, where d is the distance vector. So the denominator might look like (c*(t - tr) - (r - r'))·v, but wait, for a moving charge, the potentials are given by integrals over the charge's past positions.

But wait, in the context of the problem, the potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time tr. So I think the expressions for V and A involve terms like (c*(t - tr) - (r - r')) · v. Let me think.

The scalar potential V(r,t) is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v/c²)(t - tr))] something. Wait, no, the denominator would involve c multiplied by the time difference minus the dot product of the position vector and v. Or maybe it's the other way around. Oh, right, the denominator is (d c - (d · v)), where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the field point r. Wait, no, let's
