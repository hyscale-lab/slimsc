Okay, so I've got this question about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when a charge is moving, it generates both electric and magnetic fields. But wait, the question is specifically about the potentials, V and A. I think the potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations, right?

So, the setup is that there's a charge q moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a point r at time t. The vector d is the vector from where the field was generated at time tr (which is earlier) to the observation point r. Oh, and tr is the time when the field was generated, so the charge's velocity at that time is v.

I remember that the scalar potential V is typically associated with the electric field, and the vector potential A with the magnetic field. Also, I think the potentials are expressed using retarded times because the fields propagate at the speed of light, so the current or charge distribution at an earlier time affects the potential at a later time.

Wait, the scalar potential for a stationary charge is straightforward: V = q/(4πε0 r). But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated. Oh right, because the motion introduces a magnetic component as well. So the potentials shouldn't be the same as in the static case.

I think the general expressions involve a term that includes the velocity of the charge. Let me recall the Lienard's formulas or the retarded potential expressions.

Oh, right! For a moving charge, the scalar potential V involves the charge divided by the distance, but adjusted by factors involving the velocity, and the vector potential A is proportional to the velocity of the charge.

Wait, the scalar potential isn't just q/(4πε0 r) anymore because the charge is moving. So the denominator probably isn't just r anymore but something like (distance) minus (velocity dot product), scaled by the speed of light.

I remember that the scalar potential V can be written as (q/(4πε0)) * (γ)/(R - (β · R) c), where γ is the Lorentz factor and β is v/c. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, I think the denominator might involve (c * d - d · v) or something like that, where d is the vector
