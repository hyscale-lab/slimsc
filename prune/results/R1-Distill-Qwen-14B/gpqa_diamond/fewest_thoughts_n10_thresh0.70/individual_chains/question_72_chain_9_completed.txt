Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. The question is about determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product after a series of reactions. Let me break this down.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. 

Hmm, okay, so I think this first step is some kind of nucleophilic substitution or elimination. Wait, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile. But wait, the starting material has a tert-butoxy group. That's a bulky group, so maybe an SN2 reaction isn't favorable. Oh, but wait, if there's a leaving group... Wait, the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of those dibromomethyl groups has two bromines attached to a methyl group—so like CH2Br2? Or is it Br2C-? Wait, dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2? No, wait, dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2? Wait, no, dibromomethyl is actually Br2CH-, but wait no, wait, a dibromomethyl group is -CH2Br2? No, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps each of the substituents is a dibromomethyl, which would be -CH2Br2. Wait, no, that's not possible because a carbon can't have five bonds. Oh, wait, maybe it's a methylene group with two bromines. Like, each substituent is Br2C-? No, that doesn't make sense either. Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two methyl groups, each of which has two bromines attached. So, each methyl is -CH2Br2? Or is it -CHBr2? Because for a CH2 group, two Brs would be -CH2Br2, but that's impossible. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Dibromomethyl is a group where the methyl has two bromines. So the structure is CHBr2. So each of the two substituents on the cyclohexene is a CHBr2 group. So each of those is a dichloromethyl, but I think that's correct.

So when sodium iodide is present, perhaps the bromide ions are acting as nucleophiles. Wait, sodium iodide would provide iodide ions, which are stronger nucleophiles than bromide. So perhaps a substitution reaction occurs where the iodide replaces the bromide in the dibromomethyl group. But wait, each of the dibromomethyl groups has two bromine atoms. So if two equivalents of the starting material are used, maybe each of the two -CHBr2 groups can undergo substitution twice. Alternatively, perhaps each -CHBr2 group reacts once, but since there are two, two equivalents are used.

Wait, but the product 1 is formed. So the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. This is a norbornene structure, right? Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene. So the structure has a bridge. The 7 position is substituted with a tert-butoxy group.

So when this norbornene structure is treated with the dihalide and NaI, perhaps a ring-opening occurs. Alternatively, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction? No, wait, the diene is in the starting norbornene. Or maybe it's a 1,3-diene reacting with another diene or dienophile.

Wait, wait, the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene. Each of the 5 and 6 positions (if I number correctly) have a -CHBr2 group.

Hmm, but norbornene is a bicyclic diene. So maybe the first step is a Diels-Alder reaction. So the norbornene (which is a bicyclic diene) would react with another dienophile. Alternatively, norbornene is a diene and the cyclohexadiene is a dienophile? Or perhaps it's a cycloaddition.

Wait, but in the presence of NaI and elevated temperature, perhaps it's a substitution. The dihalide has two bromines on each methyl group. Maybe it's undergoing a nucleophilic substitution where iodide replaces the bromide. So each -CHBr2 might become -CHI2? But that doesn't immediately make sense. Alternatively, perhaps we're looking at a ring-opening of norbornene via an SN2 reaction, but norbornene is a bridged bicyclic structure, which may not easily undergo SN2 because of the steric hindrance.

Wait, another approach: the norbornene has an oxygen group—tert-butoxy. Maybe the oxy group is a leaving group, but that seems unlikely because tert-butoxy is a poor leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bimolecular reaction where the diene reacts with the dihalide in some way.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene is acting as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction with the dienophile, which is the cyclohexadiene derivative. Wait, but cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene, which would make it a diene, not a dienophile. So maybe the dienophile is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexadiene has groups that make it a dienophile, such as electron-withdrawing groups. So each of the CHBr2 groups is an electron-withdrawing group, so maybe making the cyclohexadiene a dienophile.

In Diels-Alder, the diene reacts with a dienophile to form a six-membered ring. So if the norbornene is the diene, and the cyclohexadiene with the CHBr2 groups is the dienophile, then they would react. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is the cyclohexadiene's substituents.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to think of another approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alkylation. The starting material has a tert-butoxy group, which is a good leaving group? No, wait, tert-butoxy is a strong base but a poor leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is acting as an electrophilic alkylation agent. The norbornene's oxygen group could be a leaving group, but again, not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a ring-opening of the norbornene. The norbornene has a bridge, and upon treatment with the dihalide and NaI, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of ring-opening addition. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is acting as a dienophile. Wait, another thought: perhaps the Diels-Alder adds to the norbornene to form a new ring.

Let me see, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So the structure is like a norbornene with a tert-butoxy group at position 7. Then, when it reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI, perhaps each of the two CHBr2 groups is undergoing substitution to become CHI2. So each CHBr2 becomes CHI2, and the product is 5,6-bis(dichloromethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, but with iodide where bromide was.

Wait, but why would that happen? Because NaI would provide I- which is a good nucleophile, displacing Br- in an SN2 reaction. So each CHBr2 would react with I- to form CHI2, releasing Br- as leaving group. Since there are two such groups, two equivalents of NaI would be consumed, which matches the question statement.

But wait, the starting material is the norbornene with a tert-butoxy group. I'm not sure how that would interact here. Maybe the norbornene is not reacting, but the dihalide is being substituted.

So product 1 would be 5,6-bis(dichloromethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene? Or maybe the norbornene is functionalizing. Wait, but the question says the norbornene is combined with the dihalide and NaI to form product 1. So perhaps the product 1 is the norbornene with some substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the norbornene is acting as a nucleophile. The tert-butoxy group is a good leaving group under certain conditions, perhaps when deprotonated. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene's bridge is opening up. Let me think. The norbornene has a bridge, and when treated with a dihalide, perhaps it's undergoing a ring-opening alkylation. For example, the oxy group (tert-butoxy) could act as a leaving group, leading to an attack by the dihalide's methyl groups.

Wait, but norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So maybe the oxy group is at position 7, which is adjacent to the bridge. If the ring opens, perhaps a new substituent is added.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is acting as a dienophile. So the norbornene (dienophile) reacts with the cyclohexadiene (dienophile) as the diene. Wait, Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. Maybe the cyclohexadiene is the diene, and the norbornene isn't a dienophile. Hmm.

Wait, maybe each of the CHBr2 groups is a leaving group. So perhaps in the presence of a base, the norbornene could attack each CHBr2 group, substituting Br with something. Wait, but the base is NaI, so the iodide could be a nucleophile.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the iodide attacks the CHBr2 groups, replacing Br. So each CHBr2 becomes CHI2. But since there are two of them, two equivalents of NaI are used. So product 1 would be the same cyclohexadiene but with CHI2 groups instead of CHBr2.

But what about the norbornene? Does it react? Or is it just a solvent or something else? The question says it's combined with the dihalide, so perhaps the norbornene is undergoing a reaction as well.

Alternatively, maybe the norbornene and the dihalide undergo a coupling reaction. Perhaps a [2+4] cycloaddition, which would form a new ring. Let me try to imagine that. The norbornene, being a diene, might react with the dienophile, which would be the cyclohexadiene with substituents. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: after the initial reaction, product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4 to form product 2. Then product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150°C to form product 4. The question is about product 4's hydrogen count.

So let's think about the overall process. The initial step probably introduces some iodine substitution. Then, the next steps might involve some kind of oxidation or ring formation.

Wait, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. That often suggests an acid-catalyzed reaction, maybe dehydration or some kind of ring formation. Then, treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO—I think that's the conditions for forming a sulfonamide or sulfonate ester, but wait, SO3 is usually used for sulfonation. Alternatively, when DMSO and SO3 are used, perhaps it's a sulfonation reaction, introducing a sulfonic acid group.

Wait, but maybe the second step is introducing a sulfonic acid group. Alternatively, in the presence of pyridine, it could be a Mitsunobu reaction, but Mitsunobu typically uses DEAD or DIAD and a phosphine, so maybe not. Alternatively, the SO3 could be part of a sulfonation.

Wait, let me think again. The second step is treating product 1 with aqueous H2SO4, which is likely to protonate something, perhaps leading to ring formation. For example, if product 1 has some diol structure, acid treatment might lead to hemiacetal or acetal formation, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step forms a diiodide. Then, acid treatment could cause elimination, forming double bonds. So product 2 might have more double bonds.

Then, treatment with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO—maybe that's a sulfonation. DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent, and pyridine is a base. So perhaps product 2 is being sulfonated at an aromatic ring or another position.

If product 3 has a sulfonic acid group, then heating at 150°C might lead to some elimination or ring formation. Alternatively, sulfonating groups are good leaving groups, so perhaps product 3 undergoes elimination upon heating.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to outline the possible steps.

First Reaction:
- Starting material: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene.
- Reagent: 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI.
- Possible reaction: substitution of bromides with iodide.
   So each CHBr2 becomes CHI2. But how does this connect to the norbornene?

Wait, perhaps the norbornene is getting functionalized. Since the norbornene is a bicyclic diene, maybe it's undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction with the dienophile, which is the cyclohexadiene with the CHBr2 groups.

Wait, norbornene is a bicyclic compound but can it act as a diene? Yes, it's a conjugated diene. So maybe it's the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. The dienophile would be the cyclohexadiene with the CHBr2 groups. Wait, but cyclohexa-1,3-diene is itself a diene, not a dienophile. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituents (CHBr2) on the cyclohexadiene function as electron-withdrawing groups, making the molecule a better dienophile. So the Diels-Alder reaction would proceed with the norbornene as the diene and the cyclohexadiene as the dienophile.

Wait, but Diels-Alder typically uses a diene and a dienophile (like a carbonyl group). So if the cyclohexadiene with two CHBr2 groups is a dienophile, then it would react with the norbornene's diene.

So the Diels-Alder reaction would form a six-membered ring, adding across the diene and dienophile. The product would be a bicyclic compound with substituents from both reactants.

But wait, the starting material is norbornene, which is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, and the dienophile is the cyclohexa-1,3-diene with substituents. So the Diels-Alder would add to the norbornene's diene, creating a new six-membered ring. The product would have a bridge from the norbornene and a new ring from the Diels-Alder adduct.

Alternatively, perhaps the Diels-Alder reaction forms a new bridge, leading to a more complex bicyclic structure.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the iodide substitution. If each CHBr2 becomes CHI2, then the product 1 would be 5,6-bis(dichloromethyl)-something. But wait, the starting material is the norbornene with tert-butoxy. So maybe product 1 is a more complex structure where the norbornene has attached the cyclohexadiene via some reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is not reacting, and product 1 is the dihalide substituted with iodide. But the question says product 1 is formed from the combination of both starting materials, so the norbornene must be reacting as well.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene is getting functionalized via a nucleophilic substitution. The tert-butoxy group is a leaving group under certain conditions, but it's more likely to act as a base. Alternatively, maybe the norbornene's bridge is opening, and the dihalide is adding to the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is acting as an electrophile, and the norbornene is undergoing an alkylation. The tert-butoxy group is a good leaving group if deprotonated, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think about the overall process. The first step may form a compound with iodide groups, which upon treatment with H2SO4, forms a sulfonated compound, and then upon heating, undergoes some elimination to form rings with fewer hydrogens.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me think of the final step. Heating product 3 (after sulfonation) at 150°C to form product 4. Heating with sulfonic acid groups could lead to elimination or ring formation.

Alternatively, maybe the final product is a fused ring system, such as a tricyclic compound, which would have fewer hydrogens because of the increased ring strain and more equivalent hydrogens.

Wait, another approach: think about each step's possible transformations.

1. Reaction of norbornene with dihalide and NaI: substitution of Br with I in the dihalide. So product 1 is the dihalide with I instead of Br. So it's 5,6-bis(dichloromethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene? No, wait, each CHBr2 becomes CHI2. So product 1 is 5,6-bis(dichloro methyl) cyclohexa-1,3-diene, but with I replacing Br? No, wait, the substitution would replace Br with I. So CHBr2 would become CHI2.

Wait, no, substitution would replace Br with I, so each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2? But wait, that's impossible because CH2I2 would have two iodines, which is possible, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is reacting in a way that forms a new carbon-carbon bond. For example, a coupling reaction where the iodide is a leaving group, and the norbornene's oxygen attacks, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is an alkylation of the norbornene. The dihalide has two CHBr2 groups, and perhaps the norbornene's oxygen (tert-butoxy) is a leaving group, allowing the dihalide to add across the ring.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the next steps.

Product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4 to form product 2. Acid treatment often protonates oxygen groups, leading to leaving groups. For example, if product 1 has an -O- group, H2SO4 might protonate it, making it a better leaving group. Then, elimination could occur, forming a double bond.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. SO3 is a sulfonating agent. So product 3 might have a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) attached.

Finally, product 3 is heated at 150°C, possibly leading to elimination or rearrangement, forming product 4. Heating sulfonated compounds can sometimes lead to elimination, forming rings or double bonds.

The final question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Assuming all steps are correct, perhaps product 4 is a highly symmetrical structure with several equivalent hydrogen atoms. So, the count would depend on the symmetry.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's challenging. Let me try to think of what the final structure might look like.

If the initial Diels-Alder forms a new ring, then after sulfonation and elimination, the product might have multiple rings with symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a naphthalene derivative with substituents, which would have certain symmetries.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a fused bicyclic compound with several equivalent protons.

Wait, let's think step by step again.

First, the norbornene is reacting with the dihalide and NaI. If substitution occurs, perhaps the dihalide becomes diiodide. Then, product 1 is diiodide.

Product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4. H2SO4 is an acid, so maybe it causes the diiodide to undergo elimination. For example, each CHI2 group could lose HI, forming a double bond. So, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene becomes a triene? Or perhaps forms a new ring.

Wait, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two CHI2 groups. Upon treatment with H2SO4, perhaps each CHI2 is eliminated to form a double bond. So each CHI2 becomes a CH group with adjacent double bonds, but it's a bit unclear.

Wait, more accurately, if you have CH2I2, and you eliminate HI, you would form a double bond. So each CH2I2 group would lose two HI molecules, forming a triple bond? No, wait, elimination of two HI from CH2I2 would give a triple bond, but that's not possible. Let me think: CH2I2 upon elimination would lose two I atoms and form a double bond. So CH2I2 → CH2 (but that's just a single bond, no). Wait, perhaps each CH2I2 group is at the end of a chain, and elimination would form a double bond between adjacent carbons.

Wait, maybe the cyclohexa-1,3-diene with CHI2 groups, upon treatment with acid, loses HI and forms a new double bond. So the cyclohexa becomes a cyclohexa diene with more double bonds. For example, moving from 1,3-diene to 1,3,5-triene? Or maybe a conjugated diene with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the acid treatment leads to the formation of a ketone or another functional group, but I'm not sure.

After that, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. That sounds like a sulfonation reaction. Sulfonic acid groups are introduced at certain positions, probably activating the molecule for further reactions.

Finally, product 3 is heated at 150°C, which might cause elimination, forming rings or expelling the sulfonic acid group as a leaving group, leading to the formation of a new structure.

If the final product 4 is a highly symmetric polycyclic compound, like a fused bicyclo structure, it might have fewer distinct hydrogen atoms.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the product 4 is a tricyclic compound with several identical environments.

Wait, perhaps the final product is cubane or something similar, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps after all steps, the product is a compound with multiple rings and symmetrical substituents, leading to a small number of unique hydrogen environments.

But the options given are 8,4,10,7. I'm leaning toward 8, but I'm not confident.

Another approach: the number of chemically distinct hydrogens depends on the symmetry of the molecule. Let's say the final product is a molecule with several equivalent H's due to symmetry.

If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, mirror planes, or other symmetry elements, the number of unique H's decreases.

For example, a molecule with a four-fold symmetry might have fewer unique H's.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is norbornene, which has a certain symmetry. If the reactions preserve some symmetry, the final product would have fewer unique H's.

Assuming that the final product has a symmetric structure, perhaps with two identical rings or substituents, the number of unique H's could be lower than the initial material.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to determine. However, based on the options given, I think the answer is likely 8 or 10.

Wait, another possibility: the final product might be a compound with multiple rings and bridge structures, leading to several equivalent H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a cage-like structure, such as adamantane, which has a high degree of symmetry and fewer unique H's. Adamantane has 10 H's in total, and all are equivalent, but that's not the case here. Wait, adamantane has four equivalent CH groups, each with two equivalent H's, so total would be 8 H's. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the final product might have a bridge leading to some symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the starting norbornene, after several reactions, becomes a structure with two bridgeheads, leading to equivalent H's.

But this is getting too speculative.

Given the options and the process, perhaps the correct answer is 8. So I'll go with option A.


The problem involves determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product (product 4) after a series of reactions. Here's the breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: The starting material, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. Sodium iodide likely facilitates nucleophilic substitution, where iodide ions replace bromide ions in the dibromomethyl groups. This forms product 1, which is likely 5,6-bis(dichloromethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with iodide substituents.

2. **Reaction 2**: Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. Acidic conditions may lead to elimination or rearrangement, potentially forming a more conjugated or aromatic system. This forms product 2.

3. **Reaction 3**: Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. These conditions suggest sulfonation, where a sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) is introduced. This forms product 3.

4. **Reaction 4**: Product 3 is heated at 150°C. Heating may induce further elimination or rearrangement, potentially forming a fused ring system or a highly symmetrical structure. The final product (product 4) is likely a polycyclic compound with significant symmetry, reducing the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

Given the symmetry of the final product and the elimination/rearrangement steps, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is reduced. Based on the reasoning and the options provided, the most plausible answer is **8**.

Answer: A
