Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question involves stars, their effective temperature, and the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Oh right, when the star has dark spots, part of its surface is cooler, which affects the overall photospheric temperature. But how does that tie into the ratio of Ti atoms in different energy levels?

Wait, the problem says when the star doesn't have spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So the star's temperature is lower when there are spots. But how does this affect the ionization state of Ti?

I remember something about the Saha equation, which relates the ionization states of atoms in a stellar atmosphere. The Saha equation depends on temperature and electron density. Oh wait, but the question is about neutral atoms, so I'm considering the ratio of two energy levels within neutral Ti, not ionization.

Wait, no. The ratio of the number of neutral atoms in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us how populations of energy levels change with temperature. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-(E_i - E_j)/(kT)), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Oh right, because the transition corresponds to a specific wavelength, the energy difference can be found using E = hc/λ. So the energy change between the two levels is fixed. When the temperature changes, the exponent changes.

In the problem, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when it's spotless (6000 K). So the ratio of the populations will change based on the temperature.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2 when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. Let me think: when the temperature increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio (n1/n2) increases because you have more higher energy states. Wait, no—wait. Let me get the math right.

Let me define the ratio as R = (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(kT) )

If E2 is higher than E1, then (E1 - E2) is negative, so the exponent becomes positive. So R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) )

If the temperature T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) is a positive value that becomes smaller. So the exponential term decreases. Therefore, R would decrease if E2 > E1 with increasing T.

Wait, no. Let me try with numbers. Suppose E2 = E1 + ΔE.

So R = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(kT) )

Wait, no. Because if E1 is lower than E2, then E2 - E1 is positive, so R
