Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem about the Cope rearrangement. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, first I need to draw its structure to visualize what's going on.

Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has a norbornene structure. The norbornene is a bridged bicyclic compound. The substituents are at positions 2, which has a vinyl group and an azabicyclo. So, the structure should have a bridge, and at the 2 position, there's a vinyl group attached.

Wait, the molecule is 2-vinyl, so the vinyl is attached to the second carbon of the bicyclo system. The azabicyclo suggests that one of the carbons in the bridge is a nitrogen. Oh wait, 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-eneâ€”so the nitrogen is in the bridge. So the structure is similar to norbornene but with a bridge containing a nitrogen.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me sketch this out. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has three bridges: two of length 2 and one of length 1. So, the structure has two rings: a five-membered and a two-membered bridge? No, wait, bicyclo[m.n.p] means the bridge lengths are m, n, p. So [2.2.1] implies three bridges with lengths 2,2, and 1.

In the case of norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene), the double bond is between C1 and C2. But in our case, the double bond is at position 5. Wait, the compound is 5-ene, so the double bond is between C5 and C6 perhaps? Or maybe between C5 and C6 in the structure.

Wait, maybe it's better to number the bicyclo system. Let me think: bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the heptene has seven members, with three bridges. The numbering starts such that the bridgehead positions are 1 and 4. So positions
