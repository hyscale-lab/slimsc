Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon. The options are A to D, all in units of N*s.

First, I remember that in the quantum mechanical model for diatomic molecules, the energy levels come from both rotation and vibration. Oh wait, the question mentions the rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. But wait, isn't the rigid rotor model where the bond length is fixed? Maybe the non-rigid one considers bond length changes, but in this problem, they give a fixed bond length, so maybe that's not the main point here.

Wait, the problem states it's the quantum rotation-vibration model. So this combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, so I think that's the state where both the rotational and vibrational quantum numbers are at their lowest values.

Wait, but for a diatomic molecule, the energy levels for vibration are quantized, and each vibrational level has rotational levels associated with it. So the molecule's energy is a combination of both. Oh, right, the total energy is the sum of vibrational and rotational parts.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. That would be the lowest energy state, so the vibrational
