Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states when it absorbs a photon. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let me try to think it through.

The molecule is made of two atoms, X and Y. Their masses are given as Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The question is about finding the momentum of the photon needed to transition the molecule from the fundamental state to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the model here is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. So the molecule's energy comes from both rotation and vibration. But the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration.

Hmm, the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I need to consider the energy transitions. In rotational-vibration models, the energy levels are quantized. For the vibrational part, the energy levels are quantized as (n + 1/2)ħω, where n is the vibrational quantum number. For rotation, the energy is quantized as something like (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where J is the rotational quantum number and I is the moment of inertia.

The fundamental state would have the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0, I think). So from (n=0, J=0) to the next lowest state. But what's the next state? It could be either an increase in vibrational state (n=1, J=0) or an increase in rotational state (n=0, J=1). But I'm not sure if the next state is determined by which transition requires less energy.

Wait, the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the smallest energy difference. So I need to compute the energy required for both possible transitions and see which is smaller.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (n=0) but in the lowest rotational state (J=0). To get the next state, the molecule would need to either increase n or increase J. But perhaps the smallest energy transition is the rotational one, or the vibrational one.

Wait, the
