Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me think. The question is about a pion (Pi(+)) at rest decaying into a muon (mu(+)) and a neutrino (nu). The pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the products.

Wait, right, pion decay. Pions are subatomic particles, and when they decay, they usually do so into other particles. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum should be conserved, which means the products' momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, right? Or maybe in this case, are we considering them massless? I remember that in beta decay, the neutrino is treated as massless for simplicity sometimes.

So the process is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So their magnitudes are the same, but directions are opposite.

I think I need to use conservation of energy and momentum here. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, since it's stationary. So the initial energy is E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, and its kinetic energy plus rest mass is its total energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because its rest mass is negligible. Wait, but in reality, neutrinos do have some mass, but for the sake of this problem, maybe we can assume it's zero. Or perhaps the problem expects us to treat it as such.

So, let me denote the kinetic energy of the muon as KE_mu and that of the neutrino as KE_nu. The total energy after decay is then (m_mu c² + KE_mu) + KE_nu. Because the pion is at rest, the total energy after decay must equal the total energy before. So:

m_pi c² = (m_mu c² + KE_mu) + KE_nu

Which can be rearranged as:

KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi c² - m_mu c²

Plugging in numbers: 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV. So the sum of the kinetic energies is 33.9 MeV.

But I also need to consider momentum conservation. The pion is at rest, so the total momentum before decay is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after decay must also be zero. The muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta.

Momentum is a vector quantity. Let me denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum as p, and the neutrino's as p as well (since they're opposite in direction, their magnitudes are the same). So, for each particle:

The energy of the muon is given by E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, wait. Energy in terms of momentum: E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). So for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( p² c² + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, units might be confusing. Let me think in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity, which is common in particle physics. So then, E_mu = sqrt( p² + m_mu² ) and E_nu = p (since for neutrino, m_nu ≈ 0, so E=pc).

So, the energies are E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), and E_nu = p.

From conservation of energy:

m_pi = E_mu
