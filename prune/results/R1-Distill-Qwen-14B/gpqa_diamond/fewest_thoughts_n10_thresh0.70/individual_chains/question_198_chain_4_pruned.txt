Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked. 

The question is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. They also give me the stability constants (β) for different complexes of Co(II) with SCN-. The β values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm. I remember that stability constants (formation constants) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. Each β corresponds to a different complex, probably with different numbers of SCN- ligands.

Wait, so the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)]^n+, where n could be 1, 2, 3, 4. Each β represents the formation constant for the nth complex. So β1 is for the first complex, Co(SCN), which would be CoSCN^+ maybe, β2 for Co(SCN)₂^2+, and so on.

But wait, the problem mentions the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN- ligands. So the complex we're interested in is the one with two SCN- ions, which would be the second complex, with β2=40.

Wait no, wait. Wait. No, the question says dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- groups. So the complex is [Co(SCN)₂]^n+? Or wait, the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+, the second [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, third [Co(SCN)3]^3+, and fourth [Co(SCN)4]^4-? Or wait, but the charge would depend on the number of SCN- and the Co's charge. Co(II) is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^m+, the charge m is 2 - n*(-1) = 2 + n. Wait, no, because each SCN- contributes -1. So Co²+ plus n SCN- would be Co(SCN)_n^(2-n). So for n=1, it's [CoSCN]^+ (charge 2-1= +1). For n=2, [Co(SCN)₂]^0 (charge 2-2=0?), but that can't be right because SCN- is not a spectator ion. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n+) — but that might not make sense because SCN- is a ligand.

Wait, maybe each complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^(2 - n) because Co is +2 and each SCN- is -1. So for n=1, [CoSCN]^+ (charge 2-1=1+), n=2, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, n=3, [Co
