Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal.

Alright, first, what do I remember about rhombohedral crystals? I think rhombohedral is one of the crystal systems, right? Oh wait, right, a rhombohedron has all edges equal and all angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, wait, interatomic distance—so that must be the edge length 'a' of the crystal, right?

So the formula for the interplanar distance d(hkl) in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of (h² + k² + l²) times the square of the reciprocal of the lattice parameters, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Oh wait, no, the general formula is d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)cos α )) ), but wait, that's for a general case, perhaps. Or wait, no, maybe I should think about it differently.

Wait, no, the correct formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c (but in our case, it's rhombohedral, so a = b = c, and angles alpha = beta = gamma. So, the formula simplifies a bit.

Wait, I remember that for a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a/(sqrt(h² +k² +l²)), but in a rhombohedral system, the formula is a bit more complicated because the angles aren't 90 degrees.

The general formula for d(hkl) in a crystal is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk + hl + kl)/(a²) * cos(theta) - [ (h^4 + k^4 + l^4 + 2h²k² + 2h²l² + 2k²l²) ]/(a² (h²
