Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities for two planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Hmm, the question says that both planets have been detected via the radial velocity method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter period means it's orbiting faster, right?

The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Oh wait, but same radius, so maybe Planet_1's star is more massive but not larger. I remember that for a star, higher mass can mean larger radius, but maybe not in this case because they're the same here.

So, the main thing we're looking at is the probability of a transit. I think the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Also, the duration of the transit and the period influence how often we can observe it, but since I think the question is about the probability per orbit, maybe it's just about the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight.

The formula I vaguely recall is that the transit probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else. Oh wait, no, the main factors are the size of the planet relative to the star and the relative
