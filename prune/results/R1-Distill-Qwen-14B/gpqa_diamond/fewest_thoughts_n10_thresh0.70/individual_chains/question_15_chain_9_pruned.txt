Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. But wait, how exactly does that work?

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh, and both have circular orbits. Their host stars have the same radii, but the host of Planet_1 is more massive (twice as much as the other star). 

Wait, I think the transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. The probability formula I remember is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a, but I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, the geometric probability is proportional to the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. Or wait, the probability is actually proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because a planet is more likely to transit if its orbit is closer to edge-on, but the chance is (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor related to alignment.

Wait, no, let me think again. The transit probability (P) is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned. But since the orbits are circular, I think the exact probability is P ≈ (R_star / a) × (1 / (1 + (a/(R_star * (1 + e)))), but since e=0 here, it's just P ≈ (R_star / a). Oh wait, no, I think I got that wrong. The formula I think is P = (R_star / a) × (R_star + R_planet) / a? Or maybe it's (R_star + R_planet) over a, but that doesn't sound right because if the planet is very small compared to the star, R_planet is negligible. So maybe it's just (R_star / (a × (1 + (R_planet / R_star))))?

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula. Oh, right! From what I recall, the probability that a planet transits its star is given by:

P = (R_star / a) × ( (R_star + R_planet) / R_star )

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by a factor that accounts for the inclination. Oh, wait, the actual probability is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned within our line of sight. But I'm getting a bit confused.

I think the formula is P = (R_star / a) × (something involving the orbital parameters). Or another approach: the probability is the area of the circle where the planet's path would cross the star's disk, divided by the area of the entire orbit.

Wait, perhaps
