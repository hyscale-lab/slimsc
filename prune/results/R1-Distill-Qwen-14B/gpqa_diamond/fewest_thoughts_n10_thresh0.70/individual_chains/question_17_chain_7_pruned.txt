Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where it's part of a complex with EDTA. Hmm, I remember EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions, forming a complex.

The problem states the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Oh wait, and the K for the complex is given as 5x10^10. I think K here is the formation constant, which tells us how strong the complex is. The higher the K, the more stable the complex.

So, the solution is stoichiometric, which I think means that the molar ratio of Ca²+ to EDTA is 1:1. Because EDTA usually complexes in a 1:1 ratio, right? So each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA molecule.

Wait, but in solution, the complex dissociates a bit. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would be determined by the K value. Because the K is so large, the complex doesn't dissociate much. But I need to calculate the actual concentration.

I think the formula for the formation constant K is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). Since the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA, and the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA ↔ Ca-EDTA.

But wait, in this case, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So initially, when you prepare the solution, you have 0.02 M of the complex. But some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA.

Let me set up the variables. Let's let s be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. Since the stoichiometry is 1:1, the concentration of EDTA that dissociates would also be s. 

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. When it dissociates by s, the concentration of the complex becomes 0.02 - s, which can be approximated as 0.02 because s is probably very small compared to 0.02, especially since K is so large (so
