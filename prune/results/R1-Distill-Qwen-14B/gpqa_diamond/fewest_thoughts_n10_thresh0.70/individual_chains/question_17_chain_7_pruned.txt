Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, forming complexes with metal ions. The formation constant, Kf, tells us how strong the complex is. A higher Kf means the complex is more stable.

So, the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 0.02 M. I think that the formation constant equation is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Oh wait, but wait, EDTA is usually in the Y^4- form when it's deprotonated. Since the pH is ideal, I guess that means all the EDTA is in the Y^4- form. So, the solution should have a buffer where the pH is such that EDTA is fully deprotonated, so we don't have to worry about the different protonated forms.

So, the complex is formed from Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. So, the reaction is Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant Kf is 5e10. 

Wait, but the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA^2-], is 0.02 M. 

I'm trying to find the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions. So, I need to relate the concentrations using the formation constant.

Let me set up the expression. Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). 

But wait, in solution, the total EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex and any added EDTA. Wait, no. The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, all the EDTA is tied up in the complex? Wait, no. Because when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The solution is made by dissolving 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, initially, before any dissociation, the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. Then, it dissociates a little into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, in a solution where the complex is formed, the concentrations are in equilibrium. So, let me denote [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M, and we'll let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ that dissociates from the complex. So, [Ca^2+] = x, and [EDTA^4-] = x as well, because each complex releases one Ca^2+
