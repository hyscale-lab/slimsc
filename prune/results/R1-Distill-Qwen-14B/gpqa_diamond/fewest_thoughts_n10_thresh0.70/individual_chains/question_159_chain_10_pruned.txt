Okay, so I've got this question here about quasars and their observations across the electromagnetic spectrum. Hmm, the question is talking about a peak at around 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum, and then the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths. I remember that when we observe objects with redshift, their emitted light gets stretched to longer wavelengths. So maybe this has something to do with redshift?

Wait, the quasar's peak is at 790 nm. If the flux drops below that, I think that's similar to the Lyman break in galaxies. The Lyman break occurs at around 91 nm in the rest frame (for hydrogen), so when you observe a galaxy with a certain redshift, the Lyman break moves into longer wavelengths. For example, if a galaxy has a redshift z, the Lyman break would be at 91 nm*(1+z). If the observed wavelength is longer than that, you see a drop in flux because the intergalactic medium (like the IGM) is absorbing the light, especially at those ionizing wavelengths.

So in this case, the peak is at 790 nm. I think that's the Lyman break for this quasar. So 790 nm would be 91 nm*(1+z). Let me calculate that. 790 divided by 91 is approximately 8.68. So 1+z is about 8.68, which means z is roughly 7.68. Wait, that's a high redshift. Quasars can indeed have high redshifts, so that makes sense.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth. Comoving distance depends on the redshift and the cosmological parameters given. The parameters provided are the Hubble constant H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ωm = 0.3, dark energy density Ωλ = 0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ωk = 0).

I remember that the comoving distance D_C is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z)) dz, where E(z) = sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ*(1+z)^3w + Ωk*(1+z)^2) ). Wait, but dark energy (assuming it's a cosmological constant) has equation of state w = -1, so (1+z)^
