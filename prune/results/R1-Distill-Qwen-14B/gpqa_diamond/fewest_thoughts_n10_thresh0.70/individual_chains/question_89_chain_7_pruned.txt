Okay, let's try to work through this problem. It's a bit complicated, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid and has four bridgehead carbons. Each bridgehead is a tertiary carbon, right? So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two of these bridgehead carbons.

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when it reacts with vicinal dihalides (where two adjacent carbons have halogens), it usually causes an elimination reaction, like dehydrohalogenation. But wait, in this case, the dihalide isn't vicinal because the positions are 1 and 3 on adamantane. Oh, wait no—adamantane's structure is such that the bridgeheads are adjacent. Wait, no, let me think. In adamantane, the bridgeheads are connected through a ring structure, so 1 and 3 might actually be adjacent? Or maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Adamantane's structure is like a diamond fragment with four bridgehead carbons. Each of those bridgeheads is connected to two other bridgeheads and two CH2 groups. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two bridgeheads that are diagonally opposite each other, perhaps. But regardless, when KOH is used, especially in a strong base like this, it might cause an elimination. But wait, elimination typically requires adjacent leaving groups. Since the bromines are on bridgehead carbons, maybe the reaction is different.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The reaction conditions—excess KOH and heat. Oh! It might be a case of dehydrohalogenation, but since the dihalide isn't vicinal, perhaps it's a different elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of the Cope elimination or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: in such a rigid structure, the base could abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. So, elimination would form an alkene. So, 1,3-dibromoad
