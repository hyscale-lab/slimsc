Okay, let's try to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, so I've got a reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms across from each other on the structure.

First step: heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with bases, they usually undergo elimination, forming alkenes. So maybe it's an E2 mechanism. Since it's dibromine on adjacent carbons (if adamantane is like a bridge structure), elimination would form a double bond. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane. Elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, or maybe 2 and 3? Or perhaps a ring becomes more strained, so the more stable double bond forms. But wait, adamantane is already a highly strained structure? No, adamantane is actually quite stable. Oh wait, no, adamantane is a diamondoid, so it's a fused cyclohexane rings structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two adjacent bridgeheads. When you eliminate two HBr molecules, you form a double bond between those positions, right? So the product after KOH would be 1,3-didehydroadamantane or maybe an adamantine structure with a double bond. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps when KOH is used, it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to an alkene.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR shows 4.79 ppm as a 2H triplet. That region is usually around where alkenes or maybe ethers have protons. But wait, 4.79 is more like the region for vinyl protons, maybe a double bond. The triplet suggests coupling with two other protons. Or perhaps it's an ethylene group.

Looking further, the NMR also has 2.41-2.23 ppm as 10H. That's probably the adamantane structure, as those would be the bridgehead protons and
