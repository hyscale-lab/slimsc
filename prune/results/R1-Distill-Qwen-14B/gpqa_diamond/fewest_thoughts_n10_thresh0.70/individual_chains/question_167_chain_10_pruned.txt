Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the non-Gaussianity of a specific Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha squared)). Oh right, because that's the standard way to normalize such superpositions.

The non-Gaussianity, nG, is calculated using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is the density matrix of a Gaussian reference state, and rho is the density matrix of our non-Gaussian state.

Wait, but Gaussian states are things like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. The reference Gaussian state tau would presumably be the state that the non-Gaussian state rho is being compared to. Or maybe it's the closest Gaussian state to rho? I'm not entirely sure, but let's proceed.

The problem asks for nG when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5. So I need to compute del_b for these values.

First, let's plug in the given values. phi = -pi/4. Let me calculate sin(2phi), because that's part of N. 2phi would be -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) is -1.

Alpha is 0.5, so exp(-2 alpha squared) is exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-2*0.25) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N squared is 1 + (-1) * 0.6065 = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. Therefore, N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6274. But wait, N is the normalization, so |psi> is normalized by N, so rho is |psi><psi|, right?

But wait, what's the state |psi> look like? Let's write it out:

|psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

With phi = -pi/4, cos(phi) is cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Similarly, sin(phi) is sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So |psi> becomes [0.7071|alpha> - 0.7071| -alpha> ] / N.

But wait, |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states. Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. Their density matrices are Gaussian, but when you take a superposition, the state becomes non-Gaussian.

So the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, which is a typical Schrödinger cat state. So when we compute rho, it's a pure state, and tau is the reference Gaussian state. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is then del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy.

Wait, no, the formula given is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), which is S(rho) - S(tau). But wait, if rho is pure, then S(rho) is zero. No, wait, no: von Neumann entropy S(rho) = -Tr(rho ln rho). So if rho is a pure state, rho is a projector, so ln rho is zero except at the eigenvalue 1, so S(rho) is zero. But that
