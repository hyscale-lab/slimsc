Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

Alright, the setup is an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, and they have negligible mass. So, I don't have to worry about their kinetic energy or anything like that; it's all about the electric potential energy here.

The problem says that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D, with some numbers in various scientific notations. 

Hmm, okay, so I think I remember that the potential energy of a charge in an electric field depends on the work done to bring the charge from infinity to that point. But wait, in this case, all the charges are fixed except one. Wait, no, the 13th is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So, each of those 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the charge at P.

Wait, but since all the charges are identical and have the same charge, 2e, they would all repel each other. But since the system is isolated, and the other 12 are constrained, I think the minimum energy would be when the potential energy is at its lowest possible state.

Wait, but wait. The system's potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. So, I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair.

Wait, but wait, how many pairs are there? Let me think. There are 13 charges. Each of the 12 charges around P is interacting with the charge at P, and also with each other.

So, the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges, plus the potential energies between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, but wait, how do these interactions work? Because each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, each is 2 meters away from the fixed charge (the 13th). But what about the distance between the 12 charges themselves? Are they all at the same radius from P, arranged in a sphere? So, the distance between any two of them would be... Oh wait, but the problem states that they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but nothing about their positions relative to each other. Hmm, maybe I can assume that they are all at the same point, but that's probably not physical. Alternatively, perhaps they are arranged in a circle or sphere around P, but without knowing the exact arrangement, maybe the problem simplifies by considering all pairs as being 2 meters apart. Wait, but that can't be right because if they're all 2 meters from P, their distance from each other depends on the angle between them. For example, if they're all on a sphere, the distance between two charges would be less than 4 meters, depending on the angle. But the problem might be making an assumption that the distance between any two of the 12 charges is 2 meters as well, but that's probably not the case. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge, and not the potential energy between the 12 themselves. Because the 12 are constrained, maybe their mutual interactions don't contribute to the potential energy in this context. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, but in that case, the potential energy would be calculated as the sum of each of the 12 charges interacting with the 13th. But wait, if only considering the 13th and the 12 around it, that's 12 interactions. But the system's total potential energy should include all possible pairs. Oh right, because each charge interacts with every other charge except itself.

So, to find the total potential energy U, I need to calculate the potential energy for each pair and sum them all. But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, so each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P. But what about the distance between any two of the 12 charges? If they're all on a sphere of radius 2 meters, their mutual separation would be more than 2 meters. For example, if two charges are on opposite ends of the sphere, their separation would be 4 meters. But the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, so perhaps we can assume that each of the 12 is at a different point, but maybe the mutual interactions are negligible, or perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy from the 13th charge and the 12 others, but not the 12's mutual interactions. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying by considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P, so their mutual separation is 2 meters. But that can't be, because when you have multiple charges around a central point, their mutual distances are not the same as their distance from the center. So, this approach might not be correct.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating the mutual distances between the 12 charges. Perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual distances are not considered, and only the interactions between each of the 12 and the 13th are taken into account. Because if the 12 charges are constrained to stay at a fixed distance from P, maybe their own arrangement is such that their mutual distances don't contribute to the potential energy. But that doesn't make sense because the 12 charges would have their own mutual repulsion, which would contribute to the system's potential energy.

Hmm, but perhaps the problem is only asking about the potential energy due to the 13th charge and the 12 others. Let me think again. The total potential energy U of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for 13 charges, each pair contributes. So, the number of unique pairs is (13 choose 2) = 13*12/2 = 78 pairs.

But the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters from P. So, each of the 12 has a potential energy with the 13th charge. Additionally, each pair among the 12 charges has their own potential energy, which depends on their mutual separation. But since the mutual separation isn't given, I'm confused about how to proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that's not possible because they would all repel each other and can't stay in the same spot. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplifying and considering each of the 12 as being at 2 meters from the 13th, but their mutual distances are the same as 2 meters. But that's not correct because if they are all at 2 meters from P, they can't all be 2 meters apart from each other unless they're all on the same point, which is impossible.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge, and not the energy between the 12 themselves. If that's the case, then the total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between the 13th and each of the 12.

Wait, but that would mean that each of the 12 charges has a potential energy of (2e)*(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2 m), and since there are 12 of them, I multiply that by 12.

So, the potential energy U would be 12 * ( (2e)^2 ) / (4πε₀ * 2 m )

But let's compute that. Let's get the constants right. e is the elementary charge, 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. 4πε₀ is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

So, let's compute each term.

Each of the 12 charges at 2 m from the 13th. The potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 q2)/r.

In this case, each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the 13th is 2e as well. So, q1 = q2 = 2e.

So, the potential energy for one pair is U_pair = k * (2e)(2e) / r.

r is 2 meters.

So, U_pair = (8.988e9) * (4 e²) / (2 )

Wait, e squared is (1.602e-19 C)^2 = approx 2.566e-38 C².

So, 4 e² is 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.0264e-37 C².

So, U_pair = 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 / 2

Compute that: 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = approximately 9.23e-28. Then divide by 2: 4.615e-28 J per pair.

But wait, we have 12 such pairs (since each of the 12 charges contributes a pair with the 13th charge). So, the total from these interactions is 12 * 4.615e-28 = approximately 5.538e-27 J.

But wait, that's only the energy from the 13th charge and each of the 12. What about the energy between the 12 charges themselves?

Ah, because the problem doesn't specify their positions relative to each other, I'm stuck. Without knowing the mutual distances, I can't calculate the potential energy between each pair of the 12. So perhaps the problem is only considering the 12 interactions between the 12 and the 13th charge.

Wait, but the question says, "the minimum energy of this system." So, perhaps the potential energy is minimized when the mutual repulsions are as small as possible. But how? If the 12 charges are arranged in a way that minimizes their mutual potential energy, that would probably mean they are as far apart as possible. But since they're constrained to be 2 meters from P, perhaps the distance between any two of them is as large as possible, which would be 4 meters (if they're on opposite ends of the sphere). But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges because they're constrained, making their potential energy contributions zero. That doesn't make sense, but maybe that's what the problem wants.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So, their positions are fixed at 2 m from P, but their exact positions relative to each other can vary. So, the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges could vary depending on their arrangement. But since the problem is asking for the minimum energy, perhaps the minimum occurs when the mutual potential energy is as negative as possible, but wait, same charges repel, so their mutual potential energy would be positive. So, to minimize the total energy, which is the sum of all potential energies, we would want the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges to be as small as possible. But since they're all positive, making them as small as possible (i.e., as close to zero as possible) would require minimizing their repulsion, which would happen when the charges are as far apart as possible. But wait, that's not possible if they're all fixed on a sphere of radius 2 m. Their mutual distances can't be more than 4 m (diametrically opposite points).

Wait, but perhaps the problem is designed such that the 12 charges are equally spaced on a sphere, but in that case, each pair's distance would be the same. But I don't think that's the case here because the problem doesn't specify that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is so simplified that it only considers the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge, and ignores the mutual interactions between the 12. Because otherwise, without knowing their arrangement, we can't compute the mutual potential energies.

So, perhaps the problem is only considering the 12 interactions between the 13th and the other 12, and not the 66 interactions between the 12 themselves. So, if that's the case, we can proceed by calculating only those 12 contributions.

Wait, but the problem says "the minimum energy of the system," which is the sum of all pairwise potential energies. So, without considering the mutual potential energies, we can't find the actual minimum energy. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are all at point P as well, but that can't be because they're constrained to be 2 m away. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the 12 charges are all at the same point, 2 meters from P, and their mutual separation is zero. But that can't be right because like charges can't occupy the same point; they'd repel each other. So, maybe the problem is expecting us to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 and only consider their interactions with the 13th charge.

In that case, the total potential energy would be 12 times the potential energy between the 13th and one of the 12. As I calculated earlier, that's about 5.538e-27 J.

But looking at the options, let me see:

Option A: 5.645e-26 J

Option B: 2.822e-26 J

Option C: 7.056e-27 J

Option D: 122.330 J

Wait, 5.538e-27 is about 5.54e-27 J, which is not exactly any of the options. The closest is option C, 7.056e-27, but that's about 20% higher. Hmm. So perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the math. Let me compute each step again.

Each pair between the 13th charge and a 12th charge has a potential energy U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2 m)

So, k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

(2e)^2 is 4e².

So, U_pair = (8.988e9) * (4e²) / (2 * 2)

Wait, wait, wait a second. Wait, the distance r is 2 meters, so denominator is 2 m. So, U_pair = (8.988e9) * (4e²) / (2).

Wait, no. The formula is U = k*q1*q2 / r. So, in our case, both q1 and q2 are 2e. So,

U_pair = (8.988e9) * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m)

So, that's (8.988e9) * (4 e²) / 2.

Wait, 4e² is 4*(1.602e-19)^2 = 4*(2.566e-38) = 1.0264e-37 C².

So,

U_pair = (8.988e9) * (1.0264e-37) / 2.

Calculating that:

8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = let's compute that.

8.988e9 is 8.988 x 10^9.

1.0264e-37 is 1.0264 x 10^-37.

Multiplying them: 8.988 * 1.0264 ≈ approximately 9.235.

Then, 10^9 * 10^-37 = 10^-28.

So, 9.235e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.6175e-28 J per pair.

Since there are 12 such pairs, multiply by 12.

12 * 4.6175e-28 = 5.541e-27 J.

So, the total would be approximately 5.54e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27, which is about 27% higher. None of the options exactly match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do it again more carefully.

Compute (2e)^2: (2 * 1.602e-19 C)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = (3.204)^2 * 1e-38 = ~10.266e-38 = 1.0266e-37 C².

Then, U_pair = (8.988e9) * (1.0266e-37) / (2 * 2) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the distance r is 2 m, so denominator is 2.

Wait, no: the formula is U = k * (q1 q2) / r.

So, for each pair between the central charge and one of the 12, r is 2 m.

So, U_pair = (8.988e9) * (2e * 2e) / (2).

Which is (8.988e9) * (4 e²) / 2.

So, 4e² is 4 * (1.602e-19)^2 = 4 * (2.566e-38) = 1.0264e-37.

So,

(8.988e9) * (1.0264e-37) = let's compute this.

8.988e9 = 8.988 * 1e9

1.0264e-37 = 1.0264 * 1e-37

Multiply together: 8.988 * 1.0264 ≈ let's compute that.

8 * 1.0264 = ~8.2112

0.988 * 1.0264 ≈ ~1.014.

Total ≈ 8.2112 + 1.014 ≈ 9.2252.

So, 9.2252e(9-37) = 9.2252e-28.

Wait, but wait: 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = 8.988 * 1.0264 = approx 9.225, and 1e9 * 1e-37 = 1e-28. So, 9.225e-28.

Then, divide by 2: 9.225e-28 / 2 = 4.6125e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 12 * 4.6125e-28 = 5.535e-27 J.

So, again, about 5.535e-27 J.

Looking at the options again:

A) 5.645e-26 → 5.645 x 10^-26 → 56.45e-25 → way larger.

B) 2.822e-26 → 28.22e-25 → larger than our value.

C)7.056e-27 → 7.056e-27 → which is about 7.056e-27. Hmm, our calculation is about 5.535e-27, which is about 77% of option C.

Wait, maybe I missed something. Did I forget to multiply by something else? Oh wait, wait a second. The 13th charge is fixed, but each of the 12 is interacting with it. So, U is 12 * (k*(2e)(2e)/(2)).

Alternatively, perhaps the 13th charge is being counted multiple times. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the potential energy as the work done to assemble the system.

Wait, when assembling the system, the 13th charge is first placed at point P. Then, each of the other 12 charges is brought from infinity to their positions, each at a distance of 2 m from P. So, the potential energy added each time is the work done against the electric field created by the existing charges.

Wait, but when you bring the second charge, the electric field at 2 m from P would be due to the 13th charge. But when you bring the third charge, the electric field would be due to both the 13th and the second charge.

But since all charges are identical and repel, the potential energy would be the sum of the work done to bring each charge from infinity to their positions.

But this approach might be more accurate. Let me think about it.

The total potential energy U is the sum of the work done in bringing each charge to their positions.

So, the first charge (the 13th) is placed at P. No work is done because there are no other charges present. Then, the second charge is brought from infinity to 2 m from P. The electric potential at that point due to the 13th charge is V = k*(2e)/(2 m) = k*e/(2 m). The work done is q * V = (2e)* (k*(2e)/(2*2 m)).

Wait, Wait, no. Wait, the potential at point P is due to the 13th charge, which is 2e. So, when bringing a charge q (which is 2e) from infinity to point P, the potential is V = k*(2e)/(2 m). Then, the work done is q * V = (2e) * (k*(2e)/(2 m)).

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The potential at a point due to a charge is V = k q / r. So, when placing the second charge (2e) at 2 m from P, the potential at that position due to the 13th charge (also 2e) is V = k*(2e)/(2 m) = k e/(m).

So, the work done to bring the second charge from infinity to that point is q * V, which is (2e) * (k*(2e)/(2 m)).

Wait, no, because the charge being moved is 2e. So, work done U2 = (2e) * V = (2e) * (k*(2e)/(2 m)).

Wait, but wait, the formula for work done when bringing a charge from infinity to a point where the potential is V is U = q * V.

So, when placing the second charge, the potential is due to the 13th charge. So, V = k*(2e)/(2 m) = k e/(m).

So, the work done is (2e) * (k e/(m)) ) = 2e * k e / m.

Wait, no, because the charge being moved is 2e, so:

U2 = (2e) * (k*(2e)/(2 m)) ) = (2e) * (k e/(m)) ) = 2e * k e / m.

Wait, let me compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each step.

So, the first charge is placed, no work done.

Second charge: brought to 2 m from P. The potential at that point is V = k*(2e)/(2) = k e.

So, work done is (2e) * V = 2e * k e = 2 k e².

Third charge: when placing the third charge, it is at a distance of 2 m from P. But the potential there is due to both the first and the second charge. So, the potential is V = k*(2e)/(2) + k*(2e)/(2) = k e + k e = 2 k e.

Wait, no, because each of the other charges (the 12) is at 2 m from P, but when placing the third charge, it's also 2 m away from the first charge but what about the second charge? The second charge is at 2 m from P as well, so the distance between the second and third charges is sqrt( (2m)^2 + (2m)^2 - 2*(2m)*(2m)*cos(theta) ), but without knowing the angle, perhaps we can't compute it. This approach is getting complicated because each subsequent charge's placement is affected by all the previously placed charges.

But this seems way too complicated, especially since the problem gives us 12 charges all at 2 m from P. So, perhaps we can model this as placing each charge in the field of all others, but that's going to be a lot of work.

Alternatively, perhaps the total potential energy U for the system is simply the sum of the potential energies of all the pairs involving the 13th charge and each of the 12, plus the potential energies between each pair of the 12.

But without knowing the mutual distances between the 12, I can't compute that. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the first part, the 12 pairs with the 13th charge.

Wait, but in the earlier approach, when I computed the potential energy as 12 * (k*(2e)^2/(2)), I got 5.5e-27 J, which didn't match any of the options except perhaps option C, which is 7.056e-27. But that's about 28% higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the formula.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy between two point charges is U = (k q1 q2 ) / r.

So, for each pair between the 13th and each of the 12, the potential energy is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m).

So, that's (k *4e²) / (2 m) = (2 k e²) / m.

Each of the 12 contributes this, so total is 12 * (2 k e²)/2 m.

Wait, no, because each pair is counted once. So, for each of the 12 charges, the 13th is one, so 12 pairs. So, 12 * (k *4e²)/(2 m) = 12*(2 k e²)/m.

Wait, let me compute this again.

Each pair: U = (k * (2e) * (2e )) / (2 m) = (4 k e²) / (2 m) )= 2 k e² / m.

So, 12 such pairs: 12 * (2 k e² / m ) = 24 k e² / m.

Wait, wait, that's not correct. Because each of the 12 charges contributes a pair with the 13th charge, which is 12 pairs in total. So, U = 12 * ( (2e)*(2e) ) / (4πε₀ * 2 m )

Which is 12 * (4e²) / ( (8.988e9) * 2 * 2 m )

Wait, no, the k is 8.988e9, so:

U = 12 * ( (2e)*(2e) ) / ( (4πε₀)* 2 m )

Which is 12 * (4e²) / ( (8.988e9) * 2 * 2 m )

Wait, no, the denominator is (4π ε₀) * r, which is k * r.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each part numerically.

So, let's compute each term step by step.

Compute e²: (1.602e-19 C)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

Each term (2e)^2 is 4e² = 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.0264e-37 C².

So, U for each pair (central charge and one of the 12) is:

k * (2e)^2 / (2 m) = (8.988e9) * (1.0264e-37) / 2.

So, 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = 9.225e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.6125e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 55.35e-28 = 5.535e-27 J.

So, again, about 5.535e-27 J.

Looking at the options again, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is higher. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5 times higher. Option A is 5.645e-26, which is about 10 times higher.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is considering the mutual interactions between the 12 charges. But how?

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each is equidistant from every other charge. For example, on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters, arranged in a regular dodecahedron or something. Then, each pair of the 12 charges would be separated by the same distance. But the problem doesn't specify this, so I'm not sure if I should proceed with that assumption.

But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute their potential energies. So perhaps the problem is only asking about the potential energies between the 13th and the 12, but I'm not matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point as the 13th charge? No, that can't be, because they are constrained to be 2 m away.

Wait, another thought: maybe I messed up the units somewhere. Let's make sure I'm using the right values.

k (Coulomb's constant) is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

e is 1.602 x 10^-19 C.

r is 2 meters.

So, the calculation seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy in a different way, like considering that the 13th charge is 2e, and the 12 each are 2e, but maybe the potential energy includes all possible pairs, including the 12 with each other. But without their mutual distances, I can't compute that. So perhaps the problem is expecting to ignore the mutual terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to treat all 13 charges as identical and compute the potential energy from all pairs, treating each pair once.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total potential energy for all pairs, including the 12 with each other.

Let me think: total number of pairs is (13 choose 2) = 78. Of these, 12 are between the 13th and the others. The remaining 66 are between the 12 charges themselves.

But without knowing the mutual distances between the 12, I can't compute those 66 terms. So, perhaps the problem is designed so that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that can't be right because like charges can't occupy the same point. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual terms, and the correct answer would be approximately 5.5e-27 J, but none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponents. Let me compute 8.988e9 multiplied by 1.0264e-37.

8.988e9 is 8,988,000,000.

1.0264e-37 is 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010264.

Multiply them together:

8,988,000,000 * 1.0264e-37 = let's compute the exponent first. 1e9 * 1e-37 = 1e-28.

So, 8.988 * 1.0264 = approximately 9.225.

So, 9.225e-28.

Divide by 2 (because r is 2 meters): 4.6125e-28 per pair.

Multiply by 12: 55.35e-28 = 5.535e-27.

So, this is 5.535 x 10^-27 J.

Looking at the options, none match this exactly. The closest is option C: 7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor somewhere. Let me think again about the formula.

Wait, each charge is 2e, so each pair between the 13th and the other 12 contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = k*(4e²)/(2m) = (2 k e²)/m.

So, 12 pairs: 12 * (2 k e²)/m = 24 k e²/m.

Wait, let me compute 24 * k * e² / m.

k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e² is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

m is 2 meters.

So,

24 * (8.988e9) * (2.566e-38) / 2.

Let me compute step by step.

First, 24 / 2 = 12.

So, 12 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 12 * 8.988e9 = 12 * 8.988e9 = 107.856e9.

Now, 107.856e9 * 2.566e-38.

Multiply 107.856 by 2.566: approx 107.856 * 2.566 ≈ let's compute:

100 * 2.566 = 256.6.

7.856 * 2.566 ≈ 7 * 2.566=17.962, 0.856 *2.566≈2.201. So sum is 17.962 +2.201=20.163.

Total approx 256.6 +20.163=276.763.

So, 276.763e (9-38) = 276.763e-29.

Which is 2.76763e-27 J.

Wait, that's about 2.77e-27 J. Hmm, but that's not matching the options either.

Wait, perhaps there was a miscalculation in the exponents. Let me do it more carefully.

Wait, 12 * 8.988e9 → 12 * 8.988e9 = (12 * 8.988) * 1e9 = 107.856 * 1e9 = 1.07856e11.

Then, multiply by 2.566e-38: 1.07856e11 * 2.566e-38 = (1.07856 * 2.566) * 1e(11-38) = 2.767e-27 J.

So, 2.767e-27 J.

Still not matching any of the options.

Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-express the potential energy.

Wait, U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m) * 12.

Which is 12 * (4 e² k ) / (2 m) ) = 12 * 2 e² k / m.

Which is 24 * e² k / m.

Wait, e² is 2.566e-38 C².

k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

m is 2 meters.

So,

24 * (2.566e-38) * (8.988e9) / 2.

Wait, 24 divided by 2 is 12.

So, 12 * 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9.

Compute 12 * 2.566e-38 = 30.792e-38 = 3.0792e-37.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 3.0792e-37 *8.988e9 = ?

3.0792e-37 *8.988e9 = (3.0792 *8.988) * 1e( -37 +9 ) = 27.66 * 1e-28 = 2.766e-27 J.

Again, about 2.766e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is expecting to only consider the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, but I'm not getting any of the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents somewhere. Let's try the calculation again.

Compute each step:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

q1 = q2 = 2e = 3.204e-19 C.

r = 2 m.

So, U_pair = (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 / 2.

(3.204e-19)^2 = (3.204)^2 * 1e-38 = 10.266e-38 = 1.0266e-37 C².

So, U_pair = (8.988e9) * (1.0266e-37) / 2.

Calculate 8.988e9 *1.0266e-37: 8.988 *1.0266 = about 9.225.

So, 9.225e(9-37) = 9.225e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.6125e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 55.35e-28 = 5.535e-27 J.

Again, same result.

Hmm. So, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J. But that's about 28% higher than my calculation. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in using the exponents.

Wait, let's compute 8.988e9 *1.0264e-37 /2.

Wait, 8.988e9 = 8.988 * 1e9.

1.0264e-37 =1.0264 * 1e-37.

Multiply together: 8.988 *1.0264 ≈ let me compute more accurately.

8 *1.0264 =8.2112.

0.988 *1.0264: let's see, 0.9*1.0264=0.92376; 0.08 *1.0264=0.082112; 0.008 *1.0264=0.0082112. Summing: 0.92376 + 0.082112 =1.005872 +0.0082112=1.0140832. So total is 8.2112 +1.0140832=9.2252832.

So, 9.2252832e(9-37) =9.2252832e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.6126416e-28.

Multiply by 12: 5.5351699e-27 J.

So, approximately 5.535e-27 J.

Hmm. None of the options match this. Could the problem be expecting the absolute value? No, because all energies are positive in this case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the 12 charges as being at the same point, making the mutual potential energy something else. For example, if all 12 are at the same point, then the potential energy between each pair would be U = (k*(2e)*(2e))/r, where r is zero, but that's impossible as it would lead to infinite energy. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, but the calculation is (k*(2e)*(2e))/ (2 m) multiplied by 12.

Which gives 12 * (4 e² k) / (2 m) ) = 12*(2 e² k)/ m.

Which is 24 e² k / m.

Wait, let me compute that.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38 C².

k=8.988e9.

m=2.

So,

24 * (2.566e-38) * (8.988e9) / 2.

24 /2 =12.

So, 12 * 2.566e-38 *8.988e9.

12 * 2.566e-38 =3.0792e-37.

3.0792e-37 *8.988e9= (3.0792 *8.988 )e( -37 +9 )=27.66e-28=2.766e-27 J.

Again, same result as earlier. But the options don't have this value.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is7.056e-27, which is about 2.57 times larger than our calculated 2.766e-27. Hmm, that's a big discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m) = 12 * (k *4 e²) / (2 m) )= 24 *k e² / m.

Wait, k is 8.988e9, e² is2.566e-38, m is 2.

So,

24 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38 / 2.

24 /2 =12.

12 *8.988e9 =1.07856e11.

1.07856e11 *2.566e-38 = (1.07856 *2.566) *1e(11-38) =2.767e-27 J.

Same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects to include the potential energy from the mutual interactions between the 12 charges. But without their mutual distances, I can't compute that. So, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore that, and the intended answer is 5.5e-27 J, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is at a distance of 2 meters from P, and their mutual distance is 2 meters as well. That is, each charge is at the same point, but that's impossible due to their mutual repulsion. Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular pattern where each is 2 meters from P and approximately 2 meters from each other. But without knowing the exact number of dimensions or the arrangement, I can't compute their mutual potential energies.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have the 12 charges placed at 2 meters from P, but all at the same point, and their mutual distance is zero. But that's impossible because same charges can't be at the same point, leading to infinite potential energy. So that's not the case.

Perhaps the problem is intended to have only the 13th charge and the 12 others, but their mutual distances are considered to be non-existent, leading to no additional potential energy terms beyond the 12 terms with the 13th. But in that case, the total potential energy would be 5.5e-27 J, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let me try that.

If k is 9e9, then:

U_pair = (9e9) * (4e²) / (2 m) = (9e9) * (1.0264e-37) / 2.

9e9 *1.0264e-37 =9.2376e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.6188e-28 per pair.

Multiply by 12: 5.54256e-27 J.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different charge value. Let me check the problem again: each charge is 2e. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the energy is calculated in a different way, considering the work done to assemble all the charges.

The total potential energy U of the system can be calculated as the sum of the potential energies for each pair.

But when assembling the system, each charge is brought from infinity, and the work done is the sum over all pairs.

So, the first charge (q1) is placed at P: no work done.

The second charge (q2) is brought from infinity to 2 m from P: work done is U2 = (k q1 q2)/r.

The third charge (q3) is brought from infinity: the work done is U3 = (k q1 q3)/r + (k q2 q3)/r'.

But wait, r' is the distance between q2 and q3. If they're both at 2 m from P, the distance between them would be 4 m if diametrically opposite, or 0 if at same point (but they can't be). So, perhaps the problem is assuming that each new charge is placed such that the distance between any two charges is 4 m. But that's not a realistic assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance between any two of the 12 charges is 2 m. So, when placing the third charge, it's 2 m from each of the previously placed charges. But that's only possible if all charges are arranged in a regular polygon or something, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, and only consider their interactions with the 13th charge. So, the total potential energy is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m) )= 12 * (4e² k)/(2 m) )=24 e² k/(m).

Plugging in the numbers:

e² =2.566e-38 C².

k=8.988e9.

m=2.

So,

24 * 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 / 2.

Which is 12 * 2.566e-38 *8.988e9.

As before, this gives 2.766e-27 J.

Hmm. So, I think the correct answer is approximately 5.535e-27 J, but none of the options match this. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the 13th charge as being one of the 12, but that's not the case. The problem states that 12 are at 2 m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy when the 12 charges are at 2 m from P, but their mutual potential energy is zero? No, that's not possible because they have the same charge and repel each other, so their mutual potential energy would be positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of all pairs, but the mutual pairs are negligible. But without their contribution, the potential energy would be 5.5e-27 J, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me think again: the 13th charge is fixed, and each of the 12 is at 2 m from it. So, there are 12 pairs between the 13th and the 12. But each of the 12 charges also interacts with the others. So, the total number of pairs is 12 (from 13th) + (12 choose 2 ) = 12 +66=78 pairs.

But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute the 66 pairs. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the 12 pairs, leading to 5.5e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the potential energy to be calculated as (12 choose 2) pairs, each at 2 m from each other, in addition to the 12 pairs with the 13th charge. But that would require knowing the mutual distances. Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is 2 m from the others, making their mutual potential energy U = (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m) for each pair.

But that can't be, because if all 12 are at 2 m from each other, their mutual potential energy would be (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m) for each of the 66 pairs. But that would make the total potential energy much larger.

Wait, but I'm overcomplicating again. Without the problem's exact arrangement, I can't proceed. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute only the 12 pairs and pick the closest option, even though it doesn't match exactly.

Looking back, my calculation gives about 5.535e-27 J, which is not among the options. The closest is option C:7.056e-27 J, but that's 7.056e-27, which is about 28% higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of e. Let me check: e is 1.602 x 10^-19 C. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the energy per charge, but that doesn't make sense because all charges are identical.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to compute the potential energy in a different way, perhaps using the formula for a point charge in an electric field.

Wait, for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy is U = q * V, where V is the potential at their position due to the 13th charge.

V = k*(2e) / (2 m) )= k e / m.

So, U for each charge is (2e) * (k e / m ) = 2 k e² / m.

So, 12 charges contribute 12 * 2 k e² / m = 24 k e² / m.

Which is the same as before, leading to 2.766e-27 J.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is 28.22e-25 J. Wait, that's 28 times larger than the 1e-26 range. Hmm, not matching my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of pairs. Let me think again. The 13th charge is fixed, and each of the 12 is at 2 m from it. So, the 12 charges each contribute a pair with the 13th charge. So, 12 pairs. Is that correct?

Yes, that's correct.

So, the total potential energy is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(r), where r is 2 m.

Wait, that's 12 * (k*(4e²))/(2 m) )= 24 k e²/(m).

Which is 24 * (8.988e9) * (2.566e-38) / 2.

Wait, 24 /2 is 12.

12 *8.988e9 =1.07856e11.

1.07856e11 *2.566e-38= 2.766e-27 J.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for r. For example, r being 2 meters from each other.

Wait, but the problem states that the 12 are at 2 m from P, not from each other.

So, I'm back to square one.

Perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, maybe I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me check:

Wait, in the formula U = k q1 q2 / r.

Each pair between the 13th and others: q1=2e, q2=2e, r=2 m.

So, U_pair = (8.988e9) * (2e * 2e) / 2.

Which is (8.988e9) *4e² /2 = (8.988e9) * 2 e².

e² is (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So, U_pair = 8.988e9 * 2 *2.566e-38.

Calculate that: 8.988e9 *5.132e-38 = (8.988 *5.132) *1e(9-38) = approx 45.96e-29 =4.596e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 55.15e-28 =5.515e-27 J.

Still same as before.

Hmm.

Given that none of the options match, but the closest is option C:7.056e-27 which is higher, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy to be calculated without dividing by 2, which would make each U_pair (8.988e9 *4e²)/2 = 17.972e-28.

Multiply by 12:215.664e-28=2.156e-26 J, which is about option A:5.645e-26 is higher, but option B is 2.822e-26, which is close to 2.15e-26. Hmm, not quite.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not have divided by 2 in the U_pair calculation. Let me see:

If U_pair is (k*(2e)^2)/r, where r is 2 m.

So, U_pair = (8.988e9 *4e²)/2.

Which is (8.988e9 *4e²)/2 = (8.988e9 *4 *2.566e-38)/2.

Compute 8.988e9 *4 =3.5952e10.

3.5952e10 *2.566e-38 = 9.225e-28 (as before).

Divide by 2:4.6125e-28 per pair.

Multiply by 12:5.535e-27 J.

Still same result.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. It's possible that the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, which is approximately 7.056e-27 J, but I can't reconcile my calculation with that. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the potential energy between each pair as (k*(q1*q2))/r, but using r as 2 meters for all pairs, including the mutual ones. So, for the 12 charges, each pair is 2 meters apart. So, the mutual potential energy would be (k*(2e)^2)/2 for each pair.

So, the total mutual potential energy would be (12 choose 2) * (4e² k)/(2).

Which is 66 * (4e² k)/(2) )=66 * 2 e² k.

Which is 132 e² k.

So, adding that to the 12 pairs with the 13th charge:

Total U = 12*(4e² k)/(2) ) + 66*(4e² k)/(2).

Wait, no, because for mutual pairs, r is 2 m, so each mutual pair contributes (4e² k)/(2) =2 e² k.

So, 66 mutual pairs contribute 66 * 2 e² k =132 e² k.

And 12 pairs with the 13th contribute 12*(4e² k)/(2) =24 e² k.

So, total U =132 e² k +24 e² k =156 e² k.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

The 13th charge is fixed. The 12 charges are each at 2 m from P. So, the 12 charges each have a potential energy of (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m) with the 13th charge. So, 12 * (4e² k)/(2 m) =24 e² k/(m).

Additionally, the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is each pair contributing (k*(2e)^2)/r, where r is 2 m. So, each mutual pair contributes (4e² k)/(2) )=2 e² k.

There are (12 choose 2) =66 mutual pairs.

So, mutual U =66 * 2 e² k =132 e² k.

So, total U =24 e² k/(m) +132 e² k.

But wait, this requires knowing the value of m, which is 2 meters.

So, e² k = (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9 = approx 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 =2.307e-28.

So,

24 e² k /m =24 *2.307e-28 /2 =24 *1.1535e-28 =2.768e-27 J.

Mutual U:132 *2.307e-28 =3.049e-26 J.

Total U:2.768e-27 +3.049e-26 =3.325e-26 J.

But that's about 3.325e-26 J, which is option A:5.645e-26 is higher, option B is2.822e-26, which is close.

Wait, but according to this calculation, the total U would be approximately 3.325e-26 J, which isn't exactly any of the options. But option B is 2.822e-26, which is a bit lower.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is not as high as this because the mutual distances aren't all 2 m. For example, if the mutual distance is larger than 2 m, the mutual potential energy would be smaller. But without knowing the arrangement, I can't compute the exact value.

I think I've spent a lot of time on this, but I'm still not getting any of the options. Perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, but I can't see how to get there. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:2.822e-26 J.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mutual potential energy calculation. Let me recompute it.

Mutual U:

Each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/r = (8.988e9 *4e²)/r.

r is the distance between two of the 12 charges. But if they're arranged in a circle, the distance between two adjacent charges is not 2 m. For example, if 12 charges are equally spaced on a circle of radius 2 m, the distance between adjacent charges is 2 * 2 m * sin(π/12) ≈ 2 *2 *0.2588=1.035 m. So, the distance would be about 1.035 m. But without knowing the arrangement, I can't compute the exact distance. So, perhaps the problem is expecting to ignore the mutual terms, leading to the U of 5.5e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Given all this, I think I'll have to go with the initial approach, which gives about 5.5e-27 J, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, but I'm not sure why.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total potential energy of the system, which is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs of charges. The system consists of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( q = 2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The 13th charge is fixed at point \( P \), and the other 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \) from \( P \).

### Key Assumptions and Calculations:
1. **Potential Energy Between the 13th Charge and Each of the 12 Charges**:
   - The potential energy between two charges is given by:
     \[
     U = \frac{k \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2}{r}
     \]
     where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( q_1 = q_2 = 2e \), and \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \).
   - Substituting values:
     \[
     U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2e) \cdot (2e)}{2} = \frac{4k e^2}{2} = 2k e^2
     \]
   - Since there are 12 such pairs (one for each charge interacting with the 13th charge):
     \[
     U_{\text{total, 13th}} = 12 \cdot U_{\text{pair}} = 12 \cdot 2k e^2 = 24k e^2
     \]

2. **Mutual Potential Energy Between the 12 Charges**:
   - The problem does not specify the arrangement of the 12 charges relative to each other. Without explicit information about their mutual distances, the mutual potential energy cannot be calculated. However, if we assume the mutual distances are negligible or the problem intends to ignore them, the total potential energy is dominated by the interactions between the 12 charges and the 13th charge.

3. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - Compute \( e^2 \):
     \[
     e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
     \]
   - Substitute into \( U_{\text{total, 13th}} \):
     \[
     U_{\text{total, 13th}} = 24 \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38})
     \]
     \[
     U_{\text{total, 13th}} = 24 \cdot 2.307 \times 10^{-28} = 5.537 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value of \( 5.537 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the given options exactly. However, the closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is approximately 28% higher than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests either a difference in assumptions (e.g., mutual distances) or rounding in the problem's provided options.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the given options, the most reasonable choice is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, assuming the problem intends to approximate or simplify certain aspects of the system.
