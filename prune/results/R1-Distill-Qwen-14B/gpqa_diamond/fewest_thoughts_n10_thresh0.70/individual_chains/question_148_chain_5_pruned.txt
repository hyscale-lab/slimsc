Okay, let me try to work through this chemistry problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step. So, the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. We have five such compounds, and various reactions happen with them. The goal is to find the molecular weight range of substance A4.

First, I'll list out what each substance does. Let's go through each piece of information.

Substance A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is 20Â°C or room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, oxidizing xenon probably means it's a strong oxidizing agent. Xenon is noble gas, so if A1 is causing it to react, maybe A1 is a fluorine-containing compound that's highly oxidizing.

A2 has an oF (I think that's the oxidation state of fluorine) of 31.96%. Wait, no, oF probably stands for oxidation number. So, the oxidation state of fluorine in A2 is 31.96%. Wait, that doesn't make sense because oxidation states are in a scale where each element has a value. Oh, wait, maybe it's the percentage abundance of a certain isotope? Or perhaps it's a molar ratio or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the fluorine's oxidation state in A2 as a percentage of something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps oF refers to the oxidation state value as a number, but 31.96% seems odd. Oh, wait, perhaps the oF is the oxidation state in terms of valence. Because fluorine usually has a -1 oxidation state, but in some compounds, like when it's oxidized, it can have positive states. So maybe A2 has fluorine in a +1 or higher oxidation state.

Wait, fluorine typically has an oxidation state of -1 in most compounds. But in some cases, like when it's part of a strong oxidizing agent, it can be in a higher oxidation state. For example, in certain fluorides or when bonded to more electronegative elements. So A1, which decomposes into A2 and F2 (fluorine), might be a compound where fluorine is in a higher oxidation state than -1. So, when it decomposes, it releases F2, which is elemental fluorine.

Wait, but F2 is the elemental form, so in A1, fluorine is perhaps in a higher oxidation state than in A2. Let me think: When A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and F2 gas. That means A1 has fluorine in a higher oxidation state than F2. Because F2 is in 0 oxidation state. So, if A1 is decomposing into A2 and F2, then fluorine in A1 is being reduced. So A1 is likely a strong oxidizing agent, with fluorine in a higher oxidation state than in A2.

So, perhaps A1 is something like YF4 (if Y is a less electronegative element) that decomposes into YF2 and F2. Wait, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe A1 is a compound where Y is in a higher oxidation state, and upon decomposition, it releases F2 and forms a compound with lower oxidation state Y.

Wait, but let me think about the reactions. A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, so it's inert, but under certain conditions can form compounds. So if A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, perhaps it's a fluorine-based compound that can oxidize Xe. For example, maybe XeF6 is a product, but that's the other way around. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a compound like ClF3 (but Y isn't Cl here; Y is another element). So maybe Y is an element that forms multiple binary fluorides.

The five binary compounds of Y and fluorine are known
