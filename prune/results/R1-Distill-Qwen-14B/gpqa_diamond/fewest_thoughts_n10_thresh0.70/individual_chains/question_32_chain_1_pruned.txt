Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, the question is asking for the energy when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Oh wait, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think about what that means.

Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium has an atomic number of 3. So if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6. Got it.

RHIC collides heavy ions, right? So each ion is accelerated to a certain energy. The question is about finding the kinetic energy or the total energy? Hmm, I think in these contexts, when it mentions the energy of the collider, it's referring to the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy. Wait, but sometimes in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, it's the kinetic energy. I'm a bit confused about that. Oh, wait, no, usually for colliders, the energy given is the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy?

Wait, let's clarify: the energy of a particle in relativity is given by gamma times m c squared, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy is gamma mc². But when you're talking about the energy in a collider, I think it's the kinetic energy that's provided. Or is it the total energy? Hmm, this is a bit tricky.

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I think they're asking for the kinetic energy because the speed is given, and the question is about the energy required to reach that speed.

Wait, but sometimes when you calculate the energy for a given speed, you have to compute the kinetic energy, which is (gamma - 1) mc². So perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.
2. Calculate
