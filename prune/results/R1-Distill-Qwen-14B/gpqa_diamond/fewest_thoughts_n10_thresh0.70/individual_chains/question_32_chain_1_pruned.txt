Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and determining the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, and in this case, the nucleus is X, which they said is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, so Li is lithium, right? The common isotope is Li-7, which has 3 neutrons. So X is a Li-7 nucleus.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Oh right, that's 96% the speed of light. I think this is a relativistic problem because the speed is a significant fraction of c. So I should use relativistic equations, not classical ones.

First, I need to find the energy of the nucleus. I'm pretty sure the total energy in relativity is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor. So the formula would be E = gamma * m0 * c². But wait, since we're dealing with units where c is involved, maybe I can just calculate gamma and then multiply by the rest mass energy.

So to find gamma, the Lorentz factor, the formula is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Given that v is 0.96c, so let's plug that in.

Calculating gamma: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let me compute that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. Subtract that from 1, which gives 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, but let me do that more accurately. 0.96^2 is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 which is 3.571428... approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but I should maybe compute that more precisely. Let me recalculate. 0.96 is v/c, so v = 0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... So gamma is 3.5714 approximately.

But wait, sometimes more precise calculations are needed. Let me compute the square root of 0.0784 again. Hmm, 0.28^2 = 0.0784 exactly? Let me see: 0.28 * 0.28
