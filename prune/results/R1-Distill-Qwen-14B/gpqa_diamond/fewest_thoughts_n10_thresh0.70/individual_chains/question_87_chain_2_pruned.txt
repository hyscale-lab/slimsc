Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR spectroscopy. Let me read through the question carefully.

So, the problem says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to figure out the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm, let's break this down. A di-substituted benzene ring means there are two substituents on the ring. The ring is six-membered, so that's the benzene ring part. But the total carbon count is 8, including the ring. So, let's see, the benzene has six carbons, but wait, if it's di-substituted, that would add two more groups, but each substituent might have more than one carbon. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the ring itself is 6 carbons, and the substituents add up to 2 more, making 8 in total. So each substituent is probably one carbon each? Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is one, but that might complicate things.

Wait, FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O), which is either aldehyde, ketone, ester, etc. Also, an aromatic-halogen bond, so the substituents must include a halogen (like Cl, Br, I) and a carbonyl group.

Wait, but wait. The question says the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene ring. So, it's an aromatic compound with two substituents: one is a halogen (since the IR shows aromatic-halogen), and the other is a carbonyl-containing group.

But wait, the carbonyl group could be part of another substituent. So, let's think about possible structures.

Possible substituents could be, for example, a halogen (Cl, Br) and an acyl group (like an acetyl group, COCH3). Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl group as part of another substituent, like a ketone attached via a single bond.

Wait, but the substituents could vary. Let's think about possible structures.

Wait, the molecular formula might help, but it's not given here. But the
