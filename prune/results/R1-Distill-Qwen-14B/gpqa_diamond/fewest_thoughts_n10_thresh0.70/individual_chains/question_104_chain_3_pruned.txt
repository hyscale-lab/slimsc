Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's motion towards or away from us.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, same star masses and similar planet masses—probably the same method applies for both.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, the question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. So, the orbital period ratio is P2/P1, and we need to find that.

I think the RV method relates the velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the Doppler shift. The formula for the semi-amplitude is K = (v*sin i) which is related to the Doppler shift. But wait, the Doppler shift would be proportional to the velocity. Since the same spectral line is being observed, the shift in wavelength (Δλ) relates to the velocity via the Doppler formula.

The Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ = v/c, where c is the speed of light. So, the velocity v is (Δλ/λ) * c. But wait, since both shifts are given in milliangstroms, and assuming the same λ for both (since it's the same spectral line), the ratio of velocities would be the same as the ratio of the shifts.

So, Planet #1 has a shift of 5, Planet #2 has 7. So v2 = (7/5) * v1. But wait, wait, no, because the Doppler shift is inversely related to the period. But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K. K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. But how?

The formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 AU)^ (1/3) ) * (1/(1 year)) )
