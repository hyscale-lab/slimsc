Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying compound E through a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are a few hints and reaction steps given, so I'll need to break them down one by one.

First, let me list out the given information:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

Additional hints:
a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) IR spectra: A has a peak around 1750 cm^-1, E around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are A to D, each a cyclic ketone.

Hmm, IR peaks around 1750 suggest a carbonyl group, probably a ketone since that's a common peak region. Then, E has a peak at 1715, which is a bit lower but still in the ketone range. Alternatively, maybe an ester or something else, but since options are ketones, probably E is a ketone too.

Let me think about each reaction step.

1. A + HCN → B. HCN addition to a carbonyl group typically gives a cyanohydrin. So if A is a ketone, B would be a ketone cyanohydrin. Wait, but when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent. So B would be a secondary alcohol with a CN group attached.

Wait, but the next step is the reduction of B to C. So with H2 and Pd, which is hydrogenation. If B has a nitrile group, hydrogenation would reduce it. Nitriles reduce to amines, but wait, under H2 and Pd, perhaps it's a hydrogenation of a triple bond? No, wait, nitriles under hydrogenation would become amines. Alternatively, maybe there's a carbonyl in B as well.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Suppose A is a cyclic ketone. HCN addition would form a cyanohydrin, which would have an alcohol and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon. So, the structure would be, for example, cyclohexanone + HCN → cyanohydrin (cyclohexyl with OH and CN groups on adjacent carbons? Wait, no, the cyanohydrin forms on the same carbon as the carbonyl. So the carbonyl O is replaced by a -C(OH
