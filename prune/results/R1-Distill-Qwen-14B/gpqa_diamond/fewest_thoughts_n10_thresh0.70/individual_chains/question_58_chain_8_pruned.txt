Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure out which one never needs regularization. Let me think.

Regularization... I remember it has to do with dealing with infinities in calculations, like in quantum field theory. It's a way to make sense of divergent integrals or terms that blow up. The idea is to introduce a cutoff or some other method to make the math work, then remove the cutoff in the end. So which theories do this?

Option A is Superstring Theory. Strings are those tiny loops, right? I think string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity and it's supposed to be finite. Wait, does it require regularization? Or does it somehow avoid the infinities that other quantum field theories have? Because in string theory, maybe the higher-order terms don't produce the same kinds of divergences. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think string theories are said to be perturbatively finite, meaning they don't have the same divergences as, say, QED or QCD. So maybe they don't need regularization as much.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD deals with the strong force. I know that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, which means quarks behave more freely at high energies. But wait, when it comes to regularization, I think QCD does require it. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get infinities. So you need techniques like dimensional regularization or lattice regularization to handle that. So B probably requires regularization.
