Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so it's a classic acid-base titration problem.

First, let me read the problem again. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which we dilute with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. We're supposed to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with pairs of pH values.

Wait, I need to figure out what the initial concentration of the acetic acid is after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) can be calculated as Molarity × Volume. The volume in liters would be 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³, the new volume is 40 cm³, so the new concentration is moles / new volume. That's 0.001 / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is CH3COOH + OH⁻ → CH3COO⁻ + H2O. So at the equivalence point, all the acetic acid will have been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO⁻).

But the question also asks about the pH at 25% titration. That means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. Let me calculate how much that is.

First, let's find out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point. The moles of NaOH needed would be equal to the moles of acetic acid. Moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

25% titration would mean using 25% of that volume, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So how many moles of NaOH is that? 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, 0.00025 moles of acetic acid will be neutralized, and the same amount of acetate ion will be formed.

Wait, but the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.001. After 25% titration, 0.00025 moles have reacted. So the remaining unreacted acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of acetate ion formed would be 0.00025 moles. So now, this is a buffer solution because we have both the weak acid and its conjugate base.

To find the pH at this point, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]). The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Given Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/1.85e-5) = approximately 4.74 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733). So pKa is about 4.73.

So plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = 4.73 + log(0.00025 / 0.00075). Let's compute the ratio: 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333. The log of 0.333 is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, which is about 4.25. That's close to option A, which says 4.26, but wait, let me check the options.

Looking at option A: 4.26; 8.52. Hmm, but what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. The solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic.

So the pH at equivalence is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions. The concentration of acetate can be calculated. The moles at equivalence are 0.001 moles, and the total volume is the initial diluted volume (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (10 cm³), which is 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻. The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻]. Since the initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M, and the change is x for [OH⁻], the expression is x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, because x is very small.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 ≈ 1.081e-11. Taking square root, x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M. So [OH⁻] ≈ 3.288e-6 M. pH is 14 - pOH,
