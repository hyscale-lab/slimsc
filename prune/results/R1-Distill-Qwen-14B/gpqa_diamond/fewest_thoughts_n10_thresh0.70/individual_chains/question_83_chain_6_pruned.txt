Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

Alright, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I have to calculate both values and pick the correct pair.

First, I think I should find the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you mix solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we're adding 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. 

So the initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume. Oh wait, but the volume has to be in liters. Oh right, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. 

After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles/volume. That's 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, no, wait. Because when you mix equal volumes with a weak acid and water, the concentration halves. Oh right, since 20 mL to 40 mL, so 0.05 M becomes 0.025 M. Right, that's correct.

Now, the titration with NaOH. The NaOH is 0.1 M. At 25% titration, I think that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. 

First, let me find the equivalence point. Because the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So I need to calculate how much NaOH is needed for that.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the concentration becomes 0.025 M, but the moles stay the same because we're not adding more acetic acid, just diluting it. So moles of acetic acid are still 0.001 mol.

At equivalence point, all of that acetic acid would have reacted with NaOH. So moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 mol, because the reaction is 1:1 between acetic acid and NaOH. 

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. 

Wait, but when the question says 25% titration, that's 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, now, I think I should calculate how much of the acetic acid has been neutralized at 25% titration. Since the equivalence requires 10 cm³, 25% is 2.5 cm³. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. 

So in the reaction, each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, producing a mole of acetate ion. So the moles of acetic acid neutralized are 0.00025 mol. 

So the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. After neutralization, remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate ion produced are 0.00025 mol. 

But wait, the solution after adding the NaOH will have a new volume. Let me think: the diluted acetic acid solution was 40 cm³ (20 + 20). Then adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[Acetic acid] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M

[Acetate] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.0058824 M

Now, I can
