Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about selecting the suitable reagents for two reactions. I need to figure out what reagents A and B are for each step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction uses the product from the first and reagent B (along with H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, okay. So let me break this down.

First Reaction: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide, which is a nucleophile. So this seems like a nucleophilic addition reaction to the ketone.

Wait, but in the product, there's a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. Oh! So the ketone is reacting with cyanide. I remember that when a ketone reacts with HCN (or NaCN since it's a source of CN-), it undergoes addition. But in this case, the product is a nitrile and a hydroxyl group. Hmm, maybe after the addition, something happens to the product.

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be (CH3)C(OH)CN, I suppose. Wait, no, wait. Let me write the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If we add CN- to the carbonyl, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, but that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, no: in the addition, the cyanide would add to the carbonyl, giving (CH3)2C(OH)CN—no, wait, the addition of HCN to a ketone gives a cyanohydrin. Right, the cyanohydrin formation. So the product would be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached.

So, the first step is forming a cyanohydrin. Now, what reagents are involved in that? NaCN is providing the CN- nucleophile, but the reaction also requires an acid catalyst, I think. Because forming the cyanohydrin typically happens under acidic conditions. So H3O+ (protonated) is used as a catalyst. Because the carbony
