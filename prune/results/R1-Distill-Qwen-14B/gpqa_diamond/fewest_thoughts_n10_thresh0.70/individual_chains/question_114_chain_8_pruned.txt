Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone like that reacts with CN- (from NaCN), I think it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, typically, the nucleophilic addition to ketones gives a cyanohydrin. So the product would be a diol where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by an OH and a CN group, but wait, in this case, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see the structure.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, so the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structure. The butanenitrile part would be CH2CH2CN, but this is 2-hydroxy-2-methyl. So the structure is (CH(CH3)(OH))CH2CN? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you add NaCN, the cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile. The addition would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Oh, because butanenitrile is four carbons, but here the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, that's (CH3)2C(OH)-CN. So the formula would be C4H7NO, but more importantly, the structure is correct.

So the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The reagent A here is probably an acid catalyst. Because usually, adding a strong acid like H3O+ or H2SO4 would help in the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic so the CN- can attack. So in the first step, A is probably H3O+ or something acidic.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. What's that used for? Oh, sodium bisulfite is used in the hydroboration reaction, maybe in the oxidation state? Or in some other reactions like with aldehydes and ketones for the formation of bisulfite adducts. But for cyanohydrin formation, I think it's usually done under acidic conditions. So A is probably H3O+.

So in the first reaction, A is H3O+. So options A and B are possibilities.

Now the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-h
