Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about paramagnetic coupling and the hydrogen atom's transition energy. Hmm. Let me try to break it down. 

The question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The setup is a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and m is small. B is 1 Tesla. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is the Balmer series wavelength for the hydrogen atom, maybe the H-alpha line or something like that.

Wait, right, the Balmer series is the transition from n=3 to n=2, and the wavelength 0.4861 micrometers is about that. Oh wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nanometers, which is visible light, red I think. Yeah, that's the H-alpha emission line. So the energy difference ΔE corresponds to that.

First, I need to find the energy of the hydrogen transition. I remember the Rydberg formula relates the wavelength to the energy levels. The formula is 1/λ = R*(1/n1² - 1/n2²), where R is the Rydberg constant, approximately 1.097e4 m^-1. Wait, actually, I think more accurately it's 1.097373e4 m^-1.

In the Balmer series, n1 is 2 and n2 is higher. Wait, wait, no. For the transition that emits light in the Balmer series, the electron moves from a higher energy level (like n=3) to n=2. So n1 would be 2 and n2 is 3. Let me get that right.

So, plugging in the numbers: 1/λ = R*(1/2² - 1/3²). Let me compute that. 1/4 is 0.25, and 1/9 is about 0.1111. Subtracting gives 0.1389. Multiply by R: 1.097e4 * 0.1389 ≈ 1.542e3 m^-1. Then λ is 1/(1.542e3) ≈ 6.49e-4 meters. Wait, but wait the given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 4.861e-7 meters. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong here.

Wait wait, no. Because the calculation I just did gives 1/(1.542e3) ≈ 6.49e-4 m, which is 649 nm, but that's in the red part as well. Oh wait, perhaps the transition is from n=4 to n=2? Let me check. So 1/λ = R*(1/2² -1/4²) = R*(1/4 -1/16) = R*(3/16) = 1.097e4 * 0.1875 ≈ 2020 m^-1. So λ is 1/2020
