Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The cavity isn't at the center because the center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's smaller than R, the radius of the conductor. 

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, and the angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. For instance, in electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor is zero. Also, charges in a conductor reside on the surface. But wait, this conductor is uncharged initially. So when we place a charge inside the cavity, how does that affect things?

Oh right, there's something called the method of images or the concept of induced charges. When a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces opposite charges on the inner surface and then the same type of charge on the outer surface. But wait, since the conductor was initially neutral, the inner surface must have an induced -q charge, and the outer surface would have +q to balance. But wait, no—wait, I think the conductor is initially neutral. So when +q is placed inside, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) will have an induced -q charge. Because the conductor was uncharged, the outer surface must then have a +q charge as well, because the total charge has to be zero? Wait, no, because the conductor as a whole is neutral. Wait, no, the conductor was uncharged, so the total charge is zero. So if +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (inside the cavity) must have -q induced. Then the outer surface must have +q, but wait, that would make the total charge +q, which contradicts the conductor being neutral. Oh wait, no, the conductor is neutral, so the total charge on the conductor must be zero. So if +q is inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. But wait, that would make the total charge of the conductor (-q + q) = 0, which matches. So yes, the conductor's outer surface has +q.

But wait, the problem says the conductor is uncharged, so the induced charges must sum to zero. So inner surface: -q, outer surface: +q. So the outer surface's charge is +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so its distance from the conductor's center is L, which is larger than R. So when we're outside a conductor, the electric field behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So for a point outside a spherical conductor, the field is the same as if the charge were a point charge at the center.

So, the field at point P would be due to the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is +q. So the electric field E at P is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Wait, but that's assuming the charge is at the center. But wait, in this setup, the charge inside the cavity is off-center, but the conductor's outer surface charge induces a symmetrical distribution, or does it?

Wait, no. The position of the charge inside the cavity affects the inner surface's charge distribution. The inner surface's induced charge would be a dipole or something else if the charge is off-center. Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface must be spherical, meaning the outer charge distribution is uniform?

Wait, no, that's only if the inner charge is symmetric. If the inner charge is not at the center, would the outer surface's charge distribution be non-uniform? Hmm. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think.

In a spherical conductor with a cavity, if a charge is placed asymmetrically inside the cavity, the inner surface will have an induced charge that's also asymmetric. But the outer surface, being a sphere, would still have a uniform charge distribution because there's no external field influencing it (assuming it's isolated). Wait, no, because the inner induced charge creates an electric field that, in the conductor, must be zero. So the fields inside the conductor must cancel out. So the induced charge on the outer surface must arrange itself in such a way that the net field inside the conductor is zero.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Another approach: the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within, as if it were a point charge at the center. So even if the charges inside are asymmetric, the outer field is as if all the charge is at the center. So in this case, the outer surface has a charge of +q, so the field outside would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So that would correspond to option B.

But wait, the point P's distance from the cavity's center is l, and the centers are separated by s. The angle between l and s is theta. So would that affect the field at point P?

Hmm, maybe not, because from the outside, the conductor's field is as if all charge is at the center. So regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is placed, the outer field is as if it's at the center.

Wait, but in the problem, the conductor is uncharged. When we introduced +q inside the cavity, the inner surface induced -q, and the outer surface +q. So the total charge of the conductor is 0 (the conductor's original charge) plus +q (outer) minus q (inner) which is zero. So the conductor's outer surface has +q, and the inner surface has -q.

So, at point P outside, the field is due to the +q on the outer surface. So it's as if a point charge +q is at the center of the conductor.

So the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Which matches option B.

Wait, but the other options involve l and s, which are the positions of the point relative to the cavity. But if the field outside depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center, then options involving l and s would not be correct. So option B is the answer.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Due to the conductor's neutrality, an equal positive charge $+q$ appears on the outer surface.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. This is a consequence of the symmetry of the conductor and the fact that the induced charges on the outer surface distribute uniformly.

3. **Field at Point $P$**: Since the outer surface of the conductor has a total charge of $+q$, the electric field at point $P$ (which is outside the conductor) is determined by treating the charge as if it were located at the center of the conductor. The magnitude of the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$.

4. **Irrelevance of $l$, $s$, and $\theta$**: The distances $l$ (distance from $P$ to the cavity's center) and $s$ (separation between the centers of the conductor and the cavity) and the angle $\theta$ do not affect the electric field at $P$ because the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge of the conductor and the distance $L$ from its center.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
