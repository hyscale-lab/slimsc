Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: Consider the annihilation process p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A−. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Hmm, right. So, annihilation processes often involve converting matter and antimatter into other particles. In this case, a proton and antiproton annihilate into two A+ and two A− particles. 

Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. That probably means its kinetic energy is low, so maybe we can approximate its energy as just its rest energy plus a small bit. But I'm not sure yet.

I remember that in high-energy physics, when dealing with reactions, conservation laws are key—specifically conservation of energy and momentum. Since this is an annihilation process, I think both energy and momentum must be conserved.

But wait, the antiproton and proton are colliding. If the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the proton is at rest? Or is the setup such that the antiproton is moving, but slowly, so its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy?

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving". So, maybe its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest energy. So, perhaps I can approximate its total energy as just m_p c², where m_p is the proton mass. But wait, the proton and antiproton have the same mass, so m_p c² is their rest energy.

Wait, but I think the proton is moving in some direction, but since it's an annihilation, I need to consider the frame of reference. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the center-of-momentum frame. Because in particle physics, when dealing with annihilation, the center-of-mass frame is often used.

Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe in the lab frame, the antiproton is moving, and the proton is at rest. Or perhaps the opposite?

Wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antipro
