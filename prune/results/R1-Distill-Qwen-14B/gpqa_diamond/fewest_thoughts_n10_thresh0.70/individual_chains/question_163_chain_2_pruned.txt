Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, we need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each giving a volume and a pH.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, so it's a base. When it reacts with a strong acid, like HCl or H2SO4 perhaps, it should undergo a neutralization reaction. The acid would donate protons (H+ ions) which would react with the hydroxide ions (OH-) from Fe(OH)3.

The reaction should be something like:
Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O

Wait, right, because Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 will require three moles of H+ ions to completely dissolve.

So first, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 are present in 0.1 grams.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So each OH3 group is (16 + 3*1) =19 g/mol. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*19 = let's calculate. 3*19 is 57, plus 55.85 is 112.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 112.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000886 moles. Let me check that calculation: 0.1 / 112.85 equals approximately 0.000886 mol.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ for dissolution. So the H+ needed is 0.000886 *3 = 0.002658 moles.

But wait, the acid provided is 0.1 M. So the volume (V) needed can be found using the formula:

n = M * V → V = n / M.

So V = 0.002658 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02658 liters, which is 26.58 cm³. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have 26.6 or anything like that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:
A) 32.14
B)30.09
C)28.05
D)20.40

Wait, none of them is 26.58. That's confusing. Did I make a mistake?

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and doesn't completely dissolve? No, the question says 'dissolve' and mentions using a strong acid, so I think it's a complete neutralization.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the molar mass. Let me double-check that.

Fe is 55.845 g/mol.
