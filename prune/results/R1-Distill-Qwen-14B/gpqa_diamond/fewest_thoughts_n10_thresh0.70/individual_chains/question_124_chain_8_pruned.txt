Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it again.

The question is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector's radius is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, I remember that the Lorentz factor (gamma) is related to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. Since these particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame will be longer than their proper lifetime due to time dilation. The number of particles that reach the detector's walls probably depends on how much their lifetime is extended, allowing them more time to travel before decaying.

Wait, so if one third reach the walls at gamma=20, then when gamma increases, more particles would reach the walls because they live longer. Because if gamma is higher, the lifetime is longer, so the particles have more time to move further before decaying. So for two-thirds to reach, gamma must be higher than 20. Looking at the options, the possible answers are 54, 68, 40, 28. So the answer should be higher than 20, which all are except perhaps option D (28) but wait, 28 is higher than 20. Wait, no, 28 is higher, but the initial is gamma=20. So perhaps the answer is B (68), but I'm not sure. Let me think more.

The key is probably to calculate the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector's walls and compare that to their mean lifetime. The particles are produced at the center, so the distance they need to travel is the radius, which is 30 meters. But wait, wait, noâ€”wait, the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, which for gamma around 20, their speed is very close to the speed of light. So the time to reach the walls is approximately distance divided by speed. Since speed is close to c, let me approximate it as c
