Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles and a detector. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure this out. Let me read it again.

The question says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced, and these travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, they're asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Wait, okay. So I need to find the Lorentz factor that would make two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's walls instead of one-third.

I remember that the Lorentz factor, gamma, is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But I'm not sure how that plays into the particles reaching the detector.

Oh wait, maybe it's about the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector. If they're moving at a high speed, their lifetime would be dilated due to time dilation. So the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) is tau, and the observed lifetime is gamma * tau. 

But wait, the particles are fast-decaying, so if their lifetime is longer (due to higher gamma), they have a better chance to reach the detector walls. Because they live longer, they can travel a longer distance before decaying.

So the problem must relate the fraction of particles reaching the detector to their speed (or gamma). Let me think.

The initial scenario: with gamma of 20, 1/3 reach the inner walls. So the radius is 30 meters. I need to find the gamma where 2/3 reach the walls.

I think the fraction depends on the ratio of the distance the particle travels before decaying to the detector's radius. If the particle's lifetime is longer (higher gamma), more will reach the detector.

Wait, but how do you model the decay? The number of particles that decay before reaching the detector would follow an exponential decay law. So the probability that a particle survives to reach the detector is e^(-t/tau), where t is the time it would take to travel the radius, and tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, no, more accurately, the time experienced by the particle is different
