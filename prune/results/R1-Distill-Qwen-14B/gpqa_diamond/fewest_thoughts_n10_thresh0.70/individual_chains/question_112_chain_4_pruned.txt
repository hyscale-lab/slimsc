Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let's read through it again and try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question involves an electron state described by |alpha>, and some operator whose matrix elements are given. The goal is to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate and the average value of the operator.

Alright, let's start by understanding the given state. The state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Since it's proportional, I'll need to normalize it first. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors should be normalized to 1 in magnitude.

Wait, so |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I know are the standard spin-up and spin-down states. So, the state |alpha> is a linear combination of these two. But since it's proportional, I need to compute the normalization factor.

The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2-i) for |down>. The normalization condition is the sum of the squared magnitudes of these coefficients. So the magnitude squared of (1+i) is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 =2. Similarly, the magnitude squared of (2-i) is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4+1=5. So the sum is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the operator's matrix representation is given. The elements A_ij are hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, but what are the basis states here? Since the operator is acting on the spin space, which is two-dimensional, the matrix will be 2x2. So the operator in the basis {|up>, |down>} has A12 = A21 = hbar/2, and A11=0, A22=0. So the matrix is:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Hmm, that's interesting. This looks like an operator that's a multiple of the Pauli X matrix. Because the Paul
