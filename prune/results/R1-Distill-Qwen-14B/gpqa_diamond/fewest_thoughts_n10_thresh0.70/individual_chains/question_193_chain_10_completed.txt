Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx is small, the star is far away.

Wait, the formula given is N ∝ 1/plx^5. So N is the number of stars. Let me write that as N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. But wait, I need to relate this to distance because the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance.

Since parallax plx is 1/distance (d) in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d. That means d = 1/plx. Oh wait, but the formula is 1/plx^5. So substituting d into that, 1/plx^5 is (d)^5. Because plx is 1/d, so plx^5 is (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5, so 1/(plx^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because when d increases, more stars are farther away, but does the number increase or decrease? Wait, the formula N = k * d^5. So as d increases, N increases. But wait, I'm a bit confused because usually the number of stars you can see increases with volume, which is proportional to d^3. Hmm.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, then 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But how does the number of stars change with distance? The question is asking about per unit range of distance r. Does that mean the rate of change, like the derivative of N with respect to r?

Wait, let me read the question again. "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So, it's about the change in the number of stars with distance, in terms of how N varies as r changes. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the variation is N ∝ d^5. So when you increase d by a small amount, how does N change?

Wait, but the options are given as functions of r, so maybe I'm getting confused with the variables. Wait, in the problem statement, r is used as "per unit range of distance, r." So perhaps r is the distance variable. So the number of stars N is proportional to r^5, so the change with distance is that N increases as r^5. So the answer would be option B) ~ r^5.

Wait, but why isn't it related to volume? Because normally, the number of stars you can observe within a certain distance increases with volume, which is r^3. So why is this different?

Ah, wait, maybe the original relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let me think again. Since plx = 1/r, then 1/plx^5 is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. That's option B.

But wait, why would the number of stars grow so rapidly with distance? I thought it was more about the volume. Oh, but perhaps this is a specific region where the density of stars isn't uniform. Wait, maybe the question is assuming a certain distribution of stars. Oh, wait, maybe the number of stars in a region isn't just a volume effect but depends on how the stars are distributed.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is that the number of stars is inversely proportional to the fifth power of parallax. So N = k * (1/plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, then N = k * r^5. So the number of stars in the region is proportional to r^5. So when the distance r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5.

So the correct option is B, which is ~ r^5.


The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, \( N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} \), which simplifies to \( N \propto r^5 \).

This means the number of stars in the region increases with the fifth power of distance. The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, \( r \)), and the correct interpretation is that \( N \) is proportional to \( r^5 \). Thus, the number of stars grows rapidly with distance in this specific scenario.

The correct answer is:

Answer: B
