Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 200 mL or 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C. We're asked to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- or PO4^3-?) Wait, wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it dissociates, it forms H2PO4^- (which is dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and PO4^3- (orthophosphate). Wait no, I think orthophosphate is actually H3PO4. Hmm, but in solution, it dissociates into these ions. So the question is about the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, which I believe is PO4^3-? Or wait, sometimes orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- form. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, H3PO4 is the fully protonated form. It can lose a proton to become H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), then lose another to become HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and then lose another to become PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, sometimes the term orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- ion. Hmm, I'll have to look that up, but since this is a thought process, I'll proceed as if the problem is asking for PO4^3-.

Wait, no, actually, another way: the question says "orthophosphate ions." Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, I think. Because when you have NaH2PO4, that's dihydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4 is hydrogen phosphate. So orthophosphate would be the HPO4^2- ion. So that's what the question is asking about.

So the solution has these two salts. Let me think about what each salt dissociates into.

KH2PO4 (potassium dihydrogen phosphate) dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions.

Na2HPO4·2H2O (sodium hydrogen phosphate) dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, plus the water of crystallization, but water doesn't affect the ions in solution.

So the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. That's interesting because both are phosphate species.

Wait, so the solution is a buffer solution of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-? Because they are adjacent in the dissociation steps of H3PO4.

So the problem is, when you mix these two, you can consider the solution as a buffer between the first and second dissociation steps. Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: "What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution?"

I think in this context, orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2- because that's the hydrogen phosphate ion, and PO4^3- is the orthophosphate ion. Wait, no, I might have that backwards. Let me think: H3PO4 is phosphoric acid. When it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), then PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So orthophosphate is PO4^3-.

Wait, but then why are the given salts KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O? So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait a second, but then if the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, what is the concentration of PO4^3-? Because PO4^3- is formed when HPO4^2- loses a proton.

But in solution, the HPO4^2- is in equilibrium with H2PO4^- through the second dissociation constant, and with PO4^3- through the third dissociation. So the PO4^3- concentration would be minimal, but the question is about orthophosphate, which I thought was PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps I should proceed.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- ions. Because in the solution, the primary ions are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

Now, the approach would be to calculate the initial moles of each salt, then consider their dissociation, and apply the buffer equation (Henderson-Hasselbalch) using the relevant Ka value.

Wait, but let me think: the Ka values are given as Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12.

So the second dissociation is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+; Ka2 is 6.2e-8.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+; Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So the first step is to calculate the moles of each salt.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, Mw 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007344 mol.

Each mole of KH2PO4 gives 1 mole of H2PO4^-.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass 1.00 g, Mw 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005603 mol.

Each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives 1 mole of HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, we have 0.007344 mol of H2PO4^- and 0.005603 mol of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the solution volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

So concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007344 / 0.2 = 0.03672 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005603 / 0.2 = 0.028015 M.

Wait, but wait. If we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, this forms a buffer solution between the first and second dissociation steps. So the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, using the pKa2.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) ≈ 7.207.

Wait, Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the acid would be H2PO4^- (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), and the base is HPO4^2-.

Wait, no, in the second dissociation step, H2PO4^- is the acid and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base.

So the ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].

So pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, the problem isn't directly asking for pH. It's asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is PO4^3-, then that comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

So let me think: the concentration of PO4^3- depends on the third dissociation. But since the solution is buffered around the second pKa, the [PO4^3-] would be very low because Ka3 is much smaller (1.8e-12). So the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible compared to HPO4^2-.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I'm now thinking is actually HPO4^2- (since that's the ion in the solution from the given salt). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.

If the salts are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, then the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which could be HPO4^2- (as opposed to H2PO4^-). So the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028015 M, but that's before considering any reactions.

Wait, but that can't be right because the solution is a buffer. So the actual concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will depend on the pH of the solution, which is determined by the buffer.

Wait, the problem is, the concentrations aren't simply the initial amounts divided by the volume because the ions can dissociate further. But wait, in this case, the salts are already dissociated into their respective ions. So the initial concentrations are as I calculated before. But wait, the solution is a buffer solution, so the pH will be determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation using the ratio of the two ions.

But the question is not about the pH; it's about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- (the fully deprotonated form). But that would be determined by the third dissociation, which is much less significant because Ka3 is so small.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution, considering the buffer effect.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to first calculate the pH of the solution using the buffer equation, then find the concentration of HPO4^2- and PO4^3- based on that pH.

But no, the solution's pH is determined by the buffer, and the concentrations of the species are dictated by that. But the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is the HPO4^2- ion.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the concentration of PO4^3- (orthophosphate) in the solution. Because in the dissociation steps, the PO4^3- is the final product of HPO4^2- losing a proton.

But since the pH of the solution is determined by the buffer, which is around the pKa2, the concentration of PO4^3- would be determined by the third dissociation, but it would be very low.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of each salt.

2. Use these to find initial concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

3. Determine the pH of the solution using the buffer equation involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

4. Use the determined pH to find the concentration of PO4^3- via the third dissociation equation.

But wait, the problem is with step 3: the buffer equation uses H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and gives the pH. Then, using that pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3- from the HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-, in which case, the concentration is determined by the buffer solution, but that's not straightforward because the buffer affects the ratio of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but the total concentration of both would be the sum.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. The orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-, and the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- as the two salts. So the concentration of HPO4^2- is simply the moles divided by volume, but that's only accurate if there's no dissociation beyond that. But since HPO4^2- can further dissociate, the actual concentration would be less than that initial amount.

Wait, but the given salts are Na2HPO4·2H2O, which dissociates into Na+ and HPO4^2- (the 2:1 ratio, I think). So the solution already has HPO4^2- in it. So the concentration of HPO4^2- is the moles divided by the volume, but adjusted for the buffer.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is a buffer, and the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in a ratio determined by the buffer equation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the solution, the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- form a buffer, so their concentrations are determined by the ratio given by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

So, let me proceed.

First, calculate the moles:

Moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007344 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005603 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L.

So concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007344 / 0.2 = 0.03672 M.

[HPO4^2-] (initial) = 0.005603 / 0.2 = 0.028015 M.

But since these are a buffer, the pH is determined by the pKa2 of H3PO4.

pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) ≈ 7.207.

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Plugging in the concentrations:

pH = 7.207 + log(0.028015 / 0.03672).

Calculating the ratio: 0.028015 / 0.03672 ≈ 0.763.

log(0.763) ≈ -0.116.

So pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.116 ≈ 7.091.

Now, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

At pH 7.091, the concentration of H+ is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.091) ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

The expression for Ka3 is [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

We can solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But wait, [HPO4^2-] is the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution. However, in the buffer solution, the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-] is determined by the pH. But the actual concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- may not be the same as the initial concentrations because some H2PO4^- may have converted to HPO4^2- due to the buffer.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Let me denote [HPO4^2-] as 'b' and [H2PO4^-] as 'a'.

Then, from the equation, pH = pKa2 + log(b/a).

We have a = 0.03672 M, b = 0.028015 M.

But wait, that's the initial concentrations. But in reality, the buffer equation will adjust these.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the ratio and then find the concentrations.

Let me denote n as the total moles of phosphate species in solution.

n_total = 0.007344 (KH2PO4) + 0.005603 (Na2HPO4) = 0.012947 mol.

n_total = a + b, where a is [H2PO4^-], and b is [HPO4^2-].

From the buffer equation:

pH = pKa2 + log(b/a).

We have:

log(b/a) = pH - pKa2.

So, b = a * 10^(pH - pKa2).

We have:

a + b = 0.012947 mol.

Substituting b:

a + a *10^(pH - pKa2) = 0.012947.

a (1 + 10^(pH - pKa2)) ) = 0.012947.

So,

a = 0.012947 / (1 + 10^(pH - pKa2)).

Wait, but I calculated the pH earlier as approximately 7.091. Let me use that.

So,

pH = 7.091,

pKa2 =7.207.

So,

pH - pKa2 = 7.091 -7.207 = -0.116.

10^(-0.116) ≈ 0.763.

So,

a = 0.012947 / (1 + 0.763) = 0.012947 / 1.763 ≈ 0.007337 mol.

And,

b = a * 0.763 ≈ 0.007337 * 0.763 ≈ 0.005605 mol.

So the concentrations in 0.2 L:

a = 0.007337 / 0.2 ≈ 0.036685 M,

b = 0.005605 / 0.2 ≈ 0.028025 M.

So [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.028025 M.

But wait, the problem is that this is the concentration of HPO4^2- in the buffer. So if the question is asking for HPO4^2-, that's the value. But if the question is about PO4^3-, then we need to find that.

So, let's proceed to find [PO4^3-].

The third dissociation: HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

At pH 7.091, [H+] = 8.23e-8 M (as calculated before).

The expression is:

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-].

So,

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12,

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 M,

[H+] = 8.23e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028025) / 8.23e-8.

Let me compute that:

1.8e-12 * 0.028025 = 5.0445e-14.

Divide by 8.23e-8:

5.0445e-14 /8.23e-8 ≈ 6.125e-7 M.

Wait, that's approximately 6.125e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

A) 6.24x10^-7 M

B)5.48x10^-7 M 

C)2.81x10^-7 M

D)3.97x10^-7 M 

So 6.125e-7 is close to option A (6.24e-7), but a bit lower.

Wait, but maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me check the calculations again.

Let me re-calculate the [HPO4^2-] in the buffer.

Total moles of phosphate species: 0.007344 (from KH2PO4) + 0.005603 (from Na2HPO4) = 0.012947 mol.

pKa2 is 7.207.

pH is 7.091.

So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2) = 10^( -0.116 ) ≈ 0.763.

So, [HPO4^2-] = 0.763 * [H2PO4^-].

Total concentration: [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.012947 mol / 0.2 L = 0.064735 M.

Wait, wait a second! I think I made a mistake earlier. The total concentration of phosphate species is:

Total = [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-].

But [PO4^3-] is very small, so perhaps we can approximate it as negligible. So:

[H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.064735 M.

But from Henderson-Hasselbalch, [HPO4^2-] = 0.763 * [H2PO4^-].

So,

[H2PO4^-] + 0.763 [H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.064735.

1.763 [H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.064735.

[H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.064735 / 1.763 ≈ 0.03667 M.

So [HPO4^2-] = 0.763 * 0.03667 ≈ 0.02802 M.

So in solution, [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.02802 M.

Now, using the third dissociation equation:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-].

[H+] is 8.23e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02802) / 8.23e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02802 = 5.0436e-14.

Divide by 8.23e-8: 5.0436e-14 /8.23e-8 ≈ 6.125e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.125e-7 M. The closest option is A) 6.24e-7 M.

But wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations. Let me recalculate the pH more accurately.

Ka2 = 6.2e-8 → pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)).

Let me compute pKa2 accurately.

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) → log(6.2) is approximately 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076.

So pKa2 = 7.2076.

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2).

We have the moles:

n_total = 0.012947 mol.

Let me represent [H2PO4^-] as a and [HPO4^2-] as b.

Then,

a + b = 0.012947 mol.

b/a = 10^(pH - pKa2).

Wait, but I don't know pH yet. That's the problem. So perhaps I should approach it as:

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log(b/a).

But I also have a + b = 0.012947.

So, let me let log(b/a) = x.

Then,

b = a * 10^x.

So,

a + a * 10^x = 0.012947.

a (1 + 10^x) = 0.012947 → a = 0.012947 / (1 + 10^x).

But pH = pKa2 + x → x = pH - pKa2.

Wait, but I don't know pH yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can express [PO4^3-] in terms of a and b.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the buffer equation to find pH, then use that to find [PO4^3-].

Wait, earlier I approximated pH as 7.091, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can set up the equation with the exact values.

Let me try to compute pH more accurately.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:

pH = pKa2 + log( (moles of HPO4^2-) / (moles of H2PO4^-) )

Because both are in the same volume, the ratio of their concentrations is the same as the ratio of their moles.

Moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005603 mol.

Moles of H2PO4^- = 0.007344 mol.

So,

pH = 7.2076 + log(0.005603 / 0.007344).

Compute the ratio:

0.005603 / 0.007344 ≈ 0.763.

So log(0.763) ≈ -0.116.

Thus,

pH ≈ 7.2076 - 0.116 ≈7.0916.

So pH ≈7.0916.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0916) ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

Now, using the Ka3 expression:

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-].

We have:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Compute [HPO4^2-]: 0.005603 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028015 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028015) / 8.23e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028015 ≈ 5.0427e-14.

Divide by 8.23e-8:

5.0427e-14 / 8.23e-8 ≈ 6.125e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close to our calculated 6.125e-7.

But wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations.

Let me compute 0.005603 / 0.2 exactly: 0.028015 M.

[H+]=10^(-7.0916)= 8.23e-8 M.

So 1.8e-12 *0.028015 = 5.0427e-14.

5.0427e-14 /8.23e-8 = 6.125e-7.

Hmm, but let me see the options again. The options are:

A)6.24e-7,

B)5.48e-7,

C)2.81e-7,

D)3.97e-7.

So 6.125e-7 is closest to option A.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering [HPO4^2-] as 0.028015 M. Because in the buffer, some of the HPO4^2- may dissociate further into PO4^3-, but since Ka3 is so small, the change would be negligible. So our calculation should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-, but that's 0.0280 M, which is not one of the options. So the question must be asking for PO4^3-.

So the correct answer should be approximately 6.125e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7). But let me check the options again.

Wait, option A is 6.24e-7, which is 6.24 x 10^-7.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the calculation is precise.

Let me recompute [PO4^3-]:

(1.8e-12 * 0.028015) / (8.23e-8) = ?

Calculate numerator:

1.8e-12 * 0.028015 = (1.8 * 0.028015) * 1e-12 = 0.050427 * 1e-12 = 5.0427e-14.

Denominator: 8.23e-8.

So 5.0427e-14 / 8.23e-8 = (5.0427 /8.23) * 1e-6.

5.0427 /8.23 ≈ 0.6125.

So 0.6125e-6 = 6.125e-7 M.

Which is 6.125e-7, as before.

So the closest option is A)6.24e-7.

But wait, perhaps the buffer calculation is incorrect. Let me re-check the buffer approach.

Wait, perhaps the initial moles are correct. Wait, another approach: the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The total concentration of phosphate species is [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-].

But since PO4^3- is very small, we can approximate [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.03672 + 0.028015 = 0.064735 M.

But from the buffer equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

So,

[HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2).

Which we can use to find the exact concentrations.

But perhaps it's easier to calculate the exact [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and the total concentration.

Let me denote [H2PO4^-] = a, [HPO4^2-] = b.

From buffer equation:

b = a * 10^(pH - pKa2).

Total phosphate: a + b ≈ 0.064735 M.

Substituting b:

a + a *10^(pH - pKa2) = 0.064735.

a (1 + 10^(pH - pKa2)) ) = 0.064735.

But we can express pH in terms of a and b.

Wait, perhaps another approach: let me take the ratio from the buffer.

[HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2).

We can write [HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] * 10^(pH - pKa2).

Let me denote r = 10^(pH - pKa2).

Then,

[HPO4^2-] = r [H2PO4^-].

Total concentration: [H2PO4^-] (1 + r ) = 0.064735.

So,

[H2PO4^-] = 0.064735 / (1 + r).

[HPO4^2-] = 0.064735 r / (1 + r).

But we don't know r yet because r depends on pH, which depends on the buffer.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D)3.97e-7 M. But why?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering which species to use in the third dissociation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-, which is 0.0280 M. But that's not among the options. So perhaps the question is indeed about PO4^3-, which we calculated as approximately 6.125e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close. The slight difference might be due to more precise calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the buffer pH is calculated more precisely, leading to a slightly different [PO4^3-].

Wait, let me compute pH more accurately.

Ka2 =6.2e-8 → pKa2 = log(1/6.2e-8) = log(1.6129e7) ≈ 7.2076.

pH = pKa2 + log(b/a).

b =0.005603 mol, a=0.007344.

b/a =0.005603/0.007344 ≈0.763.

log(0.763) ≈-0.116.

So pH=7.2076 -0.116=7.0916.

So [H+]=10^-7.0916 = 8.23e-8.

Now, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028015 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028015) / (8.23e-8) = ?

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028015 = 5.0427e-14.

Divide by 8.23e-8: 5.0427e-14 /8.23e-8 = 6.125e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about which ion is being considered. If the problem is asking for [HPO4^2-], it would be approximately 0.028 M, which is 2.8e-2 M, but none of the options are in that range. So the question must be about PO4^3-.

Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 6.1e-7 M, which is closest to option A:6.24e-7.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and apply the relevant equilibrium expressions. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The dissociation steps of H₃PO₄ are as follows:

1. **Initial Moles of Salts**:
   - Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
     \[
     \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007344 \, \text{mol}
     \]
     This contributes 0.007344 mol of H₂PO₄⁻.
   - Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
     \[
     \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005603 \, \text{mol}
     \]
     This contributes 0.005603 mol of HPO₄²⁻.

2. **Initial Concentrations**:
   - \([H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{0.007344}{0.2} \approx 0.03672 \, \text{M}\)
   - \([HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.005603}{0.2} \approx 0.028015 \, \text{M}\)

3. **Buffer System**:
   The solution is a buffer containing H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, which correspond to the first and second dissociation steps of H₃PO₄. The relevant equilibrium constant is \(K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}\), with \(pK_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.2076\).

   Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
   \[
   \text{pH} = pK_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]}\right)
   \]
   Substituting the concentrations:
   \[
   \text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log\left(\frac{0.028015}{0.03672}\right)
   \]
   \[
   \text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log(0.763) \approx 7.2076 - 0.116 \approx 7.0916
   \]

4. **PO₄³⁻ Concentration**:
   The third dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ is:
   \[
   \text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{PO₄³⁻} + \text{H}^+
   \]
   The equilibrium constant is \(K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}\). At pH 7.0916, \([\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.0916} \approx 8.23 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\).

   Using the equilibrium expression:
   \[
   K_a3 = \frac{[\text{PO₄³⁻}][\text{H}^+]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
   \]
   Solving for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):
   \[
   [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028015)}{8.23 \times 10^{-8}}
   \]
   \[
   [\text{PO₄³⁻}] \approx \frac{5.0427 \times 10^{-14}}{8.23 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.125 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
   \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:
   The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ (\(6.125 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)) is closest to option A (\(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)).
