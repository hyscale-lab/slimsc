Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let's look at the reactions one by one.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which are nucleophiles. So, maybe this is an addition reaction.

Wait, but when you add CN- to a ketone, like in the formation of cyanohydrins. Oh right! The cyanohydrin reaction. In that case, the ketone reacts with a cyanide source, and in the presence of an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or H2SO4, it forms a cyanohydrin. The acid is needed to protonate the ketone oxygen, making it a better electrophile. So for the first step, reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+.

Looking at the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, that fits the cyanohydrin structure. The CN adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the OH (from water, I think) adds to the same carbon. So yes, the first part uses an acid catalyst, so A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The reagent is B and H2O, which gives the corresponding acid, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen? I think nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. The typical hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acidic conditions, like with HCl (concentrated), heat, and water. Or sometimes H2SO4 is used as a catalyst.

So the second reagent B must be a strong acid. Looking at the options, what are the choices for B in each option?

Option A: B is HCl.
Option B: B is CH3COOH (acetic acid).
Option C: B is HCl.
Option D: B is CH3COOH.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent is B plus H2O. So for the nitrile to acid conversion, I think HCl is a common reagent used. So if B is HCl, that makes sense.

Alternatively, sometimes you use a base, but I think in this case it's acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes when you have a nitrile adjacent to a hydroxyl group, like in the structure given, maybe the conditions could cause some elimination or other reactions. But in this case, the product is the acid, so hydrolysis is the pathway.

So for the second reaction, reagent B should be a strong acid like HCl.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: A is H3O+ (correct for first step), B is HCl (correct for second step). So that works.

Option B: B is acetic acid. I don't think acetic acid is strong enough for that hydrolysis. Maybe it works under reflux for a long time, but I'm not sure. I think HCl is more likely.

Option C: A is NaHSO3. Wait, why would that be? NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I'm trying to remember. Sodium bisulfite is often used in the reduction of carbonyl groups, like in the benzoin condensation or as a mild reducing agent. But in the first reaction, we're adding CN- to a ketone. Would NaHSO3 be involved there? I don't think so. So C's A is probably wrong.

Option D: A is NaHSO3. So not H3O+. So that would be incorrect for the first reaction.

So, focusing on options A and C for the first reaction.

Wait, first reaction: the reagents are NaCN and A. So the conditions for the cyanohydrin formation are NaCN (source of CN-) and an acid catalyst. So A must be H3O+ or another acid. So option A's A is H3O+, which is correct. Option C's A is NaHSO3, which is a source of H+ (since HSO3^- can act as H+ donor). Wait, NaHSO3 would provide H+ in solution (HSO3^- is a weak acid, so it can donate a proton). So if A is NaHSO3, then the H+ comes from that. So perhaps that's also viable.

Wait, so the first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A (which is H3O+ or NaHSO3). Let's think about the reaction.

In the cyanohydrin formation, you can use various acids as catalysts. For example, H2SO4, H3O+, or maybe even NaHSO3 if it provides enough H+.

So if NaHSO3 is present, the HSO3^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to the ketone. So in this case, using NaHSO3 as the acid would also work. That would mean in the first reaction, A could be NaHSO3. Hmm, so I'm a bit confused now.

But what about the second reaction? Let's think about that again.
