Okay, so I have this question about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. Oh right, where N is the normalization constant. N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). Right, because when you have a superposition of coherent states, the normalization comes from the inner product of the states.

The parameters here are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to compute the non-Gaussianity, which is given by the relative entropy measure, del_b. The formula is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (nG) is actually the relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state. So, the nG is the minimum of the relative entropy between rho and any Gaussian state tau. Oh, but how do I compute that?

Alternatively, since the state is a cat state, which is a superposition of coherent states, the non-Gaussianity comes from this superposition. For the relative entropy, I think the reference Gaussian state is probably the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. But wait
