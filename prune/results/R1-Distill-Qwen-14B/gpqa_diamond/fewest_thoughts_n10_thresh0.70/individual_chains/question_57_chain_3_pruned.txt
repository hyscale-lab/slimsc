Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I remember that when particles like electrons scatter off a target, especially a nuclear one, their scattering can be described using things like scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the details, so I'll try to think through it.

The problem gives me some phase shifts: δ₀ = 90 degrees, δ₁ = 67 degrees, δ₂ =55 degrees, δ₃=30 degrees, and δ₄=13 degrees. Oh, and we're told to ignore the rest beyond δ4. So I guess the higher-order phase shifts beyond l=4 are negligible and we can ignore them.

The question is asking about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I think the scattering amplitude is a complex quantity, often denoted as f(θ), and it can be written in terms of the phase shifts. Right, the formula I remember is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ - δ_l) ), summed over l from 0 to whatever.

Wait, but the problem is specifically asking about the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh, right! The incident beam direction is when the scattering angle θ is 0 degrees. So I need to evaluate the imaginary part of f(0) in this case.

Wait, when θ is 0, what's the value of sin(lθ - δ_l)? Because lθ
