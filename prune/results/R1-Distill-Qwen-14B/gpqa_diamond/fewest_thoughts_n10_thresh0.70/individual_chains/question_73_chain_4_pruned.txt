Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I'm supposed to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the speeds because of how velocities add in special relativity. Oh, right! The formula for relative velocity is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Since both are moving in the same direction, their velocities are in the same direction, so I subtract them.

So let me plug in the numbers. v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So the numerator would be 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c². Let's compute that denominator: 0.6*0.5 is 0.3, and c² cancels out. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7. What's that numerically? 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.14285... So v_rel is about 0.14c. That's one part done.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic kinetic energy, right? Or wait, no, the total energy includes their rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. Or wait, no, the total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies. Because each is moving, their energies are gamma*m*c².

So the first astronaut's energy E1 is gamma1 * m * c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for v = 0.6c, v² is 0.36c². So 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma1 is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c²? Wait wait, wait, no, wait. Because the mass is 2m. So E1 is gamma * (2m) * c²? Or is it just gamma * m * c²? Wait, the question says each mass is 2m and 3m. Oh, right! So for the first astronaut, their energy is gamma1 * (2m) * c², and the second is gamma2 * (3m) * c².

Wait, but in the options, the total energy is given as multiples of mc². So let me compute each contribution.

First, let's compute the energies.

For the first astronaut:

v = 0.6c. So beta = 0.6. gamma = 1/s
