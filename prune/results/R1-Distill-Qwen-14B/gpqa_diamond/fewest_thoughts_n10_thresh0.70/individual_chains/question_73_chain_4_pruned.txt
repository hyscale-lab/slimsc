Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics; I have to use special relativity.

The problem states that the first astronaut has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, while the second has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy.

First, I think I should tackle the relative speed part. Wait, how do you find the relative velocity between two objects moving at relativistic speeds? Oh right, you can't just subtract their speeds like v1 - v2 because that would give a speed greater than c, which is impossible. I remember there's a formula for relativistic velocity addition. Let me recall: the relative speed u is given by (u1 - u2) / (1 - (u1*u2)/c² ), but wait, wait. No, actually, if the two are moving in the same direction, then the relative speed is (u1 - u2)/(1 - (u1 u2)/(c²)). But wait, wait again. No, that formula is when you're finding the velocity of one frame from another. Wait, maybe I got it backwards. Let me think: in relativity, if you're in frame S and you see another frame S' moving at speed v, then an object in S' moving at u' would have speed u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u'v)/c²). Oh wait, that's for when S' is moving at v relative to S, and the object is moving at u' in S'. So for the relative speed between the two astronauts, perhaps I should calculate it as (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

But wait, wait a second. Wait, the problem says both astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction. So from astronaut A's perspective (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), astronaut B (3m, 0.5c) is moving at a speed relative to A. So A's speed is 0.6c, and B's speed
