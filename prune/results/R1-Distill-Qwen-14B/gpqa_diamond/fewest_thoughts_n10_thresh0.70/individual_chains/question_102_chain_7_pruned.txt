Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology constructs and why a fluorescent signal isn't showing up. Hmm, let's try to break this down. 

So the setup is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and they're looking into their developmental fate. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets making the binding site. 

They've made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes, ligand and receptor, right? The vector has two ORFs: ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Wait, I remember CBA is a strong promoter, maybe from the cytomegalovirus, used to drive expression. The receptor is after an IRES element. Oh right, IRES elements allow internal ribosome entry sites, so they can drive expression of the second gene without needing a second promoter. So in a bicistronic construct, the first gene is under a promoter, then the IRES, then the second gene.

Now, between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Hmm, loxP sites are for Cre-mediated recombination. So when Cre is present, it recognizes these sites and deletes the stop cassette, allowing the downstream genes to be expressed.

So the ligand is fused to mCherry and the receptor to eGFP. But only when Cre is present, because the stop cassettes are in between. So if Cre is active, the stop is removed, and the mCherry and eGFP would be expressed.

They raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and used them in Western blot. They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte cultures. But when they breed mice and cross them with SOX10-Cre mice, they don't see a green signal. The green would be from eGFP.

Why no green? Let's look at the options.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if the construct is in the same cell, maybe they act autocrinally. But how does that affect the expression? Not sure. The issue is about expression of the eGFP, not the function, so maybe this isn't the right reason.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, then it wouldn't get to the cell surface, and eGFP wouldn't be detected. But how would that happen? The construct includes the receptor, which is a transmembrane protein. If the eGFP is fused to it correctly, maybe issues with protein trafficking. But why in this setup? The problem is in the vector design, because if the stop is correctly removed, the eGFP should be expressed. Maybe the eGFP is in the same reading frame? Or perhaps the way the ORF is set up is causing a problem.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor is under IRES, which I think doesn't require a promoter for the second gene. So maybe the CBA promoter is sufficient for both, but perhaps in the construct, the regulatory elements for the receptor are missing. But the presence of IRES suggests that the second gene (receptor) is expressed after the first. So if the IRES isn’t working, the receptor wouldn’t be expressed. But how would that relate to the eGFP?

Option D: The
