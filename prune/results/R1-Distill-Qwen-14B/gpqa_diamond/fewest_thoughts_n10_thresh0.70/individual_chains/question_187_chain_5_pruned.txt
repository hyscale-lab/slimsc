Okay, so I have this question about the detectability of stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope. Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used for things like exoplanet detection and studying stellar velocities. The key here is determining which stars have a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel after a one-hour exposure.

The options given are a) to f), and the choices are how many are detectable. Let's go through each option.

First, I think I need to figure out the V magnitude of each star because the signal-to-noise ratio depends on the brightness of the star. The formula for S/N ratio in astronomy is something like S/N = (10^(-0.4*(m - m_zero))) / sqrt(t * X), where m is the magnitude, m_zero is some reference, and X is the exposure time or something related to noise sources. Wait, maybe the formula is simpler. Oh right, I think the formula is S/N â‰ˆ 10^(-0.4*(m - m_0)) / sqrt(t), where m_0 is the magnitude corresponding to a certain flux. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact parameters here.

Wait, looking it up in my notes: The signal-to-noise ratio for an astronomical spectrum can be approximated as S/N = (10^(-0.4 * (m - m_ref))) ) / sqrt(t), where m_ref is the reference magnitude (like the zero point of the instrument), and t is the exposure time in seconds. But I'm not sure about the exact values for ESPRESSO. Hmm.

Alternatively, I remember that the S/N per pixel depends on the star's brightness. Brighter stars (lower magnitudes) will have higher S/N. The question says at least S/N of 10. Also, the exposure time is 1 hour, which is 3600 seconds.

Let me think about each star:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a very bright star. Its V magnitude is about -0.74. That's super bright. ESPRESSO on VLT, which is a big telescope, should have no problem detecting it. The S/N should be way above 10.

b) Polaris: Polaris is a bit
