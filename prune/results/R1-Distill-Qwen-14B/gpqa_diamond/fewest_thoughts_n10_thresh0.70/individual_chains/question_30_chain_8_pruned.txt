Okay, so I've got this question here about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let's think it through.

The question states that the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. And I need to find out which color is absorbed. I remember that in chemistry, when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. Oh right, that's the whole idea behind colors and absorption spectra.

Wait, I think materials absorb certain energies and emit others based on their electron transitions. When the electron gets excited, it jumps to a higher energy level, and when it drops back, it emits a photon. The energy of that photon determines the color we see.

So the energy here is 2.3393 eV. I need to convert that to wavelength or frequency to find the color. Oh, right, energy and wavelength are related by the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.

Let me jot down the numbers. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. Speed of light c is about 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. And 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules.

So first, convert the energy from eV to joules. 2.3393 eV multiplied by 1.602e-19 J/eV. Let me calculate that:
