Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the muon's intrinsic angular momentum operator. Hmm, let's break it down. 

The question says that the Y-component of the angular momentum, Ay, is represented by a 2x2 matrix. It's given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second as (i, 0). I remember that S might be related to the Pauli matrices, but which one? Oh wait, the Pauli y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so S must be that. 

So, the operator Ay is c multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * Y, where Y is the Pauli matrix. 

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But the question is about which statement is correct regarding these calculations. Let's think about the properties of Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices (X, Y, Z) are 2x2 Hermitian matrices, but wait, no, Y is actually Hermitian? Let me check. The conjugate transpose of Y would swap the i and -i. So Y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is equal to Y*, but I think it's actually anti-Hermitian because Y† = -Y. Wait, no, let me compute:

Y† = [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Comparing to Y: [[0, -i], [i, 0]], Y† is the negative of Y. So Y† = -Y. So Y is anti-Hermitian. So Ay is c times an anti-Hermitian matrix. So the operator Ay is anti-Hermitian because c is a real constant. Anti-Hermitian means i Ay is Hermitian. 

Hmm, but eigenvalues of anti-Hermitian matrices are purely imaginary. Because for any eigenvalue a of an anti-Hermitian operator B, we have a = -a*, so a is imaginary. So Ay's eigenvalues should be imaginary. Let's see the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The imaginary parts are ±2πh
