Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see. The question is about Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the options given. 

First, let's look at the spectral data provided for Compound X. The IR and NMR data will help me figure out what the structure of Compound X is. Once I know that, I can determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Let's start with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably due to O-H or N-H stretches. But looking at the options, I don't see any amines, so maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 suggest some conjugation, maybe an aromatic ring with substituents, since those are around the C=C stretches.

Now the NMR data: 

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – a broad singlet. That's probably an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid because the broadness suggests hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm and are a triplet if coupled with adjacent protons. But a singlet is more likely an -OH.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) – these look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. The higher shift (8.0 ppm) is likely the protons ortho to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. So, if there's a substituent on the benzene ring causing deshielding, like a carbonyl group, then the ortho protons would be more downfield. So this makes me think of a benzoic acid derivative or maybe a ketone attached to benzene.

Looking at the 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) – that's probably a CH adjacent to something electronegative, maybe oxygen. Like a CH next to a carbonyl group. For example, in a ketone, the CH2 or CH group near the carbonyl would show up around here. But wait, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's a CH group connected to something else.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – perhaps CH2 groups. Maybe part of an ethyl group or similar.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a methyl group attached to something, maybe an oxygen. Like an OCH3? But wait, the d (doublet) suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Alternatively, it's a CH(CH3) group, where the methyl is attached to a CH that's next to another CH.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a terminal methyl group, probably part of an ethyl chain. Like CH2CH3.

Putting this together: The aromatic ring is para-substituted. There's a carbonyl group (from IR) attached to the ring. The NMR suggests substituents on the ring. The 10.5 ppm peak is likely a carboxylic acid -OH. So the structure might be something like a para-substituted benzoic acid with some substituents.

Wait, but let's think about the substituents. The 10.5 ppm could also be an aldehyde proton, but I don't see any aldehyde in the options. The options are either carboxylic acids or substituted benzene rings with substituents like ethyl groups or
