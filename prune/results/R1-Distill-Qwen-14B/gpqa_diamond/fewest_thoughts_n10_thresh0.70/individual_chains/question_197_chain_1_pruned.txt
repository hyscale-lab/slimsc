Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure out the final product after Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by analyzing the given spectroscopic data for Compound X. The data includes IR and 1H NMR. I remember that IR can tell me about functional groups, and NMR gives information about the structure, like the presence of aromatic rings, substituents, and possible substituent positions.

Let's look at the IR data first. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an -OH stretch or possibly an amine. But wait, I think the broadness might suggest an -OH, maybe a carboxylic acid since that's a strong, broad peak. Oh, but wait, 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that's probably a carbonyl group, like a carboxylic acid or ester or ketone. But the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are around where aromatic C=C stretching occurs, so there's an aromatic ring involved.

Now, the NMR data. Let's list the peaks:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm suggests an -OH proton, likely from a carboxylic acid. Because in carboxylic acids, the -OH is usually around 10-12 ppm and broad. So this is probably a carboxylic acid group.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is in the aromatic region. A doublet with two protons. So maybe a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Like if there's a substituent on the benzene ring, and the adjacent protons are giving this signal.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, this time lower downfield. This is typical for a para-substituted benzene where there are two substituents, maybe an electron-withdrawing group and something else. Wait, but the integration is 2H each, so maybe it's a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents in the para positions? Or perhaps it's a substituent that's causing the splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's an ortho or meta substitution, but the same shift for both doublets suggests it's para.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet, maybe for a CH adjacent to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen or a carbonyl. Or perhaps it's a methylene group next to an oxygen.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, maybe a methylene group, perhaps part of a chain attached to the ring.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons, maybe a methyl group attached to a CH2, making a branching. Like maybe a CH(CH2CH2something) group.
