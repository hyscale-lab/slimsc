Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, which are like infinities that pop up in calculations. I think it's used when the theories predict certain values that are infinite, which isn't physically meaningful. So you have to regularize the theory—like introducing a cutoff or something—to make the math workable.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Let me think about each option. 

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, isn't that the non-quantum version? Like Maxwell's equations? I think in classical theories, you don't really have the same issues with divergences as in quantum theories. Because in classical electromagnetism, even though there are point charges and things that can lead to infinities, the theories don't require regularization in the same way. Or wait, maybe they do? I'm not too sure. Because when you have point charges, the electric field near them is problematic, but I don't think regularization is the approach used there. Instead, maybe people use other methods or just accept the singularities.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is a quantum field theory and I know that it's a renormalizable theory. So it does require renormalization, which is a form of regularization. Oh wait, but the question is about regularization, not renormalization. Are they the same thing? Hmm, no, I think regularization is a step used in the renormalization process. Regularization introduces a temporary modification to the theory to make calculations finite, which is then removed during renormalization. So QED does require regularization because it has loop divergences. So C is out.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's also a quantum field theory, and I think it does require regularization. Wait, but isn't QCD asymptotically free? That means that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, so perturbative methods work. But still, when you do calculations, especially loop diagrams, you might get divergences. So you would need regularization techniques like lattice regularization or dimensional regularization. So B probably
