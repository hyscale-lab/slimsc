Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read the question again. It's about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are infinities that pop up in calculations, making the results non-physical. So, regularization helps to make these infinities manageable by introducing a temporary cutoff or some other method, and then you take the limit where that cutoff goes away. But some theories don't need this. 

Wait, but wait—each of these theories is different. Let's break them down one by one.

Option A is Superstring Theory. I recall that string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics with general relativity. One of the main ideas is that it doesn't have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories because it's a theory of strings rather than point particles. Oh, but wait—superstring theory still deals with high energies and requires some form of regularization or maybe renormalization? Or does it handle things differently because it's background-dependent? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think that in string theory, maybe the theory is finite, meaning it doesn't require regularization because it doesn't have the same kinds of divergences. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's because string theory incorporates supersymmetry, which might help with these divergences, but I'm not certain about whether regularization is needed.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interaction. As far as I know, QCD does require renormalization, which suggests that it has divergences. But wait, renormalization is a process that often follows regularization. So if a theory needs renormalization, that could imply that it has divergences that need to be handled. Or maybe some theories have only finite terms and don't need it. But I think QCD, being a non-Abelian gauge theory with asymptotic freedom, still requires renormalization because of the loop corrections leading to divergences. So regularization is necessary here.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism and is a well-understood quantum field theory.
