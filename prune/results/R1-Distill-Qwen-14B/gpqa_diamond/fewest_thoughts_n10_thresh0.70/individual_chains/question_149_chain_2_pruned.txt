Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and break it down.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly right, except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Those two peaks have similar shifts and equal integrals, adding up to 1H. So, the integral is correct, which suggests they're the same proton, but they're split into two. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, which is a bit confusing.

Then there's the LC-MS analysis. It shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass, and the mass is consistent with the expected molecule. So, the mass spec doesn't show any extra fragments or a different molecular ion. But wait, why two peaks in LC-MS?

Hmm, okay. Let me think about possible explanations. The options are A to D.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, if that were the case, the MS would show a different mass, right? The question says both peaks have the same mass spectrum as the expected. So, the mass is the same. So A is probably not the right answer because a precursor would have a higher mass (like the starting material before losing something).

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In NMR, if you have enantiomers, the NMR would show the same spectrum because the environments are identical. So the integrals would be the same and you wouldn't see two peaks. Wait, but the question says two peaks with same shift? Enantiomers have the same NMR shifts, so why two peaks? Oh, wait, but if the compound is racemic, maybe in the NMR it would just show each proton's signal as a single peak. Unless it's a diastereomer or something else. Hmm, maybe not B.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Double coupling could imply some kind of coupling between protons, but the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling. So perhaps another type of coupling, but I'm not too familiar with this term. Maybe it's some kind
