Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but let me think this through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what do I remember about symmetries in effective field theories? I think SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model, respecting certain symmetries.

I remember that the Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry. Because all the fields are described in a Lorentz-invariant way. So any effective theory built from it would also have to respect Lorentz symmetry, right? So all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So option 1 (Lorentz) is a must.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz, but also translations. Oh wait, wait. The SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's non-renormalizable. But effective theories are still usually written in a way that respects Poincare symmetry. Because they're valid in regions where the UV physics is integrated out, and you still want the theory to make sense under spacetime translations. So Poincare symmetry (option 2) should also be respected. So 1 and 2 are both required.

Wait, but I've heard that in SMEFT, they're organized by their dimension. The operators are classified based on their Lorentz and gauge structures. But does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations. But operators are allowed to have higher dimensions, which could, I'm not sure, violate translation symmetry. Wait, no, because the operators are local, so they should respect Poincare. Because each term is a local operator built from the SM fields, so their inclusion doesn't break translation symmetry. So yes, Poincare symmetry is also required.

Now, what about CP symmetry? Wait, the SM doesn't respect CP. For example, the CKM matrix has CP violation. But in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect CP? I don't think so. Because SMEFT can include higher-dimension operators that may violate CP. So operators in SMEFT aren't necessarily CP-symmetric
