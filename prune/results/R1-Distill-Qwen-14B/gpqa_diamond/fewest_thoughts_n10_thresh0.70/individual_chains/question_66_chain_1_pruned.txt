Okay, so I've got this physics question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the Standard Model (SM) symmetries. But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options given are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare Symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I need to think about what each symmetry entails. Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics are the same for all observers regardless of their constant velocity or rotation. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in spacetime, so it's like the combination of Lorentz and translational symmetries. Oh right, but wait, effective field theories (EFTs) usually assume local symmetries, so SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.

What about Poincare symmetry? Well, Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. But wait, SMEFT is formulated as a low-energy effective theory. In EFTs, you often have a scale Î›, and terms are organized by their dimension. The theory might not have Poincare symmetry because the translations would imply momentum conservation, but in EFTs, you can have nonrenormalizable terms which allow for soft momenta but not necessarily hard momentum conservation. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Or maybe SMEFT is still Poincare symmetric because it's a Lorentz-invariant theory. Because Poincare symmetry includes the possibility of translations, but SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant EFT, so perhaps it respects Poincare's symmetry. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about what the SMEFT operators look like. SMEFT operators are constructed as higher-dimensional operators respecting the SM gauge symmetry, which includes SU(3), SU(2), U(1) and Lorentz symmetry. So the operators must transform appropriately under Lorentz transformations, meaning Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must.

Poincare symmetry, on the other hand, includes translations. But in EFTs, since the effective theory is valid below a certain scale, perhaps they don't necessarily have to respect Poincare symmetry.
