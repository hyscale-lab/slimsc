Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Hmm, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let me break this down.

First, I think I should draw the structures to visualize what's happening. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group attached. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring, and attached to it is a hydroxymethyl group which is connected to another cyclohexyl group. Also, there's a formyl (aldehyde) group somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should look at the nomenclature again. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning there's an aldehyde group on the cyclohexane. Then, the substituent is at the 1-position. That substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, it's a CH2-OH connected to a cyclohexyl group, all attached to the main cyclohexane ring.

So, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane with an ethynyl (triple bond) group. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Wait, no, ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH? Or is it directly attached? Oh right, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡C-CH2 group or is it CH2-C≡CH? No, ethynyl is the substituent, so it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So the structure is cyclohexyl-C≡CH.

Wait, no. The structure of ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group. So, the ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH, but wait no, ethynyl is the substituent, so it's a cyclohexane with a -C≡CH
