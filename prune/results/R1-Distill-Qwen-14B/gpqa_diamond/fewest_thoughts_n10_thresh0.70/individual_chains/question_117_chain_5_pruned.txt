Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question about optical isomerism, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by breaking down the question.

The question says that optical isomerism occurs when compounds have the same molecular formula but differ in the arrangement of their structures, specifically in their spatial arrangement. So, I'm looking for which of the given compounds exhibit this property.

The options are four moieties, numbered 1 to 4, and the choices are A, B, C, D with combinations of these numbers. Let me go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, okay. Biphenyl compounds can have stereoisomerism. Wait, biphenyls can have different positions, but in this case, since the substituents are at 2 and 2' positions, and nitro groups at 6,6', I'm thinking about the possibility of geometric isomerism. Oh wait, no, geometric isomerism is about double bonds or rings. Wait, biphenyls can have different configurations around the single bond between the two benzene rings. So if the two substituents (like the methyl ester groups) are on adjacent carbons, maybe they can't rotate, leading to possible isomerism. Wait, but wait, this is a biphenyl with substituents on each ring. Let me think. The structure is 1,1'-biphenyl, meaning the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Then, the substituents are at 2 and 2' positions, and also 6 and 6' have nitro groups. So looking at the substituents at 2 and 2', each has a methyl ester group. Wait, so each ester is on each ring? So each ring has a COOCH3 group on the 2 position. And the 6 and 6' positions have nitro groups. Now, the question is whether this biphenyl system can have stereoisomerism. Since biphenyls can exhibit axial chirality if they have non-symmetrical substituents. Axial chirality arises when there's a restricted rotation around the central bond, leading to different configurations. So in this case, the substituents on each ring
