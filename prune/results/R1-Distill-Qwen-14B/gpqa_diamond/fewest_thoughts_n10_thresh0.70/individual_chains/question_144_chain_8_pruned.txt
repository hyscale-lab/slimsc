Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? The question is asking about the mean decay distance. I think the mean decay distance has something to do with how far the particle travels before it decays. But how do I calculate that?

The given data is: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. Wait, so E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. Oh wait, Γ is 320 MeV which is 0.32 GeV. Right, because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV.

I recall that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The formula is something like τ = ħ / Γ. And the mean decay distance, which I think is called the decay length, would be the product of the velocity and the lifetime. So, L = v * τ.

Wait, but to find the velocity, I might need to use the energy and mass. Because energy E is related to the rest mass and the kinetic energy. Wait, no, E here is probably the total energy, including rest mass. So for a relativistic particle, E = γ m c². So γ would be E/(m c²). Wait, but I'm working in units where c is 1, so E = γ m, right? So γ is E / m.

So gamma would be 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2. Let me calculate that. 8 divided by 1.2 is like 6.666..., so 6.6667. So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

Then, velocity v is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Wait, no, because beta (β) is v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). So β = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)). Alternatively, since E = γ m, then β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

So plugging in gamma 6.6667, 1/gamma squared is 1/( (8/1.2)^2 )= 1/( (6.6667)^2 ) which is about 1/44.444, so approximately 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. Then sqrt of that is about 0.9887. So β is about 0.9887, which means v is approximately 0.9887c.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me calculate gamma first: 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666... So gamma is 6.6667. Then, 1/gamma is 0.15, so 1/gamma squared is 0.0225. So 1 - 1/gamma² is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887, yes. So v is about 0.9887c.

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, I need to make sure the units are consistent. ħ is the reduced Planck constant. I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because when you use natural units where c=1 and ħ=6.582
