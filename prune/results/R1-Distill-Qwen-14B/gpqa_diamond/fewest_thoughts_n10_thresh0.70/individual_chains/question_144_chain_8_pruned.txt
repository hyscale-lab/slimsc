Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance and its decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are like unstable particles; they don't exist for long. So their decay distance depends on how long they live, right?

The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are different distances, so I think I need to calculate the mean decay length.

Wait, mean decay distance... I think that depends on the particle's lifetime. The formula I remember is the mean proper lifetime τ, which is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but for particles, Γ is the energy width, and τ is the lifetime. So Γ is the uncertainty in energy, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime, I can find the distance using the particle's velocity. The decay distance L is v * τ. But wait, the particle is moving when it's produced, right? So I need to find its velocity first.

How do I find the velocity? The energy E is given. Since the particle is a resonance, it's moving, so its energy is the total energy. The total energy E is related to the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But wait, for a relativistic particle, the total energy E is gamma * m c². So gamma is E/(m c²).

Wait, let me get this right. The rest mass energy is m c². The total energy E is gamma times m c². So gamma = E / (m c²). But I need to compute beta, the velocity relative to the speed of light. Because beta = v/c.

Beta can be found from gamma. The relation is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). So I can solve for beta.

But maybe there's a formula that directly relates E, m, and beta. Alternatively, I can compute the velocity using the relativistic equations.

Let me think. The energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m by E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

Hmm, but perhaps another approach is better. Since E is much larger than m, maybe it's ultrarelativistic, but I'm not sure. Let's calculate it properly.

So gamma is E/(m c²). Let me compute that. Let's plug in the numbers.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is 6.6667.

Wait, but wait a second—units. Because E is given in GeV, and m is in GeV/c²? Because m c² would be in GeV. So yes, gamma is correct.

Now, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Solving for beta:

gamma² = 1/(1 - beta²)
=> 1 - beta² = 1/gamma²
=> beta² = 1 - 1/gamma²
=> beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

So plugging in gamma = 6.6667:

1/gamma² is 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is approximately sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887, which is about 0.989c. So v is approximately 0.989 times the speed of light.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me calculate 1/gamma²:

gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.666666667. So gamma squared is (6.666666667)^2 = 44.44444444.

So 1/gamma² = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887, as I thought. So beta is about 0.9887.

So v = beta c ≈ 0.9887 c.

Now, the mean lifetime is tau ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, what are the units here?

Γ is given as 320 MeV. ħ has units of GeV·s (since Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.58
