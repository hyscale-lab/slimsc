Alright, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what we have here. So the question involves a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending with compound E. We also have some hints that might help us figure out the structure of each compound.

First, let's break down each step. 

The first reaction is compound A reacting with HCN to form compound B. When aldehydes or ketones react with HCN, they typically form cyanohydrins. So I think compound A might be a ketone because when it reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin (compound B). The IR hint says that compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which aligns with a carbonyl group, probably a ketone.

Next, compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C. Hydrogenation of a cyanohydrin (which has a nitrile group) would reduce the nitrile to an amine. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, Pd and H2 usually hydrogenate triple bonds, maybe the nitrile group is being hydrogenated. But wait, H2 and Pd—maybe it's a catalytic hydrogenation. If compound B is a cyanohydrin (like R-C(OH)-CN), then reducing it would probably reduce the nitrile group. Nitriles on hydrogenation give amines, but maybe in this case, it's a different pathway. Or perhaps it's a ketone and nitrile group. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe compound B is a secondary alcohol and a nitrile. No, wait, the cyanohydrin formation adds a hydroxyl and a nitrile group. So for example, if A is cyclohexanone, B would be cyclohexanone cyanohydrin, which is a diol with a nitrile. But when you hydrogenate that, the nitrile would become an amine. Hmm, but the product is compound C. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile group is reduced to a methyl group. Wait, no, nitriles on hydrogenation (H2, catalyst) typically become amines. For example, R-CN + H2 → R-CH2-NH2
