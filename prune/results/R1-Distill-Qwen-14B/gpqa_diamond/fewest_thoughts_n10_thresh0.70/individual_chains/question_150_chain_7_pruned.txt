Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. The NMR data is given, and there are a series of reactions happening. I need to figure out what the final product is.

First, the NMR data. Let me list out the peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that seems like an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, it's a triplet. Aldehydes are usually a singlet, but maybe it's coupling with something else, like adjacent protons. Or perhaps it's a conjugated system.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H) – aromatic protons, probably in a para-substituted ring. The doublet suggests each proton is coupled with one other, maybe in a para arrangement.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H) – another aromatic doublet. Maybe another para-substituted ring, or perhaps a meta substitution. Wait, but two doublets, each 2H, perhaps two separate aromatic rings with substituents.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, 2H. Could be vinyl protons, like from an enal or an enol. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring with some substituents causing them to be split, but broad suggests maybe some exchange happening, like in a phenolic OH environment, but it's 2H and a singlet.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) – this looks like a CH2 group attached to something electronegative. Maybe an OCH2 group. The doublet indicates two neighboring protons, so perhaps it's part of a chain like OCH2CH2... or OCH2 connected to another CH2 or something else.

Putting this together: the molecule has an aldehyde group, two aromatic rings (maybe two benzene rings attached), some CH2 groups, and an oxygen (since the formula is C8H9NO). Oh wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree
