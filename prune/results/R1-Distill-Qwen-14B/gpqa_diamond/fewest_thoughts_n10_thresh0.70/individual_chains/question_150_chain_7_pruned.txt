Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let's see what it's about. The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. The NMR data is also provided, which should help in determining the structure. Then, the compound is reacted through a series of reagents, and I need to find the final product from the given options.

First, let's break down the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is CnHmOxNy. So, the degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x - y)/2. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, another formula I remember is Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the general formula.

Wait, each degree of unsaturation is a ring or a double bond. So the formula is C8H9NO. Let's compute using the formula: DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Let me think: for each ring or double bond, it's one DoU. X here is halogens, but in this case, there's none. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So, DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Hmm, maybe I should just recount.

Wait, molecular formula is C8H9NO.

The general formula for a saturated compound is CnH2n+2Ox. But since we have O and N, maybe the formula is adjusted accordingly. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the DoU as:

DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is halogens, which are zero here. So,

DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2 =5.

So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could mean, for example, one ring, one double bond, and two other rings or double bonds, or other combinations. Let's see what the NMR tells us.

The 1H NMR data is:

9.72 (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

Let me interpret each peak.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. High upfield, around 9-10 ppm usually indicates an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10, but they are typically deshielded and appear as singlets. But here, it's a triplet. Hmm, maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde, perhaps. Or maybe an acidic proton like an enol, but that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone or something else. Alternatively, could it be an aldehyde adjacent to something that splits the signal into a triplet?

Then, the 6.98 ppm doublet (2H) and 6.51 ppm doublet (2H) suggest two sets of two protons each in a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are equivalent and would couple with adjacent protons. So, for example, in a para-substituted benzene, each proton has two neighboring protons (ortho), but in a para-substituted di-substituted benzene, each proton would be a doublet. Wait, no, in a para-disubstituted benzene, each proton is adjacent to two others? Wait, maybe I need to think about coupling.

Alternatively, in a para-substituted aromatic ring, the protons are all equivalent if the substituents are symmetrical. Wait, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions. For example, two substituents in para positions on the benzene ring. Then each proton would be a doublet because they're coupling with their adjacent protons. Or perhaps the substituents are such that the aromatic protons are split into two doublets. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta-substituted ring, but that would lead to two doublets as well.

Wait, looking at the integration, each is 2H. So maybe two protons each in two different aromatic environments. So perhaps one ring has substituents at the para position, and another ring is similar.

Wait, but wait, the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That makes me think of two para-substituted aromatic rings. For instance, two phenyl groups attached to the molecule. Each phenyl would have two protons as doublets. So, perhaps the molecule has two phenyl rings, each in the para-substituted position. Alternatively, perhaps one phenyl group is attached with substituents such that the aromatic protons are split into two doublets. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad singlets can be due to exchange with protons, like -OH groups. But 2H as a broad singlet could be two -OH protons. Or, maybe it's adjacent to an electronegative atom, leading to a broad signal. Alternatively, it could be an enol proton, but that's less likely if the molecule is in a more stable form.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet (2H). That region suggests methylene groups adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps an OCH2 group. So maybe a -OCH2- structure. Or perhaps it's part of an ether, or an ester, or an amine. But given the molecular formula, which includes N, perhaps it's an amine, but more likely, given the reagents, it's an ether.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So the structure likely contains an amide or something with an N.

Wait, let's think about the reagents. The reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. aq. KOH, Heat

Hmm, NaNO2 and HCl are typically used for diazotization, especially under cold conditions (like 0-5Â°C). Next is water, which might be hydrolysis. Then aqueous KOH and heat, which is a strong base and heat, so perhaps some elimination or saponification.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about each step.

First, NaNO2 and HCl. This is a typical diazotization condition for aryl amines or aliphatic amines. So the starting compound probably has an amine group. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So N is present. So perhaps the starting compound has an amine, which gets converted to a diazonium salt in step 1.

Then, step 2 is H2O. That might be a hydrolysis step. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis under certain conditions. For example, aryl diazonium salts can be hydrolyzed to phenols. So if the starting material has an aromatic amine, it would form a diazonium salt which then gets hydrolyzed to a phenol in step 2.

Then, step 3 is aqueous KOH and heat. That's a strong base and heat. That might lead to elimination or some kind of dehydration. Alternatively, it could be a Claisen or aldol condensation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the starting material has an N. The reagents involve diazotization, which suggests that the starting compound has an amine group. So the starting structure likely contains
