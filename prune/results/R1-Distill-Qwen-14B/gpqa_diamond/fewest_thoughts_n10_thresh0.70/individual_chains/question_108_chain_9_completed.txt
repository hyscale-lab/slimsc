Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember that paramagnetism has to do with the magnetic properties of materials, and how electrons interact with magnetic fields.

The problem states that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis. Also, it mentions small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, m is the magnetic quantum number for orbital angular momentum, right? So m can take values from -l to +l in integer steps, where l is the azimuthal quantum number. The problem says m is small, so maybe m is 0 or close to it. 

The magnetic field is given as B=1 Tesla. I should think about what the paramagnetic coupling term is. Paramagnetic materials have unpaired electrons, and their magnetic moments interact with an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect in such a case is given by something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. Oh wait, the Zeeman effect is when the energy levels split due to the presence of a magnetic field. 

In the case of electrons, the magnetic moment μ is given by the Bohr magneton multiplied by the magnetic quantum number m. The Bohr magneton μ_B is (eħ)/(2m_e), where e is the electron charge, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, and m_e is the electron mass. So μ = μ_B * m. 

Wait, but wait a second. The orbital magnetic moment is μ = (μ_B) * l, but the spin magnetic moment is μ_s = μ_{B} * (s), where s is 1/2 for electrons. Hmm, but the question mentions orbital magnetic quantum number m, so maybe we're dealing with the orbital contribution here. Or perhaps it's considering the spin? Wait, the term 'paramagnetic coupling' might refer to the spin-orbit coupling, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, paramagnetism typically arises from the spin magnetic moments. Wait, but the problem states it's the paramagnetic coupling term, so perhaps it's the Zeeman term for the spin.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Paramagnetism is due to the spin magnetic moments. The orbital contribution is part of the diamagnetic term, I think. So in this case, the paramagnetic coupling would be the spin term. But the question says 'orbital magnetic quantum number m' is small. Hmm, maybe the paramagnetic term here refers to the orbital contribution, which would be smaller if m is small.

Wait, but in hydrogen, the ground state has l=0, so m=0. So for states with higher l, m can be non-zero. But if the problem says m is small, maybe m is like 1 or 2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's considering the spin magnetic quantum number, which can only be ±1/2. But the question says m is small, so perhaps it's talking about the spin quantum number.

Wait, the question says 'small values of m (orbital magnetic quantum number)'. Oh, okay, so m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. So m can be -l, ..., +l. For l=0, m=0. For l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So if m is small, perhaps m=0. But that would make the paramagnetic term zero. Hmm, but that can't be the case because the question is about comparing it with the transition energy.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's try to structure this.

The problem is asking to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think is the paramagnetic coupling term) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition energy corresponds to a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. That's in the visible range, I think. Oh, wait, 0.4861 micrometers is about 486 nm, which is the wavelength for the Balmer series in hydrogen, specifically the H-alpha line. So the energy ΔE is the energy difference between two energy levels in hydrogen.

So the task is to compute the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ and compare it with ΔE.

The paramagnetic coupling term is probably the Zeeman energy. The Zeeman term in the Hamiltonian is given by H_Zeeman = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment due to the electron's orbital motion or spin.

Wait, but the problem says it's the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism comes from unpaired electrons, so in hydrogen, each atom has one electron. So the spin is 1/2. But the orbital contribution would be due to the orbital angular momentum.

Wait, but the paramagnetic coupling term is usually the spin-orbit interaction, but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, the paramagnetic term could be the spin's Zeeman interaction, while diamagnetic is the orbital. I think the paramagnetic term comes from the spin magnetic moment, and the diamagnetic from the orbital.

So H_paramagnetic = -μ_s · B, where μ_s is the spin magnetic moment.

But in the problem statement, it's the orbital magnetic quantum number m that's small. So perhaps the paramagnetic term here is due to the orbital contribution, but that seems off because orbital contributions are more diamagnetic. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the paramagnetic coupling term refers to the spin part, but the question gives m, the orbital quantum number, which is small. So maybe the problem is considering the orbital Zeeman effect, which is usually smaller than the spin part.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to proceed.

So the paramagnetic coupling term would be the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field. Let's model it as H = - μ · B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For the orbital magnetic moment, μ = (μ_B) * m, where m is the magnetic quantum number (since μ = m μ_B for orbital).

Wait, no. Wait, the orbital magnetic moment is μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (L_z / ħ) ), so μ = μ_B * (L_z / ħ). Since L_z = mħ, so μ = μ_B * m. So yes, μ = μ_B m for the orbital part.

But wait, μ_B is the Bohr magneton = (eħ)/(2m_e). So the magnetic dipole moment due to orbital motion is μ = μ_B m.

So the energy (Hamiltonian) is H = - μ · B. Since B is along Oz, μ · B = μ_z B = μ_B m B.

So ⟨H⟩ = - μ_B m B.

Wait, but if m is small, like m=0 or 1, the term could be small. So compared to the transition energy ΔE.

The transition energy ΔE corresponds to the energy difference between two hydrogen levels. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers (486.1 nm). The energy can be calculated using the relation E = hc/λ.

So let's compute ΔE. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 486.1e-9 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m)
= (6.626e-34 *3e8 ) / (486.1e-9)
Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25
Denominator: 486.1e-9 = 4.861e-7
So ΔE ≈ 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approx (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-18 ≈ 0.409e-18 J = 4.09e-19 J.

But wait, I think it's more common to express energy in terms of eV. Let me compute that as well. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 4.09e-19 J is about 2.55 eV. Wait, but wait, the Balmer series corresponds to transitions ending at n=2, and the H-alpha line is between n=3 and n=2, right? The energy difference is the Rydberg constant times (1/2² - 1/3²) or something like that.

Wait, maybe I should calculate ΔE more accurately using the Rydberg formula. The Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097e4 m^-1. The wavelength λ for the Balmer series when n=2 is given by 1/λ = R(1/2² - 1/n²), where n is the higher energy level. For H-alpha, n=3.

So 1/λ = R (1/4 - 1/9) = R (5/36) = (1.097e4) * (5/36) ≈ (1.097e4 *5 ) /36 ≈ (5.485e4)/36 ≈ 1.523e3 m^-1.

So λ = 1 / 1.523e3 ≈ 6.566e-4 meters, which is 656 nm. Wait, but the question says λ=0.4861 micrometers, which is 486 nm. Oh, that's the H-beta line, which is n=4 to n=2. So let me compute that.

For n=4, 1/λ = R (1/4 - 1/16 ) = R (3/16) = 1.097e4 *3/16 ≈ (3.291e4)/16 ≈ 2.057e3 m^-1.

So λ = 1/(2.057e3) ≈ 4.86e-4 meters = 486 nm. That matches the given λ. So the energy is E = hc/λ.

Let me compute E in Joules again.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 486.1e-9 m

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9)
= (1.9878e-25) / (4.861e-7)
= approx 4.09e-19 J

But wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 4.09e-19 J = approx 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term is ⟨H⟩ = - μ_B m B.

What is μ_B (Bohr magneton)? It's (eħ)/(2 m_e), where e is the charge, ħ is h/(2pi), and m_e is the electron mass.

Compute μ_B:

e = 1.602e-19 C
ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s
m_e = 9.109e-31 kg

So μ_B = (1.602e-19 C * 1.0545718e-34 J·s ) / (2 *9.109e-31 kg )

Let me compute numerator: 1.602e-19 * 1.05457e-34 ≈ 1.692e-53 C·J·s

Denominator: 2 *9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30 kg

So μ_B ≈ (1.692e-53) / (1.8218e-30) ) = approx 9.288e-24 J/T.

Wait, because Tesla is kg/(s^2·A), and J is kg·m²/s², so the units would work out as (C·J·s) / (kg) → C·(m²/s) ) / (kg) → (C·m²)/(kg s) ). But Tesla is kg/(s²·A), so J/T would be (kg·m²/s²) / (kg/(s²·A)) ) = (m² A ) / kg * (kg s² ) / (m² s² ) ) ... Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The point is, μ_B is about 9.274e-24 J/T.

So now, ⟨H⟩ = μ_B * m * B. Wait, but the sign depends on the direction, but since we're comparing magnitudes, we'll ignore the sign.

Given that B=1 Tesla, m is small. Let's think about what m can be. Since m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, it can vary from -l to +l. For the hydrogen atom, the possible l values are 0,1,2,..., so m can be 0, ±1, ±2, etc., depending on l.

If the problem says m is small, maybe m=0 or m=1. Let's take m=1 for maximum effect (since it's small but non-zero).

So ⟨H⟩ = μ_B * 1 * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J.

Wait, but wait, that's 9.274e-24 J, which is about 5.78e-6 eV, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

Wait, 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV.

So ΔE is 2.55 eV, and ⟨H⟩ is about 5.79e-5 eV. So the paramagnetic term is way smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I mix up the magnetic moments? Because in hydrogen, the dominant magnetic effect is due to the electron's spin, not the orbital motion. Because for most states, the orbital angular momentum can be zero (like s-states), but the spin is always 1/2. So perhaps the paramagnetic term should consider the spin contribution.

But the problem specifically mentions the orbital magnetic quantum number m, so maybe the paramagnetic term here is due to the orbital motion. But in that case, for most states, the orbital contribution would be smaller.

Wait, but looking back, the problem says 'for small values of m (orbital magnetic quantum number)'. So m is small, perhaps 0 or 1. So the orbital paramagnetic term is small.

Wait, but for the spin contribution, m_s can be ±1/2. So if the question is about the spin paramagnetic term, then m is 1/2. But the question says m is the orbital quantum number, so perhaps it's not.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed with the given data.

So, the paramagnetic coupling term's expectation value is about 5.79e-5 eV, while the transition energy is 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting ⟨H⟩ as 5.79e-5 eV, which is 0.0000579 eV. That's five orders of magnitude smaller than 2.55 eV.

So when comparing ⟨H⟩ and ΔE, it would be that ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.

Looking at the options:

A) ⟨H⟩ = ΔE → No, not at all.

B) ⟨H⟩ >> ΔE → No, it's way smaller.

C) ⟨H⟩ << ΔE → Yes.

D) ⟨H⟩ > ΔE → No.

So the correct option is C: ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given data:

1. **Transition Energy (ΔE):**  
   The wavelength of the transition is given as λ = 0.4861 μm (486.1 nm), which corresponds to the H-alpha line in the Balmer series of hydrogen. Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 486.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \), we calculate:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)), we find:  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (⟨H⟩):**  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the magnetic moment of the electron with the external magnetic field \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). For the orbital magnetic moment, the energy is given by \( \langle H \rangle = -\mu_B m B \), where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number, and \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \).  

   Since the problem specifies "small values of \( m \)" (orbital magnetic quantum number), we take \( m = 1 \) (the maximum small value for \( m \)). Substituting, we find:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = \mu_B m B = (9.274 \times 10^{-24})(1)(1) \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. **Comparison:**  
   The transition energy \( \Delta E \) is approximately \( 2.55 \, \text{eV} \), while the paramagnetic coupling term \( \langle H \rangle \) is approximately \( 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). This shows that \( \langle H \rangle \) is many orders of magnitude smaller than \( \Delta E \).  

4. **Conclusion:**  
   Among the given options, the correct comparison is \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).

**Answer: C**
