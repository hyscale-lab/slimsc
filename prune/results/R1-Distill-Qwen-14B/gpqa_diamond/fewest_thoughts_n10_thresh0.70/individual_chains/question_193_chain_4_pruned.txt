Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. They're asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are various powers of r, like r squared, r cubed, etc.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle at which the position of a star appears to shift when viewed from two points in space. The formula I remember is that distance (d) in parsecs is inversely proportional to parallax. So d = 1/plx. That means as parallax decreases, distance increases.

So, if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, I can substitute plx in terms of distance. Since d is 1/plx, plx is 1/d. Let me write that down: plx = 1/d. So substituting into N, we have N proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. I think this is asking for the rate of change of N with respect to r. So, perhaps the number of stars per unit distance. Or maybe the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r, with thickness dr?

Let me think about this. When we talk about the number of stars as a function of distance, we usually think in terms of a differentialâ€”like the number of stars between r and r+dr. Because the total number up to a certain distance would be an integral.

So, suppose N(r) dr is the number of stars between r and r+dr. Then, how does N(r) depend on r?

From earlier, N is proportional to d^5. But wait, because N is given as a function of parallax. Wait, perhaps I need to relate the number density of stars to distance.

Another approach: The number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d
