Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it again. 

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are about the dependence on r, like r cubed, r to the fifth, r squared, etc.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, or was it that distance is about 360 divided by the parallax in parsecs? Oh right, the formula is distance (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So d = 1/plx. So plx = 1/d.

So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, that would be N ∝ (d)^5, because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. Because 1/plx is d, so 1/(1/plx)^5 equals d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So I think it's about the number density or the number per unit distance. Maybe it's about the
