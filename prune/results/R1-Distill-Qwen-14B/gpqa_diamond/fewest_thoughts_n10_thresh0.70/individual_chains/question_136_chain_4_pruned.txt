Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. Hmm, I remember from my studies that divergence and Gauss's Law are related, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through.

The vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². Oh right, in spherical coordinates, radial means the field only has a component in the r-direction. So the vector field is f(r) r̂, and its magnitude is 1/r². So f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. That makes sense. Since it's only radial, the other components (theta and phi) must be zero.

Now, the question is asking about the volume integral of the divergence of f over a sphere of radius R. So, the integral is ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV. I remember that the divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only the radial component is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f_r). Let me write that down.

So, ∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r). Since f_r is 1/r², plugging that in:

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ].

Simplify inside the derivative: r² * (1/r²) is 1. So, the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait no, wait, let me recalculate. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me make sure.

Wait, f_r is 1/r². So, r squared times f_r is r²*(1/r²) = 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is 0. So ∇ · f would be zero? But wait, that's only the case if there's no charge or something inside the volume. Or maybe I'm mixing this up with Gauss's Law.

Wait, Gauss's Law says that the integral of the divergence of E over a volume is equal to the enclosed charge. But wait, this is a vector field f, not the electric field. Unless f represents the electric field. Oh wait, the magnitude being 1/r² suggests that it's similar to Coulomb's law, where E is proportional to 1/r². So maybe f is the electric field due to a point charge at the origin.

If f is the electric field, then the divergence would relate to the charge density. Because Gauss's Law in differential form is ∇ · E = ρ/ε₀. So, if the charge is at the origin, then the divergence of E would be ρ/ε₀ only at r=0, and zero elsewhere. So for a sphere that includes the origin (r=0), the integral would be the charge enclosed.

Wait, but in this problem, the vector field is given as 1/r². Let me think. If it's the electric field, then
