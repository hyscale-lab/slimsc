Okay, so I have this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. The question is about iron atoms in the photosphere of two stars and their energy levels. Oh right, the photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted, and LTE means Local Thermal Equilibrium, which I think implies that the gas is in thermal contact with a radiation field at a certain temperature.

The key point here is that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation here refers to the energy levels of the atoms—so maybe it's about the Boltzmann distribution or something related to the population of energy levels.

I remember that the population of a particular energy level in a gas in thermal equilibrium is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula is something like n_i = n_1 * exp(- (E_i - E_1)/(k T)), where E_i is the energy of the level i, E_1 is the reference level (like the ground state), k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the problem says that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. So E = 1.38e-23 J. Let me think about the ratio of the populations between the two stars.

In star_1, the excited level is twice that of star_2. So if for star_1, the population is n1, and for star_2, it's n2, then n1 = 2 * n2.

But wait, the ratio of the populations (n1/n2) would be equal to the ratio of their respective Boltzmann factors, since the number of particles in each level depends on the temperature and the energy difference.

Wait, let me get the exact formula. The Boltzmann distribution gives the ratio of populations between two energy levels as (n1/n2) = exp( - (ΔE)/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference (E2 - E1), assuming E2 is higher than E1. Wait, no, wait: if E2 is higher than E1, then for the ratio n2/n1 = exp( - (ΔE)/(k T) ), because higher energy states have less population.

But in the problem, star_1 has twice as excited as star_2. So for the same energy level, n1 = 2 * n2. So the ratio n1/n2 is 2. So 2 = exp(ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(ΔE/(k T2))? Or wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, each star has its own temperature. For star 1, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is n1_excited/n1_ground = exp( - ΔE/(k T1) ). Similarly for star 2, n2_excited/n2_ground = exp( - ΔE/(k T2) ).

But the question states that the number of excited atoms in star_1's photosphere is twice that of star_2. So the ratio (n1_excited)/(n2_excited) = 2. But wait, no, because
