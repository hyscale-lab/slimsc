Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/(plx^5). And they're asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance, right? So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. Wait, let me think again. The formula is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 parsec / distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So, if the distance increases, the parallax decreases, which makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

So, the given relation is N ‚àù 1/(plx^5). Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, we get N proportional to (d)^5. Because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5.

Wait, but wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, N increases as d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So I think it's asking about the number
