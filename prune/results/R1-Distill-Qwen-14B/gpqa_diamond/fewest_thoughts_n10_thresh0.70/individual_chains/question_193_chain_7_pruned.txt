Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. Oh wait, right, plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So, we're to find N as a function of distance. Let's break it down.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in gives N proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/(d^5), so 1 over that is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Wait, wait, no. Let me do the math carefully.

So, 1/(plx)^5 is same as (d)^5, because plx is 1/d.
