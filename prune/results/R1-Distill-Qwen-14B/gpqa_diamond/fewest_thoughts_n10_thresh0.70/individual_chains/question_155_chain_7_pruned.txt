Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me take a deep breath and break it down.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is related to the expectation values. Specifically, the uncertainty ΔA is sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²), right?

Wait, but in this case, the state is an eigenstate of P_x. Oh, wait no, the state is specifically given. Wait, the state is the column vector (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So I don't need to worry about the eigenstate of P_x; I just need to compute the expectation values for P_z and (P_z)^2 in this state.

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the matrix representations given for P_x, P_y, and P_z are in this basis. That's important because the state vector given is expressed in this basis.

So the first thing I need to do is compute the expectation value of P_z, ⟨P_z⟩, and then compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Then use those to find the uncertainty.

Wait, but since the state is given, I can compute these expectation values directly by matrix multiplication. Because for a state |ψ⟩, ⟨A⟩ is ψ† A ψ. Since we're working in a basis where the state is a vector, the expectation value is just the conjugate transpose multiplied by the matrix multiplied by the vector.

Let me write down the state vector more clearly. It's a column vector with entries (-1/2), (1/sqrt(2)), (-1/2). Let me denote this as |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ].

But wait, since the basis is real, do I need to worry about complex conjugates? I think in this case, the state is real, so the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So ψ† would be [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ].

Now, the matrix for P_z is given as:
