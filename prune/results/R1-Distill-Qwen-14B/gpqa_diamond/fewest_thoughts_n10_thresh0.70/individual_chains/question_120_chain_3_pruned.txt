Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, parallax... right, parallax is a measure of distance to stars. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/distance (approximately, in parsecs).

The question states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, uniform distribution implies that the number density of stars is the same in all directions and possibly in terms of distance, but I need to think about how parallax relates to the number of stars we observe.

I remember that parallax is related to distance. If a star has a parallax plx, its distance d is about 1/plx parsecs. So plx = 1/d. Now, the number of stars we observe in a certain range of parallax depends on how many stars are at that corresponding distance.

Wait, but stars are spread out in space. If the distribution is uniform, the number of stars per volume is constant. So, the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius d and thickness dd would be proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of a shell is 4πd² dd. So for a given distance d, the number of stars is proportional to d² dd.

But how does this translate into parallax? Since plx is 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, let's substitute d in terms of plx. The volume element in
