Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm. The question says to assume that stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means they are spread out evenly in all directions. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is that the distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax (plx) in arcseconds. So plx = 1/d. Right, so if plx is small, the star is far away, and if plx is large, the star is nearby.

So the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Let me think, when considering a thin shell in space, the number of stars in that shell depends on the volume. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume would be proportional to the volume.

Wait, but how does parallax relate to volume? Let's see. The volume of a spherical shell (like between two distances) is 4π r² dr, where r is the radius. But since plx is 1/d, d = 1/plx. So, if I have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, that corresponds to a distance from d to d + dd, where dd is the change in distance. Wait, wait, no, when plx increases, distance decreases. So when plx is p, d is 1/p. So a small change in plx, say delta p, would correspond to a change in distance delta d.

Let me find the relation between delta p and delta d. Since p = 1/d, delta p = - (1/d²) delta d. So delta d = -d² delta p. Since d is 1/p, delta d = - (1/p²) delta p.

But maybe I should think in terms of the number of stars per unit parallax. So the number per unit volume is constant because it's uniform distribution. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4π d² dr multiplied by the number density (n). So N = 4π n d² dr.

But since plx is p = 1/d, dr = (delta p) * (-d²). So I can express everything in terms of p. Let's see.

d = 1/p, so d² = 1/p².

dr = (delta p) * (-1/p²). Wait, but when plx increases, distance decreases, so moving from p to p + delta p (assuming delta p is positive, so p increases, which means d decreases). Hmm, but maybe I should just consider the absolute value to get the positive thickness.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express dr in terms of delta p. Let me express dr as a function of delta p. Since p = 1/d, dr = - (1/p²) dp. So the absolute value is |
