Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's try to break it down. So the question is about stars with and without spots affecting the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Alright, I remember that when stars have spots, it changes their overall temperature, which in turn affects the behavior of the atoms in their photosphere.

The star's normal Teff is 6000 K, and when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that happen? Oh right, because spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when spots cover part of the surface, the average temperature we observe from the star goes down. But in this question, the overall photospheric effective temperature is given as 5500 K when spots are present. So that's the effective temp we measure, but I guess the spots themselves are even cooler than that? Or maybe the spots' temperature isn't directly given, but perhaps it's not needed here.

The main point is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star is spotted, this ratio is lower than when it's not. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So the question is, what is (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots)?

I remember the Boltzmann equation, which relates the number of particles in different energy states. The equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Here, n_i and n_j are the number of atoms in energy levels i and j, g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E_i and E_j are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature.

Wait, but since we're talking about the same transition, the energy difference E_i - E_j is related to the photon energy, which is given by wavelength. The transition corresponds to about 1448 Angstroms. So we can find the energy difference using E = hc/lambda.

But maybe I don't need to calculate the exact energies because the factor is about how temperature affects the exponential term. Because the
