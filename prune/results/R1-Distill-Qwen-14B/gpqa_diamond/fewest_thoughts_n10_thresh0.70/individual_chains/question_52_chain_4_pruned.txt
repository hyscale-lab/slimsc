Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, so the question is about a star with certain parameters. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. Now, the problem is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spot-free compared to when it has spots.

Hmm. So the key here is understanding how temperature affects the population of different energy levels in atoms. Oh, right, this relates to the Boltzmann equation in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which is mentioned in the problem.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T)). Here, g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, E2 > E1, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature decreases. However, the spots themselves might be cooler or hotter? Hmm, dark spots on a star are usually cooler regions, so they might have a lower effective temperature than the rest of the photosphere. But the problem states that the overall effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. So the star's average temperature is lower.

But the photosphere as a whole is in LTE, so when spots cover part of the surface, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is lower. So for the purposes of the photosphere, the temperature is an average, but each part (spot and non-spot) might have its own T. However, the problem says to assume LTE, and perhaps the effective temperature is the one affecting the line ratios. Or maybe each region contributes to the observed spectrum.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels in the photosphere. So when the star has spots, the overall photospheric T is lower, but the spots themselves are even cooler. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying things by considering the overall effective temperature as the relevant T for the Boltzmann factor. Or maybe it's considering the average T of the entire photosphere.

Let me read the problem again. It says when the star's surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. The observed ratio of Ti levels decreases when spots are present. So when spots are present, the ratio n1/n2 (or n2/n1?) is lower.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots.
