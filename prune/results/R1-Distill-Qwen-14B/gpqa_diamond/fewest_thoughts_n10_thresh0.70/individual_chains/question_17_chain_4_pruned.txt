Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium.

The problem gives me 0.02 M concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal. They also give the formation constant, K(Ca-EDTA), which is 5x10^10. I think the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So, the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, and K is given as 5e10.

Wait, the key here is to find the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca²+] in the solution. But the solution has the complex, not the individual ions. So, we're dealing with the dissociation of the complex into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

I remember that for such complexes, the formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, since the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, assuming that all the Ca is in the complex, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are both zero. Then, when it dissociates a little bit, x amount dissociates. So, the concentration of Ca²+ would be x, and EDTA^4- would also be x (since each complex gives one of each ion upon dissociation). But wait, wait. No, because the stoichiometry is 1:1, so for each complex that dissociates, you get one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

So the expression for K would be K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Let me denote the concentration of the complex as C, which is 0.02 M. Upon dissociation, the change would be that the complex
