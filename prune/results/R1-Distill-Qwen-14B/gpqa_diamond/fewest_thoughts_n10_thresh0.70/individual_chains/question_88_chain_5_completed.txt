Okay, so I've got this science question here about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step.

The question says that the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and given to mice via oral gavage. Then, they used in vivo imaging and saw some issues: some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, others got stuck in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. But they did identify fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability. The question is asking which process is happening here.

Wait, I remember that Peyer patches are a type of secondary lymphoid organ, specifically in the intestinal area. They're involved in immune responses, especially in the gut. So when the GFP-tagged proteins were delivered orally, some made it to the Peyer patches. But the fluorescence was affected by stomach acid and mucus—so maybe the proteins didn't survive digestion.

The next part is that they isolated proliferating cells. High variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests something is causing variation in the antibodies. I'm thinking about the immune response processes. Let me recall: during an immune response, B cells undergo several processes. One is clonal expansion, where B cells multiply. Another is somatic hypermutation, which increases the diversity of the antibodies they produce. Class switching is when the type of antibody changes (like from IgM to IgG), and VDJ recombination happens during the generation of the B cell receptor in the bone marrow.

Wait, so VDJ recombination is part of the initial setup of the B cell receptor during development in the bone marrow. But once an antigen is encountered, the B cells that are activated will start proliferating and undergo somatic hypermutation. So in this scenario, the GFP proteins are acting as antigens, right? The B cells in the Peyer patches would take them up and present them, leading to activation and proliferation.

When they isolate the proliferating cells and find high variability in the variable regions, that sounds like each B cell has a slightly different antibody due to mutations. So that's probably somatic hypermutation. Somatic hypermutation occurs in the germinal centers during the immune response, which is where B cells proliferate and undergo this process. This increases the chances that some B cells will produce high-affinity antibodies.

Let me think about the options again:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This seems right because it leads to variability in the antibodies produced by the B cells.

B) Complement activation: That's more about the activation of the complement system, which can lead to lysis of pathogens. Not directly related to the variability in the B cell receptors.

C) Class switching: This changes the antibody's isotype but doesn't affect the variable regions' variability—so the heavy chain class changes, but the sequence variability is from other processes.

D) VDJ recombination: That's during B cell development, so it's not happening here once the B cells are already activated. The variable regions are already set.

So the process taking place is somatic hypermutation, which is option A.


The question involves an experiment where GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are delivered to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence of these proteins is partially destroyed by stomach acid and intestinal mucus, but some reach the Peyer patches, where they are taken up by proliferating immune cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells reveals high variability, suggesting a process that increases antibody diversity.

Peyer patches are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut that play a key role in immune responses. The observed fluorescence in these patches indicates that the GFP-tagged proteins act as antigens, triggering an immune response. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes points to a process that introduces mutations in the B cell receptors, leading to diverse antibody production.

Among the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in germinal centers during an immune response, where activated B cells undergo mutations in their variable regions to increase antibody diversity. This matches the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **B) Complement activation**: This process involves the complement system attacking pathogens but does not explain the variability in the B cell receptors.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not affect the variability in the variable regions.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow and sets the initial sequence of the B cell receptor, not during an immune response.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs after B cell activation and during the immune response. This process is consistent with the experimental observations.

Answer: A
