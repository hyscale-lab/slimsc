Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their velocities are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally when you're dealing with speeds close to the speed of light. So for the relative speed, I can't just subtract the two; I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The velocity addition formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, right, because when you're in one frame moving at velocity u relative to another frame, and another object is moving at velocity v in that frame, the object's speed relative to you isn't just u - v. Oh wait, wait—no, actually, which way are we going here? So, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, what's the speed of the second?

Wait no, wait. The question is about the relative speed between the two astronauts. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction, then from A's frame, what is B's speed? Or is it the other way around? Or maybe it's the relative speed as observed from another frame, but no, the problem just says 'relative speed' without specifying, so I think it's the speed of one as seen from the other's frame.

Wait no, wait: actually, the problem is about their relative speed as observed from another frame? Or is it their speed relative to each other? Oh wait, no, I think it's the speed of one relative to the other. Because they're moving in the same direction. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed? Or vice versa.

But wait, maybe I need to compute the relative velocity as observed from a frame where A is moving at 0.6c and B is moving at 0.5c, but I think that's the same as the rest frame. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the relative speed between the two as observed from a third frame, but I'm not sure. Wait, the problem says "relative speed and the total energy of the system." So maybe for the relative speed, it's the speed of one as seen from the other.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is correct here. Let me get that right. The formula for the relative velocity u' when you have two frames moving relative to each other. Wait, if one object is moving at u in the lab frame, and the other at v in the lab frame, then the speed of the second object as seen from the first's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, no, wait: no, that's if the first frame is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. Oh, I'm getting a bit tangled.

Wait, let me get this right. The velocity addition formula is (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the object in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame relative to the lab. So, if I want to find the speed of B as seen from A's frame, then A's frame is moving at u_A = 0.6c relative to the lab. And B is moving at u_B = 0.5c in the lab frame.

So from A's frame, B's velocity would be (u_B - u_A)/(1 - (u_A u_B)/(c²)).

Wait, that can't be right because if u_B is less than u_A, this would give a negative, but since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed should be positive. Let me plug in the numbers.

u_B is 0.5c, u_A is 0.6c. So the numerator is (0.5c - 0.6c) = -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ -0.1428c. But speed can't be negative, so I think the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c.

Looking at the options, option C says 0.14c for v_rel. Option D also says 0.14c. So that part is either C or D.

Now, the total energy of the system. The system consists of two astronauts, so the total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies.

Each astronaut's energy is gamma * m c². But wait, the astronaut's masses are 2m and 3m.

Wait, for the first astronaut with mass 2m and velocity 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2). So for astronaut 1: v = 0.6c, so (v/c)^2 = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma * (2m) c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut 2: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. (v/c)^2 = 0.25. 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is around 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464m c².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² ≈ 5.964 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches this.

So the relative speed is 0.14c and the energy is 5.96 mc². So the correct option would be option C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction with velocities \( v_1 = 0.6c \) and \( v_2 = 0.5c \) in the lab frame. To find the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( v_1 = 0.6c \) and \( v_2 = 0.5c \):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the first astronaut
For the first astronaut with mass \( 2m \) and velocity \( v_1 = 0.6c \):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the second astronaut
For the second astronaut with mass \( 3m \) and velocity \( v_2 = 0.5c \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
