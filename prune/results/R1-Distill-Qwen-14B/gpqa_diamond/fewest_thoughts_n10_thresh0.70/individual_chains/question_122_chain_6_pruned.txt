Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow and think through each part carefully.

Alright, the problem starts with acetic acid being treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Hmm, I remember that when acetic acid reacts with something like bromine, especially in the presence of acetic anhydride and pyridine, it's probably undergoing a substitution reaction. Oh right! That sounds like the formation of an acyl bromide. Wait, acetic acid has a -COOH group. So when it's treated with Br2 in pyridine and acetic anhydride, it likely becomes acetyl bromide, which is CH3COBr. Yeah, because the -OH in the acid is replaced by Br.

So product 1 is acetyl bromide, CH3COBr.

Next, product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is a catalyst, I think. So what reaction happens between acyl bromide and ethanol? Oh, that's an esterification. The bromide leaves, and the alcohol attacks the carbonyl. So we get an ester. So product 2 would be ethyl acetate, CH3COOEt (where Et is CH2CH3). Because the Br is replaced by the ethoxide group from ethanol.

Then, product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide. Sodium cyanide is a good nucleophile. So what reaction occurs here? Since we have
