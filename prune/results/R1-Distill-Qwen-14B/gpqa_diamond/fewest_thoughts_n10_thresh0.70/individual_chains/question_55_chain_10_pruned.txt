Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are four different acetates: Cis-propenyl, Trans-propenyl, Cis-butenyl, and Trans-butenyl acetates.

The given NMR data is:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting patterns and the integration can tell us a lot about the structure. Let me think about each of these signals.

Starting with the 2.1 ppm singlet. A singlet usually means no neighboring hydrogens. It's a triplet of 3H, so maybe a methyl group attached to something that doesn't have adjacent hydrogens. Oh wait, acetate esters have a methyl group attached to oxygen. So that's probably the OMe group from the acetate. So that fits.

Next, the 1.6 ppm doublet (3H, d). A doublet means it has one neighboring group. Since it's 3H, maybe a methyl group attached to a CH2 or a CH group. Wait, but if it's a doublet, perhaps it's a CH3 attached to a CH that's next to something else.

Then the 5.5 ppm (1H, dq). Dq is doublet of quadruplets? Or maybe it's a doublet of doublets? Wait, the notation says dq, which I think stands for doublet of quadruplets, but I'm not entirely sure. But more likely, it's a doublet of doublets (maybe I'm mixing up the abbreviations). Alternatively, it could be a triplet with some splitting, but the exact splitting isn't clear. Anyway, 5.5 is in the vinyl region, so this is probably a proton on a double bond.

The 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz) is a downfield signal, also in the aromatic region. But wait, acetates don't have aromatic rings. Oh wait, maybe it's a vinylic proton. Because in some structures, like allyl groups, the protons can be deshielded and appear around 6-7 ppm. With a coupling constant of 16 Hz, that's a big coupling, which suggests a trans coupling in a double bond. Because J is the coupling between two adjacent protons, and in a trans configuration, the coupling is larger than in cis.

So putting this together, the molecule probably has an ester group (from the singlet at 2.1 ppm) and a propenyl or butenyl group attached as the R group.

Let me think about the possible structures.

The options are propenyl and butenyl, in cis or trans configurations. Let me draw them out mentally.

For propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2CH2COOCH3, but wait, propenyl is CH2=
