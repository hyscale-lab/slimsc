Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for things like detecting exoplanets via the radial velocity method. But the key here is to figure out which stars meet the brightness criteria for both instruments.

The question gives some data about each star. Let me break down the information. First, I need to figure out the apparent V magnitude for each star because that's what determines if they can be observed by each spectrograph. 

Wait, the problem says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, meaning apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17. HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag, so apparent magnitude up to 16. Because higher magnitudes are dimmer, right? So a star with V mag less than or equal to 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and less than or equal to 16 by HIRES. To be detected by both, the star's apparent V mag must be ≤16, because HIRES can't see beyond 16. So the star needs to be brighter than 16 mag, but wait, no—wait, the question says, for ESPRESSO, brighter than 17 mag, which means apparent magnitude ≤17. For HIRES, it's brighter than 16, so apparent
