Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum, which probably means we're focusing only on their orbital angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l of 1 (since p orbitals have l=1), and the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, with m (the magnetic quantum number) being -1.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z, the z-components of the orbital angular momenta of the two electrons, and getting eigenvalues of -ħ each. So, we're looking for the probability that when we measure each L1z and L2z, both come out as -ħ.

Hmm. I remember that for orbital angular momentum, the eigenvalues are given by Lz |l,m> = ħ m |l,m>, but wait, no, wait. Actually, the eigenvalue is m multiplied by ħ. Because for orbital angular momentum, the z-component is mħ. So, for each electron, L1z and L2z can each have possible values of -ħ, 0, or +ħ since l=1 gives m = -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore spin, so we don't have to consider spin states. So we're dealing purely with the orbital angular momentum.

The coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. So, this is a state where the total angular momentum is l=2, and the m is -1. But how do we get the individual m1 and m2 from this?

I think when you couple two angular momenta, you can expand the state in terms of the product of individual states. But since we have a coupled state, we need to find the expansion in terms of the uncoupled basis. That is, the state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed as a linear combination of |l1,m1> ⊗ |l2,m2> states, where the sum of m1 and m2 gives M = -1.

Wait, but the total m is m1 + m2. So in this case, m1 + m2 = -1. So each possible combination of m1 and m2 that adds up to -1 will contribute to the state.

But how do we find the coefficients for each |m1, m2> in the expansion of the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>?

I think this involves the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are used to express the coupled states as a sum of products of individual states.

The coupled state |l1 l2; L M> is a linear combination of |l1 m1> |l2 m2> where m1 + m2 = M.

So for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

The possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to M=-1 are:

m1 = -1, m2=0.

m1=0, m2=-1.

m1=-2? No, because each m can only be -1, 0, +1. So, m1 can't be -2. So the possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

Wait, but that's only two possibilities. Oh, but wait, because l1=1 and l2=1, m1 can be -1,0,1, same for m2. So the possible (m1,m2) pairs where m1 + m2 = -1 are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1).

Wait, that's it. Because if m1 is -1, m2 is 0. If m1 is
