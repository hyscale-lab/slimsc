Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Oh right, parallax is that thing where the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Wait, no, wait. Wait, parallax is measured in arcseconds, and the closer the star, the larger the parallax. Because if you imagine being in space, the closer a star is, the more it appears to shift in position when viewed from different points in Earth's orbit.

So the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in the sky—so maybe they're spread out in all directions, same density everywhere. But I'm not sure if that's about their position in space or their apparent positions. Oh wait, I think in astronomy, when we say stars are uniformly distributed in space, it means they have the same density throughout the galaxy or universe. So, same number per unit volume everywhere.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, for a given range of parallax values, how many stars are there? Let's think about parallax and distance. Parallax (p) is inversely proportional to distance (d). Because p = 1/d, right? So larger d means smaller p.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is p (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by d (in parsecs). So d = 1/p. So as p increases, d decreases. So higher parallax means closer stars.

Now, if stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number density is constant. So number per unit volume is constant. But volume depends on distance, because volume scales with the cube of radius. Wait, but the parallax relates to the distance, so we can model this.

So, imagine we're looking at stars within a certain distance. Let's say we have a small range of parallax, like from p to p + dp. Because p is inversely proportional to distance, dp would correspond to a range in distance. Wait, to find the number of stars in a small range of p, I'd think in terms of how many stars are within a certain shell in space.

Wait, when p changes by dp, what's the corresponding change in distance? So since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. The differential of d with respect to p is dd = - (1/p²) dp. So a small change in p (dp) corresponds to a change in d of - (1/p²) dp. But wait, I'm trying to find how the volume changes with distance.

The volume of a spherical shell from d to d + dd is 4π d² dd. Because the volume is (4/3)π (d+dd)^3 - (4/3) π d^3 ≈ 4π d² dd when dd is small.

So the number of stars in that shell would be the number density (n) multiplied by the volume. Since n is uniform, say n stars per cubic parsec.

So number of stars in shell is n * 4π d² dd.

But we want this as a function of p. So let's substitute d = 1/p and dd in terms of dp.

We have d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases. But for the purposes of counting, we can consider the magnitude when dealing with small ranges.

So substituting d = 1/p and dd = (1/p²) dp (taking absolute value), the number of stars becomes:

n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp.

Wait, wait, let me make sure. The volume of the shell is 4π d² dd. So substituting d = 1/p and dd = (1/p²) dp (since dp is positive when p increases, but d decreases, I'm taking absolute values).

So,

volume = 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, that's 4π divided by p^4 multiplied by dp.

So number of stars is n * 4π / p^4 * dp.

So the number per unit range of p (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So if you have a range dp, the number is proportional to 1/p^4 times dp.

So the number per unit dp (like the density in p space) is 1/p^4. Therefore, as p increases, the number of stars per unit dp decreases as 1/p^4.

Wait, but the options are about how the number changes with plx. So the number of stars per unit plx range (like per arcsecond) would be 1/(p^4), so the number decreases as p increases, following 1/p^4.

But wait, let me think again. Because I'm considering a thin shell in space, which corresponds to a thin shell in p. The number of stars in that p shell depends on the volume, which depends on p^4.

So the number of stars per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4.

Looking back at the options:

A) ~1/plx^4

B) ~1/plx^2

C) ~1/plx

D) ~1/plx^3

So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I've heard that the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec) decreases with distance squared. Hmm, but in this case, the question is about per unit parallax, not per unit distance.

Wait, let me think about it differently. Since the number of stars in a shell between d and d+dd is proportional to d^2 dd. And since d = 1/p, dd = - (1/p^2) dp. So the number is n * 4π d^2 dd = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p^2) dp = n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

Which gives N ∝ 1/p^4. So the number per unit p (like per arcsecond) is 1/p^4.

So yes, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (like per 1 arcsecond) decreases as 1/p^4. So the correct option is A.

Wait another angle: Let's think about volume in terms of parallax. For a given parallax p, the distance is d = 1/p. The volume up to that distance is (4/3)π d^3. So the number of stars up to distance d is n*(4/3 π d^3). But that's cumulative. But the question is about the number in a small range of p, which is the differential.

Alternatively, think of how many stars are between parallax p and p + dp. The corresponding distance is d = 1/p, and d + dd = 1/(p + dp) ≈ 1/p - (1/p^2) dp. So the shell in space is from d to d - (1/p^2) dp (since p increases when d decreases). Wait perhaps I should express the shell's volume in terms of p.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express the number of stars as a function of p. Let me model this.

The number per unit volume is constant, n. The volume of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars in that shell is N = n * 4π d² dd.

But since p = 1/d, dd = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting, N = n *4π ( (1/p)^2 ) * (1/p²) dp ) = n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

So N = (4 π n / p^4 ) * dp.

So the number of stars per unit change in p (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is inversely proportional to p^4, so the correct answer is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = \frac{1}{d} \). If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density of stars is constant, say \( n \) stars per unit volume.

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is given by \( N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \) (taking the absolute value for simplicity), the number of stars in terms of \( p \) becomes:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} dp = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). Therefore, as \( p \) increases, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \).

Among the given options:
- **A) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^4 \):** Correct, as derived above.
- **B) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^2 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^2 \).
- **C) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \).
- **D) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^3 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^3 \).

Thus, the correct answer is **A**, as the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \).
