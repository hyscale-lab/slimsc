Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. Hmm, it's about an isolated system of particles with charge, right? So, there are 13 identical particles each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, which is about 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. But wait, each is 2e, so each charge is 3.2e-19 C. 

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the 13th is at the center, and the 12 are arranged around it at a distance of 2 meters each. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. I think the minimum energy would relate to the potential energy because when you bring charges together, you're doing work against their mutual repulsion, so the potential energy would be the work done. Oh right, because all these charges are positive (since they're multiples of e, which is positive for protons), they will repel each other. 

Wait, but wait. The question is about the minimum energy. Hmm, potential energy in electrostatic systems is minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible, right? Because when you have like charges, they repel, so the lowest potential energy is when they're placed as far apart as possible. But in this setup, the 12 charges are at a fixed distance from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So I guess the system is already in a configuration where the 12 are on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 meters, each at a point on that sphere, but constrained there. 

Wait a second, are they arranged in some particular way? Like, are they equally spaced? The problem doesn't specify, but maybe for calculating potential energy, the arrangement doesn't matter because we can model it as each charge contributing to the potential at the center. Alternatively, maybe each charge at radius 2m contributes to the potential at the center charge. 

Wait, no, wait. Because the charges are identical and all at the same distance, maybe the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each charge due to the others. But wait, since the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the others are fixed at 2m, perhaps the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each of the 12 charges due to the central charge, plus the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. 

But wait, no. Because all the 12 charges are at the same distance from the central charge, the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 would be (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 meters). But wait, the central charge is 2e, each of the 12 is 2e. So each contributes a potential energy of (k*(2e)^2)/(2). So for 12 of them, the total would be 12 * [k*(4e²)/2] = 12 * [k*(2e²)] = 24 k e². 

But wait, wait! That's the potential energy due to the central charge and each of the 12. But I also have to consider the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Because each of them is at 2 meters from P, but what about their distance from each other? Oh, because they're all at a distance 2 meters from P, their mutual distances would vary. If they're arranged in a regular dodecahedron or something, but for the minimum energy, perhaps the mutual potential energy is also considered. 

Wait, but the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So maybe their mutual distances are fixed, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. But the question is about the minimum energy of the system. Wait, but the system is isolated, so the potential energy is fixed because the charges are
