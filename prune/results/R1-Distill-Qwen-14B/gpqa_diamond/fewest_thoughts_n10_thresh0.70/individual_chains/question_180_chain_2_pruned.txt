Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay 2 meters away from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, in Joules. The options are given, and I need to choose the right one.

Hmm. So, I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Because the system is isolated and the charges are either fixed or constrained, I'm guessing the energy comes from the electric potential energy between the charges.

Wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2m away from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the charge at P. But wait, the fixed charge is also 2e, right? Because all particles have charge 2e.

So, the setup is: one charge at P (2e), and 12 charges each at 2m from P (each 2e as well). So, the 12 charges form like a spherical shell around P, but each is fixed at a point 2 meters away.

But wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So they're all at the same distance, but are they arranged in some specific configuration? Like, maybe like a regular dodecahedron or something? Or does the exact arrangement not matter because all the charges are equidistant from the central charge?

Wait, potential energy for point charges is independent of their arrangement as long as their positions are fixed. Because each pair contributes to the potential energy, and in this case, each of the 12 charges is at the same distance from the central charge. So, perhaps we can calculate the potential energy between each pair and sum them up.

But wait, potential energy is a scalar quantity, so the system's total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair
