Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. I remember that these synthesis problems can get a bit tricky, but let's take it one step at a time.

The first part says acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Hmm, I think that's about making an acyl bromide. Oh wait, I remember that when you have an acid like acetic acid and you treat it with a brominating agent like Br2 in the presence of pyridine, which acts as a base, it's probably forming an acyl bromide. Acetic anhydride is also involved, but wait, does that mean the acid is converting into an acylium ion? Or maybe it's acting as a catalyst? Or perhaps the acetic anhydride is actually part of the bromination process. Wait, I think the standard procedure for making acyl bromides is using PBr3, but in this case, they're using Br2 and pyridine. Oh right, another method for making acyl bromides is by treating the acid with Br2 and pyridine. So acetic acid would react to form acetyl bromide (CH3COBr).

So product 1 is acetyl bromide.

Next, product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid. Heating an acyl bromide with ethanol and acid sounds like an acid-catalyzed nucleophilic acyl substitution. So acetyl bromide (CH3COBr) would react with ethanol. The Br is a good leaving group, and the ethanol acts as a nucleophile. So the product would be ethyl acetate, right? Because the bromide leaves and ethanol's oxygen attacks, replacing Br with an OEt group. So product 2 is ethyl acetate (CH3COOEt).

Then, product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide. Sodium cyanide is a good nucleophile. So this is probably a substitution reaction if possible. But wait, ethyl acetate is an ester. Ester hydrolysis under basic conditions usually gives the carboxylic acid or the corresponding salt. But wait, NaCN is a base? Or maybe it's a nucleophilic attack. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the ester's oxygen is replaced. No, wait, substitution in esters isn't straightforward. Oh wait, another possibility: the ester could undergo a nucleophilic acyl substitution.
