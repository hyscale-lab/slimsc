Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're given information about two planets orbiting a star, and we need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember that depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance, and the planet's albedo. Oh, wait, the question says both have the same albedo, so that part cancels out.

First, let me note down the given data. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff of 6300 K. The two planets have their own masses and radii. But for equilibrium temperature, I think mass and radius of the planets don't matter directly. It's more about their orbital distances from the star.

Wait, but the problem mentions the transit and radial velocity methods. The transit method gives the radius of the planet, which is already provided. The radial velocity method gives the mass, which is also given. But how does that help us find the distance? Oh, right, but wait, in the RV method, the semi-major axis (distance) is determined based on the Doppler shift. But in this problem, we don't have the actual semi-major axes given. Instead, we have the induced Doppler shifts on the star's spectral lines for each planet.

So the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift in wavelength is related to the star's velocity. The formula I remember is delta lambda over lambda equals velocity over c (the speed of light). But wait, in this problem, the shifts are given in terms of Angstroms. Let me think about how that relates to the velocity.

The problem states that Planet1 causes a shift of 0.03 Å, and Planet2 a shift of 0.04 Å on the [OI] line at 6300 Å. So the formula for Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. Let's compute the velocities.

For Planet1: delta_lambda is 0.03 Å, lambda is 6300 Å. So delta
