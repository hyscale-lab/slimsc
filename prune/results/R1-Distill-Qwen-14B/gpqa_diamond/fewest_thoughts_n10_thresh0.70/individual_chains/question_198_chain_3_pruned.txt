Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to remember what stability constants are. Stability constant, or formation constant, is a measure of the stability of a complex. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So the complexes with higher β values will form more readily.

The complexes are likely [Co(SCN)_n]^(some charge), where n is the number of SCN- ligands. The blue complexes are probably the ones with two SCN- ligands, so [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Or maybe another number? Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the color corresponding to the number of ligands, but for the purposes of this problem, I think I can assume that the blue complexes are the dithiocyanato ones, which would be the n=2 complex.

So the question is about finding the percentage of Co in the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. To find that, I think I need to calculate the distribution of Co between all the possible complexes and the free Co^2+ ion.

The possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^4- (since the βs are given up to β4=16, I guess n=1 to 4). Wait, no, β4 would be for n=4, so the fourth complex.

Wait, actually, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β corresponds to the complex with n ligands. For example, β1 is the constant for the first complex, which is [Co(SCN)]^+.

The general formula for the formation of the nth complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^{2+n} = β_n [Co^{2+}][SCN^-]^n.

So, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the possible species: free Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^4-. But wait, maybe in solution, some of these might not form significantly. For example, if β4 is lower than β3, maybe the fourth complex is less favored.

But in any case, the problem gives the total cobalt concentration as 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate is 0.1 M. So I think the plan is to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the others,
