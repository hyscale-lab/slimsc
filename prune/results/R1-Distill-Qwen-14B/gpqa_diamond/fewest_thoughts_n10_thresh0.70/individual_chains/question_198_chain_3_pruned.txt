Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants tell us about the formation of complexes, right? Higher β means the complex is more stable.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. So, I think the blue one is probably the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is the dithiocyanato complex. Or wait, maybe the dithiocyanato is a different one. I remember that Co with more SCN tends to form different colored complexes, like maybe Co(SCN)_4^3- is blue, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question says 'blue dithiocyanato' which would be with two SCN? Or perhaps it's a different number. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.

Wait, the stability constants are given for β1 to β4. So each β corresponds to a different complex. I think the general form for the stability constant is βn = [Co(SCN)_n^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n). So for each n (number of SCN attached), βn is the constant.

So β1 is for Co(SCN)^(+) maybe? Or Co(SCN)^(n-1)? I think the charge would be Co^2+ plus n SCN^- (each SCN is -1), so the complex would be [Co(SCN)_n]^{2 - n}+ ?

Wait, but the problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. So dithiocyanato would be with two SCN. So that's n=2, so β2 is 40. So we're looking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Or [Co(SCN)_2]^(2-2) = [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is neutral? Hmm, but I'm not sure about the charge here.

Wait, maybe I should just proceed with the calculation regardless of the exact complexes. The problem is about the distribution of the species, so using the stability constants to find the fraction of each complex.

The overall approach, I think, is to consider all the possible complexes and the free Co^2+ ion, and calculate the fraction each contributes. Then, sum all the fractions and find the percentage of the blue one.

So the possible species are Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- (n=3), and [Co(SCN
