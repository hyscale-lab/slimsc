Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I need to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, no, actually, the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes? Or is it the next 150 minutes from the start? Let me read the question again.

Wait, the setup is that the atom has a 32% decay probability within 100 minutes. So that's the initial period they're considering. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed. And the question is about the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Or wait, is the next 150 minutes starting from now (50 minutes have passed) or is it the remaining time? Hmm, the question is a bit ambiguous but I think it's asking for the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes after the current time (i.e., from time t=50 to t=200, which is 150 minutes). Or wait, perhaps the initial 100 minutes were the time frame, but 50 have passed, and they're asking about the next 150 minutes, which would be 200 minutes total. Or maybe it's the next 150 minutes from now, which would be 50+150=200 minutes total. But I think radioactive decay works on a half-life basis, so maybe it's better to model it with the decay equation.

Wait, the key here is that the decay follows an exponential law. So, the decay probability within a certain time should be modeled with the exponential distribution. So, the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. But wait, the given probability is 32% decay within 100 minutes. So, the survival probability after 100 minutes is 68%, which is 1 - 0.32. 

So, the decay constant λ can be found using the equation:

P_survival = e^(-λ * t) = 0.68 when t=100.

So, taking natural log on both sides:

ln(0.68) = - λ * 100.

So, lambda λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Let me compute that. ln(0.68) is approximately... Well, ln(1)=0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693. 0.68 is close to 0.7, so ln(0.7) is about -0.3567. So, ln(0.68) is a bit lower, say around -0.38569. So, λ ≈ 0.38569 / 100 ≈ 0.0038569 per minute.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute ln(0.68). Using a calculator: ln(0.68) is approximately -0.385662. So, yes, lambda is about 0.00385662 per minute.

Now, the question is: given that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. So, the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 =
