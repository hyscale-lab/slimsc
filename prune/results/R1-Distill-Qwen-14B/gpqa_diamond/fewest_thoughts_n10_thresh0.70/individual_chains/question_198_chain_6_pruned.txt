Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. And the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Wait, so dithiocyanato would be with two SCN- ions. So the complex would be Co(SCN)_2^2+ or something like that? Or maybe Co(SCN)_n where n is 2? And I think the stability constant is β2, which is 40. But wait, I need to confirm which β corresponds to which complex.

Stability constants, β, are for the formation of complexes. So βn is the constant for the nth complex. So β1 would be Co(SCN), β2 Co(SCN)_2, β3 Co(SCN)_3, etc. So the dithiocyanato complex is the second one, so β2 is 40.

But wait, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I remember that different
