Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, so the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors. Let me check if this vector has a magnitude of 1. The components are -1, 2, 1. So the square of the magnitude would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Hmm, that's 6, so the magnitude is sqrt(6). So the state vector isn't normalized. Oh wait, but when you write the state vector in quantum mechanics, it's supposed to be normalized, right? So maybe I need to normalize it first.

Wait, but the question might not require that because perhaps the measurements are based on the given state without normalization. Or perhaps the matrices are unitary, but I don't think so because the operator for Q looks diagonal, maybe with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. Hmm.

Wait, the problem is about measuring P and then Q. So first measuring P, then Q. And we need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Okay, so first, I think I should find the possible outcomes when measuring P, and then find the state after the measurement, and then find the probability of measuring -1 for Q in that state.

But wait, the state is given as (-1, 2, 1), but I should check if it's normalized. Let me compute the norm squared: (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 =1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is not normalized. That might complicate things, but perhaps when we calculate probabilities, the normalization will play a role.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and the state is supposed to be normalized. But I'll proceed with the given.

So, the first step is to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P. To do that, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and compute the projection of the state vector onto that eigenspace.

Wait, operator P is given by a matrix. Let me write down matrix P:

P has first row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0].

So the matrix P is:

[ 0          1/√2         0        ]
[1/√2       0           1/√2     ]
[ 0          1/√2        0        ]

Hmm, that's an interesting structure. Let me see if I can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the matrix's eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant is:

| -λ        1/√2        0        |
|1/√2      -λ         1/√2     |
| 0         1/√2      -λ        |

This is a 3x3 determinant. Let me compute it.

Using the rule for 3x3 determinants, expanding along the first row:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ]
+ 0 * [ ... ]

Hmm, let's compute each term.

First term: -λ * [ λ² - (1/2) ] because (1/√2)^2 is 1/2.

Second term: -(1/√2) * [ (-λ/√2 ) - 0 ] = -(1/√2)(-λ/√2) = (λ)/(2).

Third term is zero because it's multiplied by 0.

So the determinant is:

-λ ( λ² - 1/2 ) + λ/2.

Which is:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + λ/2.

Simplify:

-λ³ + λ.

Set equal to zero:

-λ³ + λ = 0 → λ (λ² - 1) = 0.

So the eigenvalues are λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1.

So when measuring P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.

Now, the question is about measuring P and getting 0, and then measuring Q and getting -1.

So first, after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses into the eigenspace of P corresponding to λ=0.

But wait, what is the eigenspace for λ=0? Let me find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the matrix P is as written above.

So P v = 0.

Let me write the equations:

Row 1: (0) v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/√2)v1 + 0 v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0.

Row 3: 0 v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

So from row 1 and 3, v2 =0. From row 2, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form (v1, 0, -v1) → v1 (1, 0, -1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1).

Wait, but eigenvalues can have higher multiplicities. So for λ=0, does the eigenspace have dimension
