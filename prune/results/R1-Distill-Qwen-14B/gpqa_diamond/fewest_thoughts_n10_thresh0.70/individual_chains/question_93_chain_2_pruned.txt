Okay, so I need to figure out why there are discrepancies in the scientist's qPCR results. Hmm, let's see. So the setup is that he's making a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran three technical replicates for each of the serially diluted samples. The efficiency was 100%, R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. 

Wait, I remember that in qPCR, the efficiency is usually close to 100% for a good assay. A slope of -3.3... Oh right, I think the ideal slope is around -3.32 if I'm not mistaken. Because the formula for the slope is -3.32 divided by the efficiency, and with 100% efficiency, that's exactly -3.32, which is close to -3.3 here. So that's probably fine.

The RÂ² of 1 means the data fits perfectly, so no issues there. Now, looking at the Ct values. For each concentration, there are three technical replicates. Let's see how they vary.

At 100,000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. So the range is from 33.9 to 34.5. That's a difference of about 0.6. The average is around 34.2, maybe.

Wait, but technical replicates should have very little variation because they're replicates on the same sample, same run, same everything. Usually, the Ct values should be very close. Like within 0.3 of each other. Because technical variability in processing the same sample shouldn't be that big. 

Looking at the other concentrations:

10,000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. That's a range of 0.6 again. The variation is similar. 

1,000 copies: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. Same 0.6 range.

100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6. Also 0.6 difference. 

10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21
