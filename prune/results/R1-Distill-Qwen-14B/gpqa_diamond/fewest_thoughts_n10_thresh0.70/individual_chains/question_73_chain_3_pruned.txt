Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to figure out the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Oh wait, but wait, when considering relative speed in relativity, I can't just subtract the speeds normally because of the effects of special relativity. Right, because at high speeds, classical velocity addition doesn't apply. So I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity u' when observed from one frame (say, the frame where astronaut A is at rest) to another frame (where astronaut B is moving). So, the formula is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/cÂ²)

Wait, but wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. Wait, but wait, so from A's perspective, what's B's speed? Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed should be the difference, but adjusted for relativity.

So let me plug in the numbers. Let me consider u as B's speed (0.5c) and v as A's speed (0.6c). So u' is (0.5
