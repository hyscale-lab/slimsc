Okay, so I've got this question about a new anti-diabetes drug and its effect on mitochondria in HEK293 cells. Hmm, I need to figure out which experiment won't help determine the mitochondrial role of the drug. Let me think through each option carefully.

First, let's recap what each experiment might be testing. The question is about whether the drug affects mitochondria, so the experiments should be related to mitochondrial function or presence.

Option A: Differential centrifugation to extract mitochondria, then using a Glucose Uptake Assay. Wait, glucose uptake... I'm not sure how that directly ties to mitochondria. I know that mitochondria are involved in cellular respiration, producing ATP. But glucose uptake is more about the cell's ability to take in glucose, which happens in the cell membrane. Maybe if the drug affects glycolysis or insulin signaling, but how does that show mitochondrial involvement? Or maybe the assay is looking at glucose transporters, which are in the plasma membrane. So if the mitochondria are extracted via centrifugation, the glucose uptake might not be affected by the drug if it's working on mitochondria, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the assay measures something else.

Option B: Transformation with recombinant luciferase and adding luciferin. Oh, wait, luciferase is an enzyme used in reporter assays. If the cells are transformed with it, maybe the presence of luciferase activity indicates something about the cell's metabolism. Alternatively, wait, the luciferase could be used as a marker for something like mitochondrial
