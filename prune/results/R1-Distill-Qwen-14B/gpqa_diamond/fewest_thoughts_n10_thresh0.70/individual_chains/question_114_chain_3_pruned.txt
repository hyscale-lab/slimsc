Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the reactions given. Let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves a more complex molecule, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, wait. Let's break down the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. Adding NaCNâ€”sodium cyanide. So, what's happening here? I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism is probably the enolate formation or something like that. Oh wait, but butanone is a cyclic ketone maybe? No, butan-2-one is a straight-chain ketone.

Wait, another thought. Maybe it's a substitution reaction. No, ketones don't usually undergo substitution. Oh, right, the C=O group can undergo nucleophilic addition. So NaCN provides CN- as a nucleophile. So the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin.

But wait, what's the structure of the product? 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The molecule would have a carbon chain where the second carbon has both a hydroxyl group, a methyl group, and a nitrile group. So, it's like CH2-C(OH)(CH3)CN-CH2? Or wait, butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile on C4. Wait, no, butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, it's (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? No, butanenitrile is four carbons in total, with the nitrile at the end. So, the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, wait, butane is four carbons. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN-CH2? Maybe I should write it as CH2CH2CH2CN. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the structure is CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN. So, it's a four-carbon chain, with the nitrile on the fourth carbon, and the OH and methyl on the second carbon.

So, how does that happen? From butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. Reacting with NaCN. The mechanism is probably the formation of a cyanohydrin. The CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen gets a negative charge, which is protonated. So, under what conditions does this happen?

Wait, but for the formation of a cyanohydrin, the reagent is typically a source of cyanide, like NaCN, and an acid catalyst. Because the ketone needs to be activated. So, maybe the reaction is done with an acid, which protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, so the CN- can attack.

So in the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+ (acid). That makes sense. So A is H3O+.

So looking at the options, which ones have A as H3O+? Let's see the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl.

Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH.

So options A and B have A as H3O+. So for the first reaction
