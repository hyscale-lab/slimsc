Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio problem. Hmm, let's see. The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops. I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions that produce energy in the Sun, and there are different branches. The main ones are pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh right, the pp-III branch is responsible for producing a lot of high-energy neutrinos, specifically the ones in the 800-900 keV range, I think.

Wait, the question says that the pp-III branch stops suddenly about 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at the speed of light, which takes about 8 minutes to reach Earth from the Sun, that means the neutrinos produced before the stop would still be reaching us now, but any produced after the stop wouldn't. So the flux we detect now is from the neutrinos emitted before the branching stopped.

So, the pp-III branch is the dominant source for high-energy neutrinos. If it stops, then the production of those high-energy neutrinos (like in band 2, 800-900 keV) would drop. But what about the lower band, 700-800 keV (band 1)?

I recall that neutrinos in the lower energy range, like around 200 keV, come from the main pp-I branch. But wait, there's also the pp-II branch. Oh right, the pp-II branch produces a bit of neutrinos in the mid-range, maybe like 400-500 keV. But band 1 is 700-800, which is higher than that. Hmm.

Wait, the pp-III branch is the one that produces the highest energy neutrinos. So, if pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos (like band 2) would be reduced. But what about band 1? Are those produced by other branches?

I think the main sources of solar neutrinos are the pp chain and the CNO cycle. The CNO cycle produces neutrinos in a different energy range, but I'm not sure if they contribute to these bands. Let me think: the CNO neutrinos are higher energy, around 1-10 MeV. So bands 1 and 2 are in the 0.
