Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, parallax and distance are related, right? I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh wait, the formula is plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs), I think. So if distance (r) increases, parallax decreases.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. So, we need to find how N depends on r. Let's break this down.

First, the given relationship is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But plx is related to distance. Since plx = 1/r (where r is in parsecs), that means plx = 1/r. So substituting that into the equation, N would be proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Wait, let me write that out:

N ∝ 1/( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5. Oh, so N is proportional to r^5? That would mean the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. But wait, that seems a bit odd because I thought that as you look further away, you wouldn't see exponentially more stars. Or maybe in this specific region, that's the case?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let
