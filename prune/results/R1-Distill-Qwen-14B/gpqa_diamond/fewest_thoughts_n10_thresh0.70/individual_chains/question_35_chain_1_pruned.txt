Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, I need to figure out the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix Ay.

Wait, wait. So, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Right, for any matrix, the eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0. So I'll have to compute that.

But before that, let me write down the matrix Ay. Since Ay = c * S, and c is h/(4π), I can compute each element.

So, the matrix S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Multiplying by c (h/(4π)), the matrix Ay becomes:
[ 0   -i * c ]
[ i * c  0 ]

Plugging in c = h/(4π), we get:
Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So the matrix Ay is:
[ 0, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

Hmm, but maybe it's easier to factor out the c and work with S first since it's a simple 2x2 matrix. Because when dealing with eigenvalues, the scaling factor c will just scale the eigenvalues. So maybe I can find the eigenvalues of S first and then multiply by c to get those of Ay.

Right, because if Ay = c * S, then the eigenvalues of Ay are c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S.

So let's find the eigenvalues of S. The matrix S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

The trace of S is 0 + 0 = 0. The determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = 0 - (-(-1)) because i^2 = -1. So determinant is 0 - (1) = -1.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that again. The determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - [ (-i)(i) ].

(-i)*(i) equals -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is 0 - [ (-i)(i) ] = 0 - (1) = -1.

So the characteristic equation is λ^2 - trace(S) * λ + det(S) = 0. Since the trace is zero, the equation becomes λ^2 - 0 + (-1) = 0 → λ^2 = 1. So the eigenvalues are λ = ±1.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of S are +1 and -1. So when we scale by c, the eigenvalues of Ay will be c*1 and c*(-1), so c and -c. 

Since c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues a are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the real parts are h/(4π) and -h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. Because these are real numbers.

Wait, but the options are talking about eigenvalues with imaginary parts. Hmm. Let me look at the options again.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and the real parts are ±h/(4π). That can't be right because our eigenvalues are purely real.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, but our eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Unless perhaps I did a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. Let me think again. Oh wait! Maybe I made a mistake in the matrix. Because in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices are usually scaled. For example, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but in some cases, the spin matrices are defined as (σ_x/2), etc. Wait, let me think about the structure of S.

Wait, the matrix S given is:

Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

Wait, this looks like the standard form of the Pauli Y matrix, but scaled. Wait, the standard Pauli Y matrix is:

σ_y = [ 0, -i ]
        [ i, 0 ]

So S is exactly σ_y. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. The eigenvalues of σ_y are indeed ±1.

So the eigenvalues of S are ±1. Therefore, when multiplied by c, the eigenvalues of Ay will be c*(±1) → ±c.

So the eigenvalues of Ay are ± (h/(4π)).

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are matching. Let me check the options again.

Option A: Im parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, that's a mix of real and imaginary, but our a are real.

Option B: Im parts ±1/2, real ±1. Hmm, but according to our calculation, the eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts should be zero. So B is suggesting some imaginary parts, which can't be right.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az. Let me think. In quantum mechanics, the components of angular momentum are related. For spin-1/2 particles, the eigenfunctions of S_y are not eigenfunctions of S_z, because [S_x, S_z] = iħ, etc. So, if a function is an eigenfunction of S_y, it's not an eigenfunction of S_z. But what about S^2? The square of the spin operator is S^2 = (S_x^2 + S_y^2 + S_z^2), which commutes with any component. So eigenfunctions of S_y are also eigenfunctions of S^2.

So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. That seems correct because A^2 would have the same eigenfunctions as Ay, but Az would not.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given. Well, I'm not sure what that means. Basis functions of the matrix operator? Perhaps it's referring to the eigenvectors as forming a basis. But any 2x2 matrix with distinct eigenvalues has eigenvectors that form a basis. So D could be correct, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but in the options, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Maybe that's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So D is a correct statement.

Wait, but the question is during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation, so perhaps I should look for which is correct.

But let's go back to the problem. The question is about the statements during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So which of the options
