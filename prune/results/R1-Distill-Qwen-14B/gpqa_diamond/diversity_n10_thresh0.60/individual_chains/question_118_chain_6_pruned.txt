Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. Hmm, I need to figure out what the major product is from that reaction.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material. 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So, cyclopentene is a five-membered ring with one double bond. The double bond is in position 1, so that's between carbons 1 and 2. The 'enol' part means there's an alcohol group next to a double bond. Wait, enol structure is like an alcohol adjacent to a double bond, right?

So, cyclopent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents would be on C4 since it's 4,4-dimethyl. So the cyclopentane ring has two methyl groups on the same carbon (C4). Now, the enol part: the -OH group is on which carbon? Enol usually has the -OH on a carbon adjacent to the double bond. Wait, in cyclopentenol, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the hydroxyl (-OH) is on C2? Or maybe C1? Wait, no, because the numbering. Let's imagine the cyclopentene ring. Let me number the carbons clockwise: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

So the double bond is between
