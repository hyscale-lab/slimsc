Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, diatomic means it's made of two atoms, X and Y. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Right, because in a rigid rotor, the bond length doesn't change, but in the non-rigid one, maybe it does a bit, allowing for some vibration.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So for vibration, that's the ground state where the vibration quantum number is zero. And for rotation, I think the fundamental state would be the lowest rotational energy level, which is the ground state as well. So I guess the molecule is in the state where both rotation and vibration are in their lowest energy states.

The question is asking what momentum an absorbed photon should have so that the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, the next stateâ€”so probably the next higher energy state. But which transition are they talking about? Rotation or vibration?

Wait, the model combines both rotation and vibration. So the molecule's energy comes from both rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state (lowest energy) would have the lowest rotational and vibrational levels. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state, but I need to figure out whether that's a rotation or vibration transition.

But to switch to the next state, I think it's the smallest possible energy increment. So photon absorption would cause a transition where the molecule goes to the next higher energy state. So the photon's
