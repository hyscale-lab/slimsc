Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me start by breaking down each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in the IR usually correspond to O-H stretching. The broadness suggests it's from an alcohol (-OH) or maybe a carboxylic acid, but the presence of other peaks might help determine that. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be another carbonyl group, but maybe from an amide or perhaps conjugated carbonyl like in an aromatic ring. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with substituents like a carbonyl.

Next, the ¹H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, so the compound must have a double bond, probably in a conjugated system maybe. So structures like alkenes, maybe with substituents.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think, possible fragments with 45: maybe a methyl ester group? Or perhaps an ethyl group with some oxygen, like a CH2O or similar. Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of CH3OCH2CH3 (but that's more like 76). Alternatively, perhaps a fragment like CH2OCH2? Wait, no. Or maybe a propyl group with some oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone fragment. Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2CO, which is 58. No, that's over. Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me think, the possible ions. 45 could be CH3CO+ (43), but 45 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe CH2O (formaldehyde is 30), but that's lower. Hmm, perhaps it's the methyl ester: like OCH2CH3 would add up to 45? Wait, no. Let me calculate the molecular weights.

If the molecular formula is, say, C6H10O2, what's the molecular weight? 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 2*16=32. Total is 72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion would be around 114. But the fragment is at 45. So that's about 45. Let me think about possible fragments from each formula.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. MW is 6*12 +12 +32 = 72+12+32=116.

Option B: C6H10O. MW is 6*12 +10 +16=72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. 72 +10 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O. 72 +12 +16=100.

So the mass spec shows a peak at 45. Let's think about what fragments could give m/z=45.

45 could be a fragment from an ester. For example, in an ester, if the molecule breaks between the carbonyl and the ester oxygen, you might get a fragment with a methyl group attached to an oxygen. Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a ketene, but that's less likely. Alternatively, perhaps a propionyl group or something else.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 could be CH3CO-O-R cleaving, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's think about the possible functional groups.

The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an -OH group (like alcohol or maybe carboxylic acid). But the presence of a carbonyl at 1700 suggests something else. If it's an alcohol and a carbonyl, perhaps an ester? Esters have two carbonyl groups? Wait no, esters have an ester carbonyl. Wait, no, esters have one carbonyl: the R-O-C-O-R' structure? No, wait, ester structure is R-O-CO-R', so one carbonyl group at around 1700 cm⁻¹. But wait, the IR shows peaks at 1700 and 1650. So maybe two carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one carbonyl and another functional group, like conjugated double bonds.

Wait, another possibility: the two IR peaks correspond to a carbonyl (like a ketone,
