Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula for an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions the techniques used: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options provided are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Let's look at the FTIR data first. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in this region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, waitâ€”carboxylic acids have a broader and stronger O-H stretch, maybe around 2500-3300. But sometimes alcohols can also show a broad peak, but it might be less broad than a carboxylic acid. So I'm thinking this could be an alcohol or something with an O-H group.

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 peak is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or possibly an aromatic ring (like a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an amide, but we don't have nitrogen info). Wait, maybe it's an ester. Because esters have two carbonyls? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with some conjugation? Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl and an aromatic ring stretch, but I'm not entirely sure.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl groups are CH2=CH- or similar, so this suggests the presence of a double bond, maybe in an alkene or part of a ring. So the compound likely has some sort of unsaturation, like a double bond or a ring.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass for certain functional groups. For example, the tropylium ion (C7H7+) has a mass around 91, but wait, 45 is half of that. Alternatively, maybe it's the
