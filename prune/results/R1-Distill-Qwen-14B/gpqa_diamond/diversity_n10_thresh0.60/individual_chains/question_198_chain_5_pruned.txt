Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The solution contains cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate. The given concentrations are [Co] = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, so stability constants are for different complexes. So each β corresponds to a different complex. Let me think: for metal complexes, the stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. For example, for Co(SCN)^n-, the β would be the formation constant.

But I'm a bit confused about how the complexes are structured here. Cobalt can form various complexes with thiocyanate. Let me think: cobalt is in +2 oxidation state. Thiocyanate is SCN-. So possible complexes could be Co(SCN)_n^(2- n) ?

I remember that the stability constant increases with the number of ligands up to a point. Wait, no, that's not always true. It depends on the ligands and the metal. But in this case, the given β values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, so β increases from β1 to β3, then drops for β4. That's a bit odd, but maybe because the complexes change structure or geometry.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Blue is typically associated with Co(SCN)_2^- or something like that. Wait, I think the blue color is for [Co(SCN)_2]^2-, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, Co(SCN) is pink, and [Co(SCN)_2]^2- is blue? I remember that [Co(SCN)]^2+ is pink, and when more SCN- is added, it forms [Co(SCN)_2]^2− which is blue. So the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2−, right?
