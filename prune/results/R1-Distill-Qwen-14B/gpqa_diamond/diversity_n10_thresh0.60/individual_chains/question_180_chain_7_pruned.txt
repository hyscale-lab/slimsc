Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about an isolated system of identical particles with charge and some fixed positions. The question is about finding the minimum energy of the system.

Alright, let's break it down. The system has 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. I remember that e is the elementary charge, which is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each particle has a charge of 2 * 1.602e-19 C, which is 3.204e-19 C. But wait, maybe I should just keep it as 2e for now to avoid rounding errors.

Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P has one charge, and all the other 12 are arranged in some way around it, each at a distance of 2 meters from P.

Wait, but the 12 charges are at 2m from P, which is where the 13th charge is fixed. So each of these 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from point P, which has the 13th charge. So the setup is like the 13th charge at the center, and 12 others arranged around it on a sphere with radius 2m.

Now, the energy of the system. Oh right, when you have a system of charges, the electrostatic potential energy is the work done to assemble them. Since they are point charges, the potential energy comes from the interactions between each pair of charges.

Wait, but the problem says it's an isolated system. So, I guess we're considering all the interactions between the charges. But since the 13th is fixed, maybe some terms are considered differently.

Wait, but actually, no. The potential energy in a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for each pair of charges, we calculate the potential energy and add them all together.

So let's think: There are 13 charges. Each of the 12 charges at 2m away from P (which hosts the 13th charge). So each of these 12 is at distance 2m from the 13th charge.
