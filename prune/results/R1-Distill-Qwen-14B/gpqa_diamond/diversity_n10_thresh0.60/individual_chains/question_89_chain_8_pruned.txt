Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a four-fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromo would have Br atoms on two of the bridgehead carbons, probably opposite each other.

Heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's an elimination reaction. But wait, since there are two bromine atoms, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. In such cases, two elimination steps might occur. Wait, but when you have two adjacent bromines (like vicinal dihalides), elimination could form an alkene. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't adjacent. Oh, wait, in adamantane, the 1 and 3 positions are across from each other, so maybe the structure isn't adjacent but on opposite ends. Hmm, maybe the KOH would cause each Br to leave, but I'm not sure. Wait, KOH might actually deprotonate, but in this case, since it's a dihalide, perhaps it's a double elimination. Wait, when you have two bromines on adamantane, heating with strong base could lead to dehydrohalogenation twice, forming a diene? Or maybe just one elimination, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination leading to a conjugated
