Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X. It says that X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 

Another part mentions a product of a certain keto acid reacting with X, which contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. The question is about calculating the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering isotopes.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by figuring out what each part might be.

First, Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y. Violent reactions often involve things like metals reacting with acids. If Y is a liquid, maybe it's something like water or an acid. Wait, but when metals react violently with water, it's usually sodium or potassium. But those are solids, right? Alternatively, if Y is an acid, maybe it's something else.

Wait, the reaction produces a precipitate G. So perhaps it's a double displacement reaction. For example, if X is a metal and Y is a salt solution, but Y is a liquidâ€”maybe Y is something like concentrated sulfuric acid or another strong acid.

The gas W released has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about gases produced in such reactions. Could it be hydrogen gas? Because H2 has one proton and one neutron each, so each molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons? Wait, no. Wait, each molecule of H2 has 2 atoms. Each H atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (since hydrogen's most common isotope is H, with no neutrons). So H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons in total per molecule. But the question says the same number of neutrons and protons. So that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe CO2? Each CO2 molecule has... carbon has 6 protons, oxygen has 8 each. So for CO2, 6 protons from C and 16 from O (2 O atoms *8 each). Total protons: 6 + 1
