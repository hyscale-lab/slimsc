Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. Oh wait, right, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed is when the mass passes through the equilibrium point. But since this is relativistic, I think we'll have to use the relativistic equations of motion or energy.

So, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), where k is the spring constant, and A is the amplitude. Looking at the options, option C is exactly that. But wait, the question is relativistic, so C must be the non-relativistic case and not the correct answer here.

Right, in relativity, things get more complicated because the energy isn't just kinetic; you have to consider total energy which includes rest mass energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic plus potential energy.

The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic is (1/2)mv². But relativistically, kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So the total energy would be E = γmc². But wait, in SHM, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². So perhaps I should set this equal to the relativistic energy.

Wait, maybe I need to think about energy conservation. The total mechanical energy (classical) is (1/2)kA², but in relativity, the energy is higher because of the γ factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy in the relativistic case is the sum of the rest energy and the oscillation energy. Hmm, no, I think the total energy E is mc² plus the kinetic and potential energies.

Wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the energy is conserved, so the total mechanical energy is E = (1/2)kA². But relativistically, the kinetic energy is different. So maybe E = (1/2)kA² = (γ - 1)mc² ?

Wait no, I think that's not right. Because in the relativistic scenario, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all energy is potential, and when it's at equilibrium, all is kinetic. So at the equilibrium point, the kinetic energy is maximum.

So, the potential energy at maximum displacement (x=A) is (1/2)kA². That's the same as the total mechanical energy. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc². So when the mass is at equilibrium (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So setting E = (1/2)kA² equal to (γ - 1)mc².

Wait, but wait, the total energy should also include the rest mass energy. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me write down what I know:

In classical mechanics, at x=0, all energy is kinetic. So E = (1/2)mv_max².

But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy is E = γ mc².
