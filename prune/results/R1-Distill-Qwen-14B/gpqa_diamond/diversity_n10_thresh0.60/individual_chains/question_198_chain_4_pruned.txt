Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and see what's being asked.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, wait. So first, I need to understand what these stability constants mean. Stability constants, β, are the equilibrium constants for the formation of complexes. So for each complex, the higher the β, the more stable the complex is. 

The complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^2−, where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. The β values are the formation constants from the previous complex to the next. Like, β1 is for Co(SCN)²+ forming Co(SCN)₂²+, and so on. Or wait, maybe βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex. Like β1 is K for Co(SCN)²+, β2 is K for Co(SCN)₂²+, etc. I think that's how it works.

So the complexes would be:
- Co²+ (free ion)
- Co(SCN)²+ (β1)
- Co(SCN)₂²+ (β1 * β2)
- Co(SCN)₃²+ (β1 * β2 * β3)
- Co(SCN)₄²+ (β1 * β2 * β3 * β4)

But wait, I'm not sure about that. Another possibility is that β1 is for the first complex, and each βn is the step-wise formation constant. So the overall β for the nth complex would be the product of β1 through βn. So for example, Co(SCN)₂²+ would have an overall β of β1 * β2.

Wait, let me think. Stability constants for complexes are often given as stepwise or overall constants. Stepwise is the constant for adding one ligand each time. So the first complex, Co(SCN)²+, has a β1 of 9. The second complex, Co(SCN)₂²+, would form by adding another SCN- to Co(SCN)²+. So the stepwise β2 is 40. So the overall β for Co(SCN)₂²+ would be β1 * β2 = 9 * 40 = 360.

Similarly, β3 is 63, so the overall β for Co(SCN)₃²+ is 9 *40 *63 = 22680. And β4 is 16, so for Co(SCN)₄²+, it's 9*40*63*16 = let's see, 9*40 is 360, 360*63 is 22680, 22680 *16 is 362880.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN- ions, so Co(SCN)₂²+ is the dithiocyanato complex. So we need to find the concentration of Co(SCN)₂²+ relative to all possible Co species.

So the plan is to calculate the fraction of each Co species and then find the percentage contributed by Co(SCN)₂²+.

The general approach for such problems is to use the stability constants to calculate the fraction of each complex in solution, given the concentrations of the metal ion and the ligand.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is based on the stability constants and the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN-.

The fractions are calculated using the formula:
