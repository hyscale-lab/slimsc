Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

The problem says that the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, Ay, is represented by a 2x2 matrix. It's given by Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a specific 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and determine which statement is correct.

Wait, I remember that the spin matrices for particles like electrons or muons (which have spin 1/2) are similar to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are 2x2 and used for spin-1/2 systems. Let me recall, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Oh right, and each has eigenvalues ±1.

So in this problem, S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me write that out:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Hmm, wait a second. The standard Pauli Y matrix is usually written as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so that's exactly S here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is σy.

Given that, the operator Ay is c multiplied by σy. Since c is h/(4π), let's compute Ay. 

So Ay = (h/4π) * σy.

Wait, but when you're finding the eigenvalues of an operator like this, you can often find the eigenvalues of σy first and then scale them by c.

The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So σy has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Therefore, multiplying by c would give eigenvalues of c*1 and c*(-1), so c and -c.

So substituting c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

But wait, the options given are about the eigenvalues in terms of h and π. Let me check the options.

Option A says the imaginary parts are +2πh or -2πh. Hmm, but our eigenvalues are real
