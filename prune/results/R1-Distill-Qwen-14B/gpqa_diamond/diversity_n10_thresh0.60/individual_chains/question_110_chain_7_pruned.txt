Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I need to recall what each spectrograph can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait—brighter than 17? So that means apparent V mag less than or equal to 17, right? Because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects. So, for a star to be detected by ESPRESSO, its apparent V magnitude should be ≤17.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, apparent V mag ≤16.

So the question is asking which stars are detectable by both. That means the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and ≤16 (so HIRES can see it). Wait, but wait—if a star is brighter (apparent mag ≤16), both can see it, because 16 is less than 17. So the stars that can be detected by both would have apparent V mag ≤16.

Wait, no, wait. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17 mag, HIRES up to 16. So for a star to be detected by both, the apparent V mag must be ≤16. Because if it's 17, HIRES can't detect it, but ESPRESSO can. So only stars with mag ≤16 can be seen by both.

Wait, but that's just one part. I also need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star because some only give absolute magnitude or other parameters.

Let me look at each star:

Star1: Absolute V mag is 15.5, distance is 10 pc. So apparent mag is calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log (d/10). So d=10, so m =15.5 + 5*(10/10 log) = 15.5 + 5*1 =20.5. So m=20.5 mag. That's way above both 17 and 16. So neither ESPRESSO nor HIRES can detect it. So Star1 is out.
