Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). That looks a bit like a 2D metric because it's in terms of dx and dy, not any other coordinates. Wait, so it's a two-dimensional spacetime? Or is it embedded in a higher dimension? Not sure, but probably a 2D space for this problem.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. I remember that in general relativity, a pseudosphere (or more commonly called a sphere in some contexts) in 2D would have an area. Wait, but pseudosphere is a term sometimes used for a surface of constant negative curvature, like a hyperbolic space. Oh wait, no, a pseudosphere has an imaginary radius, but maybe in this context, it's about a sphere with a specific radius.

Wait, the metric provided is in terms of x and y. So maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in higher dimensions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conformal metric because it's written as a function multiplied by (dx² + dy²). The function here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the metric is conformally flat, which means it's a conformal transformation of the flat metric.

Conformal factors can change the geometry, like the curvature. I'm trying to remember how to compute the area in such a metric. The area element in a 2D metric ds² = g_{xx}(dx² + dy²) would be sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant. Wait, no, because in 2D, if the metric is diagonal with g_{xx} = g_{yy} = f(x,y), then the area element is f(x,y) dx dy.

So in this case, the conformal factor is (32)/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA is sqrt(g_{xx} g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2}) dx dy. But since the metric is diagonal (no cross terms), it's just g_{xx} dx dy. So dA = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

But wait, wait, no. The area element in a 2D metric is usually given by sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is (g_{xx})(g_{yy}) - 0, which is just (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait, no, wait. Wait, the metric is ds² = g_{xx} dx² + g_{yy} dy². So the determinant is g_{xx} * g_{yy} - (g_{xy})^2. But in this case, g_{xy} is zero, so determinant is (32/(4 - x^2 - y^2})^2? Hmm, wait no. Let me think again. The metric tensor components are g_{xx} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), same as g_{yy}, because the term is (dx² + dy²) multiplied by that factor. So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y^2))^2 - 0 = (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y^2)^2. So the area element is sqrt(det) dx dy, which would be (32)/(4 - x² - y^2) dx dy.

Wait, that's right because sqrt( (32)^2 ) is 32, and the denominator is (4 - x² - y^2)^2, whose square root is (4 - x² - y^2). So yeah, dA = 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

So to find the total area, I need to integrate dA over all x and y where the metric is valid. The denominator is 4 -x² - y^2; we can't have that being zero because that would make the metric singular. So the domain where the metric is defined is 4 -x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So the region is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin in the x-y plane.

So the area is the integral of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy over the region x² + y² < 4.

Hmm, this looks like a situation where polar coordinates would be helpful. Let me switch to polar coordinates where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, and dx dy = r dr dθ. The denominator becomes 4 - r².

So the integral becomes:

Integral from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this step by step. The integrand is (32 r)/(4 - r²). So we can separate the integrals:

32 * ∫(θ=0 to 2π) dθ * ∫(r=0 to 2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

The θ integral is straightforward: ∫ dθ from 0 to 2π is 2π.

So the area is 32 * 2π * ∫(0 to 2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute that integral. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 becomes ∫ [r / u] dr = ∫ (1/u) * (-1/2) du.

Wait, when r=0, u=4 -0=4. When r=2, u=4 -4=0.

So substituting, the integral becomes:

∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) * (-1/2) du.

The negative sign can flip the integration limits:

(1/2) ∫ (from u=0 to u=4) (1/u) du.

But wait, ∫(1/u) du is ln|u| + C. So evaluating from 0 to 4 will give ln(4) - ln(0). But ln(0) is negative infinity. Oh wait, so the integral diverges to infinity?

Wait, that can't be right because at r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the integrand becomes large. So the area might be infinite.

But wait, the denominator is (4 - r²), which becomes zero at r=2. So near r=2, the integrand behaves like (r)/(4 - r²) ≈ 2/(4 - r²). So as r approaches 2, the term 1/(4 - r²) behaves like 1/(distance to r=2), which is similar to an integral of 1/(a - x) dx near x=a, which diverges.

So the integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 is divergent. Because as r approaches 2, the integrand goes to infinity. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but the problem is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So if the area is infinite, then the answer must be D) +infty.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me double-check the setup.

The metric is given, and the pseudosphere's area is being asked. The pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. In 2D, the area of a pseudosphere (which is an infinite surface) is infinite. But wait, maybe in some models, like the Poincaré disk model, the entire hyperbolic plane has infinite area.

Wait, but the metric given is similar to the Poincaré disk metric. The Poincaré disk model has metric ds² = (4/(1 - x² - y²)^2) (dx² + dy²), right? But in our case, the metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which can be written as 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4) = 4(1 - (r²/4)), so the metric becomes (32)/[4 (1 - (r²/4)))] = 8 / (1 - (r²/4)), so (8/(1 - r²/4)) (dx² + dy²). So it's similar to the Poincaré disk with a scaling.

Wait, the Poincaré disk has metric (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²). So if our metric is (8/(1 - r²/4)) (dr² + r² dθ²), let me see:

Wait, in our case, the conformal factor is 32/(4 - r²). Let me write that as 32/(4(1 - (r²/4))) ) = 8/(1 - (r²/4)). So 8/(1 - (r²/4)). 

The Poincaré disk has a conformal factor of 4/(1 - r²)^2. Hmm, but that's different from our case. So perhaps our metric is different, but the important thing is whether the area is finite or not.

In the Poincaré disk model, the area of the entire hyperbolic plane is infinite. So if our metric represents a hyperbolic plane or something similar, the area would be infinite.

Wait, but our metric is defined for r² <4, so x² + y² <4. So the area is over a finite region? No, because even within that finite radius, the integrand can diverge at r=2. So the area integral may still be infinite.

Wait, earlier when I calculated the area integral, I found that it diverges. So the area is infinite, which would mean option D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again about the problem.

Wait, the question specifies the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, wait, in 2D, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, but it's usually a surface embedded in 3D. However, in 2D, the hyperbolic plane is a surface that can be represented with such a metric, and it's infinite in extent.

Wait, so the area would be infinite, so the answer is D.

But wait, the options are A) 0, B)4π(x² + y²), C)4π(x² - y²), D) +infty.

So the correct answer should be D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D surface in terms of coordinates \(x\) and \(y\). The task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). 

### Step 1: Understanding the Metric
The metric is conformally flat, meaning it is a scaled version of the flat Euclidean metric. The conformal factor is \(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\), which modifies the geometry of the space. The region where the metric is defined is \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), as the denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) must remain positive to avoid singularities.

### Step 2: Area Element
The area element in a 2D metric is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\text{det}(g)} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \(\text{det}(g)\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant is:

\[
\text{det}(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

### Step 3: Total Area
To compute the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over the entire region \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\) separates, leaving:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

### Step 4: Evaluating the Radial Integral
Let \(u = 4 - r^2\), so \(du = -2r \, dr\), or \(-\frac{1}{2} du = r \, dr\). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = \int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{1}{2}}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u|\), so:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

As \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\), the integral diverges to infinity. This indicates that the total area is infinite.

### Step 5: Conclusion
The metric describes a surface with infinite area, consistent with the properties of a pseudosphere (a surface of constant negative curvature). Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.
