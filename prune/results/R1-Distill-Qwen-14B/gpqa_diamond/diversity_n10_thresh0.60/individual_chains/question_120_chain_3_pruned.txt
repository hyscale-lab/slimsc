Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, let's try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance in astronomy. The formula I recall is that the distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax (plx), so d = 1/plx. Oh wait, that makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes. So if plx is small, the star is far away.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. Let me think about how the distribution works. If stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means that the number density of stars doesn't depend on distance. So in any direction, the number of stars in a certain volume is the same, regardless of how far away you look.

Wait, but when we talk about the number per unit parallax, we're essentially looking at how many stars fall into a range of plx values. So if I pick a small range in plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Let's model this. Let's say the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is N. Since the distribution is uniform in space, the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. So I need to find the volume corresponding to a range of parallaxes.

Wait, the parallax relates to distance. So for a given parallax plx, the distance is d = 1/plx
