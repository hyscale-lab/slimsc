Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Hmm, let me try to think through this. The question is about the possible decay products of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV.

So the problem gives an interaction Lagrangian: L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I might have misread that. Oh wait, perhaps it's L(y) equals negative lambda times some fermion field terms. Let me parse that again. Oh, maybe it's -λ multiplied by f, which is the fermion field, and then the product of ψ_f, which is maybe the Dirac psi for the fermion, and then (ῡ + X(y)) and another ψ_f. So perhaps the interaction term is something like λ times the fermion fields multiplied by the boson field X.

But maybe more importantly, the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So the question is about what it can decay into at the lowest order. I remember that for a boson to decay into fermions, the fermions must be a pair (like a quark and antiquark or lepton and antilepton) and their combined rest mass must be less than the mass of the boson.

Wait, the process would be something like X → f f̄. So each fermion f must have a mass such that 2m_f ≤ m_X. Because each fermion contributes m_f, so two of them require 2m_f ≤ m_X.

Wait, but wait, in reality, the mass of the X is the energy available in the center-of-mass frame, so for the decay products to be possible, each particle's mass must be less than half of X's mass, or the sum of their rest masses must be less than X's mass. But for a fermion pair, it's 2m_f (since each is m_f) so 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So m_X is 6 GeV. So each fermion's mass must be less than or equal to 3 GeV, because 6 GeV / 2 = 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, wait. Fermions have different masses. Let me list the known fermion masses:

- Up quark: around 2 MeV, negligible compared to 3 GeV.
- Down quark: similar, maybe 4-5 MeV.
- Strange quark: ~100 MeV.
- Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV.
- Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV.
- Top quark: way too heavy, 173 GeV, so way above 3 GeV.
Leptons:
- Electron: ~0.5 MeV.
- Muon: ~105 MeV.
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV.
- Neutrinos: very light, negligible.

So for each fermion f, if m_f ≤ 3 GeV, then 2m_f ≤6 GeV. So let's see which fermions satisfy m_f ≤3 GeV.

Charm quark is 1.5 GeV, which is okay. Bottom is 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So bottom quarks are too heavy.

Similarly, the tau lepton is about 1.78 GeV, so each tau is about 1.78 GeV, so two taus would be 3.56 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV? Wait wait, no, wait. If X is 6 GeV, then for a decay into tau pairs, the total mass would be 2 * 1.78 GeV = ~3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, that's allowed.

Wait, wait wait. I think I got that wrong. The threshold is that the total rest mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the boson. So for X → tau+
