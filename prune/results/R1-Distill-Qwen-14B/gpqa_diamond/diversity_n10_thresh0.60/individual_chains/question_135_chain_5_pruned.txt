Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y). And the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. We need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion pairs.

Wait, so X is a boson, and it's interacting with fermions. The Lagrangian looks like it's a Yukawa coupling kind of interaction. In Yukawa theory, the interaction term is something like g ψ ψ X, where X is a scalar boson. So the decay of X would be into two fermions, right? Because the interaction is between X and a fermion-antifermion pair.

So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair as long as energy allows. So the mass of X is 6 GeV, so each of the decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but each fermion pair's mass must be less than or equal to 6 GeV, right? Because the rest mass of the two particles can't exceed the available energy. So for each possible fermion pair, I need to check if two times the fermion mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because when X decays into a fermion and antifermion, each has mass m, so 2m <= MX.

Wait, no. Because when a particle at rest decays into two particles, their combined rest mass must be less than or equal to the mass of the original. So for each fermion f, the mass of f is m_f. Then for X → f f̄, we must have 2 m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

So let's list the fermions and their masses. Let me think about the standard model fermions:

Leptons:
- e⁻, mass ≈ 0.0005 GeV
- μ⁻, ≈ 0.
