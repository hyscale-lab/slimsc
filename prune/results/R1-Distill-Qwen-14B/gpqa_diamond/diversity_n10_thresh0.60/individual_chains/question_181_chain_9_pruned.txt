Okay, so I need to figure out the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands after the pp-III branch stops in the Sun. Hmm, let me think about what I know about the Sun's energy production and neutrino emission.

First, the Sun's core is where most of the fusion happens, right? The proton-proton chain (pp) is the main process, and there are different branches. Oh wait, the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. So the question says that the pp-III branch has stopped. I should remember what each branch contributes.

I remember that the pp-III branch involves the fusion of three helium-4 nuclei into carbon-12. Oh wait, no, actually, pp-I is the main branch where two protons fuse into deuterium, then another proton to form helium-3, and then the two helium-3s fuse into helium-4. The pp-II branch is when a helium-3 captures a helium-4 to make carbon-12. And the pp-III branch... wait, I might be mixing this up. Let me think. Oh right, the pp-III branch is where a carbon-12 nucleus captures two protons to form carbon-14, which then captures an electron to become nitrogen-14. Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused with the CNO cycle. No, the CNO cycle is a different process, involving carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.

Wait, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain. So, in the pp chain, the main pathway is pp-I, but when conditions are a bit different, you get other branches. So, the pp-III branch is, I think, when a carbon-12 nucleus captures two protons to form carbon-14, and then undergoes a beta decay to become nitrogen-14. But that's not a major part of the energy production. Or wait, maybe the pp-III branch is where a helium-3 nucleus captures a helium-3 to form carbon-8, which then captures a proton to become carbon-9. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is the one that produces boron, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the question says that the pp-III branch stops. So the other branches like pp-I and pp-II might continue. Or does the question mean that all other reactions remain as they were except for the pp-III? The question says, "all other reactions remained as they were." So, stopping the pp-III, but pp-I and pp-II continue. So, if pp-III was producing some neutrinos, and now it's stopped, the neutrino flux from that source would drop.

But wait, neutrinos are produced in various processes in the Sun. The main ones are the pp chain and the CNO cycle. I think the pp chain is the dominant source of neutrinos in the Sun's core. The CNO cycle contributes more at higher densities and temperatures, but the Sun's core is mostly pp chain.

In the pp chain, the main neutrino production is during the beta decay steps. For example, in the pp-I branch, a proton (¹H) fuses with another to form a deuterium (²H). Then another proton fuses with deuterium, creating a helium-3 (³He) and a positron and a neutrino. So each time a deuterium captures a proton, a neutrino is emitted. Similarly, in the pp-II branch, when two helium-3s fuse into a helium-4, this also emits neutrinos, I think.

Wait, but the pp-III branch, if it's a branch where a helium-3 captures a helium-4, perhaps that also produces neutrinos. Or maybe the pp-III branch is the one where a carbon-12 is formed, but that's probably part of the CNO cycle. Or perhaps I should think about neutrino types. The Sun emits electron neutrinos (ν_e) primarily because the beta decays in the fusion processes emit ν_e. So when the pp-III branch stops, the emission of ν_e from that process would stop.

But the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the neutrino flux in these bands would change if the pp-III branch stops.

Wait, neutrinos from different processes have different energies. For example, the main neutrinos from the pp chain are around 0.5 MeV or so. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact energies. The pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, while the pp-III might produce higher-energy ones? Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp chain (pp-I) emits neutrinos of around ~0.4 MeV, and the other branches (pp-II and pp-III) may emit higher-energy neutrinos. Or maybe it's the opposite. I'm not
