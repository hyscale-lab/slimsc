Okay, so I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let's read it carefully. 

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So first, I should probably find the normalization factor because the state needs to be a unit vector. But wait, the question is about the probabilities of measuring in the eigenstates of another operator, not the spin-z operator. Oh right, this other operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. So I need to find the eigenstates of this operator because the measurement probabilities are based on projecting |alpha> onto those eigenstates.

Wait, let's structure the steps. 

First, I should find the normalized state |alpha>. The given state is proportional, so I need to compute the norm. The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2-i) for |down>. The norm squared is |1+i|² + |2-i|². 

|1+i|² is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. 
|2 - i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So total squared norm is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Next, I need to consider the operator A with matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i
