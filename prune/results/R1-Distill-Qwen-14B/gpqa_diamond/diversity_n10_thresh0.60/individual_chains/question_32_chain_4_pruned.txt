Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I remember that Lithium typically has 3 protons, so if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope must be Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons, so that's Li-6.

So, the first thing I need to do is find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. I think the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 atomic mass units (u). But wait, I should double-check that. Alternatively, maybe each nucleon (proton and neutron) has a mass of approximately 1.007276 u for protons and 1.008665 u for neutrons. Wait, no, that's for individual protons and neutrons. For a nucleus, I can approximate the mass as the sum of the individual masses. But wait, actually, the exact mass of the nucleus would be lower due to binding energy, but I think for the purpose of this problem, we'll use the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. Let me calculate that.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So, mass = 3 * (mass of proton) + 3 * (mass of neutron). The proton mass is about 1.007276 u, and neutron is about 1.008665 u. So calculating that:

3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u
3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u
Total: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u.

Wait, but I've heard that the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 u. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Oh, right! Because when you add up the masses of the individual nucleons, you get a higher value than the nucleus because of the mass defect due to binding energy. So, the actual rest mass of Li-6 is lower. Maybe I should look
