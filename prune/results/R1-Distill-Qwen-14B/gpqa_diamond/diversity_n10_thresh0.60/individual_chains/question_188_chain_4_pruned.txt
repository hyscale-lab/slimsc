Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Let me think about this step by step.

Wait, a rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So the lattice is rhombohedral, which is a special case where a = b = c, and α = β = γ. In this problem, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, but wait, interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms along the edge. So does that mean a, the lattice parameter, is 10 Angstroms? Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is the same as a. But wait, no, because a rhombohedral structure isn't simple cubic. Wait, no, wait— the interatomic distance is the length of the edge of the lattice cell. So a = 10 Angstroms, because it's the distance between adjacent atoms along the edges. Oh wait, but wait, in rhombohedral structures, all edges are same, so a = b = c. So that's correct.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think the formula for interplanar distance d is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices multiplied by some terms involving the lattice parameters and the angles. Oh right, the general formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos γ)/(a²) - 2(hl cos β)/(a²) - 2(kl cos α)/(a²)

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, for a general hexagonal crystal, but this is rhombohedral, which is a special case of hexagonal? Or wait, no, hexagonal has different angles. Wait, rhombohedral is a special case of a cubic system with all edges equal and all angles equal but not 90 degrees. So maybe the formula is similar to the cubic case but with some correction for the angles.

Wait, the more precise formula I think is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ) ]^-½ / (h² + k² + l²
