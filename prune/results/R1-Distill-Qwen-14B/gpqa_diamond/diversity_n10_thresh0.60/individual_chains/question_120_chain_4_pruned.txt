Okay, so I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, the parallax (plx) in parsecs is inversely proportional to the distance. So, plx = 1/distance, which means as distance increases, parallax decreases.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Let's think. If stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, that probably means their density is uniform in space, not on the sky. Wait, no. Uniformly distributed in the sky might mean that their distribution is uniform across the celestial sphere, but when considering distance, it's a 3D space thing.

Oh, right. When we observe stars, their distribution in the sky is not just about their apparent positions but also their distances. So, the number of stars we see depends on both how many are in a certain direction and how far away they are.

Parallax is a measure of distance. Each star's parallax tells us how far it is. So, if I consider a thin shell at a certain distance d, the volume of that shell is 4πd² dr, where dr is the thickness of the shell. But since parallax plx is 1/d, dr would relate to d^2 in terms of plx.

Let me think about this. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is proportional to the surface area of the shell (which is 4πd²) multiplied by the volume element dr, and the number density of stars, which is uniform
