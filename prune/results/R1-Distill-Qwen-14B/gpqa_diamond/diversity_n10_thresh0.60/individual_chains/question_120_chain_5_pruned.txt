Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of how close a star is to us. The formula for distance in parsecs is distance = 1 / parallax (plx). So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, right? And the larger the parallax, the closer the star because the angle is smaller.

Wait, no, wait. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer. Because as you move closer to an object, the parallax increases. Like with your thumb and your eyes: the closer your thumb, the bigger the angle you see when you move your head from side to side.

So the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Let's say we're looking at a range of parallaxes, like from plx to plx + d_plx. How many stars are in that range?

I think this has to do with the distribution of stars in space. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means their number density (number per unit volume) is constant. So the number of stars depends on how much volume is in a given range of distances.

Wait, but the question is about parallax, not distance. So I need to relate the change in parallax to the change in distance.

Let me denote plx as p. Then, since distance d = 1/p, the change in distance dd would be related to the change in p, dp. Let me compute that.

So d = 1/p. Taking differential both sides, dd = -1/p² dp. So, the change in distance (dd) is negative because as p increases, d decreases. But since we're interested in the number of stars, perhaps I can think in terms of the number per unit parallax.

Wait, maybe I should consider how the volume changes with distance. The number of stars in a shell between d and d + dd would be the volume of that shell multiplied by the number density (n). The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4π d² dd (since it's surface area 4πd² times thickness dd).

So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π d² dd. But since
