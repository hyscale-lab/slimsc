Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is about finding the energy of the collider when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? Let me think, the regular lithium nucleus has 3 protons and 4 neutrons, I believe. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that means maybe it's Li-6? Because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons makes 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

Wait, but wait, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me clarify. The atomic number Z for Lithium is 3. So if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number A is Z plus number of neutrons, which is 3 +3=6. So the nucleus is Li-6, which would be 6Li.

Now, the problem is about calculating the energy of the RHIC. I remember that in particle accelerators, the kinetic energy and the total energy are important. The question is about the total energy, I think, because when particles are accelerated to relativistic speeds, their total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy.

So the nucleus is moving at 0.96c. So I need to find gamma for v=0.96c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Let me compute that.

Wait, v is 0.96c.
