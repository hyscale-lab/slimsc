Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, which probably means their distribution is even in some way. But I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, so let me think this through.

Parallax, plx, is a measure of distance. I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. Hmm. So if we imagine looking at different ranges of parallax, how many stars are there in each range? Let's break it down.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, I think that means that the number density of stars is constant in space. So, the number of stars in a certain volume should be proportional to the volume. Because if they're uniformly distributed, more volume means more stars, right?

But wait, how does that translate to parallax? Let's think in terms of distance. If you consider a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the volume of that shell is approximately 4πd² dr. The number of stars in that shell would be the number density (n) multiplied by the volume, so n * 4πd² dr.

But since plx is 1/d, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx. Let me make a substitution. d = 1/plx. So, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)² dr. But wait, dr is in terms of distance; I need to express it in terms of plx. So, dr = derivative of d with respect to plx times d plx. 

Wait, let's compute dr in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, the derivative of d with respect to plx is -1/(plx)^2. So, dr = (-1/(plx)^2) d plx. But since we're dealing with small increments, the negative just indicates direction, so the change in r (dr) is (1/(plx^2)) d plx, but since plx is positive, I think we can take the absolute value.

So, the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) d plx. Wait, that's 4π (1/plx^4) d plx. 

Wait, no. Let me think again. The volume of the shell is 4π d² dr. And dr in terms of plx is (d plx) * (dr/d plx). Because dr is the change in distance when plx changes by d plx.

Wait, plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So, dr/d plx = -1/(plx^2). The negative sign shows that as plx increases, d decreases. But when computing the volume, the absolute value matters. So, dr = |dr/d plx| * d plx = (1/plx²) d plx.

So, the volume becomes 4π (d)^2 dr. Substitute d=1/plx, dr = (1/plx²) d plx. So,

Volume = 4π
