Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me read the question again. The problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D.

I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because that would give a speed faster than light, which isn't possible. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. And for the energy, each astronaut's energy should be calculated using the relativistic energy formula and then summed.

Let me start with the relative speed part. So, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction. Let me denote the first astronaut as A with velocity u = 0.6c and the second as B with velocity v = 0.5c. But wait, relative to whom? Oh right, the relative speed of A as seen from B's frame, or vice versa. But I think the formula accounts for that.

The formula for relative velocity (u') when two objects are moving with velocities u and v relative to the lab frame is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²))

Wait, is that correct? Or is it (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)) depending on the frame? Wait, no, I think I might have it wrong. Let me think again. The relative velocity of A as seen from B's frame is ( A's velocity - B's velocity ) divided by (1 minus (A's v * B's v)/(c squared)).

So for A moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, in the same direction, the relative speed of A with respect to B would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1 / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428... c, which is roughly 0.14c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c. Looking at the options, both options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a start.

Next, the total energy of the system. I think each astronaut's energy in their rest frame would be their rest mass energy, but since they're moving, I have to calculate their relativistic kinetic energy plus rest energy. Wait no, the total energy for each is gamma times m c squared. So for each one, compute gamma multiplied by their mass, then sum both energies.

So for astronaut A: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c.

Gamma for A: 1/(sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.36 c²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(0.64)
