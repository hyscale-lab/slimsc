Okay, so I have this astronomy question here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each a different power of r.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Like, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. The formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So distance r is 1/plx. Oh wait, no, wait: parallax in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs.

So if plx is inversely proportional to r, then r is inversely proportional to plx. So r = 1/(plx) * some constant, but for the purposes of this problem, maybe the constant can be ignored since we're dealing with scaling.

The problem states that the number of stars, let's call it N, varies with 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. Wait, no, the wording says "varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Or N = k / (plx)^5, where k is some constant.

But since we want to express N in terms of r, and since r is proportional to 1/plx (r = 1/plx), then plx is 1/r. Let me substitute that into the equation.

So N is proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 over that would be r^5.

Wait, let me do that step again. If plx = 1/r, then 1/plx is r. So 1/(plx)^5 is (r)^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the exact wording again. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ (1/plx)^5. So N ∝ (r)^5. So as r increases, N increases as r
