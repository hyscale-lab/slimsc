Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. Hmm. The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun—same radius. The star has dark spots covering one hemisphere, and these spots have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler, 1000K less, so 5000K. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, the brightness changes, and this can look like an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. The question is asking what radius a hypothetical planet would need to have to create the same brightness variation as these spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted.

Wait, so the problem is about comparing the light curve variation caused by a planet transit to the variation caused by the star's spots. So, when the spots rotate into and out of view, the observed brightness changes. Similarly, when a planet transits, it blocks some light. We need to find the planet's radius relative to the star such that the dip in brightness (the amplitude) is the same as what the spots cause.

So first, I think I should calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the variation caused by a planet transit.

The star's radius is Rstar, which is same as the Sun. The spots are covering 20% of a hemisphere. Wait, the filling factor is 20%—so that's the fraction of the hemisphere's area covered by spots. One hemisphere is spotty, so the other
