Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying the final product after a series of reactions based on the given NMR data. Hmm, I remember that NMR can give a lot of structural information, so I'll need to analyze that first.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Wait, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. Oh wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, wait: the formula is 2C +2 - H - X + N. Wait, X is the halogens, but the formula doesn't include any, so X is 0. So it's (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2. Let's compute that: 18 -9 +1 is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That's five rings or double bonds. Hmm, considering a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees), and maybe a double bond or another ring.

The NMR data is given. Let me look at it:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet (t), 1H. That's a strong peak, maybe an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. If it's a triplet, perhaps it's coupling with two adjacent protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton next to an oxygen? Or something else. But aldehyde seems likely.

- 6.98 ppm: doublet (d), 2H. Maybe aromatic protons. Let's think, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are usually a doublet. Wait, no, para-substituted would have two equivalent protons, maybe as a singlet? Or maybe they're in a meta position. Wait, but 6.98 is a bit upfield for benzene, maybe a substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, like a nitro group or something else. Or maybe it's an ortho substitution.

- 6.51 ppm: also a doublet, 2H. Another set of aromatic protons. Maybe it's another ring, but I'm not sure.

- 6.27 ppm: broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad singlet might suggest some exchange, like an -OH proton, but wait, the integration is 2H. Two protons as a singlet. Maybe it's a conjugated diene or something else. Or perhaps it's an enol form, or maybe some other structure.

- 3.66 ppm: doublet (d), 2H. This is a quartet or doublet, probably adjacent to something. Maybe this is a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. Or perhaps an OCH2 group. The doublet suggests two neighboring protons, so maybe part of a CH2CH2 group, but more likely, it's a CH2 connected to something else, like O.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Breaking it down: C8H9NO. Let's see, the molecular formula could be something like a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents. Let me think about the possible structures.

The NMR shows an aldehyde proton at 9.72 ppm. So the molecule probably has an aldehyde group, RCHO. Then, the aromatic protons at 6.98 and 6.51 could suggest substituents on benzene rings. The 6.27 ppm is a bit tricky, maybe an enol proton or something else. The 3.66 ppm could be a CH2-O group, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: the reagents used are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O,
