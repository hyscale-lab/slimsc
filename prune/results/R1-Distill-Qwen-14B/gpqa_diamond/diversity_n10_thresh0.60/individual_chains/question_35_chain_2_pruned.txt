Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question is about the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, A_y. They say that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h/(4π). And the matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). 

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are involved in spin-1/2 systems. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Let me think about their forms. Oh yes, σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]] which matches the S matrix given here. So S is σ_y, right?

So, A_y = c * σ_y. Since c is h/(4π), A_y would be (h/(4π)) * σ_y. 

Now, the problem asks about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Let's recall that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0.

But wait, σ_y has eigenvalues ±i. Because when you diagonalize σ_y, the eigenvalues are imaginary. Let me compute that. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(σ_y - λ I) = 0.

So, the matrix becomes [[-λ, -i], [i, -λ]].

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (i)(-i) = λ² - (i*(-i)) = λ² - (1) because i*(-i) is 1. So λ² -1=0 → λ² =1 → λ=±1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, σ_y is [[0, -i],[i,0]], so the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) → 0 - (-i^2) → i^2 is -1, so -(-i^2)= - ( (-1) )= 1. Oh, wait, I'm getting confused. The determinant for the characteristic equation is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - (i * i) →
