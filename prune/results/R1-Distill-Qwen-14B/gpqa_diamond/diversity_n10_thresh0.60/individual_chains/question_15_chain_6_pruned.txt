Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Researchers want to observe the one that's more likely to transit, which makes sense because transiting gives good data. They have limited time, so they need to pick the one with the higher probability.

Both planets were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. That means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh, and both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since the orbital period is shorter. Also, both have circular orbits.

The stars are interesting. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So higher mass but same radius? I remember that higher mass stars are usually larger, but maybe it's because Planet_1's star is more evolved? Or not? Hmm, the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, which might mean it's starting to expand, but both stars have the same radius. So maybe Planet_1's star is more massive but in a main sequence, while Planet_2's is a slightly evolved star with same radius. Interesting.

So the question is which planet has a higher transit probability. Transiting probability depends on a few factors. I think the key formula is P = (R_star / a) * (something), but wait, let me recall.

The probability of a planet transiting is roughly given by the formula P ≈ (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))), but in this case, both orbits are circular (e=0), so the eccentricity term is 1. So the probability simplifies to P ≈ (R_star / a). But wait, is that the exact formula? Or is it (R_star / a) multiplied by something else... Maybe it's (R_star * 2) / (a) because of the geometry? Let me think.

Wait, I think the transit probability is the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the orbit. More accurately, it's (R_star / a), multiplied by the impact parameter, but since the orbits are edge-on, the maximum. Or wait, actually, the transit probability is the relative size of the star as seen from the planet's position. Oh, right, the formula for the probability is approximately (R_star / a), because the planet has to pass in front of the star's disk. But wait, I think it's actually (R_star / a) multiplied by (some factor), maybe because the planet's orbital plane has to be aligned with our line of sight.

Wait, another thought: I think the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by (sqrt(1 - (R_planet / R_star)^2)), but since the planets are Earth-like and the stars are bigger, R_planet << R_star, so that term is approximately 1. So the transit probability is roughly (R_star / a).

But wait, another source I remember says that the transit probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by (some function of the impact parameter). Or maybe more accurately, the geometric probability is (R
