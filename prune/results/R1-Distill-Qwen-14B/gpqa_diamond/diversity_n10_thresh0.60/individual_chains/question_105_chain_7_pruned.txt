Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about starspots and how they mimic an exoplanet's signal. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that a star with the same radius as the Sun has one hemisphere covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere's surface is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Only one hemisphere is spotty, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away, causing brightness variations. The interesting part is that this can look like an exoplanet causing the same brightness changes.

The task is to find what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be so that it produces the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted. So, we're comparing the signal from the planet's transit to the signal from the spots.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So normally, when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. Similarly, the spots on the star would cause a dip in brightness when they are on the side facing us, but since they are cooler, they contribute less light when they're in view.

But in the question, it's the rotational modulation causing the brightness variations. The spots cover one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, we see the spots come into view. Hmm, but the question says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So when looking at the light curve, the dip due to the spots (when they face us) would be similar in shape and depth to that caused by a planet transiting.

Wait, but planets cause a dip when they pass in front, while spots cause a dip when they are on the side facing us. So maybe the light curve's dip is similar, but the star's rotation period would determine the period of the dip, whereas a planet's orbital period would do the same. But for the purpose of this question, they're asking about the amplitude, not the period.

So I need to compare the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the star's spots to that caused by a planet blocking the star's light.

First, let's model the brightness variation due to the spots. The star's brightness we observe is the sum
