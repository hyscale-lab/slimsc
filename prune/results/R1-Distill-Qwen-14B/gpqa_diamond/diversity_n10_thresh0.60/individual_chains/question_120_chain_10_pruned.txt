Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to think it through. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different exponents. 

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance. So if a star has a larger parallax, it's closer to us. Oh wait, parallax is measured as plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), right? So distance d = 1/plx.

The question is about the number of stars per unit plx. So, I guess I need to find how the number of stars in a thin shell at a certain distance relates to the parallax. Because stars are uniformly distributed, the number should depend on the volume of the shell. 

Wait, the volume of a spherical shell... Oh right, the volume of a thin shell at radius r with thickness dr is about 4πr² dr. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume. But how does that translate into parallax terms?

Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's think in terms of plx. If I have a shell at distance d, the parallax is plx = 1/d. The thickness in distance is dr, but I need to think about how that relates to a change in plx. 

Wait, if d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Because d(1/x) = -1/x² dx. So dr = (-1/plx²) dplx. But when considering a small change in plx (dplx), the corresponding change in distance is dr. So the volume element would be 4π r² dr. But substituting dr in terms of dplx.

So, let's substitute r = 1/plx and dr = (-1/plx²) dplx. The volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign just indicates direction, but since we're talking about magnitudes, we can ignore the sign. So the volume is proportional to (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx → 1/plx⁴ multiplied by dplx. 

Wait, so the number of stars in a thin shell is proportional to the volume, which is proportional to 1/plx⁴. But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So the number per unit plx would be the number in a range dplx divided by dplx, which is (1/plx⁴) * dplx / dplx = 1/plx⁴. 

But wait, no. Because the volume element in terms of plx is the volume per unit plx. Let me think again. The number of stars in a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx is proportional to the volume of the shell at that plx multiplied by the thickness in plx. So the number dN = n * 4π r² dr (where n is the number density). 

But since we're considering dN per unit plx, we can write dr in terms
