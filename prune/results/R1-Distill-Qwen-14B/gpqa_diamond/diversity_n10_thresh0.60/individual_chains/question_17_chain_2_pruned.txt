Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry and EDTA complexes can get a bit tricky. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given information includes the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that complicating things, and the temperature is 25°C, which is standard for these calculations.

Okay, let me think. So, EDTA, or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The reaction between Ca²+ and EDTA would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant, K, for this reaction is given as 5x10^10.

Wait, but in this problem, the solution already contains the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. 

I remember that when a complex forms, the K is given by the formula K = [CaEDTA] / ([Ca][EDTA]). But wait, in this case, the complex is already present, so we can probably rearrange this formula to find [Ca²+].

But wait, what's the initial assumption here? The problem states it's a "stoichiometric" solution, which I think means that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we assume that the dissociation of the complex into Ca²+ and EDTA is the only process happening here.

So, the complex dissociates as: CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The formation constant K is given as 5e10. But wait, K for the formation is [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA)). So, the dissociation would have a K_dissociation = 1/K_formation. Let me think: yes, because if the formation is Kf = [complex]/([M][L]), then the reverse reaction (dissociation) would have Kd = 1/Kf. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, but in this problem, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaEDTA] as 0.02 M. Let me set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.

Initial concentrations:
[CaEDTA] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] = 0 (since the complex hasn't dissociated yet)
[EDTA^4-] = 0

Change:
[CaEDTA] decreases by x, so at equilibrium, it's 0.02 - x.
[Ca²+]
