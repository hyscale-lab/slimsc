Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that Compound X has certain IR and NMR data and reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the options given.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. The 3400–2500 region usually suggests an alcohol (O-H stretch) or maybe an amine, but I don't see any peaks that would indicate amines here. Wait, another possibility is an alkyne, but the 3400 region is more indicative of an alcohol or maybe an ether. Hmm, but the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group. So that suggests a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. Also, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 areas are around where aromatic C=C stretching occurs, so there's probably an aromatic ring in the compound.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows several peaks. Let's list them out:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is typical for an acidic proton, like an -OH group. Wait, but also, if it's a carbonyl group, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm as a triplet or something else. Alternatively, an aromatic -OH would be around 5 ppm, but maybe it's an acidic aldehyde or something else. Wait, wait, another possibility is a carboxylic acid. The -COOH proton appears as a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. Oh, but wait, the IR had a peak at 1720 cm-1 which would fit a carbonyl, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Or maybe an ester, but let's think more.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical for an aromatic ring with two substituents in the para position. The doublets suggest coupling with two adjacent protons each. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, if there's an electron-withdrawing group, like a nitro group, or maybe a carbonyl group attached.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm peak could be the carbonyl oxygen from another functional group. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The IR peaks: 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be even broader and maybe in a different region, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl peak is around 1720. Wait, but then where is the O-H for the acid? Alternatively, maybe it's
