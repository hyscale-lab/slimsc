Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic setting. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one. Let's see what I remember.

In the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)m v_max². So setting them equal, v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, that's the classical non-relativistic case, and the question here is relativistic. So I can't just use that.

In relativity, the situation is more complicated because of the energy-momentum relation and the fact that kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Oh right, relativistic energy includes rest mass energy, kinetic energy, and so on.

The total energy E of the oscillator should be the sum of the rest energy and the maximum kinetic energy. At maximum speed, all potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, in relativity, the potential energy isn't treated the same way. Let me think.

Wait, the oscillator is relativistic, so the potential energy might come from the field, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is treated as part of the total energy, similar to how it's done in quantum
