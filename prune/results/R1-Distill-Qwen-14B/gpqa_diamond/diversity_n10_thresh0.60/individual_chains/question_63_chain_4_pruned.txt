Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule absorbing a photon, and I need to find the momentum the photon should have. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The question says it's a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, I remember that in such models, the molecule has both rotational and vibrational energy states. The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think means the lowest energy state possible for that system. But wait, when they say switch to the next state, do they mean the next vibrational or rotational state? Or maybe a combination of both?

The question is about the photon's momentum needed to make the molecule switch to the next lowest energy state. I think the quantum rotation-vibration model treats both rotation and vibration as quantized. So the fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational level (probably J=0 or J=1, depending on the model).

Wait, no. I'm a bit confused. For a diatomic molecule, the rotation starts at J=0, but maybe for a rigid rotor the lowest rotational state is J=0, but the non-rigid rotor might have different considerations. I'm not entirely sure about that, but perhaps the main point is that when the molecule absorbs a photon, it could change either its vibrational state, rotational state, or both.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the lowest energy transition would probably be the one that requires the least energy, which would
