Okay, so I've got this question in front of me about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think through this step by step.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, wait, I think the metric is in two dimensions because there are only dx and dy terms. So this is probably a 2-dimensional spacetime or maybe just a 2-manifold. But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, pseudosphere... I remember that in general relativity, a pseudosphere is a type of solution to Einstein's equations, specifically a vacuum solution, and it has a negative curvature. But wait, how does this relate to the metric given here?

Wait, the metric provided looks a bit like the metric for a sphere but with some differences. Let me write it down:

ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²)

Wait, 32 is a number. So the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²). So that's 4 - (x² + y²) in the denominator. Let me think about the standard metric for a sphere. For a sphere of radius a, the metric in 3D is usually in terms of r, θ, φ, but here it's in 2D, using x and y. Oh, wait, maybe this is the metric for a 2-dimensional surface embedded in some higher
