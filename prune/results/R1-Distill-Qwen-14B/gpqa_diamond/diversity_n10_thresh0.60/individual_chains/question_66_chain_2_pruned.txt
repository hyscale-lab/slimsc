Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember SMEFT is a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, which ones exactly?

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me think about each symmetry.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Because if it weren't, the effective theory would break Lorentz symmetry, which usually isn't the case unless there's a specific reason. So all operators should respect Lorentz symmetry. That makes sense because the Standard Model itself is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT extends it.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if the theory is Lorentz invariant, does it automatically respect Poincare? Because Poincare symmetry requires that the theory looks the same under Lorentz transformations and translations. SMEFT should respect this because, in particle physics, all our theories are Poincare invariant. But wait, in SMEFT, you have higher-dimensional operators with different scaling. Do they affect Poincare? Maybe not, because the operators are written in a way that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model. So I think Poincare is also respected.

CP symmetry. I'm a bit fuzzy here. CP stands for charge conjugation and parity. The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric because of certain processes like CP violation in the CKM matrix. But does SMEFT require all operators to be CP symmetric? I don't think so. Because SMEFT allows for operators that can violate CP, like those that explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry. So operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3, CP, is not a must-respect symmetry.

CPT symmetry. Now, CPT is Charge, Parity, Time reversal. I remember that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because in quantum field theory, any Lorentz-invariant theory must have CPT symmetry. So since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, all its operators must respect CPT. Therefore, operator terms must have CPT symmetry.

So looking at the options, the required symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). Wait, no, because Poincare includes Lorentz.
