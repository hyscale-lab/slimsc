Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about starspots and exoplanet detection. Let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about a star with some dark spots on one hemisphere. The star's radius is the same as the Sun's, so R_star is Rsun. The spots have a filling factor of 20%, which means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that can mimic an exoplanet transit. The question is, what size exoplanet would cause the same brightness change as these spots?

So the key here is to compare the light variation caused by the star's spots to that of an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

First, I remember that the brightness change (the dip in light curve) when a planet transits a star is given by the formula:

Î”F = (R_planet / R_star)^2

Because the planet blocks a part of the star's light proportional to the square of the ratio of their radii.

But wait, in this case, the star isn't just losing some light because of the planet. Instead, the star's brightness is varying because part of it (the spotted regions) is cooler. So the observed brightness change isn't just a simple occultation; it's a change in the star's emitted flux.

I think the approach is to calculate the observed variation in flux due to the spots and then equate that to the variation caused by a planet transit.

The star emits a certain amount of flux. When the spots are facing us, their lower temperature means less flux is coming from that area.

Wait, the star has a radius R, and the spots cover a certain fraction of its surface. The filling factor is 20%, which is 0.2. But since only one hemisphere is spotty, does that mean that 20% of the entire star's surface is covered? Or 20% of the hemisphere? Hmm, the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 0.2 in that hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (pi R^2 / 2) )? Wait, because a hemisphere is half the sphere, so area is (4pi R
