Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem has two reactions. The first one is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B and water to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones through a substitution reaction. Oh right! The nucleophilic substitution on a ketone. So, when a ketone like butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with a cyanide ion (CN-), it should undergo a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by CN. But wait, in this case, the product is a nitrile and a hydroxyl group. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If we add NaCN, the Na+ is a spectator ion, but CN- would act as a nucleophile. Oh wait, but ketones don't typically react directly with CN- under normal conditions. Oh wait, I think in the presence of an acid catalyst, the ketone can undergo a reaction where the oxygen is protonated, making it a better leaving group. So perhaps this is a type of acid-catalyzed substitution.

Wait, but wait. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So, the carbonyl is at position 2. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see: the structure would be CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Or maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Hmm, not sure, but the point is that a nitrile group is added, and a hydroxyl group is present.

Wait, another thought: maybe this is a substitution where the ketone oxygen is replaced by CN. But how does that happen?

Alternatively, wait, perhaps it's a condensation reaction. Or maybe it's a hydrocyanation? No, hydrocyanation usually adds CN to the alpha position in alkenes. Hmm.

Wait another angle: butan-2-one is a ketone. If we treat it with a cyanide and an acid, maybe it's an example of the Stephen reduction or some other type of substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of the acid-catalyzed formation of a cyanohydrin.

Oh! Right, the cyanohydrin formation. Acid catalysis is used to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then the CN- attacks, and the OH- (from water, perhaps) does something else. Wait, the process forms a cyanohydrin, which is a compound with adjacent OH and CN groups.

So, in the formation of a cyanohydrin, the general reaction is:

R2CO + CN- → R2C(OH)CN + something.

Wait but the reagent here is NaCN, so providing the CN- ion. But the reaction requires an acid catalyst. So the first reaction would require an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A or B's A being H3O+).

So, reagent A is H3O+ for the first reaction. That would make sense. So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3, which I'm not as familiar with. Hmm.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure has a nitrile group (CN) and a hydroxyl group (OH) on the same carbon. The reagent B is either H2O or something else, and the product is a carboxylic acid, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen? Well, nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids. Common oxidizing agents for this reaction include KMnO4 under certain conditions, or other strong oxidizing agents. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction, but nitriles hydrolyze under acidic or basic conditions to give different products.

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions typically gives an amide, which can further hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, but the second step involves water and reagent B. So if reagent B is an acid, like HCl or acetic acid, perhaps it's aiding the hydrolysis.

Wait, but the reaction is between 2-hydroxybutanenitrile and B (H2O) to give the acid. So the reaction is in aqueous conditions. So maybe it's an oxidation, but more likely hydrolysis.

Wait, another approach: nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids when treated with strong acid and heat. For example, using HCl and heat, the nitrile group converts to a carboxylic acid. So the reagent B is HCl.

Alternatively, if B is something else, like CH3COOH (acetic acid), perhaps it's a different scenario.

Wait, the starting material already has a hydroxyl group. So when the nitrile is hydrolyzed, under acidic conditions, perhaps the product is a ketone or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the product has a hydroxyl and a carboxylic acid group on the same carbon? Wait, no, looking back: the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The structure would be something like HOOC-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-... Wait, no, but butanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2COOH. So wait, in the product, the nitrile becomes a COOH group.

In the starting material, it's a nitrile and a hydroxyl on the same carbon. So the starting material is (something)CN-OH-CH2CH2-..., but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. For that, strong oxidizing conditions are needed. Often, with HCl and KMnO4 under heat. Or H2O with some acid catalyst.

Wait, the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, the nitrile group (CN) is converted to COOH. So that would require oxidation. How is the nitrile oxidized to a carboxylic acid?

Typically, the oxidation of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done using a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 in acidic conditions. For example, KMnO4 in conc. H2SO4 and heat. Alternatively, another strong oxidizer.

But in the options, reagent B is either H2O, HCl, or CH3COOH. So if the reaction is in water, perhaps the reagent B is an acid catalyst. So for the second reaction, the reagent B would be HCl, providing the acidic conditions needed for the oxidation.

Wait, but the options list B as either HCl or CH3COOH. So looking back, the options for B in each choice:

Option A: B = HCl.

Option B: B = CH3COOH.

Option C: B = HCl.

Option D: B = CH3COOH.

So, if the second reaction requires an acid (like HCl) to facilitate the oxidation, then reagent B would be HCl.

Putting it all together, for the first reaction, A is H3O+ (acid catalyst), and for the second reaction, B is HCl (acid for oxidation).

Looking at the options, option A has A = H3O+ and B= HCl. Option C has A= NaHSO3, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, but wait a second. The first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. So, for that, we need H3O+ as the acid catalyst. So A is H3O+.

The second reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. But wait, hydrolysis of nitriles usually requires strong acid and heat. Alternatively, it could be treated with H2O and a strong acid, like HCl, acting as a catalyst.

Wait, another approach: the first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that's the cyanohydrin formation; correct.

The second reaction is the nitrile group in the cyanohydrin being oxidized to a carboxylic acid. So the reagent B must be a strong oxidizing agent. But if the reagent is HCl, perhaps with water, I'm not sure if that's enough. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis under acidic conditions.

Wait, another thought: when a nitrile is treated with dilute H2SO4 and heat, it hydrolyzes to a carboxylic acid. Or perhaps, using HCl and H2O with some other oxidizing agent.

Wait, but in the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH. So, if reagent B is HCl, then the reaction would proceed in an acidic aqueous solution. So the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but nitriles can also be hydrolyzed to amides under certain conditions, but in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid. So, perhaps the hydrolysis is being driven to completion with acid and heat.

But in the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH. So if the correct reagent for the second reaction is HCl, then option A or C would have B as HCl.

Wait, option A: A= H3O+, B= HCl.

Option C: A= NaHSO3, B= HCl.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the correct A is H3O+. So the only options that have A as H3O+ are options A and B.

So, for the first reaction, I'm confident that A is H3O+.

Now, for the second reaction, which reagent is correct? Let's think about the second reaction again.

The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the CN group becomes a COOH group.

That transformation is oxidation of nitrile to carboxylic acid. Common methods involve strong oxidizing agents. So, perhaps using KMnO4 in acidic conditions or another oxidizing agent.

But the options don't include KMnO4. So maybe the problem is treating the nitrile with aqueous acid, perhaps in the presence of an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis followed by oxidation.

Wait, but the options have B as either HCl or CH3COOH. I think that in the second reaction, the conditions are acidic, so perhaps HCl is the right choice. So, B would be HCl.

So, looking back, option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

Another possible reaction for the second step: the nitrile could undergo hydrolysis under acidic conditions to form the carboxylic acid. So, with HCl as the acid, the nitrile would hydrolyze in water to COOH.

Wait, but wait: nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions (HCl and H2O) typically gives a carboxylic acid. So I think that's correct.

So putting it all together, option A would have A=H3O+ and B=HCl. But wait, looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH.

So, if B is HCl, then the correct option is A.

Wait, but wait, in the options, the first reaction is with reagent A, and the second with reagent B. So in the first reaction, A is H3O+; in the second, B is HCl. So that's option A.

Wait, but let me think again: the second reaction is in the presence of B and H2O. So, if B is HCl, then it's HCl and water. So that would be acidic conditions, which would help the hydrolysis.

Alternatively, if B were CH3COOH, then the reaction is in a weak acid. But I think for the nitrile to carboxylic acid conversion, stronger acid (like HCl) is better.

So, the correct answer should be option A: A is H3O+ and B is HCl.


The problem involves two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.  
   - This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where the carbonyl oxygen of the ketone is replaced by a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group.  
   - The reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Therefore, reagent A must be an acid, specifically **H₃O⁺**.

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B and water to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.  
   - This is the conversion of a nitrile group into a carboxylic acid.  
   - Nitriles are typically hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic conditions. Among the options, **HCl** provides the necessary acidic environment for this reaction. Thus, reagent B must be **HCl**.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - Correct for both reactions.  
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - Incorrect because CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and insufficient for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.  
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - Incorrect because NaHSO₃ is not a suitable acid catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation in Reaction 1.  
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - Incorrect because NaHSO₃ is not suitable for Reaction 1, and CH₃COOH is insufficient for Reaction 2.

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
