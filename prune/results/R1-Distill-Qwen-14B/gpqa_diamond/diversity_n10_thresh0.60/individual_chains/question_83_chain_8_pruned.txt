Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see... It's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'll need to figure out the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. 

Alright, let me read the question again. So, we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I think I should find the concentrations after dilution and then figure out the moles involved in the titration.

Wait, diluting 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water. The total volume becomes 40 cm³. So, the new concentration is (20 * 0.05) / 40. Let me calculate that: 20 * 0.05 is 1 mmol, divided by 40 cm³ (which is 0.04 L?) Wait no, wait, wait. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol. Then adding 20 cm³, total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh, right, because when you dilute, M1V1 = M2V2. So 0.05 M * 20 cm³ = M2 * 40 cm³ → M2 = (0.05 * 20)/40 = 0.025 M.

So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The reaction is acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with NaOH to form acetate (CH3COO⁻) and water. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻Na+ + H2O.
