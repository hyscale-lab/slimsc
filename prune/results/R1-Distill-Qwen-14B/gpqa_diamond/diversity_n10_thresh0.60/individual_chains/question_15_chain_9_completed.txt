Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But wait, the question says both planets have Earth-like masses, so maybe the radius of the planet is similar to Earth's, but I'm not sure if that's given.

Wait, the question says both planets have the same masses, but not necessarily the same radii. The problem states that the host stars have the same radii. Hmm, but how does that affect the transit probability?

I think the transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Oh wait, no, I'm mixing things up. The transit probability is actually more about the orbital plane's alignment. The probability is proportional to (R_star / a)² multiplied by something else. Wait, I think the exact formula might be P_transit ≈ (R_planet / R_star)² * (1 / (1 + (M_star/M_planet)^0.5)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to transit, which depends on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, wait, I think the transit probability formula is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a_s) / (a_p) )² ), but I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

No, wait, I think the key factors for the transit probability are the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. The formula I remember is P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (1 + (M_s / M_p)^(1/3))) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, another approach: the probability is higher if the planet's orbit is more likely to edge-on relative to us. The probability is roughly (R*/a)², where R* is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital radius. Wait, no, that's the area of the star relative to the planet's orbit. Because the transit occurs when the planet's path crosses our line of sight, so the probability is proportional to (R*/a)^2.

So, P ∝ (R_star / a)^2. But wait, I'm not sure if it's R_star or the planet's radius. Oh wait, no: the transit depth is (R_p / R_s)^2, but the probability of transiting depends on the ratio of the star's size to the planet's orbital distance. So the probability is roughly (R_s / a)^2, because the area of the star relative to the planet's orbit determines the chance of a transit.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the star is larger, the probability of the planet passing in front is higher. For example, a star with a larger radius compared to the planet's orbital distance would have a higher chance of the planet transiting. So yes, P is proportional to (R_s / a)^2.

So in this problem, the two planets have different orbital periods and different host stars. Both host stars have the same radius, R_s1 = R_s2.

Wait, the problem says that both host stars have the same radii. So R_s1 = R_s2 = R.

So the transit probability for each planet will depend on (R / a)^2, where a is the planet's orbital radius.

So for each planet, compute (R / a)^2, and the one with higher value has higher probability.

But how do we find a for each planet? Because the orbital period is given. We know from Kepler's third law that (a^3) / (P^2) = (M_s) / (M_sun), but wait, in units where G and other constants are accounted for. Wait, Kepler's third law in the form P² = (4π²/G(M_s + M_p)) ) a³. But since M_p is much smaller than M_s, we can approximate P² ≈ (4π²/(G M_s)) a³. So a^3 ≈ (G M_s P²)/(4 π²). So a = [ (G M_s P²)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3).

Alternatively, perhaps a more usable form is a = [ ( (P/(2π))^2 * G M_s ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(M_s + M_p))^(1/3). But since M_p is much smaller than M_s, M_p can be neglected, so a ≈ ( (G M_s P² )/(4 π²) )^(1/3 )

But perhaps we can find the ratio a1/a2, because we're only comparing two planets.

We know Planet_1 has an orbital period P1 = P2 / 3. Because Planet_1's period is three times shorter. So P1 = (1/3) P2.

Wait, no: the question says Planet_1 has a three times shorter period than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is P, then Planet_1's is P/3.

Masses of the host stars: Planet_1's host has M1 = 2 * M2, where M2 is the mass of Planet_2's host. Both M1 and M2 are the masses of their respective stars.

So let's compute a1 and a2.

a1 is proportional to [ M1 * P1² ]^(1/3 )

a2 is proportional to [ M2 * P2² ]^(1/3 )

Wait, because a^3 is proportional to M_s * P².

So, a1 = k * (M1 * P1² )^(1/3 )

a2 = k * (M2 * P2² )^(1/3 )

So the ratio a1/a2 = [ (M1/M2) * (P1² / P2²) ) ]^(1/3 )

We have M1 = 2 M2.

P1 = (1/3) P2 → P1² = (1/9) P2².

So,

a1/a2 = [ (2) * ( (1/9) ) ) ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3 )

Compute 2/9 ≈ 0.2222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

Wait, that means Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is to theirs. Because a1 is smaller than a2.

Wait, but the period is shorter, so a smaller orbit. That makes sense.

Now, the transit probability for each is proportional to (R_*/a)^2.

Since R_s1 = R_s2 = R, the ratio of transit probabilities P1_t and P2_t would be:

P1_t / P2_t = ( (R/a1 )^2 ) / ( (R/a2 )^2 ) ) = (a2 / a1 )^2

We know that a1 = 0.606 a2 → a2/a1 ≈ 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So (a2/a1)^2 ≈ (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1_t is about 2.72 times higher than P2_t. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no: the ratio is P1_t / P2_t = (a2/a1 )^2.

So if a2 > a1, then a2/a1 is greater than 1, so P1_t is greater than P2_t.

Wait, that would suggest that Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting. So the researchers should choose Planet_1.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Options:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~1.5 times higher.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times.

Wait, according to my calculation, P1_t is about 2.7 times higher than P2_t. So the researchers would prefer Planet_1 because it has a higher probability. So the correct option would be D.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Compute a1/a2:

[ (M1 * P1^2 ) / (M2 * P2^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2 * (P2/3)^2 ) / (M2 * P2^2) ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, M1 is 2*M2, and P1 is P2/3.

So,

= [ (2 * (P2^2 / 9) ) / (M2 * P2^2) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2/(9 M2)) * (P2^2 / P2^2) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2/(9)) ) ]^(1/3 )

Which is cube root of (2/9) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 = 0.606 a2. So a2 is about 1.65 a1.

So (a2/a1) = 1.65.

So (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 = approximately 2.72.

So P1_t = (R/a1)^2 → (R/(0.606 a2))^2 → (1.65 R/a2 )^2.

Wait, no. Wait, R is the same for both stars, so:

P1_t = (R/a1)^2 = (R/(0.606 a2))^2 = (1/(0.606))^2 * (R/a2)^2 ≈ (1.65)^2 * (R/a2)^2.

But P2_t = (R/a2)^2.

So P1_t = 2.72 * P2_t.

So the probability for Planet_1 is about 2.7 times higher than Planet_2. So the researchers should choose Planet_1.

Looking back at the options, option D says Planet_1 is preferred because of ~2.7 times higher probability. So option D is correct.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to:

\[
P_{\text{transit}} \propto \left(\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}\right)^2
\]

where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the orbital radius of the planet. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{\text{star,1}} = R_{\text{star,2}} \)), the probability depends on the ratio \( a_1/a_2 \), where \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \) are the orbital radii of Planet_1 and Planet_2, respectively.

Using Kepler's third law, the orbital radius \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the host star's mass \( M_{\text{star}} \) by:

\[
a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} P^2
\]

Thus, the ratio of orbital radii \( a_1/a_2 \) is given by:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_{\text{star,1}} P_1^2}{M_{\text{star,2}} P_2^2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, we know:
- \( M_{\text{star,1}} = 2 M_{\text{star,2}} \),
- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \).

Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_{\text{star,2}} P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606 \), we find:

\[
a_1 \approx 0.606 a_2
\]

The transit probability ratio \( P_{\text{transit,1}}/P_{\text{transit,2}} \) is then:

\[
\frac{P_{\text{transit,1}}}{P_{\text{transit,2}}} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.606}\right)^2 \approx 2.72
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
