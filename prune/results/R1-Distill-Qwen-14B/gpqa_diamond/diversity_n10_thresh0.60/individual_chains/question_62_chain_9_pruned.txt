Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis problems. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The options are A to D, each with different reagents and steps. I need to figure out which sequence of reagents will give the desired product.

First, I should probably draw the structures of the starting material and the target molecule to visualize what's happening. Starting with ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond) attached. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me parse that.

Wait, the target molecule has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. So that's a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (CHO) attached. Then, at the 1-position, there's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So that's a CH2 group attached to the cyclohexane, which is also connected to a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexyl group. So the structure is like a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to adjacent carbons.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a triple bond to CH2? Or is the triple bond between two carbons attached to the ring? Oh wait, ethynyl is a substituent, so it's a cyclohexane ring with a -C≡CH group attached. Because ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So the structure is a cyclohexane with a triple bond ending in a CH group. So like cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so it's attached directly to the cyclohexane. So the structure is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached.

The target molecule: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl (CHO) group. Then, at the 1-position (adjacent), there's a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. So that's a CH2 group attached to the cyclohexane, which also has an OH group and a cyclohexyl substituent. So the structure is something like:

O

C-O (but wait, no: the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is a CHO group attached to the cyclohexane ring. Then on the adjacent carbon, a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the steps needed to go from ethynylcyclohexane to the target. Let me think about the transformations.

I remember that alkynes can undergo various reactions. One common reaction is the
