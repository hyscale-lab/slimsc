Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I have to calculate these values.

First, I think I should figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So, initial concentration M1 is 0.05 M, volume V1 is 20 cm³. After dilution with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume V2 is 40 cm³. So, the new concentration M2 would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that: 0.05 *20 =1 mmol, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O. 

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid. Let me find out the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, wait wait, wait. Wait, wait no: the diluted solution is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So 0.04 L * 0.025 M = 0.001 mol. 

NaOH concentration is 0.1 M. So volume V = moles / concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point occurs at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question is about 25% titration. 25% of what? Oh, 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³ added, that's 25% titrated. 

So, for the 25% point: 

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. 

Since the reaction is 1:1, moles of CH3COOH remaining will be initial moles (0.001) minus 0.00025, which is 0.00075 mol. 

Moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume at this point is 40 cm³ (original solution) + 2.5 cm³ NaOH = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are: 
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Now, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). Let me compute that. 

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait no, pKa is -log10(Ka). So log(1.85e-5) is about log(1.85) + log(1e-5) → 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328. So pKa is 4.7328.

So, pH = 4.7328 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.7328 - 0.477 ≈ 4.2558. So around 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, the first part for 25% is around 4.26.

Now, for the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The concentration of acetate comes from the moles of acetate divided by the total volume.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol (from initial acetic acid) because all of it has reacted. 

Total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

But acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, Kb is 5.405e-10. The initial concentration is 0.02 M. Let's set up the ICE table.

CH3COO^- : 0.02 M → 0.02 - x 
H2O : negligible
CH3COOH: x 
OH^-: x

The expression is Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So, x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. 

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, none of the options have 9.02. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, wait. Did I make a mistake in the hydrolysis? Let me double-check.

Wait, the Kb is Kw / Ka, which is correct. 1e-14/(1.85e-5)= approx 5.405e-10. Correct.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So when I set up Kb = x²/(0.02). So x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → 5.405e-10 * 0.02 is 1.081e-11. Square root is about 1.04e-5.

So [OH-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH is about 4.98 → pH is 9.02. 

But looking at the options, none of them have a pH near 9. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, wait a minute. Maybe I messed up the initial concentration after equivalence. Let me recalculate.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol, yes.

Total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10 cm³ NaOH = 50 cm³ → 0.05 L. So [acetate] is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Hmm, but maybe I should consider activity coefficients or something, but in school problems, we usually neglect that. So why is the pH not matching any of the options? Let me check the options again.

Option D: 4.57; 6.92. That can't be right because equivalence should be higher than 7.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the pH at equivalence. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait another thought: Could the solution at equivalence point be considering the dilution of the acetate ion?

Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately, not approximating x to be negligible.

So Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02. Let me see: x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02. So no, that's correct. But none of the options have close to 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the exact value without approximation.

Let me try without the approximation. Let me write the equation x² = Kb*(0.02 - x). So x² + Kb x - (2e-2)*Kb =0. 

Wait, that's a quadratic equation. Let me plug the numbers:

x² + (5.405e-10) x - (0.02 *5.405e-10) =0 → x² + 5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation: ax² + bx + c =0, where a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a). Since x is positive, we take the positive root.

Discriminant: b² +4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) → approx (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) → 4.324e-11 is much larger, so sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So x ≈ [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 → approximately 6.57e-6 / 2 → ~3.285e-6. Wait, that's different from previous. Hmm, why?

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the calculation of the discriminant. Let me compute it accurately.

Compute b²: (5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 * 1e-20 → 29.214 * 1e-20 = 2.9214e-19.

Compute 4ac: 4*1*(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11. Wait, but in the quadratic equation, it's +4ac because the formula is sqrt(b² -4ac) when the equation is ax² +bx +c=0. Oh wait, in our case, the equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x -1.081e-11 =0. So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So discriminant is b² -4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 → which is approximately 4.324e-11 (since 2.92e-19 is negligible). So sqrt(4.324e-11) = approx 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -b + sqrt(b² -4ac) ] / (2a) → [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (approx 6.576e-6 ) / 2 → 3.288e-6.

So [OH-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is about 0.517, so pOH ≈ 5.483. pH = 14 -5.483 → 8.517, approximately 8.52. 

Wait, that's about 8.52, which is option A's equivalence point value. But earlier, without the approximation, I get pH ≈8.52. But earlier, using the approximation, I thought pH was 9.02. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, I think I made a mistake in the quadratic setup. Let me double-check.

Wait, the equation is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO^-] → [CH3COOH] = x, [OH^-] =x, [CH3COO^-] =0.02 -x.

So Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) → x² = Kb*(0.02 -x) → x² + Kb x - 0.02 Kb =0. So, a=1, b=Kb, c= -0.02*Kb.

Wait, wait, in this case, Kb is 5.405e-10.

So the equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x - (0.02 * 5.405e-10) =0 → x² + 5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 =0.

So when solving, the discriminant is (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) → 2.92e-19 + 4.324e-11 ≈4.324e-11, as before.

So sqrt(4.324e-11) is about 6.576e-6. So x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 → 3.288e-6.

So [OH-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH = 5.483 → pH=8.517.

Ah, that's about 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is around 8.52.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A says 4.26; 8.52. So that would mean for 25% titration, the pH is 4.26, and at equivalence, 8.52.

But earlier, when I thought the equivalence point was around 9, but with the quadratic, it's 8.52.

So putting it all together: At 25% titration, pH is about 4.26. At equivalence, pH is about 8.52. 

Looking at the options, option A: 4.26; 8.52. So that would be the correct answer.

But wait, another thought: Did I correctly calculate the pH at 25% titration?

Wait, the 25% is 25% of the equivalence volume. Yes, because equivalence is 10 cm³, 25% is 2.5 cm³.

So the solution after 2.5 cm³ NaOH added.

Moles of NaOH: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. 

So the reaction is CH3COOH + OH^- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.001 mol. After reaction: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] =0.00025 /0.0425 ≈0.005882 M.

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log ( [A^-]/[HA] )

pKa is 4.73 (approx), as calculated earlier.

Ratio is 0.005882 /0.017647 = approximately 0.3333. Log(0.3333)= -0.477.

So pH=4.73 -0.477=4.253 ≈4.26.

Which matches option A.

So the two values would be 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the initial concentration of acetic acid is \( 0.05 \, \text{M} \), and the volumes before and after dilution are \( 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \) and \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \), respectively. The diluted concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the equivalence point. The moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = M_2 \times V_2 = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the reaction with \( \text{NaOH} \) is \( 1:1 \), the moles of \( \text{NaOH} \) required for equivalence are also \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \). The volume of \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \, \text{NaOH} \) needed is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{M_{\text{NaOH}}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At \( 25\% \) titration, \( 25\% \) of the equivalence volume (i.e., \( 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 \)) of \( \text{NaOH} \) has been added. The moles of \( \text{NaOH} \) added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = M_{\text{NaOH}} \times V_{\text{NaOH}} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and the moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH}}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^-}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(K_a) = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \), the pH at \( 25\% \) titration is:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.3333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ion. The moles of acetate ion are \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \), and the total volume is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^-}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \( K_b \ll [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] \), the concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) is:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log([\text{OH}^-]) = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, using the quadratic equation for \( [\text{OH}^-] \), the pH at the equivalence point is recalculated to be approximately \( 8.52 \).

Thus, the pH values are \( 4.26 \) at \( 25\% \) titration and \( 8.52 \) at the equivalence point, corresponding to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
