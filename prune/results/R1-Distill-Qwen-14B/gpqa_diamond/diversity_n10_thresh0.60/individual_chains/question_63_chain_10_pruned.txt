Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum models. Hmm, I should take it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about a diatomic molecule composed of elements X and Y. It’s modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed. I need to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state.

The given data are:
- Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
- Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
- Bond length (R) = 2 angstroms
- Angular frequency (w) = 4e14 rad/s

The options are A to D, with different momentum values.

Wait, so the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so when a photon is absorbed, the molecule must transition to the next higher energy state. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized for both rotational and vibrational modes.

Oh right, the energy levels for rotation are given by E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. For vibration, the energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) h ν, where ν is the frequency of vibration. Since the problem mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, I think it's considering both rotational and vibrational energy changes.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the state where both rotational and vibrational quantum numbers are at their lowest. So n=0 for vibration and J=0 for rotation. But wait, for diatomic molecules, the rotational state J can't be zero because of the rotational selection rules. Oh, but I'm not sure about that. Wait, no, J can be zero, but in reality, the ground state is J=0 for linear molecules? Or maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think.

In any case, the problem is about the photon causing the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I'm guessing that the molecule is transitioning from the fundamental state to a higher state, either by increasing vibration or rotation.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the first higher energy state. But the energy in rotation and vibration can change. So perhaps the photon
