Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a four-fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on the first and third positions of that structure.

They heat it with excess KOH at 240°C, creating a light yellow solid product 1. I think KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's an elimination reaction. Since there are two bromine atoms, perhaps it's a double elimination. Wait, but with two leaving groups. Oh right, when you have two adjacent leaving groups, like vicinal dihalides, heating with a base would lead to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. But wait, in this case, the dihalide isn't adjacent. Oh, because 1 and 3 positions on adamantane. Hmm, maybe it can form a bridge structure.

Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid, so positions 1 and 3 are on the same face or opposite? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. But when you have two bromines, elimination could form a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Oh, but KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in such reactions. Wait, substitution would require a good nucleophile, but KOH isn't the best for that. More likely elimination.

So, if we eliminate two HBr molecules from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, it would form an alkene. But where? The structure of adamantane is such that eliminating from 1 and 3 positions would lead to forming a double bond between carbons 1 and 3. Wait, but that's three carbons apart. Alternatively, perhaps the structure allows for a bridge formation. Wait, perhaps elimination leads to a bridged bicyclic structure with a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide? No, because the IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more like a carbonyl group. So maybe it's an elimination to form a ketone? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. How?

Wait, another possibility: when two vicinal bromides eliminate, they form a double bond. But if the carbons are not adjacent, maybe it's a different elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by another elimination. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the IR spectrum shows an absorbance at 1720 cm-1. That's around the region for a carbonyl group (C=O). So product 1 probably has a ketone group. So what reaction forms a ketone from a dihalide?

Wait, could it be that KOH is causing a substitution, but that seems less likely because KOH is a base. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a Fittig reaction? No, Fittig is for aryl halides.

Wait, wait, another thought. Maybe the two bromides are on adjacent carbons of a diamondoid structure, so elimination would form a double bond. But if the structure is such that the two Br's are on adjacent carbons, then elimination would form a double bond, leading to an alkene. But in that case, where would the carbonyl come from? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via elimination of two HBr and formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, how can that happen? Oh wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by another elimination, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and when treated with KOH, it undergoes elimination twice, leading to the formation of a ketone. How? Let's think about structure. If two Br are on adjacent carbons, elimination of HBr would form a double bond. But 1 and 3 positions are not adjacent. So maybe not. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2, but that's one elimination. Then another elimination might occur elsewhere. But I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach. The 1H NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). So, the peak at 4.79 is likely an -OH or an -OCH2 group, but wait, it's 2H, so maybe an OCH2 group. Or perhaps a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. The peak at around 4.8 could be an OCH2 in an ether or ester, but wait, the IR has a carbonyl, so maybe it's an ester or ketone.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm-1 is probably a ketone (around 1715 for ketones, maybe a bit higher for esters or maybe an aldehyde, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, which isn't in the NMR data. So perhaps a ketone.

So if the product is a ketone, how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a ketone upon treatment with KOH?

Wait, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then an oxidation occurs. Wait, but KOH is a base and not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination that leads to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the two bromides are on bridgehead carbons. In adamantane, carbons 1 and 3 are bridgehead carbons. So when you eliminate both bromides, perhaps each bridgehead loses a Br, forming two double bonds or a ring contraction. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, leading to the formation of a ketone. Let me think: elimination of HBr twice could lead to the formation of a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But KOH is a base, so more likely elimination. But let's think about the structure more.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the NMR data. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an -OCH2- group, perhaps in an ether or an ester. The 10H around 2.4-2.23 ppm likely belong to the adamantane structure. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be a CH2 group adjacent to something, maybe a carbonyl.

Wait, if product 1 is a diketone, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with an ethylene group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a vicinal diol. But the IR doesn't show a broad peak around 3300 for OH, but the NMR doesn't show any broad peaks either. So it's more likely that the product is a ketone.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about other possibilities. Oh! Maybe it's an epoxide. No, because the IR for an epoxide would show C-O-C stretching around 1200-1300 cm-1, maybe, but the given IR is 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexenone derivative. But I'm not sure how that would form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, leading to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a bridged bicyclic ketone. Let me think: elimination of two HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If each Br is on a bridgehead, eliminating HBr would form a double bond across the bridge. But how would that form a ketone?

Wait, maybe the elimination doesn't form a double bond but instead leads to a ring contraction, releasing two HBr and forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere with this. Let me perhaps think about the next steps. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Hmm, Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So product 1 must be something that can undergo a Friedel-Crafts reaction. But what's product 1?

Wait, if product 1 has a ketone group, then maybe it's an acylium ion or something that can form an acylium ion. But Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation or acylation of aromatic rings, but adamantane isn't aromatic. Hmm.

Wait, unless product 1 is an acyl chloride, but the IR for an acyl chloride would show a peak around 1800 cm-1, and the NMR might show a different pattern. But the IR here is 1720, which is more like a ketone.

Alternatively, product 1 is a ketone, and then product 2 is formed by some kind of acylation. But I'm not sure.

Moving further, product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, yielding product 3. Ozone is used for ozonolysis of alkenes. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So product 2 has a double bond because ozonolysis cleaves it. Then, product 3 would be the result of breaking that double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me recap. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with ketone) via KOH → product 2 via Al(OiPr)3 → product 3 via ozonolysis.

Wait, product 2 must have a double bond because ozonolysis is done on it. So product 1 must have something that, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, forms product 2 with a double bond. So maybe product 1 is a ketone with a good leaving group, and Al(OiPr)3 helps eliminate to form a double bond.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is a epoxide, but earlier I thought the IR doesn't support that.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a diol, but the IR doesn't show broad OH stretches, and the NMR doesn't either.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diketone. No, that seems unlikely.

Wait, let's think about the NMR for product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H, triplet?), wait, no, the question doesn't specify splitting. The 2H at ~4.8 could be a -CH2-O- group, like an ether. If product 1 is a diether, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but product 1 is a solid, and the IR shows a carbonyl. So if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, must form something else. Maybe a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but the substrate would need an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: maybe product 1 is a cyclopropane ring? No, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a ketone, and product 2 is the result of some kind of elimination, forming an alkene. So when product 1 (a ketone) is treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes an elimination reaction, forming a double bond adjacent to the ketone. Then, product 2 would have an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

But wait, ozonolysis can be regioselective. But in any case, the product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Wait, so let's think about the structure. Suppose product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, like (E)- or (Z)-something. Ozonolysis would break the double bond, and each fragment would form a carbonyl group. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But the question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange, like OH).

Wait, but if product 3 is from ozonolysis, which cleaves the double bond, maybe product 3 is a diketone. Let's think about the structure.

Wait, but let me think of the overall steps again.

1,3-dibromoadamantane → KOH → product 1 (maybe a ketone). Then, product 1 + Al(OiPr)3 → product 2 (maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone). Then, ozonolysis → product 3 (maybe a diketone or a dialdehyde or a mix, depending on the starting structure).

Wait, but ozonolysis of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone would break the double bond and form a carbonyl on each end. For example, if product 2 is CH2=CH-C(=O)-R, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

But wait, in reality, ozonolysis of an α,β-unsaturated ketone would give a diketone. Because when ozone cleaves the double bond, each end would form a carbonyl group. So if the structure was R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-..., no, that's not right. Wait, actually, ozonolysis of a conjugated enone (like R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-) would break between the two carbonyls. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting that right.

Wait, maybe I should think about the ozonolysis of a simple alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. For example, suppose the structure is (E)- or (Z)-CH2-C(=O)-R. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. Wait, if it's CH2=CH-C(=O)-R, then ozonolysis would give two aldehydes (if R is a small group) or ketones (if R is an alkyl group).

Wait, but in any case, the product after ozonolysis would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. So, for product 3, the NMR would show the hydrogen atoms adjacent to carbonyl groups, which are typically deshielded and appear downfield.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say it's an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm, but in the NMR data provided, the highest is 4.79 ppm, so probably not. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH group next to a carbonyl.

Wait, but in product 3, perhaps each of the cleavage points becomes a carbonyl, so we have two new carbonyl groups. So, any hydrogen adjacent to those would be split into a certain coupling pattern.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding exchangeables). Let's think: if the structure after ozonolysis is something like O=C-R-CH2-CHO, then the CH2 would be next to a carbonyl. But let me think of a specific structure.

Suppose product 2 is a diene. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyls. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a single double bond which is then cleaved into two carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an adamantane derivative with a double bond. So product 2 might be 1,3-diene or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a cyclohexenone derivative. Then, when product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps an elimination occurs to form an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So product 2 would have a double bond conjugated to the ketone.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would be a diketone or something similar.

So in product 3, the hydrogen atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups would be deshielded. Let's say, for example, each end of the former double bond becomes a carbonyl, so if the original structure was R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-R', after ozonolysis, perhaps we get R-C(=O)-O and O-C(=O)-R', but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of a specific example. Let's say product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, like (E)- or (Z)-cyclohexenone. Ozonolysis of cyclohexenone would break the double bond and form two ketone groups. Wait, but cyclohexenone has a carbonyl and a double bond adjacent. So ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls.

Wait, ozonolysis of cyclohexene (without the ketone) would give two aldehydes, but in this case, the ketone is adjacent. So perhaps the cleavage would be between the carbonyl and the double bond, leading to a diketone.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to get back on track. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

Assuming that product 3 has a structure where the most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group, and perhaps coupled to two equivalent protons, leading to a triplet. Or maybe coupled to two sets of protons, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, another approach: when ozonolysis is done on a simple alkene, say ethylene, it gives two formaldehyde molecules. But in a more complex structure, each end would form a carbonyl group. So, for example, if product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would give two ketones or aldehydes, depending on substitution.

But in our case, product 2 is derived from an adamantane structure, so it's probably a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an adamantane derivative with a double bond. So, when ozonolysis is done, it breaks the double bond into two carbonyl groups. Then, the resulting product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. So, any hydrogen adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded.

In product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen would be next to a carbonyl. Let's say it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. If that CH2 is between two carbonyls, the protons on that CH2 would be split by adjacent protons.

Wait, but if it's a CH2 group between two carbonyls, each CH2 proton would be split by the neighboring CH2. Let's say the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. No, that's not possible because that would be a four-carbon chain, but in adamantane, perhaps it's a bridge.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure where there's a CH next to a carbonyl. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-CHO. Wait, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogen is part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to a carbonyl group and has neighboring Hs that split the signal.

Wait, suppose the structure is O=C-CH2-CHO. Then, the CH2 group between the two carbonyls would have each H coupled to the Hs on the adjacent CH2. Wait, but in that case, the CH2 would be between two carbonyls, so each CH2 H would be split by the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but in reality, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then the central CH2 would have each H coupled to the two Hs on each adjacent CH2. But that's symmetric, so perhaps each H would be a quartet. Or maybe a triplet.

Wait, no, actually, each H in the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets or something more complex.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is between two carbonyls, each H in the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2 groups. So each H would see two neighboring Hs on each side, causing a triplet for each coupling. But I'm not sure how that would combine.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of a simple example. Let's say we have a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, the middle CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups. Wait, but that would require a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CHO. Then, the CH2 would be between the carbonyl and the aldehyde. Each H on the CH2 would be split by the neighboring H on the aldehyde side. But that's only one neighboring H, leading to a doublet.

But in the given NMR of product 1, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could correspond to an OCH2 group, perhaps. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH group next to a carbonyl. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH2X)-..., but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say it's a CH group next to a carbonyl, perhaps with neighboring Hs that cause splitting.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, perhaps I can think about the options. The options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

Assuming that the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, which is next to another CH2 group, each H in the central CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2 groups. So each H would have two neighboring Hs on each side, leading to a triplet from each coupling. So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets, leading to option B.

Alternatively, if a CH2 is between two CH2 groups, each H would be split by two Hs on each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets. So option B.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, which has two Hs, then each H in the CH2 would be split into a triplet due to coupling with the two Hs on the CH group. So that would lead to a triplet.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again.

If the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to another CH2 group, each H in the first CH2 would be split by the two Hs in the adjacent CH2. So each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet. But since the adjacent group is also split, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is between two CH groups, each with two Hs, leading to each H in the CH2 being split into a triplet by each adjacent CH group, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH group that's next to a CH2 group. So, for example, O=C-CH(CH2X)-..., where the CH is next to a CH2. The H on the CH would be split by the two Hs on the CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the H is part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to a CH group (which has two Hs), then each H in the CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the CH, leading to a triplet.

In that case, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

So, the options are A) triplet, which would fit that scenario.

Alternatively, if the H is part of a CH2 group that's between two CH groups, each with two Hs, then each H in the CH2 would be split into a triplet by each adjacent CH group. But that would result in a triplet of triplets, making option B.

I'm a bit torn between options A and B. Let me think about the possible structures again.

If product 3 is a diketone from ozonolysis, perhaps it's a structure where a former double bond is split into two carbonyl groups. Suppose the original structure (product 2) had a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and another double bond elsewhere, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a single carbonyl group, but that's not aligned with the ozonolysis step.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, where each ketone is separated by a CH2 group. So the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. But in that case, the central CH2 would have Hs that are each coupled to two Hs on each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in reality, the Hs on the central CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2 groups on both sides. Each H would have two neighboring Hs on each side, leading to a triplet from each coupling. So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets, making the coupling pattern option B.

So, the most deshielded H would be part of the central CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon heating with KOH, the product (product 1) is identified as a ketone based on the IR spectrum (1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group) and the NMR data (4.79 ppm, likely an OCH₂ group; 2.41-2.23 ppm, adamantane-related CH groups; 1.94 ppm, CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl). The reaction likely involves elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a ketone.

When product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃), a Lewis acid catalyst, it undergoes a reaction to form product 2. This step likely involves the formation of an α,β-unsaturated ketone via elimination, introducing a double bond conjugated to the carbonyl group.

In the next step, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3, which is a diketone. The cleavage of the double bond results in two carbonyl groups, and the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to one of these carbonyl groups.

The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen is determined by its interaction with neighboring hydrogens. If the hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group between two carbonyls, it would be split by the two hydrogens on each adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet of triplets. This splitting pattern arises because each hydrogen in the CH₂ group is coupled to two hydrogens on one side and two hydrogens on the other side.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet of triplets.
