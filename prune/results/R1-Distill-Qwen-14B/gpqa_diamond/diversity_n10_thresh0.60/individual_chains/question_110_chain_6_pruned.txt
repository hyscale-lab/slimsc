Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs. The spectrographs are ESPRESSO at Paranal Observatory and HIRES at Keck Observatory. I remember that each of these has different brightness limits for the stars they can observe. 

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various properties, and I need to figure out which ones are bright enough to be seen by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

First, I need to understand the brightness limits. The problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, I'm a bit confused. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter than 17, that means it's magnitude is less than 17. Because like, Sirius is magnitude -1, which is brighter than a star at magnitude 0. So, higher magnitudes are fainter, lower are brighter.

So, for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag less than 17 can be observed. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so apparent V mag less than 16. So the key is to find stars whose apparent brightness (apparent V magnitude) is less than 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES.

Wait no, wait, the problem says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed". Wait, that's confusing. Because "brighter than 17" would mean apparent magnitude less than 17. Because the scale is inverted. Right, because apparent magnitude is lower for brighter objects. So if a star has an apparent V magnitude of 16, it's brighter than 17. So for ESPRESSO, they can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, which translates to V <17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V <16.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. The way the problem states: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So if a star's apparent V is brighter than 17, meaning it's V mag is less than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V <17. HIRES: stars brighter than 16 mag (V <16). So a star must have V <17 for ESPRESSO and also V <16 for HIRES. Wait no, because the question is asking which stars can be detected with both. So the star must be observable by both. So it must meet the condition for both.

So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than 17 (so ESPRESSO can see it), and less than 16 (so HIRES can see it). Because HIRES can only see stars brighter than 16 (V <16). So the stricter condition is V <16. So the star must have an apparent V mag less than 16.

But wait, some stars may have their magnitudes affected by interstellar extinction (dust
