Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos and the Sun. Hmm, I remember that the Sun produces neutrinos through various nuclear reactions, right? The question is about the pp-III branch suddenly stopping. Wait, what's the pp-III branch again? Oh right, the proton-proton chain has different branches. The pp-I branch is the main one, I think, and pp-II and pp-III are other pathways. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

So the scenario is that the pp-III branch stops about 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, 8.5 minutes is roughly the time it takes for a neutrino from the Sun's core to reach Earth. So if the pp-III branch stopped, we would see a change in the neutrino flux here on Earth after that delay.

Wait, what neutrinos are produced by the pp-III branch? I think the pp-I branch produces a lot of the high-energy neutrinos, like the Beryllium-7 ones. But pp-III might be producing lower energy neutrinos. Or was it the other way around? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's the other wayâ€”pp-III produces higher energy neutrinos, but I'm not so sure.

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So we're looking at neutrinos just below and above 800 keV.

If the pp
