Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics because the speeds are a significant fraction of c. So I have to use special relativity concepts here.

The problem states: two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait a minute, wait. So the first astronaut has mass 2m and speed 0.6c. The second has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. But wait, both are moving in the same direction. So I guess the relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds because in relativity, velocities don't add that way.

Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. So the relative speed formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c^2)). But wait, wait. Wait, no. Because when you have two objects moving in the same direction, the relative speed of one with respect to the other is (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). But wait, actually, I think I might have it backwards. Wait no, the formula for u (the relative velocity of object 2 as seen from object 1's frame) is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Alternatively, if object 1 is moving at speed v1 and object 2 at v2, then from object 1's frame, object 2's speed is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, v2 is 0.5c and v1 is 0.6c. So if I'm calculating the relative speed of the second astronaut from the first's perspective, it would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, no, wait! Wait, no, because in this case, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c relative to our lab frame, and the second is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from the first astronaut's frame, the second astronaut's speed is v' = (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Because v2 is the speed of the second in the lab frame, and v1 is the speed of the first.

So substituting the values: (0.5c - 0.6c) / [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c^2)].

Calculating numerator: 0.5c -0.6c = -0.1c. So the numerator is -0.1c, which indicates the second astronaut is moving at -0.1c relative to the first, but since speed is positive, the magnitude is 0.1c. But wait, wait, no, speed is just the magnitude, so the relative speed would be 0.1c. Hmm, but wait, the options have 0.14c in some choices. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me recheck the calculation. The denominator is 1 - (0.6 * 0.5) c² / c². So 0.6 * 0.5 is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the speed is (-0.1c) / 0.7. Which is approximately -0.142857 c. So about -0.143c. The negative sign indicates direction, but speed is positive, so the relative speed is 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's the relative speed between them. So looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c.

Now, what about the total energy of the system? The total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies. Each astronaut's energy is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy.

So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v=0.6c: 1 - (0.6)^2 = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 is gamma * m c² * 2m? Wait, wait. Wait, the relativistic energy equation is E = gamma * m c^2. So the astronaut's mass is 2m, so E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c².

Similarly, for the second astronaut, mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * (3m) c².

Calculating each:

E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E = E1 + E2 = (2.5 + 3.464) m c² ≈5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2 and v_rel=0.14c. Option B has E=4.96, which doesn't match. Option D has E=5 mc^2, which is lower than our calculated value.

So the correct answer is option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) (for the first astronaut) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\) (for the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

1. **Numerator**: \(0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c\).  
   The negative sign indicates direction, but the magnitude is \(0.1c\).

2. **Denominator**: \(1 - \frac{(0.6)(0.5)}{1} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\).

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.142857c
\]

The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the negative sign confirms that the second astronaut is moving slower than the first.

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut
- Mass: \(2m\), Speed: \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2\)

#### Second Astronaut
- Mass: \(3m\), Speed: \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2\)

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

Thus, the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\).

---

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\).
- The total energy is \(E = 5.96m c^2\).
