Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's see. The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is going in the same direction. So, the light is moving through the glass which itself is moving. I remember that when a medium is moving relative to an observer, it affects the way light propagates in that medium.

Right, the index of refraction n is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed in the medium. Normally, in a stationary medium, the speed of light is c/n. But when the medium is moving, does that change the speed? Or does it just affect the direction?

Oh, right! The speed of light in a medium isn't just based on the medium's velocity. Wait, but according to special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the source's motion. But when the medium is moving, like a material medium (like glass), the situation is a bit different because the medium's refractive index comes into play.

Wait, but the medium is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed? I think about the Doppler effect? Or maybe it's more straightforward.

Let me think. Normally, in the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is c/n. But when the
