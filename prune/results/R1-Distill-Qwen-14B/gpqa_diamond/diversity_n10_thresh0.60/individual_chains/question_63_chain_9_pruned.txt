Okay, so I have this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the photon that should be absorbed to switch it to the next lowest energy state. The options are given as A to D with various momentum values.

Wait, first, I need to understand the model. The quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model, I think. So, this model accounts for both rotational and vibrational energy states. Oh right, diatomic molecules can both rotate and vibrate, so their energy isn't just kinetic or potential but a combination.

The fundamental state probably refers to the lowest energy state available. But wait, in the context of rotation-vibration, the fundamental state is the state with the lowest vibrational and rotational energy. So, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next higher state, which would likely involve either an increase in vibrational or rotational energy, or both.

Wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that would be the next state that's the smallest in energy. I think that would be the first excited state, either increasing the vibrational quantum number or the rotational one. But wait, sometimes, the first transition is a vibrational one because the vibrational energy levels are more spaced out than rotational.

Wait, no. The spacing between rotational energy levels is smaller than that of vibrational levels. So, the rotational transitions might involve lower energy photons. But the question is about the next possible state, regardless of whether it's rotation or vibration.

Wait, but the problem says 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.' So perhaps the next state is the least energy increase. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized and depend on the rotational quantum number J. The energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For a rigid rotor, B is inversely proportional to the moment of inertia.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length might change, so it's treated as a non-rigid rotorâ€”this might complicate things. But perhaps the question is more about the vibrational part.

Wait, the problem gives me angular frequency w for vibration. So I think the key here is to
