Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think this through.

Alright, first, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance to stars. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, right, parallax (p) is inversely proportional to distance (d), so p = 1/d, but wait, more accurately, it's p = (1 parsec) / d, but the exact formula might not matter here.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly in what sense? Oh, wait, probably uniform in space, meaning the number density of stars is constant. So if you look at any volume in space, there's the same number of stars per unit volume.

Now, the problem is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (like per unit plx, say 1 parsec in parallax) changes with plx. So if I have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Wait, let me think in terms of volume. Because parallax is related to distance. So a higher parallax means closer stars, lower parallax means farther away.

If I imagine a sphere with a certain radius (distance) from us, the volume of that sphere would be (4/3)πd³. The number of stars within that sphere would be the volume multiplied by the number density (n), which is constant. So
