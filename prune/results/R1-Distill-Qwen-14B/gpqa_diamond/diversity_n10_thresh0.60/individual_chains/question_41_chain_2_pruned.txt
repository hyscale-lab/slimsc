Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on relativity and stuff, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. Oh, and the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1. The options are A to D.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer. And the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So, the glass is moving towards us, and the light in it is also moving in that same direction.

I remember something about the index of refraction affecting the speed of light. The speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n. So in the glass, the speed of light relative to the glass would be 1/n, since c=1.

But wait, the glass is moving. So the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving. So we need to find the speed of the light as observed from the lab, considering the motion of the glass.

I think this is a case where we have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because when objects are moving relative to each other, their velocities don't just add linearly. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²), but wait, that's when you're moving at velocity v relative to the medium. Or is it the other way around? Hmm.

Wait, in this scenario, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light is moving at v_light = 1/n relative to the glass. So, from the lab frame, what is the speed of the light?

So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at v_light = 1/n. But the glass itself is moving at v towards the lab. So to get the speed in the lab frame, we apply the velocity addition formula.

Wait, no. Because according to the lab, the glass is moving at velocity v. So the light's velocity in the lab frame is the glass's velocity plus the light's velocity relative to the glass, but adjusted for relativity.

Alternatively, the velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(c²)). But wait, in this case, u
