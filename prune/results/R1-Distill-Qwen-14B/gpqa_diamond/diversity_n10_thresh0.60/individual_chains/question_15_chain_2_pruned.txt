Okay, so I have this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both were detected via the RV method, which gives us their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both orbits are circular.

The host stars are a bit different. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But wait, both stars have the same radius. I remember that a star's radius affects the transit depth. Oh, right, the transit probability also depends on the size of the star because the planet has to pass in front of it from our line of sight.

I think the transit probability is related to the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. But wait, no, the probability is more about the planet's orbital plane being edge-on relative to us. The probability that a planet transits is a function of the size of the star and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, the probability of a transit is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, where a_planet is the semi-major axis. But since both planets are Earth-like, maybe the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, so maybe we can approximate it as R_star / a_planet. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another approach: the probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the
