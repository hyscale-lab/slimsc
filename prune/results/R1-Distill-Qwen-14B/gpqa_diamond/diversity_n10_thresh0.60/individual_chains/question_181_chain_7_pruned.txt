Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let's try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, with the proton-proton chain being the main one. The pp-III branch is part of this chain. Oh wait, the proton-proton chain has different branches. There's the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Each of these produces different neutrino types, I think. Oh right, the pp-I branch produces electron neutrinos (Î½_e), and so do the other branches, but maybe the pp-III branch is a minor contributor.

Wait, neutrinos are produced when a neutron converts into a proton, emitting a neutrino. So in the pp chain, the initial steps produce a lot of neutrinos. The pp-I branch is the dominant one, right? So if the pp-III suddenly stops, what happens?

The question says that the pp-III branch stops about 8 and a half minutes ago. That's the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to the Earth, so any neutrinos would have been emitted after the stoppage wouldn't reach us yet. So, the neutrinos we detect now must have been emitted before the pp-III branch stopped.

Wait, no. Because neutrinos move at nearly the speed of light, just like photons. So if the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, any neutrinos from that process would have arrived here around the same time
