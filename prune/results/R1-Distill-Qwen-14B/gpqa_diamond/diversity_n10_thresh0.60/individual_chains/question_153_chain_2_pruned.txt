Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reactions, and I need to figure out the products. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question has three different reactions labeled A, B, and C, each with their own reactants and conditions. My goal is to find out what the major products are for each and match them with the options provided.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack by an enolate on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. 

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The structure of dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH2. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it forms an enolate ion at the central carbon. The enolate will attack the beta position (the less substituted carbon) of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. 

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure here is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, actually, wait, the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Oh wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; so 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Another way: acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; so methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. If it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, then the acrylate part is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon. So it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon of the acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-O-CH3, but wait, that's just methyl acrylate. Oh wait, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, meaning the substituent is on the double bond's beta position.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-p-tolyl? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The general structure for an acrylate is CH2=CH-COOR. So methyl acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. If it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, then the substituent is on the third carbon, which is the carbonyl carbon. So maybe it's CH2=CH-C(O-p-tolyl)-OCH3?
