Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's read it again. It says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The question is about finding the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with excited atoms in stellar atmospheres, it's about the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The more excited the atoms, the higher the probability of being in a higher energy state.

The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights. If the question says that star_1 has twice as excited iron atoms, that probably means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the ground state is twice as much as in star_2.

So for star_1, the ratio N1_excited/N1_ground = 2 * (N2_excited/N2_ground). Because star_1 is twice as excited as star_2. Let me write that down. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

The Boltzmann equation for each star would be R = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ). Assuming the energy difference ΔE is the same for both stars because it's the same energy levels. So ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but actually, the question says the energy difference is the same for both stars, right? Because it's a specific energy level difference in the same element, iron.

So, the ratio R1/R2 = (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) / ( (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)) ) )? Wait, no, because the g's are the same for both stars since it's the same element. So the statistical weight ratio would cancel out.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The ratio N_excited/N_ground = (g_excited/g_ground) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). For star
