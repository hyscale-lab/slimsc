Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and is equal to c times S, where c is h/(4π), and S is given. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, first off, I need to construct the matrix Ay.

Wait, the structure of S looks familiar. Oh right, S matrices are often related to Pauli matrices. Pauli matrices are 2x2 and used in spin operators. The standard Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly what S is here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, also known as σy.

So the operator Ay is c multiplied by σy. Since c is h/(4π), I can write Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Remember, eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are ±1. But wait, wait. Because each Pauli matrix (σx, σy, σz) has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when multiplied by a constant, the eigenvalues would be scaled by that constant.

So σy has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Therefore, Ay, which is (h/(4π)) * σy, should have eigenvalues (h/(4π)) * (+1) and (h/(4π))*(-1). So the eigenvalues a would be ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. Option A says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts as ±2πh and real parts ± h/(4π). No, that can't be right because the eigenvalues of Ay should be real, since it's an observable (angular momentum operator), right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, angular momentum is an observable, so its components should have real eigenvalues. But wait, the matrix Ay is based on σy, which is Hermitian. So yes, Ay should be Hermitian, so eigenvalues are real.

So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real numbers, so their imaginary parts are zero. So none of the options A or B are correct because they talk about imaginary parts. So options A and B are out.

Now, options C and D. Let's think about them.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Hmm. Since angular momentum operators satisfy [A², Az] = 0, the eigenfunctions of A² and Az are simultaneous eigenfunctions. But for Ay, which is another component, the eigenfunctions are not the same as Az. Wait, A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with all components. So if a function is an eigenstate of Ay and A², it's also an eigenstate of A², but not necessarily of Az. Because [Ay, Az] = iħ A (but wait, in the case of spin, maybe it's different. For spin-½ particles, the angular momentum components satisfy [Sx,
