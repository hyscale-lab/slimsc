Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. 

First, I remember that the interplanar distance d is given by the formula d = a / √(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ), where a is the lattice parameter, and h, k, l are the Miller indices. Wait, but wait, for a cubic system, when angles are 90 degrees, this simplifies because the cosine terms are zero. But here, the crystal is rhombohedral, which means all the angles are equal but not 90 degrees. So the formula must include those cosine terms.

So the given data is: interatomic distance is 10 Å. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, in a crystal, the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along a lattice direction. For a simple cubic structure, that's just the lattice parameter a. But in a rhombohedral crystal, the interatomic distance would be along one of the lattice vectors, which may not be the same as a. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait a minute, in a rhombohedral crystal, the unit cell is defined by three vectors a, b, c, all of the same length a (since it's rhombohedral, so a = b = c), and all angles between them are equal (α=β=γ=30 degrees). So the lattice parameter would be a, which is the interatomic distance along the edges of the rhombohedron. So in the question, the interatomic distance is 10 Å, so that's a. So a = 10 Å.

Now, the question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. So the Miller indices are h=1, k=1, l=1.

Putting these into the formula, we get:

d = a / sqrt( (1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) - 2*(1*1 cos 30°) - 2*(1*1 cos 30°) - 2*(1*1 cos 30°) )

Wait, let me compute that denominator step by step.

First, the sum of squares: 1 + 1 +
