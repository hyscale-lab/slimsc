Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup is an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. The particles have negligible mass. Out of these, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, okay. So, I'm thinking this has to do with electric potential energy because we're dealing with charges and energy. I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of charges depends on the configuration of the charges.

Wait, so the system has 13 charges. Twelve are at a fixed distance from point P, and one is fixed at P. So the 12 charges are all 2 meters away from P. The 13th is at P. So, each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th.

Wait a minute, but since all the 12 are at the same distance from P, maybe this is a scenario where we can model this as a central charge with other charges placed around it. But since they're all at the same distance, maybe it's like a spherical arrangement.

But wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So each of the 12 particles is 2 meters away from P. The 13th is fixed at P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th charge.

So, the system comprises a central charge (at P) and 12 surrounding charges all at radius 2 meters. Now, what's the potential energy of this system?

Wait, potential energy in a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Since all the 12 are identical and at the same distance from the central charge, maybe we can calculate the energy contributed by each of those 12 charges and then sum them up.

Let me think about the formula. The electric potential energy (U) between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula: U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately
