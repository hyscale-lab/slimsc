Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I remember that angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are often represented by matrices. The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. 

Wait, the operator A_y is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

First, let's write out what the matrix S looks like. Matrix S is:

[ 0    -i ]
[ i     0 ]

Now, since Ay = c * S, and c is h/(4π), that means each element of S is multiplied by c. So Ay becomes:

[ 0       -i c ]
[ i c       0 ]

Since c is h/(4π), substituting that in, the matrix is:

[ 0     -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))    0 ]

But wait, when solving for eigenvalues, the actual values might not matter as much as the structure. Let's see, the eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix like this can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

The matrix (Ay - λI) would be:

[ -λ       (-i c)  ]
[ i c      -λ     ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (i c)(i c) = λ² - (i c)(i c). But wait, (i c)(i c) = i² c² = (-1) c². So the determinant is λ² - (- c²) = λ² + c². Setting this equal to zero: λ² + c² = 0 → λ² = - c² → λ = ±i c.

So the eigenvalues are λ = i c and λ = -i c.

Wait, but c is h/(4π). So substituting that in, the eigenvalues are ±i*(h/(4π)).

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly mention imaginary eigenvalues. Hmm, let me check the options again.

Option A: Im eigenvalue are ±2πh,
