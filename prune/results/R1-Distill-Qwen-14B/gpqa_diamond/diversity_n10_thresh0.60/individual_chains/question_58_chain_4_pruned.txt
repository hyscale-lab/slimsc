Okay, so I have this question here about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? Oh right, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are the infinities that pop up when you calculate certain quantities, like the charge of an electron or the mass of a particle. By introducing a cutoff or some other method, you can make the calculations finite and then take the cutoff to infinity carefully. So regularization is a way to handle these infinities before you renormalize.

But the question is about which theory never needs this regularization. So I'm looking for a theory that doesn't have these divergences when you go to high energies. Or perhaps a theory that naturally avoids them without needing such techniques.

Let's go through each option.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. That's the non-quantum version of electromagnetism. Wait, in classical theories, like Maxwell's equations, do they have issues with high energies? Well, in classical electromagnetism, when you look at point charges, you get problems with infinite fields at the origin. But does that relate to regularization? Or is that more about renormalization in the quantum theory?

Wait, but wait. The question is about the theories themselves. Classical Electrodynamics doesn't involve quantum effects, so maybe it doesn't require
