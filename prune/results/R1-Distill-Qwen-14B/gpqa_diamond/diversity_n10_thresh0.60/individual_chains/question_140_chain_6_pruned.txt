Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question carefully again.

The problem talks about a substance X reacting violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, and the melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a very close analog. The question is about finding the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by figuring out what each part could mean.

First, let's think about what X could be. The reaction is violent, so maybe it's a strong base reacting with something acidic? Like, for example, NaOH reacting with an acid, but that might not be violent enough. Or maybe something like a metal reacting with an acid to produce hydrogen gas.

Wait, the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. The only gas that comes to mind with equal protons and neutrons is H2O? No, wait, H2O has a proton count of 2 (since it's H2O), but neutrons would be 10 (since O has 8 neutrons, H has none). That doesn't match. Another thought: maybe it's CH4? No, that's 6 protons, 6 neutrons? Wait, CH4 has 6 (C) + 4*(1) = 10 protons. No, wait, each CH4 molecule has 6 protons (from C) plus 4 hydrogens, so 6+4=10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 neutrons (since C-12 is the common isotope), and each H has 0. So total neutrons would be 6. That's 10 protons and 6 neutrons, which doesn't match. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe the gas is something like NH3? Let's see: NH3 has 14 (N) + 3 (H) = 17 protons. Neutrons: N has 7 (since N-14 has 7 neutrons), and H has 0. So
