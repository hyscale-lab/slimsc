Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me about the muon's intrinsic angular momentum. Hmm, okay, let me think this through.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y, which is given as A_y = c·S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So, S looks like this:

[0 -i
i 0]

I remember that the intrinsic angular momentum operators, like A_x, A_y, A_z, are related to the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, right, for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operator components are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So for S in this problem, maybe S is similar to one of the Pauli matrices.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Let me recall their forms. Oh right:

σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So S here is exactly σ_y. Because the given S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches σ_y. So S is σ_y. 

Now, the operator A_y is c times σ_y. So A_y = (h/4π) * σ_y. But wait, what's the standard expression for the spin operator? Oh, right, the spin operator for each component is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix. So A_y would be (ħ/2) σ_y. Wait, but in the problem, c is h/(4π), and since ħ = h/(2π), that makes sense. Because if we plug c in, A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. Yep, that's correct.

So the eigenvalues of σ_y are the same as for any Pauli matrix, which are ±1, right? Because for any Pauli matrix, the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. So when multiplied by (ħ/2), the eigenvalues of A_y would be (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1).
