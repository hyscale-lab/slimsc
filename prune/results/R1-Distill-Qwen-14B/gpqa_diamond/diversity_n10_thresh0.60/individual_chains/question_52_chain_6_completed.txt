Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a star where 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots. When the spots aren't there, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, but when 40% is covered, it drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Specifically, when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

Wait, so when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. The spots are darker, so maybe they are cooler regions? But the star's overall photosphere is being considered. In LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the excitation of atoms depends on temperature.

The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the question isn't about the ratio of populations in different energy levels, but rather the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels. So each level corresponds to a different energy state in the neutral Ti atoms.

So when the star's overall Teff changes, the excitation of these levels will change. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler regions. Does that affect the overall photosphere's average temperature? Or is the star's overall Teff the effective temperature averaged over the spotted and unspotted areas?

Wait, the question says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff decreases. So the temperature of the photosphere (which is the region we're considering) is 5500 K in the spotted case, and 6000 K otherwise.

The ratio of Ti atoms in two levels depends on the temperature of the photosphere. So when the temperature changes, the ratio changes. The problem states that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So the ratio when spotted is lower than when unspotted.

We need to find the factor by which the ratio changes. So factor = (n1/n2 when no spots) / (n1/n2 when spots) = (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

Wait, no. Wait, the ratio is n1/n2? Or is it level 1 (lower energy) to level 2 (higher energy)? Because the Boltzmann factor would be exp( - delta E/(kT) ), so higher energy levels have fewer atoms.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2, which is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) ). So as T increases, the exponential term becomes larger because the denominator kT is bigger, so the ratio n1/n2 increases with T.

Wait, let me get the Boltzmann equation right. The ratio of populations is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ). So higher energy levels have lower populations. So if E2 > E1, then as T increases, the exponential becomes less negative, so the ratio n2/n1 increases. So if the temperature increases, more atoms are in the higher energy level.

In our problem, when the star has spots, the photospheric T decreases from 6000 K to 5500 K. So T goes down. So the ratio of n2/n1 would decrease because the exponential is smaller. But the question says that the observed ratio (n1/n2?) decreases. Wait, wait the question says: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots."

Wait, how is the ratio defined? Is it level 1 to level 2, or level 2 to level 1? Let me recheck.

Ah, the ratio is n1/n2. So when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases. Hmm. Let me see.

Wait, using the Boltzmann equation:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(kT) )

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) )

If E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So when T increases, the exponent becomes larger, so the ratio n1/n2 increases. Because the denominator in the exponential is kT, so higher T makes the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) smaller, making exp(...) larger. Wait, wait: (E2-E1) is positive, so as T increases, (E2-E1)/(kT) decreases, so the exponential term increases. So, n1/n2 increases with T.

Wait, so if T decreases, then (E2-E1)/(kT) increases, so the exponential becomes larger. Wait no, wait: when T is lower, (E2-E1)/(kT) is larger (since T is in the denominator). So, for example, if E2-E1 is fixed, a lower T makes (E2-E1)/(kT) larger, so exp( that ) becomes larger. So n1/n2 would increase when T decreases. But the problem states that when T decreases (due to spots), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. That seems contradictory. Hmm, wait maybe I got the levels wrong.

Wait, perhaps the higher energy level is level 2. So when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 (lower energy to higher) would decrease because in lower T, higher energy levels are less populated. So n2 decreases more than n1, so n1/n2 would increase.

But the problem says that when T goes down, the ratio decreases. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me think again. Suppose E2 > E1. So in a higher T, n2 is larger because more energy is available to populate higher levels. So n2/n1 would increase. So n1/n2 would decrease. Wait, let me think numerically.

Suppose E2-E1 is some positive value, say x.

At higher T: (x)/(k*T) is smaller. So exp(-x/(kT)) is larger (since exponent is more negative? Wait, no: x positive, T positive, so x/(kT) is positive. So exp(-x/(kT)) is 1 / exp(x/(kT)), which is a number between 0 and 1. So as T increases, x/(kT) decreases. So exp(-x/(kT)) approaches 1. So n2/n1 approaches (g2/g1) *1.

So, if T increases, n2/n1 increases.

Therefore, when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases.

So if the ratio n2/n1 decreases when T decreases, then if the observed ratio decreases when T is lower, what is the ratio they are talking about?

Wait the question says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots."

So when the star has spots, T is lower, and the ratio decreases. So if n2/n1 is the ratio, then when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases. So the ratio n2/n1 is what they're talking about, and it's decreasing. Wait, no: if spots lead to lower T, and the ratio n2/n1 decreases, then the observed ratio (n2/n1) is lower when T is lower.

So the ratio R = n2/n1. R decreases when T decreases.

But in the problem statement, when the star has spots, R decreases. So the question is to compute the factor by which R changes when the star is unspotted (T=6000 K) compared to when spotted (T=5500 K).

So the factor is R_unspotted / R_spotted.

So to compute that, we can take the ratio of the two R values.

R = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(kT) )

So R_unspotted / R_spotted = [ (g2/g1) * exp( -dE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) * exp( -dE/(k*5500) ) ]

The (g2/g1) terms cancel out.

So it becomes exp( [ -dE/(k*6000) + dE/(k*5500) ] )

Factor out dE/(k):

exp( dE/(k) [ 1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ] )

Compute the exponent:

Compute 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500 / (5500*6000) )

Wait, let me compute this.

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818
1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667
Difference ≈ 0.000015151

So 500/(5500*6000) = 500 / (33,000,000) ) = 1.515e-5, which is about 0.00001515, matching the previous calculation.

So the exponent is dE/(k) * 0.000015151.

Wait, but I don't know what dE is. Hmm. But perhaps the transition wavelength is given, which relates to the energy difference between the two levels.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So the energy difference is related to the photon's energy.

Energy of a photon: E = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant, c speed of light.

So dE = hc / λ.

But since we're dealing with the ratio, perhaps the exact value of dE doesn't matter because it will be a factor in the exponent. Wait but let's see.

Wait, the exponent in the R ratio is dE/(k) * [1/5500 - 1/6000] = (hc/λ) / k [ (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) ]

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but let's compute it numerically.

Let me compute the exponent.

Compute (hc)/(kλ) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Wait, let me recall the constants:

h = 6.626e-34 J s
c = 3e8 m/s
k = 1.38e-23 J/K
λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So hc is 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Divide by λ: (1.9878e-25) / (1448e-10) ) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.

Then divide by k: (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = approx 1e5 K.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 = approx 1.372 * 1e-18 = 1.372e-18 J.

Now, 1.372e-18 J divided by 1.38e-23 J/K is (1.372e-18) / (1.38e-23) ) = (1.372 / 1.38) * 1e5 ≈ 0.994 * 1e5 ≈ 99,400 K.

Wait, so (hc)/(kλ) ≈ 99,400 K.

Then, the exponent is dE/(k) * (1/5500 -1/6000) ) = (hc/(kλ)) * (1/5500 -1/6000 )

We already have hc/(kλ) ≈ 99,400 K.

So compute 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4
1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4
Difference: 0.1515e-4 = 1.515e-5.

Multiply by 99,400 K:
(99,400 K) * (1.515e-5) = 99,400 * 0.00001515.

Let me compute that:

99,400 * 0.00001515 = 99,400 * 1.515e-5.

Compute 99,400 * 1.515e-5:

Well, 1e5 * 1.515e-5 = 1.515. So 99,400 is approximately 0.994 *1e5.

So 0.994 * 1e5 * 1.515e-5 = 0.994 * 1.515 ≈ 1.506.

Wait, 0.994 * 1.515 = let's compute it.

1.515 * 1 = 1.515

1.515 * 0.994 = approx 1.515 - 1.515 *0.006 = 1.515 - 0.00909 = ~1.5059.

So the exponent is approximately 1.506.

So the factor is exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506.

We know that e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.6 is about 4.953. So 1.506 is just a bit less than 1.5. Let's compute e^1.506.

Alternatively, perhaps 1.506 is close to 1.5, so e^1.5 is ~4.48. Alternatively, let's compute it more precisely.

Compute 1.506:

We can use the approximation e^x = e^(a + b) = e^a * e^b, where a is 1.5 and b is 0.006.

e^1.5 ≈4.4817

e^0.006 ≈ 1 + 0.006 + (0.006)^2/2 ≈ 1.006018.

So e^1.506 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.006018 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.006 ≈ approx 4.4817 + (0.006 *4.4817) → 4.4817 + 0.0269 ≈ 4.5086.

So approximately 4.5.

Wait, but the exponent was positive, so the ratio R_unspotted / R_spotted = exp(1.506) ≈4.5.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure about the sign.

Wait, the exponent in R_unspotted/R_spotted is [ -dE/(k*6000) + dE/(k*5500) ] = dE/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ].

Which is positive, as 1/5500 is larger than 1/6000.

So the exponent is positive, so exp(positive) is greater than 1. So R_unspotted is higher than R_spotted by a factor of about 4.5.

So the factor is about 4.5, which is option C: ~4.5.

Wait, but wait the options are:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

So the correct factor is about 4.5, which is option C.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature, $T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K}$) to having spots ($T_{\text{eff}} = 5500 \, \text{K}$). The ratio of populations in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where $g_1$ and $g_2$ are the statistical weights, $E_2 - E_1$ is the energy difference between the levels, $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The ratio of the populations when the star has no spots to when it has spots is given by:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{unspotted}}}{R_{\text{spotted}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k \cdot 6000}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k \cdot 5500}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right)\right).
\]

The energy difference $E_2 - E_1$ is related to the wavelength of the transition ($\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}$) by:

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light. Substituting the constants:

\[
h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}, \quad c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}, \quad \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m},
\]

we calculate:

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Dividing by $k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}$ gives:

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,400 \, \text{K}.
\]

Next, compute the temperature term:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \cdot 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

The exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right) \approx 99,400 \cdot 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.506.
\]

Thus, the factor is:

\[
\exp(1.506) \approx 4.5.
\]

This means the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels increases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots.
