Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants are involved in determining the concentration of metal complexes in solution. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Let me read the problem again. We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, that seems a bit off because usually the stability constants increase as the number of ligands increases, but here β3 is higher than β2 but β4 is lower than β3. Hmm, maybe it's a typo or I've misunderstood the order. But I'll proceed as per the given values.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ complex, which would be the dithiocyanato complex, so that's the second complex, right? Or wait, maybe it's the third? Wait, no, the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^2+, the second is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the third is [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and the fourth is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? I'm a bit confused about the charges. Let me think. Each SCN- is -1, so for each Co^2+:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ : charge is 2+ + (-1) = +1. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+.
- [Co(SCN)_2]^0 : 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So β2 is for this neutral complex.
- [Co(SCN)_3]^- : 2+ +3*(-1) = -1. So β3 for this.
- [Co(SCN)_4]^2- : 2+ +4*(-1) = -2. So β4 for this.

So the blue complex is probably [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the second one. Because I remember from my
