Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, let me see. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with NaOH, which is a strong base, you get a buffer solution before the equivalence point and then a salt solution after that. 

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid and dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So that's a total volume of 40 cm³. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, 25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. But wait, the initial concentration is diluted. Let me think.

First, let's find the moles of acetic acid initially. Moles = concentration (M) × volume (L). So 0.05 M times 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) gives 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

When we dilute with 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). But that doesn't change the moles, right? So the concentration after dilution is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, let's figure out the equivalence point. The moles of NaOH needed to reach equivalence would be equal to the moles of acetic acid. So 0.001 moles of NaOH needed. Since each mole of NaOH provides one mole of OH-, that's the same as the moles of acetic acid.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, I think I should calculate the moles of NaOH added at 25% titration. So 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L. Moles of NaOH = 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

So, the moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) initially is 0.001 moles. After adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, which reacts with the acid:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- + Na+ + H2O.

So
