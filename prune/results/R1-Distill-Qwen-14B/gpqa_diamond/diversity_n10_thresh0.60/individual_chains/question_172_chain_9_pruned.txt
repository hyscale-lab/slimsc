Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, wait. Wait, I think the excitation here refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy state compared to a lower one. So if they're more excited, they have more atoms in a higher energy level. But wait, I'm a bit confused about what the exact setup is.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, that's probably the delta E between the two energy levels. And the question is about the effective temperatures of the stars, T1 and T2.

Since the photospheres are in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here. Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy levels in a system in equilibrium. The formula is something like the ratio of populations n_i/n_j equals exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature.

In this case, let's say for each star, the energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 higher than E1. Wait, but the question says the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. So delta E is E2 - E1 = 1
