Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two parts, each involving a reaction. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and a reagent B (which is water) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give possible A and B reagents, and I need to pick the right pair.

Alright, let's tackle the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide, a source of the cyanide ion. So, when a ketone reacts with CN-, what happens? I remember that in the presence of an acid catalyst, the cyanide ion can undergo a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. So, the reaction is probably a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the ketone.

But wait, what's the product? The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN, but in this case, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methyl... Oh, wait, butanenitrile would have four carbons, with the nitrile on the end. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. Wait, but in 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, the butanenitrile is four carbons, with a hydroxyl and a methyl on the second carbon.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When we add CN- in an acid condition, the mechanism is that the carbonyl oxygen is protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. The CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to an addition product. Then, the oxygen would have a negative charge, which would pick up a proton from the acid to become OH.

So, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see: butanenitrile is four carbons, with nitrile on C4. The hydroxy and methyl are on C2. So the structure would be CH2(C(OH)(CH3))CH2CN? Wait, maybe I should number the carbons. Let's think: the nitrile is on C1, then C2 has the hydroxyl and methyl. No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, so if it's 2-hydroxy-2-methyl, then the structure is CH2(C(OH)(CH3))CH2CN. Hmm, but wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which would add CN- to become (CH3
