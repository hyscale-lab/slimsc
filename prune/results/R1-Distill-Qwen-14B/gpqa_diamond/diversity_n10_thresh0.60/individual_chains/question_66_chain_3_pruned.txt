Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, which is SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these, labeled A to D.

Wait, first, what do I remember about SMEFT? SMEFT is this framework where you take the Standard Model and write down all possible higher-dimensional operators that could correct the SM. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, 7, etc. But the key is that these operators must respect the underlying symmetries of the Standard Model, right?

So the SM has certain symmetries. Which ones? Well, the Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry because all the particles we deal with are described by fields that transform under the Lorentz group. Lorentz symmetry is part of the Poincaré group, which includes translations and Lorentz transformations. Poincaré symmetry implies momentum conservation and so on.

Wait, but the question is about what the SMEFT operators must respect. So if the SM has these symmetries, then the SMEFT operators, which are built as corrections, should also respect them. But wait, the SMEFT allows for beyond SM physics, so does that mean the operators can violate some of the SM symmetries?

Wait no, wait. SMEFT is just an effective theory, so it's built by adding higher-dimension operators to the SM. These operators are constructed in a way that they don't break the fundamental symmetries of the SM. So for example, the SM has gauge symmetry, so the SMEFT operators must be gauge invariant. And they must also respect the same Lorentz symmetry, right?

So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must. Because the operators are built from SM fields, which transform under Lorentz, so the operators must be Lorentz scalars. So all operators respect Lorentz symmetry.

What about Poincaré symmetry (option 2)? Poincaré includes translations and Lorentz. So if the theory has Poincaré symmetry, then the operators must commute with the generators of Poincaré, meaning they should be invariant under Lorentz transformations and translations.

Wait, but wait—do the operators in SMEFT respect Poincaré symmetry? Because in SMEFT, the operators are local, right? They don't introduce new non-local terms. So I think SMEFT maintains Poincaré symmetry. So operators must respect Poincaré symmetry. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.

Wait, but I've read that the SMEFT Lagrangian is Poincaré invariant. Because it's a low-energy effective theory, which respects the same symmetries as the SM.

So that would mean that Poincaré symmetry (option 2) is also a symmetry that must be respected. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, what about the other options, CP and CPT symmetry?

CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation and parity. The Standard Model is almost CP symmetric, except for certain sectors like in the CKM matrix leading to CP violation in the electroweak sector. So the SMEFT operators can include operators that violate CP, right? Because the effective theory allows for adding terms that can lead to new sources of CP violation. So I don't think the SMEFT operators are required to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must.

But wait, the SM has some CP violation, so maybe the SMEFT operators are required not to introduce more? No, that's not right. The SMEFT can include operators that could potentially violate CP further. So the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not required.

CPT symmetry is a bigger symmetry, combining charge, parity, and time reversal. The SM is CPT symmetric because it's Lorentz invariant, and Lorentz symmetry plus quantum mechanics implies CPT symmetry. So all operators in the SM must respect CPT. What about SMEFT?

Well, since SMEFT is built on top of the SM, and the SM respects CPT, the SMEFT operators should also respect CPT. Because if they didn't, that would introduce some non-CPT-preserving terms, which is a big deal. So option 4 is correct.

Wait, but are all effective operators required to respect CPT? Because, for example, some models beyond SM might violate CPT, but SMEFT is just an effective theory of the SM. So probably, yes, SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry.

So to recap: which must be respected? Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2), because they are part of the framework. CPT (4) must be respected because the SM does, and SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. CP (3) is not necessarily.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So 1,2,4 must be respected; 3 is
