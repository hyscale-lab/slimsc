Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics; I need to use special relativity principles. 

Let me read the problem again. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, so both are moving in the same direction. So I'm supposed to find the relative speed of one with respect to the other and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

First, I think about the relative speed. In classical mechanics, you'd subtract the speeds if they're moving in the same direction. But relativistically, it's more complicated. I remember the formula for adding velocities in special relativity. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the formula for the relative speed when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - u')/(1 - (u u')/(c²)), where u is the speed of one object from the other's frame. Or wait, perhaps I should think in terms of frame transformations. Let me think: if I have two objects moving at u and u' in the same direction, what's their relative speed? Or more correctly, the speed of the second object from the frame of the first.

Wait, I
