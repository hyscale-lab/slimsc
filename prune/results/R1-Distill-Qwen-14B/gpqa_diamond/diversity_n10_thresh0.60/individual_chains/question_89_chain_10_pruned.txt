Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I know adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage-like molecule. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two opposite faces of the adamantane structure.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides are treated with bases, they often undergo elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation. But since it's 1,3-dibromo, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide? Wait, no. In adamantane, 1 and 3 positions are probably on adjacent carbons, but not necessarily next to each other. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the bromines are on adjacent carbons, but I'm not exactly sure about the structure.

Wait, when dibromides react with KOH, especially vicinal dihalides, they can eliminate to form alkenes via an E2 mechanism. But if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which would have two bromines on different carbons, perhaps it's a diepoxide or something else. Alternatively, KOH could cause elimination, forming a double bond. Because the product's NMR has an IR peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group. Wait, that's a strong peak, maybe an ester or ketone. But the IR is after product 1.

Wait, product 1: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes a substitution reaction. Since KOH is in excess, maybe it's an SN2 reaction. But adamantane is a very rigid structure, so each carbon is probably attached to two other carbons, making SN2 unlikely because the backside attack would be hindered. So elimination is more likely, forming an alkene.

Wait, but the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's an epoxide? No, wait, epoxides have different IR. Alternatively, if elimination occurs, maybe it's forming a diene? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters.

Wait, the product 1 is a light yellow solid. Light yellow solids can be things like alkenes, but more so, perhaps an epoxide. Wait, another possibility: when dihalides are treated with a strong base, an elimination can occur to form an epoxide. Oh, wait, no, epoxides are formed from alcohols, not dihalides. So what else?

Wait, maybe it's a double elimination. For example, in a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent carbons each with a bromine), treatment with KOH could eliminate both bromides, forming a double bond. But in this case, the compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which I'm not sure if those positions are adjacent. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH causes both bromides to leave, forming an allene or something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming an alky
