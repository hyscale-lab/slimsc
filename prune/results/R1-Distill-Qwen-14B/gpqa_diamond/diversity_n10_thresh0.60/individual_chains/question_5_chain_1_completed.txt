Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, right. So the operator P is a vector operator, meaning it's the sum of its components multiplied by the direction vector n, I think. Because any vector operator along a direction n would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Oh wait, but wait, the direction vector n is in the x-z plane. So y-component of n is zero? Or maybe not, but since n is arbitrary in x-z, perhaps n could have x and z components, but n_y is zero. Hmm.

Wait, the problem statement says that the direction n is in the x-z plane. So n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). So when I construct the operator P along n, it's P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Oh, because n_y is zero, so the P_y term drops out. Got it.

So the first step is to write down the components of the operator P. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down each component:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P is n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ, perhaps, if we consider θ as the angle from the z-axis. Wait, but in standard spherical coordinates, perhaps θ is the polar angle, so n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_z = cosθ. Wait, but since n is in the x-z plane, φ is zero or 180 degrees, because the y-component is zero. So perhaps we can parameterize n as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Wait, no, wait. If it's in x-z plane, then it's more straightforward to express n in terms of θ as the angle between n and the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ cosφ, but since it's in x-z, φ is 0, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ? Or wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up polar coordinates. Let me think again.

Wait, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the direction can be given by an angle θ from the z-axis. So the unit vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because if θ is 0, it's along z, and as θ increases, it moves towards x. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Hmm, I think that makes sense.

So the operator P along n is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Substituting the values:

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that. So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, wait. Let's do the matrix addition. The diagonal elements are from P_z: (1,0) and (0,-1) multiplied by cosθ, so the diagonal entries become cosθ and -cosθ. The off-diagonal terms are from P_x, which are (0,1) and (1,0) multiplied by sinθ. So the matrix becomes:

[ cosθ * (1) + 0, 0 * (1) + sinθ * (1) ]
[ 0 * (1) + sinθ * (1), -cosθ * (1) + 0 ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

P = (ħ/2) [ [ (1 * cosθ), (1 * sinθ) ],
            [ (1 * sinθ), (-1 * cosθ) ] ]

Wait, no. Let me compute each term:

n_x P_x is (ħ/2) * sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]]

n_z P_z is (ħ/2) * cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Adding them together:

n_x P_x + n_z P_z = (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So the matrix for P is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

Which means:

(P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0,

where I is the identity matrix.

So substituting P:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] - (ħ/2) I = 0

Factor out (ħ/2):

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ - 1, sinθ],
          [sinθ, -cosθ - 1] ] 

So the matrix equation becomes:

[ (cosθ - 1)  sinθ       ] [a]   = 0
[ sinθ      (-cosθ - 1) ] [b]

Wait, no, because the eigenvector is a column vector (a, b)^T. So:

[ (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b ] = 0
[ sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b ] = 0

So we have two equations:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a + (-cosθ - 1) b = 0

Hmm, but these are two equations; perhaps they are linearly dependent. Let me check for consistency.

Looking for non-trivial solutions, so the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

The determinant is:

| (cosθ -1)   sinθ     |
| sinθ        (-cosθ -1)|

Which is (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ)

Let me compute that:

= (-cosθ (cosθ -1) -1 (cosθ -1)) ) - sin²θ

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute as follows:

= (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - sin^2θ

Multiply out the first term:

= (-cos²θ -cosθ + cosθ + 1) ) - sin²θ
= (-cos²θ + 1) - sin²θ

But wait, (-cos²θ +1) is (1 - cos²θ) which is sin²θ.

So the determinant becomes sin²θ - sin²θ = 0. So the determinant is zero, which is expected because we're looking for eigenvalues.

Thus, the two equations are dependent, and we can take one equation to find the ratio of a and b.

Take the first equation: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0.

Let me solve for b in terms of a.

sinθ b = (1 - cosθ) a → b = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] a

But (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)} ] = [sin(θ/2)] / [cos(θ/2)] = tan(θ/2)

So b = tan(θ/2) a.

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as (a, b) = a (1, tan(θ/2))

We can represent this as a vector proportional to (1, tanθ/2). To normalize it, we compute the normalization factor.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Wait, but since a and b are complex numbers in quantum mechanics, but wait, in this case, I think the components are real or complex? Let me think.

Wait, the eigenvector could be complex, but since we're in the x-z plane, perhaps the angle θ is real, but the components might be real or may involve complex numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector is real. Hmm, but perhaps we can proceed with real numbers unless the operator introduces complex terms.

Wait, no. Let me think about the matrix P we have. The operator P is Hermitian because each component P_x, P_y, P_z are Hermitian. Because, for example, P_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], which is Hermitian. Similarly, P_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is also Hermitian. P_z is diagonal and real, so Hermitian. Thus, the operator P is Hermitian, so its eigenvectors can be taken as real, or perhaps have complex entries depending on θ.

Wait, but let's see: in our case, the matrix P is real, so the eigenvectors can be real or come in complex conjugate pairs.

Wait, but since the eigenvalue is real, so the eigenvectors can be real. So perhaps a and b are real.

Wait, but in our earlier steps, b = tan(theta/2) a. So the eigenvector is (a, a tan(theta/2)).

To normalize, a^2 (1 + tan^2(theta/2)) ) = 1.

So a^2 (sec^2(theta/2)) ) = 1 → a = cos(theta/2).

Because sec(theta/2) = 1/cos(theta/2), so 1 + tan^2(theta/2) = sec^2(theta/2).

So a = cos(theta/2), and b = sin(theta/2), because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so b = a tan(theta/2) = cos(theta/2) * [sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2)] = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but wait, are these the elements of the eigenvector? So the vector would be [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, another thought: the operator P is given in terms of x, y, z components. But wait, when we have an operator along an arbitrary direction, does the eigenvector depend on the direction? Because in the problem, the direction is arbitrary in x-z. So perhaps the eigenvector should involve angles from that direction.

Wait, but in this case, the operator is along n, which is in the x-z plane, so the eigenvectors (eigenstates) would have their spin aligned along n. So in the case of a spin-1/2 system (since the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2), the eigenvectors are spin-up and spin-down along the direction n.

But in our case, after all the calculation, the normalized eigenvector comes out as [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, where theta is the angle from the z-axis. Hmm, but wait, I think that's correct.

Wait, but another angle to consider: because the operator is along n, the state would be expressed in terms of the angles relative to n. Let me think about the standard spin states.

For example, when the direction is along z (theta=0), the eigenvector for +ħ/2 is [1, 0]^T, which matches cos(0/2) = 1, sin(0/2)=0.

Similarly, when theta=90 degrees (pi/2 radians), the direction is along x, and the eigenvector for +ħ/2 is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]^T, which would correspond to cos(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, but wait, no, wait. Wait, cos(theta/2) when theta=pi/2 would be cos(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, and sin(theta/2) would be sin(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2. So the vector is (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2), which is correct for the +x direction.

Wait, but when the direction is along x (n=(1,0,0)), the eigenvector for +ħ/2 is (1,1)/sqrt(2), which matches (cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4)).

So that seems correct.

So the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, where theta is the angle from the z-axis.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, the question says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector may involve angles relative to that direction. However, our calculation used theta as the angle from the z-axis, so perhaps the options are using spherical angles with theta being the polar angle.

Wait, in any case, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is what we derived.

Looking at the other options:

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) — looks like a standard spherical coordinate representation but perhaps involves more variables, and in our case, phi is zero because n is in x-z plane. So option B could be a possibility if the angle parameterization is different.

Option D: has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, along with cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So perhaps this is a different scenario, maybe when the direction is arbitrary in 3D, not just x-z.

Wait, but in our case, n is constrained to the x-z plane, so phi is zero. So the eigenvector might be expressed in terms of theta only.

Wait, but let me think again: in our calculation, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], but theta here is the angle from the z-axis, so for an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, the state is determined by theta, and the state is as above.

So the correct normalized eigenvector elements are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

Wait, but wait another thing: the problem says the eigenvector should be along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So perhaps the angle is given in terms of the direction of n, which is in the x-z plane. So using theta as the angle from the z-axis is correct, making the state as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each given as a $2 \times 2$ matrix multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is then expressed as:

\[
P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]

Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the resulting matrix for $P$ is:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we solve the eigenvalue equation:

\[
P |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\left( P - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0,
\]

where $I$ is the identity matrix. Substituting $P$ and performing the subtraction, the matrix equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0,
\]

where $(a, b)^T$ is the eigenvector. Factoring out $\hbar/2$, we solve the system:

\[
\begin{cases}
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \\
\sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0.
\end{cases}
\]

The two equations are linearly dependent, so we solve the first equation for $b$ in terms of $a$:

\[
b = \frac{(1 - \cos\theta)}{\sin\theta} a.
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$ and $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$, we find:

\[
b = \tan(\theta/2) a.
\]

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = a \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we impose the condition $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$. Substituting $b = \tan(\theta/2) a$, we find:

\[
a^2 \left( 1 + \tan^2(\theta/2) \right) = 1.
\]

Since $1 + \tan^2(\theta/2) = \sec^2(\theta/2)$, we have:

\[
a = \cos(\theta/2), \quad b = \sin(\theta/2).
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Finally, comparing this result with the options provided:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it introduces $\hbar$ into the components, which is not consistent with the normalized eigenvector.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it involves $\cos(\theta)$ and $\sin(\theta)$, which do not match the derived components.
- **Option C**: Correct, as it matches the derived normalized eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it introduces additional scaling factors ($\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$) that are not present in the normalized eigenvector.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
