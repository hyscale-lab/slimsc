Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the wobble of the star due to the planet's gravity. The star moves back and forth, which causes a Doppler shift in its spectral lines.

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have planets detected via RV. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So, they're probably in the same mass range. The RV method measures the Doppler shift, and in this case, Planet #1's star has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's is 7.

Wait, what determines the Doppler shift in this method? I think the shift depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star. Oh right, the formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * something with the period and the distance. Or maybe I should think about the relationship between orbital period and velocity.

Wait, another approach: The Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 + (M_p/M_star)) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / ( ( (2π)/P )^(1/3) )) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, the formula for K is approximately:

K = ( ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / ( ( (1 + (M_p/M_star))^(1/3) ) )) * ( (1) / ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the exact formula. Let me think more about the basic relationships. 

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1
