Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit tricky. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. We're given the stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants are involved in complexation equilibria. The higher the stability constant, the more stable the complex is. So each βn corresponds to a complex with n SCN- ligands.

Wait, the complexes must be Co(SCN)_n^2+ where n is 1,2,3,4. And the stability constant βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of each complex.

So the formation reactions would be like:

Co²+ + n SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_n²+ ; K = βn.

So for each n from 1 to 4, there's a complex. The question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the one with two SCN- ions. So that's Co(SCN)₂²+.

I need to find the fraction of Co²+ that's in the form of Co(SCN)₂²+ relative to all possible Co species. To find this, I probably need to calculate the concentrations of each complex and the free Co²+ ion, then sum them all up and find the ratio.

Wait, but calculating all of them might be complicated because each β is different. I think I can model this using the formation of each complex step by step.

Alternatively, I remember that when multiple complexes can form, the fraction of each is determined by the β values and the concentration of the ligand. So the relative amounts depend on the product of β and the ligand concentrations raised to the power of the number of ligands.

Wait, the general approach for this kind of problem is to find the distribution of each species using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal ion.

But I'm a bit confused about the exact method. Let me think. The fraction f_n of each complex is given by:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^-n ) / (1 + sum_{k=1}^4 β_k [SCN]^-k )

Wait, but wait. The total concentration of Co is the sum of all the species: [Co²+] + [CoSCN²+] + [Co(SCN)₂²+] + [Co(SCN)3²+] + [Co(SCN)4²+].

But wait, the total cobalt concentration is given as 1e-2 M. So, the sum of all these species equals 1e-2 M.

Alternatively, the fraction of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n²+] / (sum over all [Co species]).

But I think the approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex using the β values and the [SCN^-] concentration.

So each species' concentration is [Co²+] multiplied by β_n [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, let me get the formula right. The general formula is that the concentration of each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n²+] = β_n [SCN^-]^n [Co²+] 

But wait, [Co²+] is the free ion concentration, which is present in all these expressions. So the total cobalt concentration is:

[Co_total] = [Co²+] + sum_{n=1}^4 [Co(SCN)_n²+] 

= [Co²+] + sum_{n=1}^4 β_n [SCN^-]^n [Co²+] 

= [Co²+] (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 β_n [SCN^-]^n )

So [Co²+] = [Co_total] / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 β_n [SCN^-]^n )

Once [Co²+] is known, each [Co(SCN)_n²+] can be calculated as β_n [SCN^-]^n [Co²+].

So the fraction of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n²+] / [Co_total].

So the plan is:

1. Compute the sum S = 1 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

2. [Co²+] = c_total / S.

3. Then, for each n, calculate the fraction f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n ) / S.

Wait, because:

[Co(SC
