Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully and think through each part step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question is about a star with certain properties and how the presence of spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, right, I remember from my notes that when stars have spots, their overall luminosity changes, but this question is more about the photospheric temperature and its effect on the ionization states of elements in the star's atmosphere.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait, I think I need to clarify: when spots are present, the star's overall effective temperature decreases because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the star's average Teff goes down.

The question focuses on the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where n is the number of particles in each level, g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio is n1/n2. Because the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the photospheric temperature is lower (5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower or higher? Let's think.

Wait, the problem states that the ratio observed (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So without spots,
