Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through this carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI (hydroiodic acid) cleavage reaction, which usually targets double bonds. So, red phosphorus and HI are used to cleave alkenes. This reaction usually breaks the double bond and replaces it with -HI. Wait, no, actually, I think the reaction is called the hydroboration followed by oxidation, but wait, no, wait. Wait, red phosphorus and HI is used for the cleavage of alkenes in the form of the oxymercuration or maybe it's a different reaction. Hmm, no, waitâ€”I think that when an alkene is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it leads to the cleavage of the double bond and the formation of diols or something else. Or wait, maybe it's a hydrohalogenation reaction? Or perhaps it's the acid-catalyzed addition of HI to alkenes, leading to the formation of vicinal diiodides. Hmm, I might need to think more about that.

Wait, no, another thought: when alkenes react with HI, it's typically an acid-catalyzed addition. But in the presence of red phosphorus, I think it's a different scenario. Oh, right! Red phosphorus and HI are used for the cleavage of alkenes in a reaction known as the "dehydrohalogen
