Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune. So both planets have similar masses. The RV method detects these planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's orbit.

The data given is the periodic shift in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking about the ratio of the orbital periods—specifically, how much longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's.

I remember that the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the planet's orbit. The formula I think is something like V = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the velocity semi-amplitude. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/ ( ... wait, no, I think a more correct formula is:

K = (v) = ( (2πG) / (P c ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) )

But since the planet masses are much smaller than the star's, M_p << M_star, so 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1. So we can simplify that term.

So K ≈ ( (2πG) / (P c ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But wait, maybe it's easier to consider the relation between velocity shift and orbital period. Because the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period P, given that the star's mass and the planet's mass are the same.

Wait, because if you have two planets around stars of the same mass, K is proportional to (M
