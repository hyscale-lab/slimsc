Okay, let's tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, so we're dealing with luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The question gives us some parameters and asks about the factor by which Star_1 is more luminous than Star_2.

First, let me list out what's given. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2, so M1 = 1.5 M2. But wait, the question is about luminosity, which I don't think directly depends on mass. Luminosity of a star as a black body is related to its radius and temperature, right? Oh, right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So I think the mass might not come into play here, unless it's somehow influencing the temperature.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ1_max = λ2_max => T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but how
