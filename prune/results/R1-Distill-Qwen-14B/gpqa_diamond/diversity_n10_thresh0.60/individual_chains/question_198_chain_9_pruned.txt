Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The concentrations given are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Hmm. So first, I'm trying to remember what stability constants are. Stability constants, or formation constants, measure the tendency of a complex to form. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

Wait, wait, the problem says the 'dithiocyanato' complex. So I think that's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is the blue one. So I'm looking for the fraction of Co in the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ form.

But wait, are the complexes ordered by the number of SCN- attached? Like, the complexes would be [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, [Co(SCN)3]^3+, and [Co(SCN)4]^4+. Right, because each SCN- is a -1 charge, so for each additional SCN, the charge increases by one.

So the stability constants β1 through β4 correspond to the complexes with 1 to 4 SCN- ligands. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, β3 is [Co(SCN)3]^3+, and β4 is [Co(SCN)4]^4+.

But wait, the problem is giving four β values: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that seems a bit odd because β3 is higher than β2, but β4 is lower. I must have gotten that right because β3 is the largest, meaning the [Co(SCN)3]^3+ is the most stable.

But wait, I'm not sure if
