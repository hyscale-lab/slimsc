Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of stellar atmospheres and stuff. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changing when a star has spots. Hmm. I remember that when stars have dark spots, it affects their overall temperature and maybe the line emissions.

So, here's the given info:

- The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here, but maybe it's about the star's structure or luminosity?
- When the surface isn't covered by spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, effective temperature is tricky. Because spots are cooler, does that mean the star's total output changes? But the problem is about the photospheric effective temperature. Oh wait, the problem says when the spots are present, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500K. So the entire photosphere's effective temperature is lower when spots are present? Or is it that 40% of the surface is cooler, but the overall is a mix?

Wait, no. I think the effective temperature is an average. So when 40% of the surface is covered by cooler spots, the overall Teff drops. But wait, the way effective temperature works is that it's a measure that accounts for the total luminosity. But the problem states that when spots are present, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the star is being treated as if it's uniformly at 5500 K when spots are present. But I'm not entirely sure, but I think the problem is simplifying it that way.

The main point is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Alright, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g's
