Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. And X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number Z of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope must be Li-6 because Li typically has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 6.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check. Lithium has Z=3. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, the isotope is Li-6. So the nucleus is ^6Li. Got it.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96 times the speed of light, which is pretty fast. So we're probably dealing with relativistic effects here. I remember that when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, you need to use the Lorentz factor, gamma, to calculate energies.

The formula for the total energy of a particle is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

But wait, the problem is giving the speed, so we can calculate gamma first. Let me compute that. V is 0.96
