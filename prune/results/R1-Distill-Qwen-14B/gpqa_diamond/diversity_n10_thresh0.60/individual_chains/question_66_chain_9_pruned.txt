Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that generalizes the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. But wait, what about the symmetries?

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetry? I think Lorentz symmetry includes rotations and boosts, while Poincare symmetry also includes translations. So Poincare is a bigger symmetry that includes Lorentz plus translations. But in field theory, the Poincare group is the symmetry for the S-matrix, involving translations (momentum conservation) and Lorentz transformations.

In SMEFT, the operators are constructed as Lorentz-invariant operators. So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, right? Because otherwise, the theory wouldn't be consistent. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must.

Poincare symmetry (2): Well, the Standard Model itself respects Poincare symmetry. SMEFT operators are built from SM fields, so they should also respect Poincare. But wait, because SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, maybe some symmetries are explicitly broken by the operators. No, wait, effective theories still maintain the same symmetries as the original theory, except when the operators explicitly break them. But in SMEFT, the higher-dimension operators are constructed in a way that they don't break Lorentz or gauge symmet
