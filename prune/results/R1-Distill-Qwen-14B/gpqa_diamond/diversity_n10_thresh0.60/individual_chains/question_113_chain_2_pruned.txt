Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. The options are four different chemical formulas, all involving carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.

First, I'll read through the question again to make sure I don't miss any details. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have very strong and broad O-H stretches, often around 3000 too. Oh, but sometimes alcohols also show up there. Hmm.

Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe even carboxylic acids. The 1650 peak is a bit lower; that might be a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring with something attached. Wait, or maybe it's an amide? No, the options don't have nitrogen. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester? Or it could be a C=O stretch in something like a conjugated ester where the carbonyl is at a lower wavenumber.

Looking at the 1H NMR, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound probably has an alkene group. That makes sense with the 1650 cm^-1 peak perhaps being a conjugated double bond.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I need to think about what fragments would give a mass of 45. Common fragments at m/z 45 include the methyl group (15) plus some other parts, but wait, 45 is a bit higher. Wait, 45 is the molecular ion for something like (CH3)2O (which is 45, but that's dimethyl ether). Or maybe a fragment with a carbonyl group. Oh, another possibility is the CH2=CH-O- group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the fragment could
