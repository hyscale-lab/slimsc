Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Alright, let's start with the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's a very broad peak, maybe it's a strong hydrogen bond, which could be in a carboxylic acid. But another possibility is an alcohol, but the broadness might suggest something more acidic. Hmm.

Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is often a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Alternatively, an amide or maybe an ester could have a peak around there. Wait, in esters, the carbonyl is usually around 1740-1700. So 1700 might be an ester or a ketone. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ring with substituents or maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but I don't see any options with nitrogen here. So maybe it's something else.

Next, the NMR part says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound likely has double bonds, maybe conjugated with something else. Like in an ester perhaps? Or an aromatic ring with substituents.

Looking at the mass spec data, there's a fragment peak at m/z=45. Wait, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think, 45 is CH3CO (since 12+32=44? Wait, no. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight. 45 is C2H5O (45 is 12*2 + 5*1 + 16*1 =
