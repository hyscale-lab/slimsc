Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is also moving in the same direction as the beam, which I think means the same as the glass's movement. Because the beam is propagating through the glass that's moving towards the observer. Oh wait, no, the question says the glass is moving toward the observer, but the beam is in the same direction as the glass's movement. So the light is moving towards the observer as well, right?

Wait, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So if the glass is moving towards the observer, then the beam would be moving towards the observer. Hmm, maybe I should draw a diagram mentally. Imagine the lab frame where the glass is moving to the left (towards the observer who is, say, on the right). So the light beam is going to the left, same as the glass's velocity.

Wait, no, the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving towards them. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving, say, to the left. The light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's movement. So the light is moving to the left relative to the glass, but the glass
