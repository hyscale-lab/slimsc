Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let me start by understanding the details provided.

The question gives me five stars, each with their own characteristics: RA, DEC, magnitude, distance, and sometimes extinction (E(B-V)). The key point is that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V mag 17, while HIRES can go down to V mag 16. So any star that is brighter than 17 (so 16 or better) can be seen by ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 (so 15 or better) for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO, meaning that they can observe stars with V mag ≤17. Because if a star is brighter than 17, that's lower magnitude numbers, which are brighter. So the limiting magnitude is 17 for ESPRESSO and 16 for HIRES. So a star must have apparent V magnitude ≤17 to be observed by ESPRESSO, and ≤16 for HIRES.

Wait, but wait, no—apparent magnitude works such that lower numbers are brighter. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than V mag 17, that means it can see stars with V mag up to 17. So any star with V mag less than or equal to 17 would be observable by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so up to 16 mag apparent V.

Wait, no. Let me clarify this. Suppose a star is magnitude 15. That's brighter than 16, so HIRES can see it. ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so 15 is also visible. But a star with 17 mag would be too faint for HIRES, but visible to ESPRESSO. So for a star to be seen by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because that's the stricter condition.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The question says, "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, "brighter than 17" would mean m < 17, since
