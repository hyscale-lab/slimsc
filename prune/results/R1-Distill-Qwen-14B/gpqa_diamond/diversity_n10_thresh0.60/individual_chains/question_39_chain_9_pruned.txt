Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in a wave function. Let's see...

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but when I think about wave functions in quantum mechanics, they usually have to satisfy certain conditions, like being normalizable. Oh right! The total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

But wait, the question says that when measuring the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function is zero outside this region, right? Or maybe it's non-zero only between 1 and 3. Hmm, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That doesn't look like it's zero outside a certain range. Oh wait, maybe the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3. Because the measurements found none elsewhere. So in reality, the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise. So the given expression is probably valid only in that interval.

So for normalization, we need to integrate the absolute square of the wave function from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1.

The wave function is Ïˆ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let's compute
