Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, the question is about the momentum of a photon that's absorbed to switch the molecule to the next lowest energy state. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. So, it's not the rigid rotor approximation. Wait, right, the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, which probably means we need to consider both rotational and vibrational energy states.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state. So, the next state with the lowest energy would be either the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. But wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels combine both rotation and vibration.

Wait, no. The question is about when a photon is absorbed, so the molecule transitions to the next state with the "lowest possible energy." That probably means the next higher energy state, the first excited state. But wait, the next state would depend on whether it's a vibrational or rotational transition. Because in a rigid rotor, vibrational transitions require higher energy than rotational ones, but I'm not sure about the non-rigid case.

Wait, but maybe the non-rigid rotor model actually refers to the vibration. So, perhaps the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. Oh, right, the energy levels for a diatomic molecule in the non-rigid rotor model (also called the rotational-vibrational model) include both the rotational and vibrational energies.

So, the energy levels would be given by E(R) = B * J(J+1) + (1/2) * k * R^2, where B is the rotational constant, R is the bond length, and k is the force constant. Or wait, another approach: the energy of the molecule is the sum of its rotational and vibrational energies. But how does that affect the transition when a photon is absorbed?

Wait, the question says it's in the fundamental state. The fundamental vibrational state is the lowest vibrational state, which is n=0. But for rotation, the ground state is J=0. So, the fundamental state would be (v=0, J=0). When a photon is absorbed, it can either excite the vibration or rotation.

But to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, that would be the next higher energy state.
