Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem gives me some parameters about their radii, masses, and velocities. The main point is about their luminosities. The question is asking by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Let me list out what I know:

1. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 * R2.
2. Star_1's mass is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. So, M1 = 1.5 * M2.
3. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if their λ_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max same, T same.
4. Radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Hmm, radial velocity might affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift, but wait, the question says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, the question states that the observed wavelengths are the same, which might be due to Doppler shift. So Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, possibly causing a shift in its emitted peak wavelength.

Wait, the problem says that the astronomers found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, their observed λ_max are same. But their intrinsic temperatures might be different because of the Doppler effect.

Wait, I might be complicating things. Let me think again. The peak wavelength they observe is the same. So, the observed λ_max for both is same. But their actual emitted λ_max depends on their temperatures. So, if Star_2 is moving, its emitted wavelength would have shifted.

So, using Doppler shift, the observed wavelength λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) or something like that. Wait, actually, the Doppler formula depends on whether the source is moving towards or away. I think the formula
