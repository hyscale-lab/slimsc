Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see what I remember. The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term and asks about the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X. The mass of X is 6 GeV.

The Lagrangian provided is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think this is a Yukawa coupling kind of term. Because Yukawa interactions usually have a fermion field, a boson field, and a coupling term. So the term looks like λ f (something) ψ̄ ψ, so the interaction is between the boson X and the fermion ψ_f. 

Wait, the structure is -λ f ψ̄ (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the boson X couples to the fermion ψ_f. So the interaction vertex would involve X boson, a fermion, and another fermion (since it's ψ̄ and ψ). So the process for decay would be X decaying into two fermions. Because the vertex is X ψ ψ̄.

Now, the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. To find the possible decay products, I need to look at all possible fermion-antifermion pairs whose combined mass is less than 6 GeV. Because for a decay to be kinematically allowed, the rest mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle.

So let's list all the possible fermion pairs. Fermions include quarks and leptons. Let's think about each type.

First, quarks. The up, down, strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks. Their masses:

- Up and down: around a few MeV, negligible compared to GeV.
- Strange: about 100 MeV.
- Charm: about 1.5 GeV.
- Bottom: about 4.5 GeV.
- Top: way too heavy, about 173 GeV.

So for X (6 GeV), the decay products' rest mass must be less than 6 GeV. So any quark pair where each has mass less than 3 GeV. Because the sum has to be less than 6 GeV.

Wait no, actually, the sum of the masses needs to be less than X's mass. Because when X decays into a fermion-antifermion pair, the minimum mass needed is twice the mass of one fermion (because each has mass m, so 2m), but for massless fermions, the threshold is just the sum of the two masses, but since they are a pair, each has the same mass. So for fermions with mass m, the minimum X mass is 2m. But in reality, the threshold is when the X mass is just enough to produce the pair. So for each fermion, if 2m_fermion ≤ m_X, then the decay is allowed.

Wait, let me clarify. The rest mass energy of the decay products must be less than or equal to the
