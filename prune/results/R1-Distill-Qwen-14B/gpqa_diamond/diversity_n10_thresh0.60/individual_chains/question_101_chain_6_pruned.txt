Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to determine the reagent A and the catalyst B from the options given.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I should probably draw the structures to visualize what's happening.

3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. The structure is pyrrolidine with a methyl group on the third carbon. So, it's a secondary amine. When it reacts with compound A under acidic conditions, the product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine.

Wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl... That sounds like a cyclohexane ring with a double bond. Oh wait, more specifically, cyclohexylidene would be a cyclohexene ring with a substituent. So, maybe it's a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group (-CH2-) or something similar.

Wait, no, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So, the substituent on the pyrrolidine is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. Let's think about what that structure would look like.

Cyclohexylidenemethyl probably refers to a cyclohexene ring where one of the carbons is a double bond, and a methyl group is attached. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, cyclohexylidene might indicate a substituent with a double bond. For example, perhaps a cyclohexyl group with a double bond to the attached carbon. So, perhaps a cyclohexene ring where one of the carbons is connected via a double bond to a methyl group which is attached to the pyrrolidine.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group (like a CH2 group) but with a double bond within the cyclohexane ring. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think of the product structure.

The product is 1-(cyclohexyliden
