Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, when a star is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation levels of atoms depend on the temperature. 

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh wait, I think this relates to the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution describes the population of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like N_i / N_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), right?

In this case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote the energy levels as E1 and E2. Wait, but in the question, it's the energy difference between the considered levels. So ΔE = E_upper - E_lower. The problem states that the excitation (population) in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, N1 is twice as much as N2 for the same energy level? Or wait, maybe more accurately, the ratio N_upper / N_lower is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, let me think. Let's say the two energy levels are E_high and E_low. The ratio of populations is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for each star, the ratio is N_high / N_low = (g_high / g_low) * exp( -ΔE
