Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds to Ca²+ ions. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The temperature is 25°C, and pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that complicating things.

Wait, I remember that the formation constant (Kf) for a complex ion like Ca-EDTA describes how much the metal and ligand bind together. The formula is usually something like Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh wait, but sometimes EDTA has different forms depending on the pH. But the problem says the pH is ideal, so I guess EDTA is in its predominant form, probably Y^4-.

So the complex is CaY²- because Ca²+ combines with EDTA^4- (Y^4-) to form CaY²-. The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration of CaY²- as 0.02 M.

In solution, the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. But since Kf is really large (5e10), the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would be really low.

Let me set up the equilibrium. The formation reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-

The Kf is [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, in a solution where the complex is already formed, the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA would be very low. Alternatively, if the solution is made by dissolving Ca-EDTA salt, then the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex.

Assuming that the complex dissociates a little, let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. So, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x (since each mole of complex releases one mole each of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-). The complex concentration would then be approximately 0.02 - x, but since Kf is so large, x is going to be really small compared to 0.02. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So plugging into the Kf expression:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) 

=> 5e10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e
