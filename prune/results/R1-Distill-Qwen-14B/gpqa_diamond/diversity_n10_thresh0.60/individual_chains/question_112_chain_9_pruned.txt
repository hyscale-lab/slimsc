Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So first, I guess I need to normalize this state because the question mentions it's proportional, not necessarily normalized. Right, the normalization process involves finding the magnitude squared of each component and adding them together.

So, the state is |alpha> = a*(1+i)|up> + a*(2-i)|down>, where a is a normalization constant. Wait, no, wait. The problem says it's proportional, so maybe we can just calculate the normalization factor as 1 divided by the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

Let's compute the coefficients' magnitudes. The first coefficient is (1+i). The magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. The second coefficient is (2 - i). Its magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5. So the sum is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state becomes:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have gotten the normalization wrong. Let me double-check. The original state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). The normalization factor is 1/sqrt( |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 ). |1+i|² is (1^2 +1^2) =2, and |2 -i|² is (4 +1) =5. So yes, 2+5=7; sqrt(7) is the denominator. So the normalized state is:

(1+i)|up> / sqrt(7) + (2 -i)|down> / sqrt(7).

Wait, no, wait. No, the state is proportional, so the actual state is [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] multiplied by a normalization constant. So that constant is 1/sqrt(7), as calculated
