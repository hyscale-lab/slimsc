Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. All of them have negligible mass. Twelve of these are constrained to stay 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with charges and energy, we're probably looking at electric potential energy. Because in an isolated system, the energy is related to the arrangement of charges. Since all the particles are identical and have the same charge, they're either all positive or all negative. But since the question is about energy, the sign might not matter as much as the magnitude, but I'll keep that in mind.

So, the setup: 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th charge is at the center, and the other 12 are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m around P.

Wait, but since all the 12 charges are at the same distance from P, their configuration is symmetric. So perhaps they form a regular dodecahedron or something, but maybe for the purpose of calculating potential energy, the exact spatial arrangement doesn't matter because we can use the formula for potential energy in terms of pairs.

I think the potential energy of a system of point charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. The formula I remember is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * Σ (q_i q_j / r_ij). Since all the charges are identical, this should simplify the calculation.

Let me think about the charges. Each charge is 2e. So q_i = 2e for each particle. There are 13 particles, but the 13th is fixed at point P. So the 12 charges are each at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. So the distance between the 13th charge (say, q13) and each of the 12 charges (q1 to q12) is 2 meters.

Wait, but the 12 charges are constrained at 2 m, but are they all at the same point? That can't be, because then they'd all be at the same location, which would complicate things. Oh, but maybe they are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m, so each is 2 meters from P. But for the purposes of potential energy, perhaps it's sufficient to consider the distance between each charge and every other.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the potential energy of the system will involve interactions between this fixed charge and the 12 others, as well as the interactions among the 12 themselves.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum energy. So I need to find the configuration where the potential energy is minimized. Or wait, actually, in this case, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, so their positions are fixed relative to P. So their arrangement among themselves (like how they are placed on the sphere) might affect the potential energy. But maybe the problem is
