Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. Oh right, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So in that case, you set (1/2)kA² equal to (1/2)mv². Solving for v gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's the non-relativistic case, right?

But here, it's relativistic, so we have to consider how special relativity affects things. I remember that in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but wait, in this case, the oscillator's potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So maybe the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic, but using the relativistic formula.

Wait, but the potential energy in a spring is (1/2)kx². So the maximum potential energy would be (1/2)kA². So in the relativistic scenario, this potential energy would be converted into relativistic kinetic energy. So setting them equal:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1)mc².

Hmm, but solving for gamma might be a bit tricky. Let me write that down. So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Because (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) m c² → gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (kA²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, alpha. So,

gamma = 1 + alpha.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + alpha)^2.

Then
