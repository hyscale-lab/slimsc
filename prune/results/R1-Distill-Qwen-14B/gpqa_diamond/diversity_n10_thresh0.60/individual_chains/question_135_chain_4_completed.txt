Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Let me see... The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term and the mass of the boson X, which is 6 GeV. I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Hmm, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse this correctly. Oh, wait, perhaps the interaction term is something like L = λ f ψ_f (y) ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)). Or maybe it's a Yukawa-like coupling.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure. The term looks like λ multiplied by some fermion fields. Oh, perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling where the boson X couples to fermions. So, the interaction term would be something like λ X ψ ψ, where ψ is a fermion field.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, for X to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, the rest mass of the fermions must be less than half of X's mass, because each fermion would take at least half the mass (since they're produced in pairs).

So, the maximum possible mass for each fermion would be (6 GeV)/2 = 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be a decay product.

Wait, but wait, fermions come in different types with different masses. Let me think of the known fermions and their masses.

The known elementary fermions are quarks and leptons. Quarks come in up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Leptons are electrons, muons, taus, and their neutrinos.

But wait, top quark is way too heavy. Its mass is about 173 GeV, which is way above 3 GeV. So top can't be produced. So possible quarks are up, down, strange, charm, and maybe bottom? Let me check their masses.

Wait, the up quark is about 2 MeV, down about 4 MeV, strange maybe around 100 MeV, charm about 1.5 GeV, bottom about 4.5 GeV. Oh wait, wait! Wait, the bottom quark has a mass around 4.7 GeV. So wait, X is 6 GeV. Each b quark is 4.7 GeV, so 2 * 4.7 = 9.4 GeV. That's more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar because the rest mass needed is 9.4 GeV, which is higher than 6 GeV. So b quarks can't be decay products. Hmm, that's interesting.

Wait, so let me get this straight. The mass of X is 6 GeV. For a decay X → f f-bar, the threshold condition is 2m_f ≤ m_X. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So any fermion lighter than or equal to 3 GeV can be a decay product.

So looking at the fermions:

Leptons: electron (0.511 MeV), muon (105.7 MeV), tau (1.78 GeV). So tau is about 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

Electron and muon are even lighter, so those would be allowed as well.

Quarks: up (2 MeV), down (4-5 MeV), strange (around 100 MeV, but some sources say up to 200 MeV?), charm (1.5 GeV), bottom (4.7 GeV). So charm quarks have m around 1.5 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So X can decay into c c-bar.

Wait, but wait, strange quark's mass: I think the strange quark is around 100 MeV, so yes, less than 3 GeV. So X can decay into s s-bar.

Similarly, up quark (u) and down quark (d) are way below 3 GeV, so their pairs are allowed.

But wait, earlier I thought the bottom quark is 4.7 GeV, which is above 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar. So any decay channel involving bottom quarks is not allowed.

So the possible decay channels are:

c c-bar (1.5 GeV each), s s-bar (say 100 MeV each), u u-bar (2 MeV each), d d-bar (5 MeV each), tau+ tau- (1.78 GeV each), and the leptons e+ e- (0.5 MeV each), mu+ mu- (105 MeV each).

Wait, but in the options, some include b b-bar, others don't.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u, d d, tau, e+ e-.

Wait, but if the mass of b is 4.7 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV, then b can't be a decay product. So option A includes b b-bar, which is kinematically forbidden. So A is incorrect.

Option B: c c-bar, s s, u u, d d, tau, mu, e pairs. So that looks okay. But wait, the charm quark is allowed, but the bottom is not. So B includes c, which is allowed, and other lighter ones. So B is a candidate.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t t-bar, tau, mu, e. Wait, top quark is way too heavy, so t t-bar is impossible. So C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But again, b is 4.7 GeV, which is over 3 GeV, so D includes b which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

Wait, so that leaves option B as the correct one, which includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but let me double-check the fermion masses:

- Electron: ~0.5 MeV.
- Muon: ~105.7 MeV.
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV.
- Up quark: ~2 MeV.
- Down quark: ~4-5 MeV.
- Strange quark: ~100 MeV.
- Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV.
- Bottom quark: ~4.7 GeV.
- Top quark: ~173 GeV.

So, any fermion with mass ≤ 3 GeV (so 3 GeV is the limit). So:

c is 1.5 GeV: allowed.

s is 100 MeV: allowed.

u: 2 MeV: allowed.

d: 5 MeV: allowed.

tau: 1.78 GeV: allowed.

mu: 105 MeV: allowed.

e: allowed.

But what about the strange quark? Wait, some sources say the strange quark is around 95-100 MeV, so well under 3 GeV, so yes allowed.

So the decay channels would include all these except for b, t, and maybe others.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So that's all allowed. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all the allowed ones.

So the correct answer is B.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order, we analyze the given Lagrangian and the mass of \( X \), which is 6 GeV. The interaction term suggests that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the fermion \( f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), meaning \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Decay Channels
1. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e^- \)): \( m_e \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - Muon (\( \mu^- \)): \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - Tau (\( \tau^- \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.

2. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 4-5 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (exceeds 3 GeV).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (exceeds 3 GeV).

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is forbidden since \( m_t > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.

### Conclusion
The only kinematically allowed decay channels are those listed in **Option B**.
