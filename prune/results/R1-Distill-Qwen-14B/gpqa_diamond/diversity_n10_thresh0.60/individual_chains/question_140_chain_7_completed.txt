Okay, I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming a precipitate G, which upon heating gives B. Oh, and B has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is similar too.

Hmm, let's start by figuring out what X could be. Since X has a heavier isotope, maybe it's something like H or O? Wait, but the product has a certain reaction with a keto acid. Oh, wait, I remember that Grignard reagents react with ketones. Grignard reagents are organomagnesium compounds, like CH2MgBr or similar.

So if X is a Grignard reagent, then maybe it's something like CH2MgBr. But let's see the reaction. X reacts with liquid Y violently to give gas W, precipitate G, and B. Let's think about Grignard reagents. They react with water or alcohols (which are Y maybe?), but wait, Grignard reagents are usually prepared by reacting magnesium metal with an alkyl or aryl halide in ether. So maybe Y is an alcohol, but let me think again.

Wait, if X is Mg-based, like Mg in some compound. So when Grignard reagent (like RMgX) reacts with water, it produces R-H, Mg(OH)X, and H2? Wait, but Grignards react with water to produce the corresponding hydrocarbon and Mg(OH)X, but maybe in this case, the reaction is with another liquid, like an acid or something else.

Alternatively, maybe Y is an acid. Wait, but the gas W has a molecule with same number of protons and neutrons. That's a clue. Let's see, what gases are produced in such reactions. Maybe hydrogen gas? Because hydrogen has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so that doesn't fit. Or maybe another gas.

Wait, another thought: when a Grignard reagent reacts with an acid (like carboxylic acid), it would form the corresponding salt. But the question says when X reacts with Y (a liquid), which releases a gas W. So perhaps Y is not an acid, but something else.

Wait, another angle. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is ~277 K. Water freezes at 273 K, so 277 is just above that. Hmm, maybe B is something that melts just above 0 degrees Celsius. Wait, like maybe ice? No, that's 273 K. What's another substance? Maybe something like ammonium chloride, but that's a solid. Wait, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What's a solid that melts around that? Maybe something like a low melting point solid. Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal, but magnesium has a high melting point. Alternatively, sodium has a lower melting point but I'm not sure. Wait, another approach: when Grignard reagent is hydrolyzed, it produces magnesium hydroxide and the corresponding alkane. But when heated, maybe magnesium hydroxide decomposes? Well, magnesium hydroxide is not very soluble, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the product when X reacts with a keto acid. The product has two oxygen atoms. So, if the keto acid is something like acetone (but that's a ketone, not an acid), wait, a keto acid would have a ketone and a carboxylic acid group, like something like (CH3)2COHCOOH? Or maybe it's referring to a ketone reacting with a Grignard reagent. Wait, no, the question says the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X contains two oxygen atoms. Hmm, perhaps the product is an alcohol? Because Grignard adds twice to a ketone, but wait, a keto acid... Maybe the reaction is an addition to the carbonyl group.

Wait, X is a Grignard reagent, say R-Mg-X. When it reacts with a keto acid (like a beta-keto acid?), perhaps the Grignard adds to the carbonyl, forming an alcohol. For example, if the keto acid is something like (CH3CO)COOH, then adding Grignard would lead to an alcohol. But the product has two oxygen atoms. Let me think: adding two equivalents of Grignard would add two R groups, but the product would have more oxygen? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the Grignard is reacting with a ketone carbonyl, producing an alcohol. The product would have an additional R group and an -OH group. Let me consider a specific example: suppose the Grignard is CH2MgBr. Reacting it with acetone (which is a ketone, not a keto acid) would give (CH3)2CHOH. But wait, that's an alcohol with a formula like C4H9O. Wait, but the product in the question has two oxygen atoms. Wait, that would imply an O2 in the molecule. Hmm, maybe the product is something like a diol? Or perhaps a carbonate?

Wait, maybe I'm getting off track. Let's go back to the initial reaction: X reacts with Y to give gas W, precipitate G, and B upon heating. The gas W has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think of possible gases. Hydrogen (H2) has 1 proton and 1 neutron? Wait, no, H2 has 1 proton each, but the neutrons are zero. So 1 proton and 0 neutrons. Doesn't fit. Helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So that fits. Or maybe CO2? No, because CO2 has 12 protons (C) and 16 neutrons (O has 8 each, but CO2 has 12 + 16*2? Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, wait, the molecule of gas W has same number of protons and neutrons. For example, each molecule of W has same number of protons as it has neutrons. So, for example, He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So that's a match. Or O2 has 8 protons each, but 8 neutrons each? No, because O is 8 protons, and 8 is the atomic number, but the mass number depends on the isotope. Wait, but O-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons (since O has 8, two atoms make 16) and 16 neutrons (each O-16 has 8 neutrons, two atoms give 16). So yes, O2 would have same number of protons and neutrons. Similarly, H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons, so no. So W could be He or O2 or another.

But what's the reaction that produces He or O2? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe W is something else. Let me think about the reaction of Grignard reagents with water. RMgX + H2O → RH + Mg(OH)X. So gas produced is H2? But that doesn't fit, as H2 has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. But wait, maybe another reaction. Wait, perhaps when the Grignard reagent is quenched with an acid, like HCl, it produces H2? Or perhaps when the Grignard is in a more acidic environment, like with an alcohol, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a carbonated liquid, like carbonated water, which upon opening releases CO2. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid, and the reaction produces gas W.

Wait, another approach: the precipitate G when heated gives B. So G is perhaps Mg(OH)2, which upon heating would decompose. Mg(OH)2 when heated would release water and leave behind MgO, which is a solid, but the melting point of B is close to 277 K. Hmm, MgO has a very high melting point (around 2800°C), which is way higher than 277 K (which is about 4°C). So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe G is some other compound.

Wait, back to the melting point of B. 277 K is approximately 4°C. So B is a solid that melts around that temperature. What's a solid that has a melting point near 4°C? Maybe ammonium nitrate? Wait, no, that's more like dissolving in water. Or perhaps something like camphor? No, camphor has a higher melting point. Hmm, another thought: maybe B is water? Because water freezes at 273 K, but the problem says 277 K. Oh, wait, maybe it's ice. No, ice melts at 273 K. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Wait, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. So perhaps B is some solid that's close to melting at that temperature.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Let's think about what that might be. Suppose X is a Grignard reagent (R-Mg-X). The reaction of a Grignard with a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid, CH3COCH2COOH) would possibly form an alcohol. Let's see: the keto acid has a carbonyl group. Grignard would add to the carbonyl, forming an alkoxide, then upon protonation, an alcohol.

Wait, but the product would have how many oxygens? Let's take acetoacetic acid: it has two ketone groups and a carboxylic acid. If Grignard adds once to the ketone, perhaps it would form an alcohol. But the product would have the oxygen from the carboxylic acid and the new -OH group from the Grignard addition. So that's two oxygen-containing groups. Maybe that's the product, with two O atoms.

Wait, but the product is supposed to have two O atoms in its molecule. So perhaps the product is something like an alcohol with two O atoms. Alternatively, maybe the Grignard adds to the keto acid and then forms a salt, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, like Mg. Because Grignard reagents are made from Mg. So X could be Mg metal reacting with something.

Wait, going back to the first reaction: X reacts with Y to release gas W. If X is Mg, Y could be an acid like HCl. Then Mg would react with HCl to produce MgCl2, H2 gas, and heat. But then the precipitate G would be... Wait, but HCl is a liquid? Well, concentrated HCl is a liquid. So when Mg reacts with HCl, it produces H2 gas (but H2's protons and neutrons don't match), so that can't be. Alternatively, if Y is water, then Mg reacts with water to produce Mg(OH)2 and H2 gas. But again, H2 doesn't fit the W description.

Wait, maybe Y is carbon dioxide? If X reacts with CO2, perhaps forming some magnesium carbonate. But I'm not sure how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is alcohol. Grignard reagents are typically made in ether, but maybe Y is an alcohol. But Grignard reacts with alcohols to form more complex products.

Wait, let's think about the precipitate G. If X is a Grignard reagent, and it reacts with Y, perhaps Y is a salt solution, like a metal chloride. For example, if Y is a solution of HCl, then Grignard (RMgX) would react to form RH and MgCl2. But MgCl2 is soluble in water, so it wouldn't precipitate. Hmm, that's a problem because the question says a precipitate forms.

Wait, another possibility: if Y is a solution of a less soluble salt. For example, if Y is a solution of a sulfate, and the reaction produces a precipitate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps Y is an ether, but Grignard reagents are usually prepared in ether, so maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of H2SO4. If X is Mg, then Mg would react with sulfuric acid to produce MgSO4, H2 gas, and heat. But again, H2 doesn't fit the gas W description.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think of the gas W first. W has same protons and neutrons per molecule. So possible candidates are:

- He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons → total protons = 2, neutrons = 2 → same.
- O2: each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if O-16), so O2 has 16 protons, 16 neutrons → same.
- Ne: 10 protons, 10 neutrons (Ne-20) → same.
- CH4: 6 protons, 8 neutrons → no, doesn't match.
- H2O: 2 protons, 10 neutrons → no.
- CO: 14 protons, 14 neutrons? Wait, C is 6, O is 8 → CO has 14 protons (6+8) and 14 neutrons (6+8?), not sure. Wait, the mass number for C-12 is 12, O-16 is 16. So CO would have 12 +16=28. Number of protons is 6+8=14, neutrons is 12+8=20? No, that doesn't match. Wait, protons are 14, neutrons are 14? Only if the masses are 14 each. But that's not possible because C and O have different masses.

Wait, another approach: W could be CO2. CO2 has 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 44 g/mol. But the number of protons: C has 6, O has 8 each. So for CO2, 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons. Neutrons would be (12-6) + (16-8)*2 = 6 + 16=22. So 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that fits. So gas W is CO2. But would that make sense in the reaction?

Wait, but how would a Grignard reagent reaction produce CO2? Unless the other reactant is carbonate, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, if Y is a carbonate, then the reaction could produce CO2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again about the initial reaction.

So, when X reacts with Y, it produces gas W, precipitate G, and upon heating G gives B. B has a melting point near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. What solid has a melting point around there? Maybe something like ammonium nitrate? No, because it's more about dissolving in water. Wait, another thought: perhaps B is a hydrate that melts at that temperature. Or maybe it's a different compound.

Wait, another approach: the precipitate G when heated gives B. Suppose G is MgCO3, and B is MgO. But MgCO3 decomposes on heating to MgO and CO2. But then, the gas would be CO2, which fits W. So let's see:

If X is Mg, and Y is a carbonate solution, then Mg would react with carbonate to produce MgCO3. But wait, Mg reacts with CO3^2-? Hmm, Mg and CO3^2- might not react directly. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of Na2CO3. Then Mg would react with Na2CO3 to form MgCO3, NaMgO2, or some other product? I'm not too sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe X is a Grignard reagent, RMgX. When RMgX reacts with Y (maybe CO2), it would form RCOOMgX, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal, like Mg, and Y is an acid (like H2SO4) to produce gas W as H2. But H2 doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a heavier isotope of H. Like, for example, deuterium. So X could be HD, but I'm not sure how that would fit.

Wait, going back to the first part: the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, if X is a Grignard reagent, adding it to a keto acid would produce an alcohol. Let me think about the formula.

Suppose the keto acid is CH3COCH2COOH. The Grignard would add to the ketone group. So, for example, if X is CH2MgBr, adding it to the ketone would form CH3COCH2CH2OH. Then, the product would have, let's see, the carboxylic acid (COOH) and the new -OH group. So that's two O-containing groups: COOH and OH. So the product molecule would have two O atoms. That fits the description.

So, the Grignard adds to the carbonyl, forming an alcohol. So the product has two O atoms.

So, X is a Grignard reagent, like CH2MgBr or similar.

Now, let's connect this back to the initial reaction. Grignard reagent (X) reacts with Y (liquid) violently, releasing gas W, forming precipitate G.

Wait, Grignard reagents react with CO2 to form carboxylic acids upon hydrolysis. But in the reaction, perhaps when the Grignard is quenched, CO2 is evolved? Or when X reacts with Y which is CO2, it produces a carboxylate salt, which upon hydrolysis gives the carboxylic acid and releases CO2? Hmm, not quite sure.

Alternatively, if X is Mg, and Y is a carbonate solution, then the reaction would produce CO2 gas. So MgCO3 decomposes upon heating to MgO and CO2. So if G is MgCO3, and upon heating, it produces B as MgO and CO2 as W. But MgO has a very high melting point, so that doesn't fit with B's melting point being 277 K.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about B's melting point. 277 K is approximately 4°C. What solid has a melting point around there? Maybe something like sodium (melting point about 371 K, which is too high) or potassium (374 K). Alternatively, maybe it's ice, but that's 273 K. So perhaps B is something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is a hydrate. For instance, magnesium nitrate hexahydrate has a melting point around that range. Alternatively, perhaps B is a salt that is more stable at lower temperatures.

Alternatively, maybe B is a carbonate. Wait, magnesium carbonate has a melting point around 400°C, which is way higher than 277 K. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something obvious. The product of the Grignard reaction with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So if the product is an alcohol with two oxygen atoms, perhaps it's something like a secondary alcohol. Let me think about the formula. For example, if the keto acid is a β-keto acid, like CH3COCH2COOH, and the Grignard adds once, giving CH3COCH2CH2OH. That molecule would have two oxygen atoms: one in the hydroxyl group and one in the carboxylic acid. Wait, but the product might be quenched, leading to the acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think about the cumulative atomic masses in substance X. The problem says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an isotope that's heavier than the common one.

Grignard reagents are typically organomagnesium compounds, like CH2MgBr or CH3MgBr. So the elements in X are carbon, hydrogen, magnesium, and bromine (if it's MgBr). So the lightest element is H, with atomic mass about 1, and the heaviest is Br, around 80. So the cumulative masses would be 1 (H) + 12 (C) + 24 (Mg) + 80 (Br) = 1 +12=13, 13+24=37, 37+80=117. Wait, but that's for all elements. Wait, but the question says to sum the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes for each element present in X. Wait, no: the question says to consider that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed. Wait, perhaps each element in X contributes all its isotopes' masses.

Wait, that can't be right because that would be a huge number. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X. So, for each element in X, find the lightest isotope and the heaviest isotope, sum their atomic masses, and then add those together.

Wait, but what are the lightest and heaviest elements in X?

If X is CH2MgBr, the elements are C, H, Mg, Br.

The lightest element is H (atomic number 1), and the heaviest is Br (atomic number 35). So for H, the lightest isotope is H-1 (mass 1), the heaviest isotope is maybe H-6 (mass 6), but wait, H's isotopes don't go that high. The most common are H-1 (protium, mass ~1), H-2 (deuterium, ~2), H-3 (tritium, ~3). So the heaviest isotope of H is H-3, with mass ~3.

For Br, the most common isotope is Br-79 (mass ~79) and Br-81 (mass ~81). So the lightest isotope is Br-79 and the heaviest is Br-81. So their masses are 79 and 81.

Wait, but the question says to sum the lightest and heaviest isotopes for each element. So for each element in X, sum the mass of the lightest and the heaviest isotope.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. Oh, the question says: "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X".

Ah, so the lightest and heaviest elements (by atomic number) in X. So for X, which is CH2MgBr, the elements are C (6), H (1), Mg (12), Br (35). So the lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is Br (35). So we need the sum of their atomic masses.

Wait, the atomic mass of H is approximately 1.008, Br is approximately 79.904. So 1.008 + 79.904 ≈ 80.912. But the options are numbers like 25, 29, etc. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the lightest and heaviest isotopes of each element present in X, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says, "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So it's the sum of the lightest (by mass) and heaviest (by mass) elements in X.

Wait, wait no, the question says, "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So for each element in X, identify the lightest and heaviest elements. Wait, perhaps it's the lightest and heaviest in terms of atomic number.

Wait, but in X (Grignard reagent), the elements are H, C, Mg, Br.

H (1), C (6), Mg (12), Br (35). So the lightest element is H, the heaviest is Br. So the cumulative atomic masses would be H's atomic mass (1) plus Br's (about 80), totaling 81. But the options don't have 81. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes of each element in X. So for each element in X, find the lightest isotope and the heaviest isotope, sum their masses, then add all these sums together.

But that would be a lot. Let's see:

Elements in X: H, C, Mg, Br.

For H: lightest isotope is H-1 (mass 1), heaviest is H-3 (mass 3). Sum: 1 +3=4.

For C: lightest isotope is C-12 (mass 12), heaviest is C-14 (mass 14). Sum: 12+14=26.

For Mg: lightest isotope is Mg-24 (mass 24), heaviest is Mg-26 (mass 26). Sum:24+26=50.

For Br: lightest isotope is Br-79 (mass 79), heaviest is Br-81 (mass 81). Sum:79+81=160.

Now, sum all these: 4 +26 +50 +160 = 240. That's way higher than any of the options, so that can't be right either.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. It says, "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X."

Wait, perhaps it's the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest element and the heaviest element in X. So H (mass 1) and Br (79.9). Sum is 80.9, which isn't any of the options. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the lightest and heaviest isotopes of the elements present, but only one isotope per element. But that doesn't seem to make sense either.

Hmm, maybe I'm completely off track here. Let me go back to the reaction.

If X is a Grignard reagent, then Y could be an alcohol. Grignard reagents react with alcohols to form more substituted alkanes. But that doesn't produce a gas. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a ketone or an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a halogenated compound, leading to substitution. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the precipitate G, when heated, gives B. If G is magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)2, upon heating, it would decompose to MgO and water. But MgO has a high melting point, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps G is another compound. Maybe magnesium carbonate? If Y is a carbonate solution, then X (Mg) would react to form MgCO3. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product when a keto acid reacts with X. Let me think about an example. Let's say the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid: CH3COCH2COOH. Reacting with a Grignard reagent, say CH2MgBr, would add to the ketone group (the more reactive one), giving CH3C(OH)CH2COOH. After quenching, it would become CH3CH(OH)CH2COOH. So the product would have two oxygen atoms: one from the hydroxyl group and one from the carboxylic acid. So that's two oxygens, which fits.

So, the product has two oxygen atoms, so that's correct.

Now, looking back at the initial reaction: X (Grignard) + Y (liquid) → gas W, precipitate G, and B upon heating.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Then, X (Grignard) would react with CO3^2- to form MgCO3 as precipitate. But Grignard is a strong base and would deprotonate the solution. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of Grignard with carbonate would produce CO2 gas.

Wait, but Grignard reagents can react with CO2 to form carboxylate salts. For example, RMgX + CO2 → RCOOMgX. Then, when you add an acid, you get RCOOH. But in this case, perhaps the reaction is producing CO2 as gas W.

Wait, but if Y is CO2, then X (Grignard) would react with CO2 to form RCOOMgX. But would that precipitate? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of NaHCO3. Then, Grignard would deprotonate it, producing CO2.

Wait, let me think about the reaction: RMgX + HCO3^- → RCO3^- + MgXHCO3? Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to find the answer based on the cumulative atomic masses.

The options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

If I thought earlier that the elements in X are H, C, Mg, Br.

The lightest element is H (mass 1), the heaviest is Br (mass 80). Sum is 81, which isn't in options.

Wait, perhaps X doesn't contain Br. Maybe it's another halide. For example, maybe X is CH3MgCl. Then the elements are C, H, Mg, Cl.

Cl has a higher atomic number than Br, but a lower mass. Cl's mass is about 35.5.

So the lightest element is H (mass 1), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5, which is close to option A (35), but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the lightest and heaviest elements in X (by atomic number, not mass). H is lightest, Cl is heaviest. So their atomic masses sum to 1 + 35.5 = 36.5. Again, close to 35.

But the options don't have 36.5, but option A is 35.

Hmm, perhaps the question is considering the lightest and heaviest isotopes of the elements present. So for each element in X, take the lightest and heaviest isotopes, sum their masses, then for all elements, sum those sums.

Wait, but earlier that gave 4 +26 +50 +160 = 240.

Hmm, no. Maybe another approach: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X, meaning the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Wait, in X, the lightest element is H (mass 1), heaviest is Br (mass 80). So 1 +80 =81.

But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound, not a Grignard reagent. Let me think again.

Wait, the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Another possibility is that X is a metal like Na. Sodium reacts with a keto acid to form a salt and perhaps an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a heavier isotope of H, like deuterium. So X is HD (deuterium). Then, when reacting with something, it releases gas W. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of X with Y releases gas W, which has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think of other possibilities for W. Let's make a table:

Possible gases where total protons = total neutrons:

- He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons → yes.

- O2: each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if O-16), so O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons → yes.

- Ne: 10 protons, 10 neutrons (Ne-20) → yes.

- CH4: 6 protons, 8 neutrons → no.

- NH3: 14 protons, 10 neutrons → no.

- CO: 14 protons (6+8), neutrons: (6-6)+(16-8) =0 +8 → 8 → 14≠8 → no.

- CO2: 22 protons (6+16), 22 neutrons (6+16) → yes, CO2 has 22 each.

So possible W could be He, O2, Ne, or CO2.

If W is He, then the reaction must release helium gas. That's less common, but possible in some reactions, like when metals react with acid to produce hydrogen, but perhaps under certain conditions, helium is released? Not sure.

If W is O2, then perhaps the reaction is producing oxygen gas. For example, decomposition of a peroxide, but I'm not sure how that relates to X.

If W is Ne, perhaps a reaction involving sodium or magnesium in a specific compound.

Alternatively, perhaps W is CO2. So, the reaction produces CO2.

If that's the case, then X could be a Grignard reagent reacting with CO2. So, RMgX + CO2 → RCOOMgX. Then, when quenched with acid, it becomes RCOOH. So the Grignard adds to CO2 to form a carboxylate, which upon acid workup gives the carboxylic acid.

In this case, the gas W would be CO2, which fits the criteria (22 protons and neutrons each in the molecule).

So, if X is a Grignard reagent, Y would be CO2. But Y is a liquid, which CO2 isn't under standard conditions. Unless it's in a pressurized container.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution containing carbonate ions. Then, X (Grignard) would react to produce CO2.

Wait, but Grignard reagents reacting with CO3^2- would form MgCO3 and release CO2. Or, perhaps the Grignard is reacting with CO2 to form the carboxylate, which when acidified, gives the acid.

So, in any case, perhaps X is a Grignard reagent, and Y is CO2.

Now, going back to the initial reaction, the precipitate G would form when X reacts with Y. If X is RMgX and Y is CO2, then RCOOMgX would be the product. But I'm not sure if that's a precipitate. Or maybe it's a solution.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Mg, and Y is a carbonate solution. Then, Mg would react with CO3^2- to form MgCO3 precipitate, and release CO2 gas. So, G is MgCO3, which upon heating decomposes into MgO and CO2. But MgO has a high melting point, which doesn't fit the 277 K.

Wait, but if G is MgCO3, and upon heating, it produces B, which is MgO, but MgO's melting point is much higher. So that can't be.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the precipitate G is Mg(OH)2, which upon heating gives MgO and water. But again, MgO has a high melting point.

Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is something else. Let me think about the reaction of Grignard with Y.

Wait, perhaps Y is a ketone, and X is the Grignard reagent. Then, the Grignard would add to the ketone, forming an alcohol. But that wouldn't produce a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid. Grignard reacts with acid to form the corresponding hydrocarbon and the conjugate base. But that again doesn't produce a precipitate.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let's try to think about the cumulative atomic masses again, given the options.

If X is a Grignard reagent like CH3MgBr, then the elements are C, H, Mg, Br.

The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is Br (80). So sum is 81, which isn't an option.

If X is CH3MgCl, elements are C, H, Mg, Cl.

Cl has mass ≈35.5, so H (1) + Cl (35.5) = 36.5. Closest option is A)35.

So perhaps the answer is 35, which is option A.

But why would the sum be 35? Because 35 is the atomic mass of Cl? Wait, no, the sum would be 1 (H) +35.5 (Cl) =36.5.

Hmm, but the option is 35, which is the atomic number of Br. Wait, no, Br's atomic number is 35. Atomic mass is about 80.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X in terms of atomic number, not mass. So H (1) and Br (35), sum 36, but option A is 35.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the lightest and heaviest isotopes of the same element. But that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, maybe X is not a Grignard reagent but another type of reagent. Let me think again. The problem says that X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is similar. Another possibility: X could be a halogen, like Cl2 or Br2. But no, because it's a substance that reacts violently with Y.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a metal, like Na or Mg, which reacts with liquid Y (like water) to produce H2 gas. But H2 doesn't fit the W description.

Wait, but the gas W has same number of protons and neutrons. If W is O2, which has 16 protons and 16 neutrons, then perhaps the reaction produces O2. So maybe the reaction is a decomposition of peroxide.

Wait, if X is a peroxide, like NaO2, reacting with Y (water), it might decompose to produce O2. But I'm not certain.

Another angle: the precipitate G when heated gives B, which has a melting point near 277 K. So if B is ice, but that's at 273 K. Or perhaps B is a different hydrate.

Wait, maybe B is a hydrate of some salt. For example, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate has a melting point around 277 K? I'm not sure, but perhaps that's a possible scenario.

But I'm getting stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

Earlier, when considering X as CH3MgCl, the sum would be H (1) + Cl (35.5) ≈36.5. The closest option is A)35.

Alternatively, if X is CH3MgBr, sum is 1 +80=81, which is not an option.

But wait, another possibility: X is deuterium oxide (D2O) or something similar. But that doesn't fit with the Grignard reagent idea.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains only two elements. Let's say it's a diatomic molecule. For example, Cl2. But then, the cumulative masses would be 35.5 (Cl) *2 =71, which isn't an option.

Wait, another thought: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. If X is H2O, then when it reacts with a keto acid, you wouldn't get two oxygens. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a base like NaOH. Reacting with a keto acid would form a salt and water. But the product's oxygen count isn't clear.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal hydride, like LiAlH4. Reacting with a keto acid would reduce the carbonyl group, but I'm not sure about the oxygen count.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a halogen, but that doesn't fit the Grignard idea.

I think I'm stuck on this. Maybe the correct answer is option C)31, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the lightest and heaviest elements in X are H (1) and O (16). Sum is 17. Not in options.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements C and O. Then sum would be 12 +16=28.

Hmm, the options don't have 28.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal like Mg (atomic mass 24.3), and the other element is O (16). Sum is 24.3 +16=40.3. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the lightest and heaviest elements in X as C and O, sum 12 +16=28. Closest is option D)29.

But this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements like C and H, sum 12 +1=13, which is not an option.

Wait, given the options, I think the intended answer is 35 (option A), possibly if X is a chloride-based Grignard, like CH2MgCl, sum of H and Cl is ~36.5, but rounded to 35.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the atomic number, not mass. So H is 1 and Br is 35, sum 36. But option A is 35.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the sum of the atomic numbers of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. H is 1, Br is 35. Sum is 36, but not an option.

I think I've spent too much time and need to make a choice. Based on the earlier analysis, if X is CH3MgCl, the sum of H and Cl's atomic masses is about 36.5, which is close to option A (35). So I'll go with A.


The question revolves around identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X, which is described as a reagent in organic chemistry. Based on the analysis, X is likely a Grignard reagent, such as CH3MgCl or CH2MgBr. These reagents typically contain the elements carbon (C), hydrogen (H), magnesium (Mg), and a halogen (e.g., Cl or Br).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Elements in X**: The elements present in a Grignard reagent like CH3MgCl are:
   - Hydrogen (H), with an atomic mass of approximately 1.
   - Carbon (C), with an atomic mass of approximately 12.
   - Magnesium (Mg), with an atomic mass of approximately 24.
   - Chlorine (Cl), with an atomic mass of approximately 35.5.

2. **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**: 
   - The lightest element is hydrogen (H), with an atomic mass of 1.
   - The heaviest element is chlorine (Cl), with an atomic mass of 35.5.

3. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**:
   - The sum of the atomic masses of the lightest (H) and heaviest (Cl) elements is:
     \[
     1 + 35.5 = 36.5
     \]
   - This value is closest to the given option **35**.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X align most closely with option **A (35)**.
