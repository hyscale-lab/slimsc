Okay, let's try to figure this chemistry problem out. Hmm, so the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, producing gas W and precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Oh wait, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, so B must be a solid that's just barely melting at that temperature. That makes me think of water, but I'm not sure yet.

The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, because protons and neutrons are in the nucleus, so the number of each must be equal. So the molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let me think, what gas fits that? Maybe something like deuterium gas, but wait, deuterium is D2, which is a molecule of two deuterium atoms. Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So each D has p=1, n=1. So W could be D2, but wait, that's a heavy isotope of hydrogen. But another option is maybe carbon monoxide? No, wait, CO has a different structure. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says W is a gas, so maybe it's something like H2O? No, because H2O has protons and neutrons, but let's see: H has 1 proton, O has 8. So in H2O, each H has 0 neutrons (if it's H1), so maybe that doesn't fit. Or maybe W is something like CH4? No, that's a gas but maybe not matching the neutron and proton counts.

Wait, perhaps W is carbon monoxide, CO. Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons in its most common isotope (C-12). Oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in O-16. But wait, the molecule as a whole? No, that's not how it works. Each atom in the molecule contributes its own protons and neutrons. Oh wait, wait, the question says the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So sum of protons in the molecule equals sum of neutrons in the molecule.

So for example, if the molecule is H2O: each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (assuming H1), and O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons: 2*1 +8 =10. Neutrons: 0 +8=8. Not equal. So that's not it.

Another idea: maybe CO2? Let's see. Each C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (C-12), each O has 8 and 8. So in CO2: 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8 =22. Oh, that works! So W would be CO2, but wait, is CO2 a gas? Yes, it's a gas under standard conditions. So the molecule CO2 would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons, so that fits the condition. Hmm, that's a possibility.

But wait, let me think of another possibility. What about methane, CH4? C is
