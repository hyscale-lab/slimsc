Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about determining which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but let me think this through.

So, the question gives four options, all are different chemical compounds. The options are labeled A, B, C, D, and the question asks which one has C3h symmetry.

First, I need to remember what C3h symmetry means. Oh right, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. C stands for cyclic, and the subscript 3 means a three-fold rotation. The 'h' stands for horizontal, which implies there's a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the axis of rotation. So a molecule with C3h symmetry would have a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, sometimes C3h can also be thought of as having a three-fold rotation and an inversion axis, but I think in this context, it's the mirror plane.

Wait, no, correction: The h in C3h refers to a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis. Or is it that the mirror plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis and passes through it? Let me visualize. So, for example, ammonia has C3v symmetry, not C3h. Maybe I should think about examples.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of each molecule's structure and see which one has the right symmetry elements.

Let me look at each option.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate is (i-Pr)3BO. The structure is a central boron atom bonded to three isopropyl groups. So it's trigonal planar around boron. Each isopropyl group is bulky. Now, does this molecule have any symmetry? Let's see. The molecule is symmetric because all three substituents are the same. So the central B is surrounded by three identical groups. So does it have C3 symmetry? Yes, because you can rotate it 120 degrees around the boron and it would look the same. But does it have a mirror plane?

Wait, the molecule is planar? Boron is in the center, but the isopropyl groups are in a trigonal planar arrangement. So the molecule is symmetric. But what about the mirror planes? For a planar molecule with three identical substituents, like BF3, which has D3h symmetry. D3h implies multiple symmetry elements, including a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, but triisopropyl borate is more of a trigonal pyramidal? No, wait, boron is in the center with three substituents, so it's trigonal planar. Wait, no, wait, the actual structureâ€”boron is usually trigonal planar when bonded to three groups. So triisopropyl borate would have a trigonal planar geometry. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry in each of the three directions, but more importantly, what's the point group?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the symmetry elements. If all three substituents are the same, the molecule will have a three-fold rotation axis (C3). Are there any mirror planes? Yes, each mirror plane would pass through the boron atom and bis
