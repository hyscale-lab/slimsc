Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, like a cage with multiple rings. The compound is dibromo, so bromine atoms are on the first and third positions of the adamantane structure.

First reaction: Heated with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I think this is an elimination reaction because KOH is a strong base. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalo) react with KOH, they usually undergo elimination to form alkenes. But wait, here it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Oh, wait, no, 1,3-dibromo would be on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure? Or maybe not. Because adamantane's structure has each carbon connected in a way that each bridgehead is a carbon. So the 1 and 3 positions might be on adjacent bridgeheads. Wait, no, I'm a bit confused about the structure. Let me think: adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead is connected to three other bridgeheads. So, 1 and 3 positions might be two bridgeheads that are two apart. Or maybe they're actually adjacent? Because in some adamantane derivatives, adjacent bridgeheads are possible.

Wait, when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, what's the
