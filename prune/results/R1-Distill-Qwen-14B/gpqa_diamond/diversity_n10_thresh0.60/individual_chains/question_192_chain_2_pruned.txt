Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's try to think it through. The question is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity. Oh right, so the conductor itself is neutral, but there's a small cavity inside it. The cavity is spherical too, with radius r, and its center is at a distance s from the main conductor's center. Oh wait, and the radius of the main conductor is R, which is bigger than r, so the cavity is entirely inside.

Now, they placed a small positive charge +q somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the main conductor. The angle between l and s is theta. Whew, that's a bit to unpack.

I remember that when you have a conductor, the charges inside will induce charges on the surfaces. Wait, but the conductor was initially uncharged. Oh right, so when you put a charge inside the cavity, it induces an opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor and a positive charge on the outer surface. But wait, no, wait. Because the conductor is neutral, when you place a positive charge in the cavity, the inner surface must have an induced -q charge, and the outer surface has +q to balance, right? Because the conductor's total charge is zero.

But
