Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's about titration and pH calculations. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

So the question says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe I can figure it out step by step.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So the reaction should be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, but before that, let's calculate the diluted solution's concentration. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be (20 mL * 0.05 M) / 40 mL. Let me compute that: (20 *0.05)=1 mmol, divided by 40 mL is 0.025 M. So the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating, the initial solution is 0.025 M CH3COOH. The NaOH is 0.1 M. We need to find two pH points: at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Let's start with the 25% titration. 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So the moles of acetic acid originally are volume (L) multiplied by concentration. The diluted solution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) of 0.025 M. So moles = 0.04 L * 0.025 mol/L = 0.001 mol (1 mmol).

At 25% titration, 0.25 mmol of CH3COOH has reacted with NaOH. So moles of CH3COOH left would be 0.75 mmol, and moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed would be 0.25 mmol. Because each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid.

Wait, but when we add NaOH, the solution's volume increases. Hmm, how much volume of NaOH is added at 25% titration? The total moles of acid is 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH added at 25% is 0.00025 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 mL.

So the total solution volume is 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL.

But wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of concentrations in the solution after adding that NaOH. Let's model it.

The solution will be a buffer solution because we have both the weak acid and its conjugate base. So using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be good here.

The Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). So I need to find the ratio of acetate (A^-) to acetic acid (HA) after 25% titration.

After 25% titration:
- Moles of HA (acetic acid) = initial moles (0.001) - 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00075 mol
- Moles of A^- (
