Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Okay, let me read it again.

The problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. And when they measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. We need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm. I remember that for wave functions, the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So the probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over that region.

Since all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3, the integral of |ψ(x)|² from 1 to 3 should equal 1. Because the total probability must be 1 for normalization.

Wait, right! The wave function must be normalized. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² from 1 to 3 is 1. So I can set up that equation and solve for 'a'.

Let me write down the wave function: ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i.

Wait, but wait. Wave functions can have real and imaginary parts. The absolute square is ψ*(x) * ψ(x). So I need to compute that.

Compute |ψ(x)|²: [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i ] multiplied by [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i ] because when you take the complex conjugate of the second term, the imaginary part changes sign.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5i * a / sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i * a / sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5)^2 * i²?

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that carefully.

No, more accurately, expanding (A - Bi)(A + Bi) gives A² + B², because the cross terms are 2ABi and -2ABi, which cancel.

So in this case, A is (a / sqrt(1+x)), and B is 0.5.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a² / (1+x)) + (0.5)^2.

Which simplifies to (a²/(1+x)) + 0.
