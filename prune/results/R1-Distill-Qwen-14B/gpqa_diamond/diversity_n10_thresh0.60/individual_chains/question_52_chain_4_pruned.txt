Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand everything.

Alright, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find out by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay. So the key here is understanding how the temperature affects the population of these energy levels. Since the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), I can use the Boltzmann equation for this.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(kT) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of atoms in levels 2 and 1, respectively.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

The problem states that when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases to 5500 K from 6000 K. So the ratio n2/n1 will change because T changes.

Wait, the ratio is n2/n1 when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. So the factor is ratio_without_spots / ratio_with_spots.

Let me denote:

Ratio_with_spots = R_sp
Ratio_without_spots = R_no_sp

So the factor is R_no_sp / R_sp.

Since the statistical weights (g factors) are constants (they don't change with temperature), I can factor them out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of the ratios will be exp( (E2 - E1)(1/(k T_no_sp) - 1/(k T_sp)) )

Wait, actually, let's think about the ratio of the ratios. The ratio without spots (R_no_sp) is:

R_no_sp = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T_no_sp) )

The ratio with spots (R_sp) is:

R_sp = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T_sp) )

So when I take R_no_sp / R_sp, the (g2/g1) terms cancel out. So:

Factor = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T_no_sp) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T_sp) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T_sp - 1/T_no_sp) )

Because:

exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)

So substituting:

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_no_sp) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T_sp) ) ] )

Which is:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T_sp) - 1/(T_no_sp)) )

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me re-do that.

Original:

Factor = [R_no_sp] / [R_sp] = [exp(-ΔE/(k T_no_sp))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T_sp))]

Which is:

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_no_sp) + ΔE/(k T_sp) ] )

Factor = exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_sp) - 1/(T_no_sp) ] ) 

So that's the expression I
