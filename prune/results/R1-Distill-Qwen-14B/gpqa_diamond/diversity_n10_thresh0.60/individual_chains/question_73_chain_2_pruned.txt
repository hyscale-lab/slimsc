Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let's see... it's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and figuring out their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics; I've got to use special relativity principles.

So, the problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. Oh right, the relative speed isn't just the difference between their speeds because of relativity. I can't subtract 0.6c and 0.5c and get 0.1c. That's a common mistake. No, I have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). So let me plug those numbers in.

V1 is 0.6c, V2 is 0.5c. So numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c². Let's compute that. 0.6 * 0.5 is 0.3, so (0.3c²)/c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. Hmm, so relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now for the total energy. I think the total energy is the sum of each astronaut's relativistic energy. Each one's energy is given by gamma * m c². So for the first astronaut, mass is 2m, velocity is 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Let me compute gamma for each. For the first one: v = 0.6c, so v²/c² is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. v²/c² is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is around 0.8660. Gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So energy E2 is 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 mc². So about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and the relative speed is 0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower. So the correct energy should be 5.96 mc².

But wait, is the total energy just the sum of their energies? Or does the system's energy have to consider their relative motion in another frame? Hmm, I think the question is asking for the total energy from the perspective of each astronaut's own rest frames, but no, that's not the case. The system's total energy would be the sum of their energies from the same reference frame. Oh wait, the question says "the total energy of the system". So probably, we should calculate each energy in the same frame, but the problem doesn't specify which frame. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem states the astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction. But their speeds are given in that direction. So when calculating their energies, are we considering each from the lab frame? I think that the question is assuming we calculate each energy in the lab frame where they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, and then sum those energies. Or perhaps, no, because the problem states "the total energy of the system" — that's the sum of their energies as measured in the lab frame.

So the calculation I did earlier stands: about 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C is v_rel =0.14c, E=5.96 mc². Option D has the same speed but E=5 mc². So option C is the correct one.
