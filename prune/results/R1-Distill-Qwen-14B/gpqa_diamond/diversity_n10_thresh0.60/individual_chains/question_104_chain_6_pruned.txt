Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that two stars with the same mass (like our Sun) each have a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. 

So, for Planet #1, the spectral line shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, it's 7. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the velocity of the star. The formula for the Doppler shift relates to the star's velocity. The formula is something like velocity (v) equals (lambda shift) over lambda_0, multiplied by c (speed of light). But wait, the exact formula might not be that straightforward. Alternatively, the shift in wavelength (delta_lambda) is proportional to the velocity (v) via v = (delta_lambda / lambda_0) * c, where lambda_0 is the original wavelength. 

But since both stars are similar to the Sun and the same mass, and the planets have similar masses, the effect on the stars' velocities would depend on the planet's orbital period and other factors. Oh right, the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is due to the planet's orbit. The star's velocity (v) is related to the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the size of the orbit (semi-major axis). 

Wait, the formula for the star's velocity amplitude (K) is given by K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ something? Hmm, not sure. Wait, another approach: the RV method detects the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. 

I think the formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is: K = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )^(1/ P^(1/3)) ) ) * (something else). Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider the Doppler shift in terms of the velocity induced in the
