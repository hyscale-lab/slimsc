Okay, I'm looking at this problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is achieved when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv²_max. So equating them, I get v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh wait, that's option C. But wait, the question is about a relativistic case. So I can't just use the non-relativistic equations here.

In relativity, the energy considerations are different. The total energy of the oscillator would include both the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy, right? So the total energy E would be gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, the oscillator's potential and kinetic energy are both part of the total energy.

Wait, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy might not be (1/2)kx². Or maybe it is, but the equations of motion are different. Let me think. The force is still F = -kx, but the equation of motion would involve relativistic mass or something else, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh right, in relativistic mechanics, momentum isn't just mv; it's gamma m v. So maybe the equation of motion becomes d/dt (gamma m v) = -kx. Hmm, that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the potential energy is (
