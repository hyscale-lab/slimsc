Okay, so I've got this astronomy question to tackle. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that in a specific region, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so like N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically the number per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. So if plx decreases, the distance increases.

Wait, but the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in would change the expression. Let's see, 1/( (1/d) )^5 equals d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh, so they're asking about the density of stars as a function of distance. So maybe I need to find the derivative of N with respect to d, or perhaps think about how many stars are in a thin shell at distance d.

Wait, let me think about this. If N is proportional to d^5, that suggests that for each additional distance r (like a small change in d), the number of stars increases as
