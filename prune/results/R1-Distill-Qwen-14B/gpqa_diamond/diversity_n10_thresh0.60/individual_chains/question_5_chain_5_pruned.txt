Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states with definite values.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So the total operator P is the vector sum of these components, right? Because P is a vector operator, so P = P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. But wait, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, meaning the direction vector n is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ) or something similar. No, wait, since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero? Or maybe not, because the x-z plane allows for any angle in the x and z directions, so φ could be zero, meaning the direction is along (x and z), so perhaps n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ) for some θ. That makes sense because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

Wait, but the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So, the unit vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So for the operator P along n, it would be P·n = P_x * sinθ + P_z * cosθ. Since the y-component Py isn't involved because n's y-component is zero.

So I need to compute the matrix for P·n, then find its eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

First, let me write down each component matrix:

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]
Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute this matrix. Let's factor out ħ/2.

So the matrix inside is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ] , [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no, wait. Because the first term is sinθ multiplied by [[0,1],[1,0]], which gives [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]. The second term is cosθ multiplied by [[1,0],[0,-1]], which gives [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]. Adding them together:

Top left: cosθ (from the Pz term) plus 0 (from Px) → cosθ.

Top right: sinθ (from Px) + 0 → sinθ.

Bottom left: sinθ.

Bottom right: 0 (from Px) + (-cosθ) → -cosθ.

So the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So the operator is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

We need to find the eigenvector of this matrix with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So eigenvalue equation: (P·n) |ψ> = (+ħ/2)|ψ>.

Let me denote the matrix without the (ħ/2) factor. Let's call the matrix M:

M = [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So the operator is (ħ/2) M. So the eigenvalue equation is:

(ħ/2) M |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Divide both sides by (ħ/2), we get M |ψ> = |ψ>.

So we need to solve M |ψ> = |ψ>.

So M - I = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So M - I = [[cosθ -1, sinθ], [sin
