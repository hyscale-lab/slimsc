Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, wait, but wait—does the mass matter here? Because the question is about luminosity, which I think relates more to radius and temperature. Oh, right, because luminosity for stars is often calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. So mass might not directly factor in unless we're using some other formula, but maybe for this problem, mass is a distractor.

The question also says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. That suggests something about their temperatures, right? Because the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T must be same. So T1 equals T2.

Wait, but then their luminosities would depend on their radii. Since L = 4πR²σT⁴, and if T is same, then L is proportional to R². So Star_1 has R = 1.5 R2. So the luminosity ratio would be (R1/R2)² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 should be 2.25 times that of Star_2.

But wait, the options don't have exactly 2.25, but option A is ~2.25, option B is ~2.32, etc. Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, but wait! The problem introduces radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us, so its observed wavelength isn't Doppler shifted. But Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So does that affect the observed brightness or the temperature calculation?

Wait, the problem says the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So that's the observed λ_max. But if Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, its emitted wavelengths would be Doppler shifted, affecting the observed λ_max. So that would affect the temperature calculation.

Wait, no, wait. Because in the problem statement, the observed wavelengths where they appear brightest are same. So Star_1's λ_max is λ, and Star_2's observed λ_max is also λ. But if Star_2 is moving, its emitted λ_emitted_max would be different.

Hmm, so perhaps I need to calculate the actual temperature of each star, considering Doppler shift. Because the observed λ is different from the emitted λ if the star is moving.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the wavelengths they appear brightest are same. So if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s towards or away, then its emitted λ would be different. So we can use the Doppler effect to find the actual temperatures.

So, let's think. Let me recall the Doppler shift formula for light. The formula is:

λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) )

Wait, but wait, the direction matters. If the star is moving away, v_r is positive, leading to a redshift (longer λ). If moving towards, blueshift (shorter λ). So for Star_2, v_r is +700 km/s, assuming it's moving away. But wait, wait. Let me double-check the formula.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs / λ_emit = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But if the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter. So v is positive when moving away, and negative when moving towards.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to write the formula as:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But wait, v is the radial velocity. If the star is moving away, v is positive, so λ_obs is greater than λ_emit. If moving towards us, v is negative, so λ_obs is less than λ_emit.

In this problem, both stars have λ_obs_max equal. So λ1 = λ2_observed.

But for Star_1, v_r is 0, so λ1 = λ1_emit.

For Star_2, v_r is 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away, so v is positive. So λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Since λ1 = λ2_obs, we have λ1_emit = λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But wait, from earlier, we thought that the temperatures are the same because λ_emit_max is same, but that's assuming no Doppler shift. But with Doppler shift, it's more complicated.

Wait, no, the λ_emit_max is determined by the star's temperature. The observed λ is λ_emit multiplied by the Doppler factor.

So, let's denote:

For Star_1:

λ1_obs = λ1_emit

For Star_2:

λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) ) 

But given that λ1_obs = λ2_obs, so:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But λ_emit is given by Wien's law, λ_emit = b / T. So,

λ1_emit = b / T1

λ2_emit = b / T2

So,

b/(T1) = (b/(T2)) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )

Cancel b from both sides:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Hmm, but wait, the problem says that the observed wavelengths are same, so λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. So we have to account for Doppler shift in Star_2's emission.

But the problem also says that the stars radiate as black bodies. So their emitted spectra are black body, but the observed is shifted.

Wait, but when calculating their luminosities, we should use their actual (intrinsic) temperatures, not the observed ones. Because luminosity is an intrinsic property, not what's observed.

Wait, no. Luminosity is the intrinsic power emitted. So when calculating the luminosity using the black body formula, it's based on the star's actual temperature, radius, and emissivity. So the observed Doppler shift affects the apparent temperature and the peak wavelength, but the actual star's temperature is higher or lower depending on the direction of motion.

So, for Star_1:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4

For Star_2:

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4

We need to find L1/L2.

But we know R1 = 1.5 R2.

We need to find T1 and T2.

We have the equation from the observed lambda max:

λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But,

λ1_emit = b / T1

λ2_emit = b / T2

But,

λ1_obs = λ1_emit.

λ2_obs = λ2_emit * Doppler factor.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to write it more clearly.

Let me denote:

λ_obs for Star_1 = λ1_obs = λ1_emit

λ_obs for Star_2 = λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Given that λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

So,

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But,

λ1_emit = b / T1

λ2_emit = b / T2

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Hmm, but wait, the velocities are given. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let's compute v2/c.

v2 = 700 km/s.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s.

So, v2/c = 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333...

So, it's a small number, so we can perhaps approximate the square root.

sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ≈ 1 - v/c.

Wait, let me compute it accurately.

Let's compute the expression (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = (1 - 0.002333) / (1 + 0.002333) ≈ (0.9976667) / (1.0023333) ≈ approximately 0.995333.

So the square root of 0.995333 is approximately 0.997666.

Wait, let me compute (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) more precisely.

v=700 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333333.

So,

(1 - 0.002333333) = 0.997666667

(1 + 0.002333333) = 1.002333333

The ratio is 0.997666667 / 1.002333333.

Let me compute this:

Approximation:

0.997666667 / 1.002333333 ≈ (1 - 0.002333333) / (1 + 0.002333333)

We can use the approximation (1 - x)/(1 + x) ≈ (1 - 2x) when x is small.

So,

(1 - x)/(1 + x) ≈ 1 - 2x.

Here, x = 0.002333333.

So,

(1 - x)/(1 +x) ≈ 1 - 2*(0.002333333) = 1 - 0.004666666 ≈ 0.995333334.

So the square root of that is sqrt(0.995333334) ≈?

Well, sqrt(0.995333) is about 0.997663. Let me compute it more accurately.

Let me use the Taylor expansion for sqrt(1 - ε) ≈ 1 - ε/2 - ε²/8, where ε is small.

Wait, but 0.995333 = 1 - 0.004667.

So sqrt(1 - 0.004667) ≈ 1 - (0.004667)/2 - (0.004667)^2 / 8.

Calculate:

0.004667/2 ≈ 0.0023335

(0.004667)^2 = ~0.00002178, so divided by 8 is ~0.00000272.

So sqrt ≈ 1 - 0.0023335 - 0.00000272 ≈ 0.99766378.

So approximately 0.997664.

So,

T1 = T2 * 0.997664.

So T1 is slightly less than T2.

But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If Star_2 is moving away, the observed λ_max is longer than the emitted λ_max. So for Star_2, the observed peak is longer, which would imply a lower temperature than Star_1. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if Star_2's observed λ is same as Star_1's λ, but it's moving away, that implies that Star_2's emitted λ is shorter (since moving away makes the observed λ longer). So Star_2's emitted λ is shorter than Star_1's emitted λ, which would imply that T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, no, that's confusing. Let me think again.

For Star_2, moving away: so Doppler shift makes the observed λ longer. So observed λ is longer than emitted.

So, for Star_2:

λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c) approximation (since v is small). Wait, but earlier I used the exact formula with the square root, but perhaps for small velocities, it's approximately λ_obs ≈ λ_emit * (1 + v/c).

Wait, no. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c )

Where v_r is the radial velocity. If the star is moving away, v_r is positive, so λ_obs increases.

But wait, no, I think I'm mixing the relativistic Doppler shift with the non-relativistic approximation.

The exact formula for redshift z is λ_obs = λ_emit (1 + z), and z = v/c. Wait, no, that's when v is small, the approximation is z ≈ v/c. So for small velocities, the relativistic approximation simplifies to λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 + v/c).

But earlier I calculated the exact value using the sqrt formula.

So in this case, the exact formula gives a square root factor, but for small velocities, the approximation can be used.

But perhaps it's better to proceed with the exact calculation.

So, the ratio T1 / T2 is sqrt( (1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) )

Which is sqrt( (1 - 0.002333) / (1 + 0.002333) )

Which we computed as approximately 0.997664.

So T1 = T2 * 0.997664.

So T1 is about 0.997664 * T2.

So T1 is a little less than T2.

Wait, but this depends on the direction of Star_2's velocity. If Star_2 is moving away, then the observed λ is longer, meaning its emitted λ is shorter. So because emitted λ is shorter, that implies higher temperature. Because λ_emit = b / T, so lower λ means higher T. So if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted λ is shorter than what would be observed otherwise. So T2 would be higher than T1.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, T1 is 0.997664 T2. So T2 is higher.

Wait, that's correct.

So, Star_2 has a higher temperature than Star_1 because it's moving away, which makes its observed λ longer. But Star_1's emitted λ is same as the observed, so their temperatures would be T1 and T2, with T2 > T1.

Wait, but that's a bit counterintuitive, because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is longer (so T appears lower), but its actual T is higher because it's moving away. Because the observed λ is longer, implying lower T, but the actual T is higher.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of emitted vs observed.

Star_1: observed λ1 = emitted λ1.

Star_2: observed λ2 = emitted λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, earlier we found that observed λ2 is λ_emit2 multiplied by sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), because the star is moving away (positive v), which causes a redshift.

Wait, but the problem states that λ1_obs equals λ2_obs. So, λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which gave us T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which is T1 = T2 * sqrt(1 - 2(v/c) + ... )

So, T1 is slightly less than T2.

So, Star_2 is hotter than Star_1.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing because Star_2 is moving away, so its observed emission is redshifted, making it appear cooler than it actually is. So Star_2's actual temperature is higher, but when observed, it appears cooler because of the redshift.

So, going back to the problem. Now, we have R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

We can compute T1 in terms of T2.

But let me compute the exact value for the square root.

We can compute (1 - v/c) = (1 - 0.0023333) = 0.9976667

(1 + v/c) = 1.0023333

So the ratio is 0.9976667 / 1.0023333 ≈ 0.9953333.

The square root of 0.9953333 is approximately 0.997664.

So T1 = T2 * 0.997664.

So T1 is about 0.997664 times T2, or T2 is about 1.00234 times T1.

So T2 ≈ 1.00234 T1.

Wait, but since Star_1's observed λ is the same as Star_2's, the way we've set things up is that T2 is slightly higher than T1.

Wait, maybe I should write T1 in terms of T2.

Wait, no, the way we set it up is that T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So, T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) )

Which is T1 ≈ T2 * 0.997664.

So T1 is about 0.997664 T2.

So T2 = T1 / 0.997664 ≈ T1 * 1.00234.

So, Star_2 is a bit hotter.

Now, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 )

We have R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1² = 2.25 R2².

T1 = 0.997664 T2.

So T1^4 = (0.997664)^4 T2^4.

Let me compute (0.997664)^4.

First, 0.997664 is approximately 1 - 0.002336.

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 - 4x + 6x² - 4x^3 + x^4.

Here, x=0.002336.

So,

1 - 4*(0.002336) = 1 - 0.009344 = 0.990656.

But wait, that's for small x, so perhaps it's a good approximation.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 0.997664^4.

Alternatively, compute it step by step.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach, but since I'm just approximating, let me compute it as:

(0.997664)^2 = approximately 0.99533.

Then, (0.99533)^2 ≈ 0.99066.

So, (0.997664)^4 ≈ 0.99066.

So,

T1^4 ≈ 0.99066 T2^4.

So, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.99066) / (1) )

Wait, wait. Let me re-express:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4

So,

L1/L2 = (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= ( (1.5)^2 ) * ( (0.997664 T2 )^4 / T2^4 )

= 2.25 * (0.997664)^4

= 2.25 * 0.99066 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99066 ≈ 2.227.

Wait, 2.25 * 0.99066 is approximately 2.227.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: ~2.23.

But wait, let me check the precise calculation.

Wait, let's compute (0.997664)^4 more accurately.

0.997664^2 = ?

0.997664 * 0.997664.

Let me compute it:

Approximate 0.997664^2:

Compute 0.997664 * 0.997664.

It's (1 - 0.002336)^2 = 1 - 2*0.002336 + (0.002336)^2.

Which is 1 - 0.004672 + 0.00000545 ≈ 0.995333.

Then, (0.995333)^2 is (1 - 0.004667)^2 = 1 - 2*0.004667 + (0.004667)^2.

Which is 1 - 0.009334 + 0.00002178 ≈ 0.990687.

So, (0.997664)^4 ≈ 0.990687.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.990687 ≈ 2.227.

Which is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options:

Option D says ~2.23.

So the answer should be D.

But wait, let me double-check the Doppler shift approach.

Another approach: perhaps I should compute the actual T of each star.

But maybe I should think about the Doppler shift more carefully.

Wait, when Star_2 is moving away, the observed λ is longer than the emitted. So for Star_2, λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

We know that λ_obs for both stars is same, so λ1_emit = λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which gives λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (something greater than 1), meaning λ1_emit is longer than λ2_emit.

Wait, no, because if Star_2 is moving away, λ_obs is longer than λ_emit. So λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (something >1).

But λ1_obs = λ2_obs, which implies λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (something >1), so λ1_emit is longer than λ2_emit. Because λ1_emit = λ2_emit * Doppler factor.

So, λ1_emit > λ2_emit.

But λ_emit is inversely proportional to T, so λ1_emit > λ2_emit implies T1 < T2.

Which is what we found earlier. So T2 is higher than T1.

So, with that in mind, the calculation of L1/L2 being approx 2.23 holds.

Looking at the options:

Option D is ~2.23.

So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the luminosity ratio of the two stars, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity \( L \) of a star is proportional to its radius squared (\( R^2 \)) and its temperature to the fourth power (\( T^4 \)):  

\[
L \propto R^2 T^4
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radius Ratio**:  
   \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), so \( R_1^2 = (1.5)^2 R_2^2 = 2.25 R_2^2 \).

2. **Temperature Ratio**:  
   The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are the same for both stars. Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \), the intrinsic temperature \( T \) is related to the observed wavelength.  
   For Star_2, the radial velocity is \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), which introduces a Doppler shift. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
   \]
   Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) is the same for both stars, we equate their emitted wavelengths:  
   \[
   \lambda_{1, \text{emit}} = \lambda_{2, \text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
   \]
   Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T} \), we find:  
   \[
   T_1 = T_2 \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}
   \]
   With \( v/c = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333 \), the ratio becomes:  
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{0.997667}{1.002333}} \approx 0.997664
   \]
   Thus, \( T_1 \approx 0.997664 T_2 \), meaning \( T_2 \) is slightly higher than \( T_1 \).

3. **Luminosity Ratio**:  
   Substituting into the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]
   Using \( R_1^2 = 2.25 R_2^2 \) and \( T_1^4 = (0.997664 T_2)^4 \approx 0.99066 T_2^4 \):  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.99066 \approx 2.227
   \]

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2. The closest option is:

**Answer: D**
