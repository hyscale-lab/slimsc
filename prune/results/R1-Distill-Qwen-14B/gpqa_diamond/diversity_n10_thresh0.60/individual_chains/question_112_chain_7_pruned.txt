Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. So maybe I need to normalize this state first. But wait, the problem says it's proportional, which probably means I have to find the normalization factor. Oh right, because when you have a state like a|up> + b|down>, the normalization is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1. So I should calculate the normalization factor first.

So, let's compute the normalization. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). The modulus squared of each is |1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, and |2-i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So the total squared modulus is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Next, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator's matrix is given with elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i !=j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what's this operator's matrix look like? For a two-level system (since it's dealing with up and down, which are spin states), the matrix is 2x2. So the diagonal elements are zero (because when i=j, A_ij is zero), and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2.

So the matrix would be:
[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0 ]

Wait, what operator has this form? Oh, I think this is the Pauli X operator scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli matrices have 1s off-diagonal, but here it's ħ/2. Alternatively, the matrix is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli sigma x matrix.

The eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. Let me recall their forms. The eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Or wait, perhaps they are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|down> - |up>)/sqrt(2). Wait, let me think. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1. The eigenvectors for sigma_x: for eigenvalue +1, it's (1, 1)/sqrt(2), so (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). For -1, it's (1, -1)/sqrt(2), so (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> -
