Okay, so I have this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let me start by understanding the problem.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter than Planet_2's. That means Planet_1 is closer to its star because it's orbiting faster. Also, both have circular orbits, which is good because eccentricity can complicate things, but maybe it doesn't matter here.

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Hmm, same radius but different masses. So, maybe Planet_1's star is more massive but not larger in size. Wait, but more massive stars are typically larger. Oh wait, but the problem says both host stars have the same radii. So Planet_1's star is more massive but same size—so perhaps it's a subgiant or something? Or maybe the host is slightly evolved for Planet_2, which makes sense because the question says Planet_2's host is "slightly evolved." Oh, right, so Planet_1's host is less evolved, perhaps, since it's still main sequence but more massive.

Now, the question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the size of the orbit compared to the star's size. The formula I think is P = (R*/a) * (R_p/R*)^2, but wait, no. Wait, the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk, multiplied by the impact parameter factor. Or perhaps it's the geometric probability, which is (R_star + R_planet)/(a) but actually, the formula I think is (R* / a) * (some factor), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, the transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, intersects with the star's disk. So it's a geometric probability. The formula is usually given as:

P = (R_star + R_planet) / a

But since the planet's size is much smaller than the star's, R_planet is negligible compared to R_star. So it's approximately R_star / a.

Wait, no, wait
