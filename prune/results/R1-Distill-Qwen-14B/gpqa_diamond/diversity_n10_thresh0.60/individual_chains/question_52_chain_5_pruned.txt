Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500K. 

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

The transition between these two levels is at about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The options given are A to D, with various factors.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that in LTE, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)), where E is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait—since E is the energy difference, E = h * c / λ, right? Because the wavelength λ corresponds to the photon emitted during the transition. So E = hc/(λ). But wait, let me think: h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

Alternatively, since the energy difference between levels is given by E = hc / λ. So the ratio n1/n2 would be proportional to exp(-h c/(λ k T)).

Wait, but in the Boltzmann equation, it's (n2/n1) = g2/g1 * exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where g's are the statistical weights. Oh wait, but the question gives the ratio n1/n2, so it's (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)). Or wait, no—wait, the ratio would be (n_i/n_j) = (g_i/g_j) exp(- (E_i - E_j)/(k T)). So if level 1 is lower than level 2, then E_i - E_j is positive if i is higher. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact form, but I think the key point is that the ratio depends exponentially on temperature.

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower. So when the star has spots, the photosphere is cooler. So the ratio n1/n2 would be higher when the star is cooler because the exponential factor would be larger when T is smaller. Because when T is lower, the exponent -E/(k T) is more negative, so exp(-E/(k T)) is smaller—wait, wait. Let me think. Let me get this straight.

The energy difference between level 2 and level 1 is E = E2 - E1. So if E is positive, which it is, then when T
