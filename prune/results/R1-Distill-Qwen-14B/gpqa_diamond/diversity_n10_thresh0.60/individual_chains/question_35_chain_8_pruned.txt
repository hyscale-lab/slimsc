Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives me the operator Ay, which is equal to c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So, let me write down what S looks like.

S matrix:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So, Ay = c * S. Let me calculate what Ay is. Since c is h/(4π), Ay would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by S. So,

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Wait, that's the matrix form of Ay. The problem is asking about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this 2x2 matrix.

Eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue. Let's write that out.

So, the matrix Ay - aI would be:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0 - a , (h/(4π)) * (-i) ]
[ (h/(4π)) * i , (h/(4π)) * 0 - a ]

Which simplifies to:

[ -a , -i (h/(4π)) ]
[ i (h/(4π)) , -a ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) (i h/(4π)) ) ] = a² - [ (-i)(i) (h²/(16 π²)) ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So the determinant becomes a² - (1 * h²/(16 π²)) ) =0.

So, a² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ?

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that. Because h/(4π) is c, so sqrt( (c)^2 * (i*i term) )?

Wait, let me compute the term inside the determinant. The off-diagonal elements are (-i c) and (i c), right? So the product is (-i c)(i c) = (-i * i) c². Since i squared is -1, (-i * i )= (-(i^2))= -(-1)=1. So that product is c² * 1.

So determinant is a² - (c²) =0 → a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues a are plus and minus c, which is h/(4π). So a = ± h/(4π). 

Wait no, because c is h/(4π), so a is plus and minus c, which is h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

Now looking at the options. Option A says the imaginary
