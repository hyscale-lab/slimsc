Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's see. So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y to produce gas W, a precipitate G, and something B when heated. I need to figure out what Substance X is, and then calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in it.

Hmm, the problem says that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe X is a compound where one of the elements has an isotope that's heavier. For example, maybe it's something like H2O where one H is deuterium? Or maybe something like CH3OH where the carbon is a heavier isotope? Or perhaps X is something else.

The reaction is violent and releases gas W. W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, that's a key point. So the gas W must be a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Wait, but wait, the molecule as a whole has the same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, no—the question says the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons in total?

Wait, but the way it's phrased: the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. So total neutrons equal total protons in the molecule. So, for example, H2O has H (1p, 0n) and O (8p, 8n), so total protons would be 2+8=10, total neutrons 0+8=8. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe W is NH3? Let's see: N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (if it's 14N), and each H has 1. So each molecule has 7 (from N) + 3*(1) = 10 protons. Neutrons would be 7 (from N) +3*0=7. 10 protons vs 7 neutrons—not equal. Hmm.

Wait another idea: CO2. C is 6 protons, 6 neutrons (if it's 12C). O is 8 protons, 8 neutrons (16O). So each CO2 has 6+16*2= 38 protons. Neutrons
