Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to think through it.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with the parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the relationship is N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are various powers of r, like r squared, r cubed, etc.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d), but wait, in what units? Oh right, in parsecs. So d is in parsecs, and plx in arcseconds. So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx.

So if I have N proportional to 1/plx^5, I can substitute plx with 1/d. Let me write that out. N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Because plx is 1/d, so 1/plx is d. Wait, wait, let me be precise. plx = 1/d, so 1/plx = d. Then 1/plx^5 would be d^5, right? Because (1/plx) is d, so (1/plx)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait a second, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. But wait, when they say "how the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)", I think they're asking about the number of stars per unit distance, maybe the density or something. So perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r, and how that number scales with r.

Wait, in that case, the number of stars in a shell at distance r with thickness dr would be dN = something times r^something. Because the volume of a shell is 4πr² dr. But wait, in this case, the number of stars N is proportional to something else, so perhaps I need to express N as a function of r.

Wait, earlier I found that N ∝ d^5, but wait, d is the same as r, the distance. So N is proportional to r^5. But wait, the way the question is phrased, it's about the number of stars varying with parallax as 1/plx^5. So for a given region, perhaps it's a fixed solid angle or something, but the number counts in a certain way.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the number of stars in a given volume, but how does that relate to distance?

Wait, another approach: Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/(d). So if N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, substituting gives N ∝ d^5. So N increases as d^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's the differential, like dN/dr, the rate of change of number with distance.

If N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5 r^4. But wait, the options don't have 5, but options are about how the number changes, so maybe it's the dependence on r.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 = d^5. Therefore, N ∝ d^5, which is r^5, since d is the distance r.

So the number of stars in that region increases as r^5. But the question is, how does the number change with distance per unit range. So per unit distance, like how many more stars you get when you go a little further.

Wait, perhaps it's not the total number of stars, but the number density. Or maybe the number of stars per unit volume, but given that the region is the same in the sky (same solid angle), but at different distances.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the number of stars in a region as a function of distance. If you imagine looking in a certain direction and a certain volume, how does the star count scale. But perhaps when you're considering a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the surface area of the shell (4π r² dr) multiplied by the number density at that distance.

But if the number density (stars per volume) is proportional to r^5, then the number in the shell would be (r^5) * (4π r² dr) ), so that would be proportional to r^7 dr. But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's reevaluate.

The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So if parallax is plx, and N = k * (1/plx^5) = k * d^5.

But if we have N as the total number in a region, perhaps as a function of d, then the number of stars is proportional to d^5. So as d increases, N increases as d^5.

But the question is about the change with distance. So per unit distance, the change in N would be dN/dr = 5 k d^4. So the number of stars increases with d^4 per unit distance change. But wait, the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are about how the number of stars (in that region) changes with distance. So perhaps the correct approach is that N ∝ d^5, so for each unit increase in d, the number goes up by d^5. So the number increases as r^5. But the options have option B as ~ r^5.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is phrased: How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?

Ah, perhaps the question is asking for the differential, like the number of stars per unit distance. So dN/dr. If N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr ∝ 5 r^4. But none of the options are r^4 except option C is r^4. Wait, no, option C is r^4. So if that's the case, the answer would be ~ r^4, so option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because sometimes astronomers talk about counts in a volume. So if the number of stars is N = k * (1/plx)^5 = k d^5. But that's the total number in the region. But when you think about the number per unit distance, that's dN/dr. So N = k d^5, so dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4. Hence, the number increases as r^4 per unit distance. So the correct answer would be C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but earlier I thought the number of stars N is proportional to d^5. So why is the answer r^4?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me re-express it more clearly.

Given: N ∝ 1/plx^5.

We know that plx = 1/d, so 1/plx = d.

So substituting, N ∝ (d)^5.

So N = k d^5, where k is a proportionality constant.

Now, the question is how does the number of stars per unit range of distance (r) change with r? So per unit r, which is dr, the number of stars is dN/dr.

So dN/dr = 5k d^4.

So dN/dr ∝ r^4.

So the number of stars per unit distance (r) increases as r^4. So the answer is C) ~r^4.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the question is about the number of stars in a given volume, not per unit distance. Because when you look at a certain volume, the number of stars depends on the density and the volume.

But I'm not sure. The question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So as parallax decreases (because plx is 1/d), 1/plx^5 increases as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But if we're considering N as a function of distance, then for each increase in d, N increases by d^5. But the problem is asking how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps the point is that the number of stars in a region of the sky as a function of distance is N ∝ d^5. So the number per unit distance would be dN/dr = 5d^4, so ~ r^4.

So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but let me think about another approach. The number of stars in a volume is N = n * V, where n is the number density (stars per volume) and V is the volume.

If the volume is a sphere of radius r, V = (4/3) π r^3. But if the number of stars is proportional to d^5, then N = k d^5. Substituting d = r, N = k r^5. So N = k r^5 = n * (4/3 π r^3). So n = (N) / (4/3 π r^3) ) = (k r^5) / ( (4/3 π) r^3) ) )= (3 k / (4 π)) r^2. So number density n is proportional to r^2.

So that would mean that the number of stars per unit volume is proportional to r^2. So for a thin shell of thickness dr, the number of stars would be n * 4π r^2 dr = (r^2) * (4π r^2 dr) )= 4π r^4 dr. So the number of stars in that shell (per unit dr) is 4π r^4 dr, which is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars in each shell increases as r^4.

Wait, that also leads to the conclusion that the number of stars per unit distance (dr) is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer is C, ~r^4.

So I think the correct answer is C.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this into the relationship gives \( N \propto d^5 \). Thus, the total number of stars in the region increases as \( d^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This implies considering the differential change in the number of stars with respect to distance, \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Since \( N \propto d^5 \), differentiating gives \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

To confirm, consider the number of stars in a thin shell of radius \( r \) and thickness \( dr \). The number of stars in the shell is proportional to the number density (\( n \)) times the volume of the shell (\( 4\pi r^2 dr \)). If \( N \propto r^5 \), the number density \( n \) is proportional to \( r^2 \). Substituting \( n \propto r^2 \) into the shell volume gives the number of stars in the shell as \( \propto r^4 \), consistent with the earlier result.

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \), making the correct answer:

**Answer: C**
