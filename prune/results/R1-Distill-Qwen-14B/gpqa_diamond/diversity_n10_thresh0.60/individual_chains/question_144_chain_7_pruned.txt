Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a meson resonance called X. I need to find the mean decay distance. The given data are the production energy EX = 8 GeV, mass mX = 1.2 GeV, and width ΓX = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with some numbers in meters, so it's about calculating the mean decay length of this meson.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and its speed. The formula I think I need is the mean decay length L = γ * β * c * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is the velocity over c, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime.

First, I should find the proper lifetime τ. I recall that τ is related to the width Γ by the uncertainty principle. The relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, since Γ is given in MeV, I need to make sure all the units are compatible.

Wait, also, I remember that for a resonance, the width Γ is the total decay width, and it's related to the mean lifetime τ by τ = ħ / Γ. But I have to convert Γ into appropriate units. Let me think about the units here.

The Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So Γ is given in MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So ΓX = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Let me calculate that more precisely.

6.582 divided by 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 s. Okay.

But wait, that's the proper lifetime. The mean lifetime I'm using in the decay length formula is the proper lifetime, so that's correct.

Next, I need to find the velocity β and the Lorentz factor γ.

The particle's energy EX is 8 GeV, and its rest mass is mX = 1.2 GeV. So the total energy is E = γ m c², so γ = E / (m c²). Since E is given as 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.666... So γ ≈ 6.6667.

Now for β, the velocity. β = v/c, and since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), we can solve for β.

Alternatively, I know that γ = E/(m c²), and from that, I can find β. Let me see: E^2 = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So
