Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll do my best.

The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which I guess means that the EDTA is in its correct form, maybe deprotonated enough to complex with Ca²+ ions. The temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of Ca²+ ions.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a ligand that forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The formation constant, K, tells us how strong the complex is. A large K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

So the Ca-EDTA complex is probably CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−, and K is the formation constant for this.

Wait, but in solution, the EDTA exists in different protonated forms. Since the pH is ideal, I think it's given that the fraction of EDTA in its active form (Y^4−) is 1, so we don't have to worry about that. So, the concentration of Y^4− is the same as the concentration of EDTA added, or something like that.

But wait, the problem gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So, the concentration of CaY²− is 0.02 M. I think that's the initial concentration before considering dissociation.

Since K is the formation constant, which is K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

Wait, but if the solution is with the complex, then the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. But if the K is so large (5e10), the dissociation is minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA should be very low. 

Let me set
