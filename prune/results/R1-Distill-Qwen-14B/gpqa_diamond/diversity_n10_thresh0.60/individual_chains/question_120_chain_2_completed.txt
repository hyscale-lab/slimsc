Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution based on parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. 

The question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various inverse powers of plx.

Wait, what do I remember about parallax and star distribution? Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star caused by Earth's orbit around the Sun. The formula for distance in parsecs is 1 divided by parallax (d = 1/plx), right?

So, if stars are uniformly distributed, that means their spatial density doesn't depend on distance. So the number of stars in a given volume should be the same at all distances. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit parallax range changes with parallax. 

Let me think about volumes. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So as distance r increases, the volume increases with r cubed. But wait, each shell at a certain distance has a surface area proportional to r squared. So the number of stars in a thin shell would be proportional to r squared times the thickness of the shell.

Wait, but when we talk about parallax, plx = 1/d. So as plx decreases, d increases. So the shell volume depends on d³, which is (1/plx)³. But the number of stars in a shell depends on the volume and the density. Since the density is uniform, the number of stars in a shell should be proportional to the volume of that shell.

The shell's thickness is delta d, but how does that translate to delta plx? Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so delta plx is d squared times delta d. Because plx = 1/d, so delta plx ≈ (1/d²) delta d.

Wait, let me rephrase that. If plx = 1/d, then delta plx = - (1/d²) delta d. So the change in parallax is inversely proportional to the square of distance. So, delta d = -d² delta plx. Since we're dealing with positive ranges, I can ignore the negative sign.

So, the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness delta d is proportional to the surface area (4πd²) times delta d. So N ~ 4πd² * delta d.

But since delta d = d² delta plx, substituting that in: N ~ 4πd² * (d² delta plx) ) = 4π d^4 delta plx.

Wait, but d is 1/(plx), so substituting d = 1/plx gives d^4 = (1/plx)^4. So N ~ 4π (1/plx)^4 delta plx.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So the number of stars per delta plx would be N/(delta plx) ~ (1/plx^4) * delta plx / delta plx → 1/plx^4. But wait, that can't be right because another approach comes to mind.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the number density in terms of parallax. Let me think in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, the volume element in terms of plx would be a bit tricky.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars in a given plx interval (say, between plx and plx + dplx) is the number of stars per unit volume multiplied by the volume between those parallax values.

The volume at a certain distance is 4πd² * dd, where dd is a small change in distance. Since plx = 1/d, dd = -d² dplx. So the volume element is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Because d is 1/plx, so d squared is (1/plx)^2, and dd is d^2 dplx → (1/plx^2) dplx.

So the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx =4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Since the number of stars is density times volume, and assuming uniform density (n stars per unit volume), the number of stars in that plx interval is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number per unit plx interval (i.e., dplx=1) is proportional to 1/plx^4. That would imply that the number of stars per unit plx range decreases with plx to the power of -4. So the count goes down as plx increases, which makes sense because higher plx means closer stars, so fewer stars at each plx step.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because when plx is small (big d), the number of stars in a given plx interval (like between plx and plx + delta) would be fewer. Because each plx interval corresponds to a larger volume, but wait no, because the volume element in plx terms is 1/plx^4 dplx. So for a small plx, 1/plx^4 is large, so more stars in that plx interval. Wait, that seems contradictory.

Wait, no, when plx is small, it's a large distance. The number of stars in a given plx interval would depend on the volume of the shell. But wait, the number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to d squared times the thickness. Because the surface area is 4πd², and the thickness is delta d. So for a given delta d, the number of stars is higher at larger d because 4πd² is larger.

But when you express delta d in terms of delta plx, since plx is 1/d, delta d = (1/plx²) delta plx.

So the number of stars in a plx interval delta plx is: 4π (d)^2 * delta d = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) delta plx) = 4π (1/plx^4) delta plx.

So the number is proportional to 1/plx^4. Therefore, as plx increases (i.e., as d decreases), the number of stars per unit plx interval decreases as 1/plx^4.

But wait, the question is about how the number per unit plx range changes with plx. So the number is inversely proportional to plx^4, which would mean the count goes down as plx increases. So for each unit increase in plx, you have 1/(plx^4) stars. So the number per unit plx range is ~1/plx^4.

But looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. So that would be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me go through the steps again.

The volume element in terms of distance is 4π d² * delta d. For a thin shell, each shell has a volume of 4πd² delta d. So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to d² delta d.

But since plx = 1/d, delta d = (1/plx²) delta plx.

Substituting: d = 1/plx → d² = 1/plx^2. So substituting into number of stars:

N = k * d² delta d = k * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx² delta plx) ) → N = k * (1/plx^4) * delta plx.

Thus, per unit delta plx, the number is k/(plx^4) → which is 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx interval is inversely proportional to plx^4. So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the relationship between parallax, distance, and the distribution of stars. 

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance: 

\[
\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d}.
\]

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \(d\) with thickness \(\Delta d\) is proportional to the volume of the shell and the spatial density of stars. The volume of a thin shell is given by:

\[
\text{Volume} \propto 4\pi d^2 \Delta d.
\]

Since \(\Delta d = \frac{\Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2}\) (because \(\Delta d = -\frac{1}{d^2} \Delta \text{plx}\)), substituting \(d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}}\) into the volume expression gives:

\[
\text{Volume} \propto 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{\Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} \Delta \text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars in a shell with a small range of parallax \(\Delta \text{plx}\) is proportional to:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This means the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \(\text{plx}^{-4}\). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4.**
