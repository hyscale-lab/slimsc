Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars are observable by both.

First, let me read the question again. The key details are about the apparent V magnitudes each spectrograph can observe. ESPRESSO can handle stars brighter than 17 mag, so anything with V less than or equal to 17 would be detectable. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V ≤16. So the star needs to have an apparent magnitude ≤16 for HIRES and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, but since HIRES can only see brighter (smaller magnitude numbers), the star must be brighter than or equal to 16.5 for HIRES? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, that's a bit confusing. Let me clarify.

Wait, the statement is: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh wait, no. Wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So, "brighter than 17 mag" would be magnitude less than 17. So, ESPRESSO can observe stars down to V=17 or brighter (so magnitude <17). Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 1
