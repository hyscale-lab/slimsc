Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and really try to understand each part.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 3 degrees Celsius. 

Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, X has an isotope that's heavier than the usual.

The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within substance X. If there are multiple instances of an element, we sum the masses of all heavier and lighter isotopes. The options are A to D with numbers 25, 29, 31, 35.

Let me break this down. First, I think I need to figure out what substance X is. Since it's a reagent in organic chemistry, some common ones come to mind like KMnO4 or something else. Wait, but those have multiple elements. But wait, the reaction info may help.

The reaction with liquid Y: what liquids react violently? Maybe something like water? Let's see: if X is a metal, reacting violently with water. Or maybe a carbonate reacting with acid. But the product is a precipitate, which suggests a solid forming. But Y is a liquid, so maybe it's an acid or something else.

Wait, gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So the molecule's formula must satisfy protons = neutrons. So, possible molecules: H2O? No, H is 1, O is 8. Or maybe CH4? No, that's C (6) and H (1). Wait, wait, the molecule of gas W must have the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about hydrogen. Hydrogen has 1 proton. For the molecule to have same neutrons and protons, each atom would have to have equal number of n and p. Or wait, perhaps W is a diatomic molecule. Let's think: O2? Each O has 8 protons. So O2 would have 16 protons in total, and if each O has 8 neutrons in O-16, that's 16 neutrons. Wait, but O2 has two atoms, each with 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons would be 16 and total neutrons 16. So the total for the molecule would be equal. So maybe gas W is O2. Or maybe something else.

Alternatively, gas W could be CO2. But that's not a molecule where each atom has equal n and p. Let me see: CO2 has one C and two O's. C has 6 protons, O has 8. So for CO2, total protons would be 6 + 2*8=22, and total neutrons... Well, C has 6 neutrons (if it's C-12), each
