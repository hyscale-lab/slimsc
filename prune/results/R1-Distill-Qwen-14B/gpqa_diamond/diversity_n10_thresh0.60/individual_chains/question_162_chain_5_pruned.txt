Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2D metric because it's only in x and y. And the denominator is 4 minus (x² + y²), which suggests that this is some sort of space where the coordinates x and y are constrained such that x² + y² <4, right? Because otherwise the denominator becomes zero or negative, which might be problematic.

I remember that in GR, the area element can be found using the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric here is diagonal, so the determinant should be straightforward. The determinant for a diagonal metric diag(a, b) is a*b, so the area element dA would be sqrt(det g) dx dy.

Let me write down the metric components. The g_{xx} is 32/(4 - x² - y²), same with g_{yy}, since it's multiplied by dx² + dy². So the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]², right? Wait no, because the metric is diagonal, so for a 2D metric, the determinant is (g_xx)(g_yy) - (g_xy)^2. But since g_xy is zero here, it's just g_xx * g_yy. So det g = [32/(4 - r²)]^2, where r² = x² + y².

Wait no, because in this case, the metric is the same for both x and y, so g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So det g = [32/(4 - r²)]^2. Then the square root of that is 32/(4 - r²). So the area element is [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

But wait, for polar coordinates, dx dy is r dr dθ, right? So let me switch variables to polar coordinates for easier integration. So x² + y² = r², so x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So the area element dA = [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Now, to find the
