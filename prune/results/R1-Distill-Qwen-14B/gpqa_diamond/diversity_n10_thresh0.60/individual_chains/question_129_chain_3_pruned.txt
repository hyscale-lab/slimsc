Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are multiple steps, so I'll need to track each one carefully.

First, let me list out the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are some hints provided:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak at 1715 cm^-1.

Looking at the IR data: 1750 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which suggests that compound A is either an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But since it's reacting with HCN, which typically adds to carbonyl groups, I think A is probably a ketone or an aldehyde.

Wait, but HCN adds to carbonyls. Let me think about that. HCN adds to ketones to form cyanohydrins. So if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, HCN would add to it as well. But since the reaction forms a cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol with the cyanide group on the adjacent carbon.

Now, looking at the hints again. Hint a says that when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm. Wait, a phosphorous ylide is a Wittig reagent, right? The Wittig reaction typically forms alkenes by reacting with aldehydes or ketones. So if A is a carbonyl compound (like a ketone), reacting it with a Wittig reagent would give an alkene.

The product given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me try to visualize this structure. The main ring is cyclopentane. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group attached. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Wait, no, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? Or wait, the ylidene is a substituent with a double bond. Wait, propene has the structure CH2=CHCH3, so propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)= something?

Wait, maybe the structure is cyclopentane with substituents. Let me think: the product is 4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has a substituent at position 4. The substituent is a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would likely be CH2-C(=)CH2? Or is it CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? I'm getting a bit tangled here, but perhaps the key is that the product has a cyclopentane ring with a substituent that's an alkenyl group (like a double bond attached).

Wait, the ylidene groups are like CH2=CH- or something similar. So if the Wittig reagent is reacting with A, which is a ketone, then A must have a carbonyl group, and the Wittig would add an alkene.

Wait, the product after Wittig is an alkene. So if A is a cyclopentanone (a cyclic ketone), then the Wittig would form an alkene. So for example, if A is cyclopentanone, reacting with a Wittig reagent (like CH2=CH2Ph3P=CH2?) would form something like cyclopentene. But the product here is more complicated.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and an alkenyl group (propan-2-ylidene) at position 4.

So, let me sketch it out in my mind. The cyclopentane ring has substituents at 1, 2, and 4 positions. The substituents are methyl groups at 1 and 2, and at
