Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the concentration of that complex is 0.02 M. The problem gives me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and temperature is 25°C. I need to choose the correct concentration from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The formation constant (K) is a measure of how strong the complex is. A high K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

So, the Ca-EDTA complex is CaY^2-, where Y is the EDTA. The question is about the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

Wait, okay. The formula for the formation constant is K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). So, K is the ratio of the concentration of the complex to the product of the concentrations of the individual ions.

But wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M CaY^2-. So I can assume that initially, all the calcium and EDTA are tied up in the complex. But because K is so large (5e10), the dissociation of the complex into Ca²+ and EDTA is minimal. So, the concentrations of free Ca²+ and free EDTA are very low.

So, let's model this. The dissociation equation is:

CaY^2- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-

The formation constant K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, in solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, if x is the concentration of Ca²+ (which will be equal to the concentration of Y^4-, because each complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one Y^4-), then:

At equilibrium, [CaY^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 M because x is going to be very small due to the large K.

So, [CaY^2-] ≈ 0.02 M.

Then, K = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 5e10.

So, 0.02 / x² = 5e10.

Wait, let me write that equation again.

5e10 = (0.02) / (x^2)

So, solving for x^2:

x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 /5e10 = 4e-15.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So,

x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = 2/(5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13? Wait wait, wait a second.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So, 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13.

So, x² = 4e-13.

Taking the square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, because 6.5 *2=13. So, 2e-6.5 is approximately 2*3.16e-7, which is about 6.3e-7.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 4e-13 is 4 x10^-13. The square root of that is sqrt(4)=2, and sqrt(10^-13) is 10^-6.5. So, 2e-6.5 M.

10^-6 is 1e-6, which is 0.000001. 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That must be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my setup. The formation constant is K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). Since the complex is 0.02 M and the dissociation is x, both [Ca²+] and [EDTA] are x. So yes, the setup is correct.

Another way to think: since K is very large, the complex doesn't dissociate much, so x is very small compared to 0.02. So, the approximation [CaY^2-] ≈ 0.02 is valid.

So, the concentration of calcium ions is x, which is around 6.3e-7 M. That's option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex with a formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is given by:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Since the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex and the dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K \), we approximate \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and \([\text{Y}^{4-}]\) at equilibrium. Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
