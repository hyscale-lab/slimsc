Okay, so I have this question about the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal, but the angles between them are the same and not necessarily 90 degrees. The question says the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance... Oh right! That's the d-spacing. The formula for that in crystals depends on the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. The general formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is a bit tricky. Let me think.

Oh right, for a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is a special case where a = b = c, but the angles are all the same. The formula for d_{hkl} is given by (1/(d^2)) = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos γ)/(a²) (since in a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, so α=β=γ). Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the general formula for d-spacing which involves the reciprocal of the lattice parameters and the angles.

Wait, the general formula for the interplanar distance is:
d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk cos γ + hk cos β + il cos α)/(a²) ) )

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let me recall: In a rhombohedral system, since a = b = c = a_0, and the angles are all the same, the formula simplifies. The formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos θ )

where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors, which in this case is 30 degrees. Since the plane is (111), h = k = l = 1.

So plugging in h, k, l as 1, 1, 1. Then the numerator inside the sqrt becomes (1 + 1 + 1) - 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) * cos(30
