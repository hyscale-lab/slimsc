Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the intrinsic angular momentum operator Ay for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

So the problem says that Ay is equal to c times S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Oh wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices are similar to this. For a spin-1/2 particle, like an electron or muon, the spin matrices are (h/4π) times these Sx, Sy, Sz matrices.

Wait, but in this case, they're using S, so Ay = c * S. So, since c is h/(4π), that makes Ay equal to (h/(4π)) * S. So S is the spin matrix multiplied by 4π/h, I think. Because usually the spin matrices for spin-1/2 particles are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Wait, ħ is h/(2π), right? So S here would be similar to the Pauli matrices scaled by 2π/h or something.

Wait, let me clarify. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. For spin, the spin operator components are (ħ/2)σ, so S in this case seems to be the Pauli matrices divided by something. Or maybe not, because in this problem, they're defining S as the matrix with rows (0 -i) and (i 0). Oh, wait a second, that's the structure of the σy Pauli matrix. Let me check: σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So yeah, S in this problem is the σy matrix. So S = σy.

So then, Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * σy. So the matrix for Ay is:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

But wait, that's [ [0, -i*(h/(4π)) ], [ i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Wait, no, let me compute that. So each element is multiplied by c. So the first row is [0, -i * c], and the second row is [i * c, 0]. So c is h/(4π), so each element is multiplied by that.

But to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I might as well compute the eigenvalues of S first since the operator is a scalar multiple of S. Because if I have a matrix M and a scalar k, then the eigenvalues of k*M are k times the eigenvalues of M.

So the eigenvalues of S (which is σy) are ±1, since the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Wait, no. Wait, σy is a Hermitian matrix, so its eigenvalues are real. Let me find them.

The eigenvalues of S are found by solving det(S - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant of [ -λ, -i ]
                    [ i , -λ ]

Which is ( -λ )( -λ ) - ( -i )(i ) = λ² - (i^2 * (i*-i) ? Wait, no, let's compute it correctly. The determinant is ( (-λ)*(-λ) ) - ( (-i)*(i) ) = λ² - ( (-i)*(i) ). What's (-i)*(i)? That's (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is λ² - 1. Setting this equal to zero gives λ² =1, so λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues of S are 1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay must be c * 1 and c * (-1), because Ay is c*S. So c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real. Because S is Hermitian, so Ay is also Hermitian since it's a real multiple of a Hermitian matrix. So the eigenvalues are real. So any option suggesting they have an imaginary part is wrong.

Wait, but option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1, which also can't be right because eigenvalues are real. Wait, no—if the eigenvalues are real, then their imaginary parts are zero. So options A and B are wrong because they suggest non-zero imaginary parts. So the correct eigenvalues must be real, which would imply that the options C and D might be correct.

Wait, but let's double-check. Let me recompute the eigenvalues of S. The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i,0]], which is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix. Its eigenvalues are ±1, as I found earlier. So Ay = c * S has eigenvalues ±c, which are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are incorrect because they have non-zero imaginary parts.

So that leaves options C and D.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Well, A is the operator for the Y-component, and A² is the square of the angular momentum. Since A² would correspond to S² scaled by c², and in quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of the total angular momentum squared (like S^2) are the same as the eigenfunctions of each component because they commute. So if the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², then what about Az? Well, in spin systems, the eigenfunctions of one component (say, Ay) are not eigenfunctions of another component (like Az), because the components don't commute. So option C says they can be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not of Az, which makes sense. So C could be correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm, the basis functions of a matrix operator are the eigenvectors, but for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis, but only if the operator is diagonalizable, which it is here because it has two distinct eigenvalues (1 and -1 for S, so c and -c for Ay). So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis. So D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay, which is correct. Wait, but in this context, the basis functions of the matrix operator are the eigenvectors, so yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but both options C and D could be correct? Or am I missing something.

Wait, option D: 'The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.' So the matrix operator is 2x2, so its eigenvectors form a basis, which they do. So D is correct.

But option C is about whether the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A². Since A² is (c S)^2 = c² S². What's S²? S is a spin-1/2 operator, so S² = (σy)^2 times (something). Wait, no, S is the Pauli matrix, which for spin-1/2, S² is identity. Because the Pauli matrices satisfy σx² = σy² = σz² = I. So S² is I, so A^2 is c² I. So any function that is an eigenfunction of Ay is automatically an eigenfunction of A², because A² is a multiple of the identity matrix. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A² (with eigenvalue c² * I, but for any vector, it's c² times the vector). So for any φ, A² φ = c² φ. So yes, option C is correct.

Wait, so both C and D could be correct? Let me look at the options again.

Wait, the question is during the calculation, which statement is correct.

So the options are:

A) complex eigenvalues (incorrect)

B) same, but also complex (incorrect)

C) eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

D) eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

Well, both C and D seem correct, but let's see.

Wait, what about D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, it's a linear operator on a 2D space, so the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So maybe both C and D are correct. Wait, but let me re-read the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, because A² commutes with all components, so the eigenfunctions of any component are eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Which means that the eigenvectors form a basis for the space on which the operator acts. Since S (and thus Ay) is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors are two and form a basis for C². So D is correct.

Wait, but the question gives four options, and I have to choose which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me double-check:

So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its eigenvalues are ±1. So Ay has eigenvalues ±c, where c = h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. So options A and B are wrong because they suggest non-zero imaginary parts.

So the eigenfunctions of Ay are the eigenvectors of S, scaled by c. These eigenvectors form a basis for the matrix. So D is correct.

But also, since A² is c² S², and since S² is I (because S is σy, and σy² = I), A² is c² I. So any vector is an eigenfunction of A², with eigenvalue c². So eigenvectors of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. So option C is correct.

Wait, but Az is another component of the angular momentum. For a spin-1/2 system, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az because [Ay, Az] ≠ 0. So option C is correct as well.

Hmm, so both options C and D are correct. But the question is a multiple-choice with four options, and I need to pick the correct one. But perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

So the eigenfunction is an eigenfunction of both Ay and A², but not of Az. Which is correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Which is also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D space.

So both C and D seem correct. But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct, so both might be correct, but perhaps only one of the options is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that D is correct. Let me re-examine the statement in D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Wait, the matrix operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix. The basis functions would typically refer to the basis vectors for the space on which the operator acts. The eigenvectors of Ay are the basis functions, as they form a basis for the vector space. So D is correct.

But then both C and D are correct. But looking back at the question, I must have made a mistake because the given options are mutually exclusive.

Wait, perhaps the eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az, but can they be eigenfunctions of A²?

Yes, because A² is the square of the angular momentum, which is the same as S² times c². Since S² is the identity matrix, A² is c² I. So any vector is an eigenfunction of A², so the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So option C is correct.

So both C and D are correct statements. But wait, in the options, perhaps only one is correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is during the calculation, which statement is correct. So perhaps I need to evaluate which of the options is a correct statement based on the problem setup.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Which is correct because the matrix operator is 2x2, so its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

So perhaps both C and D are correct statements. But the options are to choose one, so perhaps I missed something.

Wait, looking back, the problem states that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of this matrix. That's correct because the matrix operates on a 2D space, and its eigenvectors form a basis for that space. So D is correct.

But then, why is option C correct? Because the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A². So perhaps both C and D are correct. But the options are presented as A, B, C, D, so perhaps the correct answer is either C or D.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial evaluation. Let me re-examine the question. The operator Ay is 2x2, so any eigenvector of it is a vector in a 2D space. The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which has eigenvalues ±1. So the corresponding eigenvectors would be orthogonal.

So for eigenvalue +1, the eigenvector would satisfy S|ψ+> = |ψ+>. Let me find it.

The eigenvectors for S:

For λ=1: (S - I)|v> = 0.

So matrix becomes [[-1, -i], [i, -1]].

The equations are:

- v1 - i v2 = 0 → v1 = i v2.

So the eigenvector can be written as [i v2, v2]^T. So choosing v2=1, the eigenvector is [i, 1]^T. But we can normalize it as needed, but for eigenfunctions, the phase doesn't matter.

Similarly, for λ=-1, the eigenvector would be [i v2, v2]^T? Wait, no. Let me re-calculate.

For λ=-1: (S - (-1)I) = S + I = [[1, -i], [i, 1]].

Equation: v1 + (-i) v2 = 0 and i v2 + v1 = 0.

Wait, perhaps I should solve S|v> = -|v>.

So (0 -i; i 0) [v1; v2] = [-v1; -v2].

So:

- i v2 = -v1 → v1 = i v2.

i v1 = -v2 → i (i v2) = -v2 → i^2 v2 = -v2 → -v2 = -v2 → 0=0. So any vector where v1 = i v2 is an eigenvector with eigenvalue -1.

Wait, that can't be right because I thought the eigenvalues were ±1 for S. Let me double-check. Oh wait, when I did the determinant earlier, I got λ^2 =1, so λ=1 and λ=-1. So for λ=1: v1 = i v2.

So the eigenvectors are [i, 1] for λ=1 and [i, 1] for λ=-1? Wait, that can't be right. Because if I plug S into [i,1], I get:

S * [i; 1] = [ (0)(i) + (-i)(1) ; (i)(i) + 0*(1) ] = [ -i ; (-1) ]

Wait, [ -i, -1 ] is not the same as λ=1 times [i, 1], which would be [i,1]. So I must have made a mistake in finding the eigenvectors.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's set up the equations for S |v> = λ |v>.

For λ=1:

Row 1: 0*v1 -i v2 = v1 → -i v2 = v1.

Row 2: i v1 + 0*v2 = v2 → i v1 = v2.

Substituting v1 = -i v2 from row 1 into row 2: i*(-i v2) = v2 → (i*(-i)) v2 = v2 → (1) v2 = v2. So any v2 is allowed. So the eigenvector for λ=1 is [ -i v2, v2 ]^T. So for v2=1, it's [-i, 1]^T.

Similarly, for λ=-1:

Row 1: 0*v1 -i v2 = -v1 → -i v2 = -v1 → v1 = i v2.

Row 2: i v1 + 0*v2 = -v2 → i v1 = -v2.

Substituting v1 = i v2 into row 2: i*(i v2) = -v2 → (i^2) v2 = -v2 → (-1) v2 = -v2 → 0=0.

So the eigenvector for λ=-1 is [i v2, v2]^T. So with v2=1, it's [i, 1]^T.

So the eigenvectors are [-i,1] for λ=1 and [i,1] for λ=-1.

Wait, let's check S multiplied by [-i,1]:

S * [-i; 1] → [ (0)(-i) + (-i)(1) ] = -i → which is (1)(-i) → correct.

Second component: (i)(-i) + 0*(1) → i*(-i)=1 → which is (1)(1) → correct.

Yes, that's right.

Similarly, S multiplied by [i,1] → first component: (0)(i) + (-i)(1) = -i → which is (-1)(i) = -i → correct.

Second component: i*(i) + 0*1 = i² = -1 → which is (-1)(1) = -1 → correct.

So the eigenfunctions are [-i,1]^T and [i, 1]^T, multiplied by normalization constants.

Now, what about A²? A² = (c S)^2 = c² S². Since S is σy, S² = σy^2 = I, because Pauli matrices square to identity. So S² = I, so A² = c² I.

So when you act A² on any vector, it's c² times that vector. So any vector is an eigenfunction of A² with eigenvalue c². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So option C is correct.

So option C is correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² (since A² is a multiple of the identity matrix), and they are not eigenfunctions of Az (since [Ay, Az] ≠ 0, so they don't share eigenfunctions).

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, its eigenvectors form an orthogonal basis, so D is correct.

Wait, but how can both C and D be correct? Let me look at the options again. The question says, which statement is correct. So perhaps both are correct, but maybe only one of the options is presented as correct.

Wait, the problem is from a multiple-choice question, so only one option can be correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering option D. The statement says, "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So the matrix operator is 2x2, and its eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

But I'm getting two options as correct, which isn't possible in a standard multiple-choice. So perhaps I made an error in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the process during calculation. Let me think: when you're looking for eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. I think that's correct because the matrix has a basis of eigenvectors.

But wait, the question is about whether during the calculation, which statement is correct. So perhaps D is correct because the matrix is diagonalizable, and the eigenvectors form the basis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the given options again.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az. Which is correct because A² commutes with all components, so any eigenfunction of Ay is an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Which is correct because the matrix is 2x2, and its eigenvectors form a basis.

So both seem correct, but perhaps the question is testing a different concept.

Wait, another approach. The problem mentions that the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. The matrix is 2x2, so it has two eigenvalues, ±c. The eigenvectors are orthogonal.

Now, for the eigenfunctions of Ay, can they also be eigenfunctions of A^2? Yes, because A² is a multiple of identity. So any vector is an eigenfunction of A². So C is correct.

And the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

Hmm, but the options are mutually exclusive, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement again. The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is σy. So Ay = (h/(4π)) σy.

The eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) and -(h/(4π)), both real.

So D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

C is correct because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A².

So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options provided don't allow for that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the operator Ay, and the matrix is 2x2, so the statement in D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis. So the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, the options are:

C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So both seem correct, but perhaps the correct answer is C because the question is about what is correct during the calculation. D is a general statement about the relationship between the operator and its eigenfunctions, while C is about the relationship with other components.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps D is correct because when you calculate the eigenvectors, they form a basis.

But I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because it's a true statement about the eigenfunctions' properties, while D is more of a definitional statement which is correct but less related to the calculation process.

Wait, going back to the options, the correct answer according to the problem's context is likely option C because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options again. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, you find that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions (option D). Or perhaps you find that the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A² (option C).

Wait, I'm a bit stuck, but I think option C is correct because it's a true statement about the eigenfunctions. The eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So after all that, I think the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The matrix \( S \) is Hermitian, and its eigenvalues are determined by solving \( \det(S - \lambda I) = 0 \). The characteristic equation is:

\[
\det\begin{bmatrix} -\lambda & -i \\ i & -\lambda \end{bmatrix} = \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \). Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are:

\[
\pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

These eigenvalues are real, so any option suggesting non-zero imaginary parts (e.g., options A and B) is incorrect.

---

### Step 2: Eigenvectors of \( A_y \)
The eigenvectors of \( S \) (and hence \( A_y \)) are found by solving \( (S - \lambda I)|\psi\rangle = 0 \) for each eigenvalue. For \( \lambda = 1 \), the eigenvector is proportional to \( [-i, 1]^T \), and for \( \lambda = -1 \), it is proportional to \( [i, 1]^T \). These eigenvectors form a basis for the \( 2 \)-dimensional space, confirming that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Thus, **option D is correct**.

---

### Step 3: Relationship with \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \)
The square of the angular momentum operator \( A^2 \) is proportional to the identity matrix because \( S^2 = I \) (a property of Pauli matrices). Therefore, \( A^2 = c^2 I \), and any vector is an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \) with eigenvalue \( c^2 \). This means the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \), as the components of angular momentum do not commute. Thus, **option C is correct**.

---

### Step 4: Resolving the Ambiguity
Both options C and D are correct based on the analysis. However, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. While D is a general statement about the eigenvectors forming a basis, C highlights a specific property of the eigenfunctions in relation to \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \). Since the problem emphasizes the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), **option C is the most relevant and correct answer**.

---

**Answer: C**
