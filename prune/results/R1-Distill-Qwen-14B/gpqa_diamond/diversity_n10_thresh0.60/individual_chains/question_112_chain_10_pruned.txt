Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me take it step by step.

Okay, the problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, first things first, I think I should normalize this state because when you're dealing with probabilities, the state vector needs to have a length of 1. Without normalization, the probabilities might not add up to 1, which is a must.

So, to normalize, I need to calculate the inner product of |alpha> with itself. The state is given as (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, so the coefficients are (1+i) and (2 - i). The inner product would be the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each coefficient.

Hmm, the magnitude of a complex number a + bi is sqrt(a² + b²), so the square would be (a² + b²). So for (1+i), the magnitude squared is (1² + 1²) = 2. For (2-i), it's (2² + (-1)²) = 4 +1 =5. Adding these, 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because the state is proportional to that. So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but wait, the question says |alpha> is proportional to that, so I think I can proceed by letting |alpha> be that normalized state. Because when we calculate probabilities, the proportionality constant will matter for normalization.

Moving on, the question asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. So I need to figure out what the eigenstates of this operator are because the probabilities are based on the projections of |alpha> onto these eigenstates.

Wait, the operator's matrix is zero on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. That's a 2x2 matrix, since it's operating on spin states (up and down). So the matrix looks like:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Hmm, that's an interesting matrix. I'm trying to remember what kind of operator this is. Oh, wait, this looks like the Pauli X operator multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So our operator A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as those of the Pauli X, since it's just a scalar multiple. The eigenvalues of Pauli X are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A would be +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The eigenstates of Pauli X are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. Specifically, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), or something like that. Wait, I might have the signs wrong; I think in some conventions it's (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for |+x> and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for |-x>, but I should double-check that. Alternatively, the exact form might not matter because I can work with the projection of |alpha> onto these states.

So, to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A, which are |+x> and |-x>. The probability of measuring +hbar/2 is the square of the amplitude of |+x> in |alpha>, and similarly for the other eigenstate.

So first, let's find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way. Another approach is
