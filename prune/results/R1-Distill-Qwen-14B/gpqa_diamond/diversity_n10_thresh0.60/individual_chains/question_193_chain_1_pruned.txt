Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let's read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5.

Wait, parallax. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/distance, but wait, actually it's plx in arcseconds equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So if the distance r increases, the parallax plx decreases.

So the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. Let's denote r as the distance. So plx = 1/r. But wait, not exactly, because units matter. Parallax plx is in arcseconds, and the distance r is usually in parsecs. So plx (in arcseconds) equals 1/(r in parsecs). So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Let's substitute plx with 1/r. So N ‚àù 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that exponent. 1/( (1/r)^5 ) equals r^5, right? Because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, and 1 divided by that is r^5.

Wait, but that's just N proportional to r^5. So
