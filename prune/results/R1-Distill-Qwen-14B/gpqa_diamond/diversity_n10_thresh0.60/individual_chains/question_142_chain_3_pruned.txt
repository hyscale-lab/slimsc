Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that the density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. But how does that translate to a position in space?

I think for a single qubit, the space is three-dimensional, right? Because the Bloch sphere is a 2-sphere embedded in 3D space. Each point on the Bloch sphere corresponds to a pure state, and mixed states are points inside the sphere.

But wait, this ρ is a mixed state because it's an equal mixture of |0> and |1>. So the density matrix is a statistical mixture, not a pure state. So its representation wouldn't be on the surface of the Bloch sphere but somewhere inside.

The question is asking about the geometrical position. I remember that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a vector in 3D space. The vector components are the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. So, the vector r is given by (x, y, z), where each component is the expectation value of σ_x, σ_y, σ_z respectively.

Wait, the general form for a single qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices. So if I can express the given ρ in terms of I and the Pauli matrices, I can
