Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's see what the question says. Oh right, a light beam is going through glass with index n, and the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the lab frame.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on how this works. I remember that when dealing with light in moving media, it's a bit tricky because of relativity and the properties of the medium. Oh wait, I think the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties and the frame of reference. 

So, normally, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, right? Like, if the medium is stationary, the light's speed is c divided by the refractive index n. But in this case, the glass is moving. So does the motion of the glass affect the speed of light as observed in the lab?

I recall that for objects moving through space, the speed of light doesn't just add the medium's velocity. Because of relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, here the glass is moving, which is a medium. So perhaps the velocity of the medium affects how the light propagates.

Another thought: maybe this problem is about classical addition of velocities, but I'm not sure. Wait, classical mechanics would say that speeds add up, but relativity says that's not the case for light. Oh wait, but the medium itself is moving. So in the lab frame, the glass is
