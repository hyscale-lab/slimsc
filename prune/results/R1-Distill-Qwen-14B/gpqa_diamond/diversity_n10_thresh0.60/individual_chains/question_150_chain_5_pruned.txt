Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and try to think it through.

The problem is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, then determining the product after a series of reactions. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation first because that might help me figure out the structure.

The formula is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, X=0 (no halogens), N=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Five is quite a few, so maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 3) and then maybe a double bond and a ring? Or maybe an aromatic ring plus some other structures.

Looking at the NMR data:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): A triplet at around 9.72. That's a pretty high ppm. Maybe an aldehyde proton? Because aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes aromatic protons can be that high, but usually they are lower. Or maybe an acidic proton, like an -OH or something else. But the triplet suggests coupling with two other protons. Hmm, another possibility is an enal (alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde), where the aldehyde proton is split into a triplet by coupling with the adjacent double bond protons. Wait, but in that case, it's usually a doublet because the aldehyde H couples with two equivalent protons. Wait, no, if it's a trans coupling, maybe it's a quartet? Or maybe it's a different situation. I'm a bit confused here.

Then there's a 6.98 ppm doublet (2H), and 6.51 ppm doublet (2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest coupling between adjacent protons. So maybe two sets of doublets for a di-substituted benzene where
