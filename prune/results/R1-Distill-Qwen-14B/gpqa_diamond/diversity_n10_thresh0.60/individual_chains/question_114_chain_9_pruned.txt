Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which is treated with reagent B in water, to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A to D, each pairing A and B with different reagents.

Hmm, okay. Let me start with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. When ketones react with CN- (from NaCN), that's a nucleophilic addition. Normally, for the addition of HCN or CN-, you'd need some acid catalysis. Wait, but wait, in the presence of an acid, the carbonyl becomes more electrophilic. So in the first reaction, maybe A is an acid. But what kind?

Wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So butan-2-one plus NaCN and A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If we add CN here, the CN would add to the carbonyl carbon. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, no. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see the structure: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the hydroxy is on the same carbon as the methyl groups. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? No, wait. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is four carbons, with nitrile at the end. Wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be CH(CH3)(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? I'm a
