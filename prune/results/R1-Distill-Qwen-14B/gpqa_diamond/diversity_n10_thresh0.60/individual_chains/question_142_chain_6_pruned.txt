Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (not a pure state). So, for a qubit, a pure state would be a density matrix like |ψ><ψ|, but this looks different.

Hmm, wait. So the given ρ is an equal mixture of |0> and |1>. So it's like a completely mixed state. I think for a qubit, the space is represented in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector represents the state, with the origin being the completely mixed state. Wait, no—wait, the Bloch sphere is for pure states, right? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the Bloch vector describes a pure state. The density matrix for a pure state can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So if that's the case, then for a mixed state, the density matrix would be a convex combination of projectors.

Wait, the density matrix given is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Each term is a projector for |0> and |1>, each with 50% probability. So this is a completely mixed state for a single qubit. Because it's a maximally mixed state, its Bloch vector should be zero. Because in the Bloch sphere, the origin is the completely mixed state, I think. Or wait, no—wait, the Bloch sphere is for pure states. The completely mixed state is the maximally mixed state, which would correspond to the density matrix I/2, right?

Wait, another approach: the density matrix for the completely mixed state (maximally mixed) is (I + 0)/2, so r is (0,0,0). Because the density matrix ρ is (I + r·σ)/2, so if r is zero, ρ = I/2. Let me check: I is the identity matrix for a qubit, which is 2x2. So I/2 is [[0.5, 0],[0, 0.5]],
