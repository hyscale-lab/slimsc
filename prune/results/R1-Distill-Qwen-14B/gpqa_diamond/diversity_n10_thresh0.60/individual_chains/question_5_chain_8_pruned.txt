Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Right, I remember that for angular momentum operators, each component has specific matrix representations.

So, the eigenvector we're looking for is an eigenstate of P·n, where n is in the x-z plane. Since n is arbitrary, the eigenvector should be expressed in terms of the angles theta and phi. Oh wait, but wait. The direction n is in the x-z plane, which means the y-component of n is zero. So the direction vector would be something like (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but since it's in x-z, maybe φ is zero? Or perhaps not exactly, but since n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the angle phi can be any value because it's in that plane. Hmm, no, wait. If it's in the x-z plane, then the direction vector should have no y-component. So maybe phi is zero, or perhaps phi is some angle but the y-component is zero. Wait, no, direction vectors in the x-z plane would have the y-component zero. So the general direction would be (x, 0, z), which can be represented using polar coordinates with theta measured from the z-axis and phi being zero, perhaps? Or maybe phi is another angle, but in the x-z plane, the direction is determined by theta and phi, but the y-component is zero. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the direction is (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ), but that can't be right because in x-z, maybe it's (cosθ, 0, sinθ) or something else. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of spherical coordinates. The direction vector n has components (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since the problem states that n lies in the x-z plane, the y-component must be zero. So sinθ sinφ must be zero. That implies either
