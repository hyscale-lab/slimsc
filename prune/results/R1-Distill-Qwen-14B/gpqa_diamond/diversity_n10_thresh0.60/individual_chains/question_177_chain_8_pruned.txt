Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem gives me some information, and I need to compute by how much the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2.

Alright, let's break down the given data. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So, M1 = 1.5 * M2. Interesting, so both mass and radius are 50% larger for Star_1.

Then, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So, if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same because the constant b is the same for all objects. So, T1 = T2. That makes sense; they emit their peak at the same wavelength, so same temperature.

Wait, but wait. The question also mentions that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight, which causes a Doppler shift in the light we observe. So, if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted; moving away, redshifted. But since Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, its light isn't Doppler shifted. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, but how does that affect the observed wavelength?

Wait, the problem says they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. Oh, right, so when calculating the peak emission, the observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler shift. So, the actual temperature might be different because of the velocity, but the observed peak wavelength is the same. Oh, so we have to account for that.

Wait no, wait. The observed wavelength is the same. So the stars' rest frames might have different temperatures, but after accounting for their velocities, the observed λ_max is same. So,
