Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the luminosities of two stars. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

Alright, so the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, which probably relates to their temperatures. Then, the radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They want to find out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming black body radiation.

Hmm, so first, I think I should recall the formula for luminosity of a star. Luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but the problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength λ_max is related to the temperature by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, but wait, Star_1 and Star_2 have the same λ_max. So T1 = T2. So their temperatures are equal?

Wait, but then you have to think about how their luminosities compare. Since L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is the same, then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

But since T1 = T2, (T1/T2)^4 is 1, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. Given R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 would be 2.25 times L2. So the answer would be option A) ~2.25.

Wait, but wait a minute. The question also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect anything?

Hmm, radial velocity relates to
