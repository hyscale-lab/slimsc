Okay, I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me see, the question gives me each star's details, including their magnitudes and distances, and some information about the telescopes.

So, from what I remember, apparent magnitude is how bright a star appears from Earth. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES can observe stars up to a certain V magnitude. ESPRESSO can go up to 17 mag, and HIRES up to 16 mag. So a star must have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16 to be seen by both. Wait, no. Wait, the question says that for ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Hmm, wait, no, actually, wait, it's the other way around. Magnitudes are a bit tricky because lower numbers are brighter. So a star with a lower magnitude is brighter.

Wait, the problem says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Oh wait, no, wait. The way it's phrased is: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So if a star's V magnitude is less than 17, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can observe it. Because in astronomy, lower magnitude means brighter. So, for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17, so ESPRESSO can observe it. HIRES can
