Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what does regularization mean in this context? I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like when calculations give infinite results. These divergences are a problem because they don't make physical sense, so regularization helps to make these infinities manageable, maybe by introducing a cutoff or something.

So, the idea is that some theories naturally don't have these divergences or don't require regularization because they're already finite. Which theory is that?

Let me go through each option:

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think superstring theory is a type of string theory, which is a quantum theory of gravity. I remember that in string theory, the basic idea is that particles are not point-like but are instead tiny strings. Because of this, maybe the theory doesn't have the same kinds of divergences as other quantum field theories. Or perhaps it handles them differently without needing as much regularization. But I'm not entirely sure.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I know that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, which means that quarks behave more freely at high energies (or short distances). But wait, because of this, QCD calculations at high energies might not diverge as much as other theories. Wait, no, but regularization is often used in loop calculations in QCD. Or does it? Alternatively, perhaps QCD is a non-Abelian gauge theory, which might have some nice properties, but I think it still requires regularization because of potential divergences. Maybe not? I'm a bit confused here.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, electrons, and photons. I know that QED is a well-tested theory, and it does require regularization. In fact, the process of renormalization in QED involves dealing with divergent loop integrals. So QED definitely needs regularization because of its divergences. So option C probably isn't the correct answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. This is the non-quantum version, like
