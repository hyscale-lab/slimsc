Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one by approximating the matrix exponential function with a fractional approximation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that matrix exponential functions often come up in solutions involving systems of linear differential equations. Finite difference methods discretize the equations, leading to large systems that can be represented as matrices. Solving these using matrix exponentials is a way to model the system's evolution over time.

Now, when moving from sequential to parallel algorithms, efficiency and computational structure matter. Parallel splitting probably refers to methods like domain decomposition or time splitting, where the problem is divided into smaller parts that can be solved concurrently.

The question mentions using a fractional approximation for the matrix exponential. Fractional approximations usually mean that instead of the exact exponential, a lower-order fraction (like a Pade approximant or a rational function) is used to approximate it. These approximations can make computations faster, especially on parallel architectures because they might break down the problem into more manageable, independent parts.

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: That's important for ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up, but I'm not sure how directly it affects converting to a parallel algorithm. It's more about the method's correctness than its parallelizability.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal boundary conditions can complicate things, but how does that tie into parallelism? Maybe if the conditions involve information from other regions, it could affect how you split the problem, but I'm not certain.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Hmm, fractional approximations as rational functions might have poles and zeros. If the roots are complex, that might affect the stability or how the approximation behaves. But wait, in the context of parallelism, maybe having certain root structures allows the approximation to be decomposed into parts that can be handled in parallel. Like, if the approximation can be expressed as a product or sum of simpler functions with independent computations.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Linear partial fractions are a way to decompose rational functions into simpler terms. If the fractional approximation can be broken down this way, it might allow each term to be computed independently, which fits well with parallel processing. For example, if each term in the partial fraction corresponds to a different subdomain or time slice, you could compute them in parallel and then combine the results.

So, the key factor here is probably the structure of the approximation that allows for parallel decomposition. Between C and D, which is more about the roots and which about the linear partial fractions.

Wait, the question is about the key factor for converting the algorithm to parallel. If the approximation can be expressed as a sum of terms that don't interfere with each other (like via partial fractions), each term can be evaluated in parallel. So, if the approximation allows for such a decomposition, that's the key.

So, option D suggests that the fractional approximation can be expressed as a linear combination of partial fractions. That would make it possible to split the computation into parallel tasks. Each partial fraction term can be computed separately, and then summed up. So D seems to fit.

Alternatively, complex roots (option C) might imply
