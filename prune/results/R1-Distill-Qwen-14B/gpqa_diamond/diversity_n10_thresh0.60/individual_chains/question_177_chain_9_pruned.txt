Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, and the radial velocities are given: Star_1 is 0 km/s and Star_2 is 700 km/s. We need to find by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, what determines the luminosity of a star? Luminosity for a star that emits as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But wait, the problem says they found the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

Wait a second, but wait. There's also the Doppler effect due to their velocities. Oh right, because if a star is moving towards or away from us, it causes a shift in the observed wavelength (redshift or blueshift). So the observed wavelength from Star_2 is shifted because it's moving at 700 km/s. But wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So let me think: the intrinsic peak wavelength is determined by their actual temperatures, but the observed wavelength is shifted.

So, the observed λ_max for each star would be their actual λ_max multiplied by (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light. But wait, if the star is moving away, the observed λ_max would be longer (redshifted), so v_r positive would be moving away, and negative moving towards. But in this problem, Star_1 has v_r=0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. The problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So let's model this.

Let me denote:

λ_obs,1 = λ_1 (since v_r1 is zero, so observed equals intrinsic)
λ_obs,2 = λ_2 * (1 + v_r2 / c) 

But wait, actually, the Doppler shift formula is a bit more precise. The formula for wavelength shift when the source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c). But wait, I think I might have to be careful about the sign. If the star is moving away (v positive), it's redshifted, so λ_obs > λ_rest. If moving towards (v negative), blueshifted, λ_obs < λ_rest.

In this problem, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. I think radial velocity here is given as positive when moving away. So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. So according to the problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So:

λ_obs,1 = λ_max1 = b / T1
λ_obs,2 = λ_max2 * (1 + v2/c) 

But since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we can set:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)
So, T1/T2 = (1 + v2/c)^{-1}

Wait, because let's rearrange:

Divide both sides by b: (1/T1) = (1/T2
