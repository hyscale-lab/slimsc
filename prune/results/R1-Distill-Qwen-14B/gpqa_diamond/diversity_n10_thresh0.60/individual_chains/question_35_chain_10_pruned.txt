Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator Ay is given as a 2x2 matrix. I've got to find which statement is correct regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, the matrix operator Ay is c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). And S has the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). So first, maybe I should write down what the matrix Ay looks like.

So S is a 2x2 matrix:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Then, c is h/(4π). So Ay would be c times S, which is (h/(4π)) * S. So the matrix Ay would be:

Ay = [[0, -(i h)/(4π)],
      [(i h)/(4π), 0]]

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation, which is det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So the matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[[-a, -(i h)/(4π)],
 [(i h)/(4π), -a]]

The determinant of this is (-a)(-a) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ].

Let me compute that. The product term: (i h/(4π))*(-i h/(4π)) = (-i^2) (h^2)/(16 π²). Since i^2 is -1, this becomes (-(-1)) (h²/(16 π²)) )= (1) (h²/(16 π²)).

So determinant is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see an option that directly matches this.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary part ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). But wait, our eigenvalues are real? Because the matrix Ay is Hermitian? Because S is Hermitian? Let's check.

S is:

[0   -i

i    0]

The conjugate transpose of S would swap the off-diagonal elements. So S^dagger is:

[0    i

 -i    0]

Which is not the same as S, unless S is anti-Hermitian. Because S^dagger = -S. Let me see: S^dagger = [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is indeed -S. Because S is [[0, -i], [i,0]], so S^dagger = -S. So S is anti-Hermitian. Then, Ay = c * S, where c is h/(4π). So Ay is anti-Hermitian as well because it's a scalar times an anti-Hermitian matrix.
