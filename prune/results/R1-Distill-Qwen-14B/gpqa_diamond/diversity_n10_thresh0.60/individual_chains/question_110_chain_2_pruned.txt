Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should understand what the question is asking. The key point is to determine which stars can be observed by both spectrographs based on their apparent V magnitudes. Because each instrument has different brightness limits. ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than V=17 mag, and HIRES can observe down to brighter than V=16 mag. Wait, no, wait, I think the way it's phrased is that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, so that's apparent magnitude less than 17, right? Because lower numbers are brighter. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V mag less than 16.

Wait, no, the actual wording is: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed". Oh, wait, wait. In astronomy, when we say a star is brighter than a certain magnitude, it's a bit confusing because lower magnitude is brighter. So if a star has apparent magnitude 17, it's dimmer than a star with 16. So when the question says ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means apparent magnitude <=17, because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Similarly, for HIRES, it's brighter than 16. So, to be detected by both, the star's apparent V magnitude must be <=17 (since ESPRESSO can see up to 17) and also <=16 (since HIRES can only see up to 16). So the apparent V magnitude needs to be <=16 to be detected by both.

So for each star, I need to calculate its apparent V magnitude. Then, if it's <=16, it can be seen by both. Because if it's 17 or below, HIRES can't see it. But wait, wait, no, the cutoffs are a bit tricky.

Wait, the criteria are:

ESPRESSO: V_mag < 17 (because it can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, which would be V <17, since brighter is lower magnitude)

HIRES: V_mag <16 (because it can observe stars brighter than 16, so V <16)

Wait, no, wait. Let me make this clearer. When a star's apparent magnitude is brighter than a certain value, that is, less than that value. For example, if a star is V=15, it's brighter than V=17, so ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, for HIRES, a star with V=15 is brighter than 16, so it can be seen.

So, for a star to be seen by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than 16, because HIRES can't see stars dimmer than V=16. So any star with V <16 can be seen by both. If a star is between V=16 and V=17, it can be seen by ESPRESSO but not HIRES. So I need to find which stars have apparent V magnitude <16.

But wait, some
