Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and absorbing a photon to switch energy states. Hmm. Let me try to break this down. I remember that in such molecules, the energy levels are determined by both rotational and vibrational states. The question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So that would be the ground state. The next state would be the first excited state. The question is about the momentum of the photon needed for this transition.

Wait, what's the energy difference when a photon is absorbed? Oh right, the energy of the photon must match the energy difference between the two states. So the photon's energy E_photon should be equal to the energy difference ΔE between the initial and final states.

But wait, what's the transition here? Are we talking about a vibrational or rotational transition? The options give a very small momentum, which would correspond to a high energy photon since momentum p is related to energy. But wait, photon momentum is p = E/c, so higher energy (frequency) means higher p.

Wait, the question says it's a diatomic modeled with the rotation-vibration model. So both rotational and vibrational energy levels are considered. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0), I think. To switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, what's the next state? Maybe the next vibrational level (v=1), but if that's not possible, perhaps a rotational transition within the same vibrational level.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, transitions between rotational states (ΔJ = ±2) are allowed. But if the molecule is in the fundamental state (J=0, v=0), the next possible state would be J=2, v=0? Or would it be v=1, J=0? Because vibration can have a higher energy than rotation. Let me think.

Vibrational energy levels have larger spacing than rotational. So the energy required to go from v=0 to v=1 is higher than going from J=0 to J=2. So for the minimal energy photon, the molecule might undergo a vibrational transition, but wait, the question says 'next state with the lowest possible energy'. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one that's just one step higher than the current state. So if the molecule is in
