Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and calculating the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let's see if I can figure this out.

Alright, the metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like a 2-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx and dy. Oh, right, because it's for a surface, maybe a 2-sphere or something else.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But I'm not sure if this metric represents a pseudosphere. Wait, maybe I should first figure out what kind of geometry this metric describes.

Let me think. The general form of a metric in 2D is ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²). The function g(x,y) here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the denominator looks like 4 - (x² + y²), which is 4 minus r squared if r is the radial coordinate. So maybe this is a metric on a space with a maximum radius of 2, since when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, which might cause the metric to blow up. That would be a singularity, right?

Wait a second, in a sphere of radius a, the standard metric in 2D would be something like (a²)/(1 - (r²/a²)) (dr² + r² d
