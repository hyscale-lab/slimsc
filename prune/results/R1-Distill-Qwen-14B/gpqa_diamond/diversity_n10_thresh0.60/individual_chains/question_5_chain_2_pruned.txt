Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when a measurement of that observable is made. The eigenvalue gives the result of the measurement. So here, the operator is P, which is a vector operator with components Px, Py, and Pz. The eigenvector we're looking for is an eigenstate of the operator P along the direction n, with eigenvalue ħ/2.

Wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. So the arbitrary direction in the x-z plane would have an angle θ from the z-axis, I think. So n would be something like (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. But maybe I'll get back to that later.

The question provides the components of the operator P. Let me write them down as matrices. 

Px is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix with first row (0,1) and second row (1,0). So that would be:
Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1],
               [1, 0]]

Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0):
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],
               [i, 0]]

And Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]]:
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0],
              [0, -1]]

Wait, but P is a vector operator, so the operator along an arbitrary direction n would be the sum of its components multiplied by the direction cosines. So the operator P along n is P·n̂, which equals nx Px + nz Pz, since n is in the x-z plane, so ny is zero. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? So the operator P along n is:

P_n = (sinθ) * Px + (cosθ) * Pz.

So we can compute P_n by substituting the matrices for Px and Pz.

Let me compute that. So:

sinθ * Px = (ħ/2) * sinθ * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
cosθ * Pz = (ħ/2) * cosθ * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Adding these together, P_n is (ħ/2) times the matrix:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Wait, let me compute each element:

Top left: cosθ * (1) + 0 = cosθ
Top right: sinθ * (1) + 0 = sinθ
Bottom left: sinθ * (1) + 0 = sinθ
Bottom right: cosθ * (-1) + 0 = -cosθ

Wait no, wait, wait. Let me check again. Actually, the matrices are:

sinθ * Px = [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]] multiplied by ħ/2.

And cosθ * Pz = [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]] multiplied by ħ/2.

So adding them:

P_n = (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So the matrix form is:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ],
           [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

Which can be written as:

(P_n - (ħ/2) I) |ψ> = 0,

where I is the identity matrix.

Substituting P_n:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ - 1, sinθ],
         [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ] times the vector [a, b]^T equals zero.

Wait, no, let me correct that. Wait, the matrix is (P_n - (ħ/2) I) = (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] - (ħ/2) I.

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ - 1, sinθ], 
         [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ]

Wait, no. Because (P_n - (ħ/2) I) would be (ħ/2)
