Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun, have each been found to have a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. The detection is done using the radial velocity (RV) method. 

So, from what I remember, the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little in response to the planet's orbit, and we can see this as shifts in the spectral lines. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, I think.

The question gives the data for two planets. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does this shift relate to the orbital period? Oh, right, the size of the shift depends on the mass of the planet and the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. 

Wait, the formula... I think it's something like the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) )^(1/3) )... Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, there's a simpler relation when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, so M_p << M_star. Since both stars are like the Sun and the planets are Neptune-sized, so M_p is much smaller. So M_p can be considered negligible compared to M_star. 

So in that case, the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is K = ( (G * P) / (2π) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) * ( (1) / sqrt(1 - e²) ) ) ) 

But since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so the denominator becomes 1. So K simplifies to something like (G * P * M_p )^(1/3) divided by something else... Wait, maybe I should think in terms of Kepler's third law. 

Wait, another approach.
