Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can work through it step by step. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, looking at the first reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is also known as methyl isopropyl ketone, right? Its structure is (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts with NaCN, I think this is a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, no, wait. Wait, ketones reacting with nitriles? Oh, wait, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. So NaCN would provide the nucleophile, CN-.

But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. The reaction with a cyanide could be a nucleophilic addition. So the mechanism would be the nucleophile (CN-) attacking the carbonyl carbon. But wait, after the addition, we would get a cyanohydrin, which is what the product looks like. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see the structure: the molecule has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group on the same carbon. So that aligns with a cyanohydrin formation.

I remember that to form a cyanohydrin, you typically add a cyanide ion to a ketone. But
