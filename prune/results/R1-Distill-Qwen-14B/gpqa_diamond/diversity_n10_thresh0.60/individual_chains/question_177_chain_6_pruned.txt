Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me read it again carefully.

Astronomers are comparing two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh wait, and Star_1's mass is also 1.5 times bigger. Interesting. But the main thing here is about luminosity.

They found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures are the same. Because T = b / λ_max, so same λ_max implies same T.

So both stars have the same temperature. That's important because the luminosity of a star depends on both its radius and temperature.

The formula for luminosity of a star (assuming black body radiation) is L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Oh wait, right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

In this case, since both stars have the same temperature, T is the same for both. So the luminosity ratio would be (R1² / R2²) multiplied by (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But since T1 equals T2, the T part is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

Wait, what's the given ratio of R1 to R2? The problem says Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. So R1/R2 is 1.5.

So then L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would make Star_1's luminosity 2.25 times that of Star_2.

But wait, the options don't include 2.25 as the first option. Let me check the options again. Oh, wait, option A is ~2.25, option D is ~2.23. Hmm, but wait a second. Did I miss anything else in the problem?

Oh, wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km
