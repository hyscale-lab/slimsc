Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The given data includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different compounds, mostly substituted benzoic acids or benzene derivatives.

First, I need to analyze the IR and NMR data to figure out what Compound X is. Then, I'll determine what reaction occurs when it's treated with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Alternatively, if it's a different reaction condition, maybe something else happens. Wait, no, Clemmensen is for ketones with those reagents.

Let's start with the IR data. The peaks mentioned are 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably due to O-H stretching. The strong peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So putting that together, the compound has a carbonyl group (maybe a ketone) and an aromatic ring.

Now the 1H NMR data. Let's break it down:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 is likely an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Because aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes higher if deshielded. But wait, wait. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton, since those are usually around 10-12 ppm. But in the IR, the 1720 cm-1 could indicate a ketone or maybe an aldehyde (since aldehydes have a strong peak around 1720). Wait, but a carboxylic acid would have a broader peak in the NMR and a very strong absorption in IR around 2500-3300 cm-1, which is the broad -OH stretch. The IR does have a 3400–2500 region, which is broad, so maybe an -OH group, like a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between aldehyde and carboxylic acid. Let me think. If the peak is at 10.5, that's higher than typical aldehyde protons, which are usually around 9-10. A carboxylic acid proton would be around 10-12, but also, in the NMR, the integration is 1H, which fits a single aldehyde proton or a single carboxylic acid -OH.

But looking at the IR, a carboxylic acid would have a very broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300. The IR does have 3400–2500, which is a broad region, so that's consistent with an -OH. Also, the 1720 cm-1 is in line with a carboxylic acid's carbonyl, which is typically around 170
