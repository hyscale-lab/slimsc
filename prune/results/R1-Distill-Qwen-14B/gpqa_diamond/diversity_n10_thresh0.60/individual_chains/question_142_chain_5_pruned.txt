Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed, not just pure. But wait, the question here is asking about its geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit fuzzy on that part.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write that down to visualize it better. So each term is a projector into |0> and |1>. Adding them together and multiplying by 1/2. Wait a second, I think I remember that a density matrix for a mixed state of two orthogonal states would have diagonal entries as probabilities. Let me compute the matrix form of ρ.

|0><0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Same for |1><1|, which has 1 in (2,2). So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and then multiplying by 1/2 gives [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So the diagonal elements are 0.5 each, off-diagonal are zero.

But wait, what's the geometrical interpretation? I think in the Bloch sphere representation, a qubit's state is represented as a vector in a 3D space. For a pure state |ψ>, it's a unit vector (x, y, z) where |ψ> = cos(θ/2)|0> +
