Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me information from three different characterization techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I'll need to analyze each of these to gather clues about the structure of the compound.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So, I'm thinking the compound has either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid group. Wait, but a very broad peak might be more like a carboxylic acid since their O-H stretches are broader than alcohols. Alternatively, if it's an -OH in a ketone or something else, but I'm not sure yet.

Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region typically corresponds to carbonyl groups like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 cm⁻¹ peak is a bit lower, which might suggest a conjugated carbonyl group, like in an aromatic ring or maybe an ester with some electron-withdrawing groups. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with conjugated double bonds, or perhaps an amide? But given that the options don't have nitrogen, maybe it's more about an ester or something like that.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data. It says there are several peaks, including some corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe in a conjugated system with the carbonyl groups. So, that suggests something like an enone (a conjugated ketone), or perhaps an ester with a double bond nearby.

Then, the Mass Spectrometry part. The fragment peak is at m/z =45. Hmm, I need to think about what fragment would give that. 45 is a common mass for a fragment. Let me see: the molecular ion is probably larger, but 45 could be a small fragment. For example, if the compound breaks off a -CH2CH2O group or something like that. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene ion? Or perhaps a fragment with a carbonyl group. Wait, 45 could correspond to the loss of a certain group. Let's think about possible structures.

Now, looking at the options for chemical formulas:

Option A: C6H12O2
Option B: C6H10O
Option C: C6H10O2
Option D: C6H12O

So the possible functional groups and structures vary. Let's think about each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. This could be a diol, but more likely, two oxygen-containing groups. Maybe a ketone and an alcohol, but more likely an ester or a carboxylic acid with another group. Wait, but if it's an ester, the formula would be something like R-O-C-O-R, but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R. Let me
