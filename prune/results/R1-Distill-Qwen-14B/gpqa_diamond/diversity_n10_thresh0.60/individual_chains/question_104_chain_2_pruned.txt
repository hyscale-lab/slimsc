Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little bit because of the planet's orbit, and we can measure that shift.

The question says that two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun, each have a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So both planets have about the same mass. The RV method detected each planet, and the shifts in their spectral lines are given: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for #2. Wait, so planet #2's shift is larger. 

I think the RV shift depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period or something like that. Oh right, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v * (M sin i)) / (M star)^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 + M planet/M star))^(1/3). Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M planet * sin i) / (M star)^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P/(2π))^(1/3) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps K is proportional to (M planet / M star) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) * something else. 

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital period. The RV method measures the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum speed the star moves due to the planet. The formula is K = ( (G * (M planet) ) / ( (M star + M planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ). But wait, since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M star + M planet ≈ M star. So this simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * M planet ) / ( M star^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^0.5 )) ). Oh wait, but for circular orbits, e=0, so that term is 1.

Wait, but perhaps it's
