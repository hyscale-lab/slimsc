Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which physical theory doesn't require regularization when dealing with high energies. The question gives four options: Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergencesâ€”like when calculations give infinite results. So the idea is that regularization helps make those infinities manageable, right?

Wait, let me think. Regularization is a part of the process called renormalization. I think all quantum field theories require renormalization because they have these divergences. But maybe some theories don't need regularization because they are already finite, or perhaps they have a different structure.

Let me go through each option. Option A is Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics with general relativity. Strings are one-dimensional objects, and they're supposed to replace point particles. Oh right, in string theory, the concept of regularization might not be necessary because the theory is background-dependent but I'm not entirely sure. Or wait, string theory deals with high energies because it incorporates gravity, but does it require regularization? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which is the theory of the strong interaction. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, and I remember that it's asymptotically free. That means at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, so perturbative methods work better. But does it require regularization? Well, all quantum field theories have divergences, so QCD would need regularization during calculations. But wait, because it's asymptotically free, maybe it's more manageable. But regardless, it still requires regularization.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism and was the first successful quantum field theory. I know that QED has processes like photon emission and absorption, and it does require renormalization. So regularization is definitely used here to handle divergences in loop diagrams.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, wait, that's the non-quantum version. Classical theories don't involve the same divergences as quantum ones because they don't have the same mathematical structures. For example, in classical ED, you have point charges which can lead to issues like the infinite self-energy of a point charge, but in a classical sense, maybe they don't "require" regularization in the same way as quantum theories. Because regularization is a quantum field theory technique to handle infinities in calculations. So in classical theories, perhaps they don't need this because the approach is different.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So, if a theory doesn't have divergences, or doesn't need to use regularization, which one is that.

Wait, Superstring Theory: I'm not entirely certain. I think that string theories don't require the same kind of divergences as point particle theories because they have a different structure. But I'm not sure if that means they never require regularization. Or do they? I remember that in string theory, the concept of regularization is handled differently, maybe through other methods like the path integral approach without needing the same type of cutoff methods. Because in string theory, the fundamental objects are strings, not point particles, so the divergences that occur in QFT
