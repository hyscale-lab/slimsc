Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light traveling through moving glass. Hmm, I remember that when objects move, especially in relativity, things get a bit tricky. But wait, this is probably a classical mechanics problem because the options don't seem to involve relativity formulas. Let me think.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, no, wait. The glass is moving toward the observer. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving towards them. But the beam is in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Or maybe the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam's propagation but toward the observer? No, wait, the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer. Wait, that can't be. Because if the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, but the glass is moving towards the observer, perhaps the beam is moving towards the observer as well. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the setup is that the glass is moving towards the observer in the lab frame, and the light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the light is moving towards the observer as well, but the glass is also moving towards the observer. So both the glass and the light are moving towards the
