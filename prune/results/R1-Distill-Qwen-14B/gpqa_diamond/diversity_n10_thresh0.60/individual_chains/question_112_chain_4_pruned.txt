Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the problem says: We have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has Aij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, I think I remember that spin states are two-dimensional. The given state |alpha> is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal. So, the first thing I should probably do is normalize |alpha> because the question says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Let's write down |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients. So the coefficient for |up> is (1+i), whose magnitude squared is (1^2 +1^2) because (1+i) has real part 1 and imaginary part 1. So that's 1+1=2. Similarly, the coefficient for |down> is (2-i), whose magnitude squared is (2^2 + (-1)^2) =4 +1=5. So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Wait, but the problem says |alpha> is proportional to that, so maybe it's already normalized? Wait, I think I have to normalize it because probabilities must add to one. So after normalization, the state is:

|α> = [ (1+i)/√7 ] |↑⟩ + [ (2−i)/√7 ] |↓⟩.

Now, the operator in question has a matrix A where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. So, in a 2x2 matrix, this would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, because for a 2x2 matrix, i and j run from 1 to 2 (assuming |up> is 1, |down> is 2). So A_11 is 0, A_12 is ħ/2, A_21 is ħ/2, A_22 is 0. So the matrix is off-diagonal elements ħ/2 and diagonal 0.

Wait, but what is this operator? It looks familiar. Oh, right! The Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A would be (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

So, the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of X are |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, which are (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/√2 and (|↑⟩ − |↓⟩)/√2, respectively. But wait, the question is about the eigenstates of operator A. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so scaling by ħ/2 gives eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

But wait, the question is asking for the probability of measuring the eigenstates of A. So the state |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis, but the measurement is in the x-basis (eigenstates of A). So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the x-eigenstates.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate of A.

Wait, let me think. The eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>. Let me write them explicitly.

|+x> = (|↑> + |↓>)/√2

|-x> = (|↑> − |↓>)/√2

So, the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/√7 ] |↑> + [ (2−i)/√7 ] |↓>. To find the probability of measuring the system in |+x> and |-x>, I need to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each of these eigenstates, then take the square of the absolute value for the probabilities.

So, let’s compute < +x | alpha >:

< +x | alpha > = [ (1/√2) <↑| + (1/√2) <↓| ] * [ (1+i)/√7 |↑> + (2−i)/√7 |↓> ]

So this becomes (1/√2)(1+i)/√7 <↑|↑> + (1/√2)(2−i)/√7 <↓|↑> + (1/√2)(1+i)/√7 <↑|↓> + (1/√2)(2−i)/√7 <↓|↓>

But since <↑|↑> = 1, <↓|↓> =1, and <↑|↓>=0, <↓|↑>=0. So this simplifies to (1/√2)(1+i)/√7 * 1 + (1/√2)(2−i)/√7 * 0 + ... other terms that are zero. So only the first and last terms, but wait, no, the cross terms: no, wait, in the expansion, only the terms where the bra and ket are the same survive. So, it's (1/√2)(1+i)/√7 * 1 (for the |↑> term) plus (1/√2)(2−i)/√7 * 1 (for the |↓> term).

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute it correctly:

< +x | alpha > = (1/√2) * (1+i)/√7 + (1/√2) * (2−i)/√7

Wait, because when you take the inner product, you have:

< +x | alpha > = (1/√2) (1+i)/√7 * <↑|↑> + (1/√2) (2−i)/√7 * <↓|↓> 

Because the other terms involve <↑|↓> and <↓|↑>, which are zero.

So, summing those, it
