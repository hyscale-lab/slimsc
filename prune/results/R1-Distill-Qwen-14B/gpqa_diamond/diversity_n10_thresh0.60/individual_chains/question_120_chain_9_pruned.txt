Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about the distribution of stars based on their parallax. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the question is asking. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky and asks how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are different power laws, so I need to find which exponent is correct.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax in arcseconds (") is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx (in ") = 1 / distance (parsecs). Right, because the closer the star, the larger the parallax. So if a star is at distance d, plx = 1/d.

Now, the stars are uniformly distributed, meaning the number density of stars is uniform in space. So the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume. But here, we're looking at how many stars fall into a certain range of parallax per unit parallax. So maybe I should think in terms of distance and how the number of stars relates to the volume as a function of distance.

Let me think about the range of parallax. If I consider a small change in parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what does that correspond to in terms of distance? Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So a small change in plx would correspond to a small change in d.

Wait, let's do the math. Suppose I have a very small dplx. Then, d = 1/plx. The change in distance, dd, when plx changes by dplx would be approximately dd ≈ (d dplx)/(plx^2) ? Wait, let me think again. If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So the derivative dd/dplx = -1/(plx^2). So a small change dplx would cause a change in d of about dd = -d (dplx)/(plx^2). But since we're considering the absolute change, perhaps I can ignore the negative sign for now.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express the volume as a function of distance. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr would be proportional to the volume of that shell, which is 4π r² dr. Because the density is uniform, the number density n is constant, so the number of stars N is n * volume.

But here, we're considering stars per unit parallax range. So I need to find how many stars are there per unit plx. Since plx is inversely proportional to r, maybe I can express the number of stars as a function of plx.

Let me express everything in terms of plx. Let plx = p, so p = 1/r. So r = 1/p. The volume element in terms of r is 4π r² dr. Now, I want to find the number of stars per unit p, so I should relate dr to dp.

Since p = 1/r, then dp = -1/r² dr. So dr = - r² dp. But since we're dealing with small increments, maybe the negative sign just indicates the direction, but for the magnitude, we can take the absolute value. So dr = r² dp.

Substituting r = 1/p into dr, we
