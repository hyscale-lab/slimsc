Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question again and break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K. Another part mentions a reaction between a keto acid and substance X producing a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

Hmm, I think I need to identify what X, Y, W, G, and B are. Let's start with the gas W. The molecule has equal protons and neutrons. So, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons in each molecule.

Wait, protons and neutrons equal in the molecule. Let me think of possible gases. Water is H2O, but that's not a gas that's formed in such reactions. Wait, maybe something like H2 or another diatomic gas. Oh, wait, perhaps NH3? No, ammonia isn't a gas with equal protons and neutrons.

Wait, let's think about the number. The molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's say each molecule has n protons and n neutrons. So the total number of nucleons per molecule is 2n. But what element would that be?

If W is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or N2. Let's see. O has atomic number 8. Each O atom has 8 protons. If the molecule has 8 protons, then each O has 8. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons in total? No, because each O has 8 protons and some neutrons. Wait, maybe it's a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something like CO2? No, that's triatomic.

Wait, another approach: the molecule must have the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about a molecule where each atom contributes to this. For example, H2: each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal. So that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe W is carbon monoxide, CO.
