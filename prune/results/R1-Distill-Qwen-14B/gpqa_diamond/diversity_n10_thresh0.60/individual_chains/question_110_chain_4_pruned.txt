Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I think I need to figure out the apparent magnitudes for each star and see which ones fall within the brightness limits of both instruments.

First, I remember that apparent magnitude determines how bright a star appears from Earth. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES have different limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag, meaning apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17. HIRES can go down to 16 V mag, so apparent magnitude less than 16 for observation.

Wait, no—wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, which I think means stars with V magnitude less than 17, because lower magnitudes are brighter. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no—apparent magnitude works such that lower numbers are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's apparent magnitude ≤17, but actually, if a star is brighter than 17, it's more like a lower number. Hmm, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, no, no, wait. Let me clarify. Apparent magnitude is how bright it appears. A lower apparent magnitude means a brighter object. So, if a star has an apparent magnitude of 1
