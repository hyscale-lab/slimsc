Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and they can decay into other particles. The question gives me some numbers: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV.

Wait, the mean decay distance. I think that has to do with how far the particle travels before it decays. Oh right, the mean lifetime is related to the decay width. So the mean lifetime τ is the inverse of the decay width Γ. But wait, more precisely, Γ is the total decay rate, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ/τ. Or is it Γ = ħ τ^{-1}? Hmm, I think I might be mixing up the formula. Oh wait, no, the uncertainty principle relates the width and the lifetime. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ/(τ). So τ is ħ divided by Γ.

But wait, the decay width is given in MeV, and Planck's constant ħ is usually in units that include eV·seconds or similar. Let me recall the value of ħ. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. Wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant in eV·s is about 6.582e-16 eV·s. So I need to make sure the units match here
