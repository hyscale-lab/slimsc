Okay, so I've got this science question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, in terms of excitation, I think that relates to the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where n is the number density, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. 

In this case, the energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is a familiar number—it's close to Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Interesting, so the energy difference E is equal to k*T, but wait, not exactly. Let me think: for the energy difference between two levels, ΔE = E_i - E_j. So here, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k*T where T is 1 K because k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE =
