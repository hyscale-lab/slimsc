Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

Alright, the problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So first, I need to normalize this state because the problem says it's "proportional," implying that the coefficients might not be normalized yet.

Wait, right, when a state is given as proportional, that means it's equal to a constant multiplied by some vector. So I should find the normalization constant. The normalization condition is that the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients equals 1.

So the coefficients are (1+i) and (2 - i). Let me compute their magnitudes squared.

The magnitude squared of (1+i) is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because |a + ib|^2 is a^2 + b^2.

For (2 - i), the magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the problem involves an operator whose matrix elements A_ij are given. Specifically, A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. Because in a two-level system, the Pauli matrices are 2x2. Let me think: The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Oh wait, wait, the given matrix A has zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. So perhaps it's (ħ/2) times the sigma_x matrix? Because sigma_x has 0 on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal.

Wait, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], and sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the given operator matrix is (ħ/2) multiplied by sigma_x. Because the diagonal elements of A are zero, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2.

So the operator is A = (ħ/2) * sigma_x. Because sigma_x has 1s in the off-diagonal positions, so when multiplied by ħ/2, the off-diagonal elements become ħ/2.

Now, the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. Wait, wait, no, the operator A is defined, and we need to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate. Wait, no, the states in which the particle is measured are the eigenstates of the operator A.

So, the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x, because A is a multiple of sigma_x. So the eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of A.

What are the eigenstates of sigma_x? They are the spin eigenstates in the x-direction, which are superpositions of |up> and |down> states.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |−x>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, the possible outcomes when measuring the operator A are the eigenvalues corresponding to these states. Since A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so ± ħ/2.

Wait, but the question says, "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator." Hmm, perhaps the wording is a bit off. Because when you measure an observable, you get an eigenvalue, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenstate. So the probabilities correspond to the square of the amplitude of the eigenstates in the given state |alpha>.

So, the approach would be:

1. Express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A (which are |+x> and |−x>).

2. The coefficients of these eigenstates in the expansion of |alpha> will give the amplitudes. The probabilities are the squares of the magnitudes of these amplitudes.

So, first, I need to write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me write:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>

I can compute c_+ and c_- by taking the inner products of |alpha> with |+x> and |−x> respectively.

So,

c_+ = < +x | alpha >
c_- = < -x | alpha >

But wait, let me express |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>

Now, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, to find c_+, I take the inner product of |+x> with |alpha>:

c_+ = [ (1/sqrt(2)) <up| + (1/sqrt(2)) <down| ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

= ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) ) + ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) )

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) )

Let me compute the numerator: (1 + i) + (2 - i) = (1+2) + (i -i )=3 +0i=3.

So c_+ = 3/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, let me check that calculation again.

Wait, no, because the inner product would be:

= ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) * (1/sqrt(2)) )

Which is [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) )

= (1 + 2 + i - i ) / (sqrt(14)) )

= 3 / sqrt(14).

So c_+ = 3/sqrt(14).

Similarly, compute c_-:

c_- = < -x | alpha >.

| -x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So,

c_- = [ (1/sqrt(2)) <up| - (1/sqrt(2)) <down| ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

= (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) )

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2))

Compute numerator:

= (1 + i -2 + i ) = (-1 + 2i )

So c_- = (-1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14 )

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2: (3)^2 / (sqrt(14))^2 ) =9/14.

|c_-|^2: magnitude squared of (-1 +2i ) is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5. So 5/(14).

Wait, 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1, which is correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.6428) and 5/14 (~0.3571). Wait, but let me look at the options.

Looking at the options, option A has probabilities 0.64 and 0.36. That would correspond to roughly 9/14≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571. So that's approximately 0.64 and 0.36, which matches option A's first two numbers.

But wait, the third part is the average value of the operator. So I need to compute the expectation value of A, which is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since we have the eigenstates, the expectation value would be |c_+|^2 * (+ħ/2) + |c_-|^2 * (-ħ/2).

Because the eigenvalue for |+x> is ħ/2, and for |−x> it's -ħ/2.

So,

< A > = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2 ) = [ (9/14 -5/14) ) * ħ/2 ].

(9-5)=4, so 4/14 * ħ/2 = (2/7)* ħ/2 = ħ/7.

So the expectation value is ħ/7.

Now looking at the options, option A's third part is ħ/7. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7. So option A would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the expectation value. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the operator matrix.

Another approach: The operator A is (ħ/2) sigma_x. The matrix representation in the z basis is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0 ]].

The state |alpha> is (1+i, 2-i) / sqrt(7) as a column vector.

So to compute <A>, which is alpha^dagger A alpha.

So,

A is a 2x2 matrix:

[ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ]

|alpha> is a column vector with components (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So,

alpha^dagger is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ].

So,

alpha^dagger * A = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * A.

Compute each term:

First element: (1-i)/sqrt(7) *0 + (2+i)/sqrt(7)* (ħ/2) ) = (2+i) * ħ/(2 sqrt(7)).

Second element: (1-i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2) + (2+i)/sqrt(7)*0 = (1 -i) * ħ/(2 sqrt(7)).

Now, multiply alpha^dagger * A * alpha:

= [ (2+i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) , (1-i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) ] multiplied by [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Wait, wait, no. It's a row vector multiplied by a column vector.

So,

= [ (2+i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) ] * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + [ (1 -i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) ] * (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Let me compute each term:

Term1: (2+i)(1+i) * ħ/(2 *7 )

(2+i)(1+i) = 2(1) + 2i +i(1) +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 =1 +3i.

Term2: (1-i)(2 -i) * ħ/(2*7 )

(1)(2) + (1)(-i) -i(2) + i^2.

= 2 -i -2i -1 = (2-1) + (-3i) )=1 -3i.

So,

Term1 + Term2 = (1+3i) + (1 -3i) )= 2.

So putting it all together:

= [ (1+3i) + (1-3i) ] * ħ/(14) ) = 2 * ħ/(14) )= ħ/(7).

So that's the same result. So the average value is indeed ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the probabilities again, because the given state is in terms of |up> and |down>, and the operator's eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>. The coefficients we found for |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x> are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14). The magnitudes squared are 9/14 and 5/14. So 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which is about 0.36.

So the options in A match these probabilities. So, the correct choice is option A.


The problem involves an electron in the state |α>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To solve the problem, the state must first be normalized. The coefficients (1+i) and (2-i) have magnitudes squared of 2 and 5, respectively. The normalization constant is 1/√7, so the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |up\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |down\rangle.
\]

The operator in question has a matrix representation \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and 0 otherwise. This corresponds to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli x-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{|up\rangle + |down\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|up\rangle - |down\rangle}{\sqrt{2}},
\]

with eigenvalues \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), the state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is expressed as a linear combination of these eigenstates:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+x\rangle + c_- |-x\rangle.
\]

The coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \) are computed using the inner products:

\[
c_+ = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+x) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

The average value of the operator \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).**
