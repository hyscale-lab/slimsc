Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos and the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why is that important? Oh right, because neutrinos take about that long to reach Earth from the Sun. So, if the pp-III process stopped, the neutrinos from that process would stop coming, and we'd see the effect here on Earth now.

Wait, but what's the pp-III branch? From what I remember, the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. There are different branches, I think. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, then pp-II and pp-III. Oh right, the pp-III branch is the part where beryllium-7 captures a helium-4 nucleus (alpha particle) to form carbon-11, which then decays to boron-11. The neutrinos from this process are the high-energy ones, right? Because the decay produces positrons, which then annihilate with electrons, emitting neutrinos with higher energies. These are the so-called 7Be neutrinos or the high-energy neutrinos from the Sun.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the production of these high-energy neutrinos would stop. But wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV
