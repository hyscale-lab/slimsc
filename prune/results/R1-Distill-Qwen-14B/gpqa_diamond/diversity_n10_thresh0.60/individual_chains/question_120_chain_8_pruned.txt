Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, let's think about this.

I remember that parallax is related to distance. The formula I think is that distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So, parallax plx = 1/distance. So as the parallax increases, the distance decreases, right?

Now, the stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in the sky, so does that mean their distances are spread out in some way? Wait, if they are uniformly distributed in space, then the number density is constant. But maybe we're considering them in terms of their parallax here.

So the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. Let's imagine we're looking at a range of parallax values, say from plx to plx + dplx. How many stars would be in that range?

I think this has to do with the volume of space at a certain distance. Because when you have more volume, you can fit more stars. But wait, how does parallax relate to volume?

Let me think. The number of stars in a volume depends on the density. If the density is uniform, then the number of stars is proportional to the volume.

But parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So how does the volume relate to distance?

Volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr would be the surface area of the sphere times dr. Surface area is 4πd², so the volume is 4πd² dr.

But since parallax plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So dr is the change in distance, but I'm interested in the change in parallax. Let me express dr in terms of dplx, the change in parallax.

dplx is the change in plx. So plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Differentiating both sides, -d^2 dplx = dr. Wait, let's do it carefully.

d = 1/plx. So differentiating both sides with respect to plx: dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, but since d is positive and plx is positive, I think taking the magnitude, dr = (1/plx²) dplx. Because as plx increases, d decreases.

So the volume element dV is 4π d² dr. Sub
