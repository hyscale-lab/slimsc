Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's start by going through each piece of data step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. I know that IR peaks can tell us a lot about functional groups. The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ probably indicates -OH or maybe N-H stretching. But wait, the peak is very broad, which makes me think it's an -OH group, like in an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. If it were an alcohol, the peak would be less broad than a carboxylic acid, but sometimes the broadness can vary. Also, carboxylic acids usually have a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹, which fits here. 

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. I remember that a peak around 1700 is typical for carbonyl groups. This could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peak at 1650 might correspond to a conjugated carbonyl group or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an amide. But wait, amides usually have lower carbonyl peaks around 1650. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. 

Looking at the 1H NMR data, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has an alkene group. That suggests the molecule has some unsaturation, which would be a double bond or a ring. Since there are two carbonyl peaks in IR, perhaps it's a di-carbonyl compound. Wait, but wait, 1700 and 1650 might also be from a conjugated system, like a carbonyl and an aromatic ring. Hmm.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. I need to think about what fragments have a mass of 45. Common fragments include CH3CO+ (which is 43?), wait, let me think. Wait, 45. Could it be a propyl group
