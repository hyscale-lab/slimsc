Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see... the question involves two reactions, and I need to select the correct reagents A and B from the options given.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's acetone. Acetone reacting with sodium cyanide. Hmm. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. Like, for example, when you add something like HCN or CN- to a ketone.

But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So maybe this is a cyanide addition. In the presence of an acid catalyst? Because sometimes, for such additions, you need an acidic environment to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic.

Oh wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The butanenitrile part is CH2CH2CN, but wait, wait. Wait, the formula would be: the nitrile group is on the second carbon, right? Because the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile has four carbons. Let me count: the nitrile is on C2, but the rest: the molecule would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN? No, but wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the substituents would be on the correct positions.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it adds CN-, it would probably add to the carbonyl carbon. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, but that's 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, which is different from what's given. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. Wait, butanenitrile is four carbons, so maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Oh, right! So the starting material is acetone (three carbons: (CH3)2CO), adding CN- across the carbonyl would make (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the product given is butanenitrile, which has four carbons. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, the starting material is butan-2-one. Oh, wait butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, but wait no: butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3. Because butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO? Wait, no, butan-2-one is 2-butanone, which is (CH3)C(O)CH2. Wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is correct. So acetone is butan-2-one? No, acetone is propan-2-one. Oh wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one would have four carbons. So it's (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO. Wait, let me think. Butane is CH3CH2CH2CH3. So butan-2-one is (CH2CH2)CO. Oh, wait no. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No. Wait, butan-2-one is CH3-CO-CH2-CH3. Yes, that's correct.

So the structure is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3. So when NaCN is added, what happens? I think the cyanide ion would attack the carbonyl carbon in a nucleophilic addition. So the product would be CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain with a nitrile and a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Yeah, that makes sense.

So the reaction between a ketone and NaCN. I remember that in the presence of an acid catalyst, such as H3O+ (which is option A and B for reagent A), the ketone is protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, so the CN- can attack. After the addition, the proton is removed, and then with another acid work-up, perhaps.

Wait, but sometimes in such reactions, the conditions are HCN, which is a weak acid. But here, the reagent is
