Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of intrinsic angular momentum. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The question says that the operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). And the matrix S has rows [0, -i] and [i, 0]. So first, I should probably figure out what Ay looks like.

Right, so c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. Let me compute that. Multiplying each element of S by c. So the first row of Ay would be (0 * c, (-i) * c) which is (0, -i h/(4π)). The second row would be (i c, 0), which is (i h/(4π), 0).

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Oh wait, but the question isn't directly asking for the values, but which statement about the options is correct.

The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about each.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't sound right because eigenvalues of angular momentum components are usually multiples of ħ/2, but wait, wait. Let me think about what S is. S is given, and if I compute Ay, it's a scaled version of S. Let's recall that for spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Wait, but in this case, c is h/(4π). Let's compute the scaling.

Wait, c is h/(4π), and S seems to be similar to the Pauli Y matrix. Oh wait, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly S here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, sigma_y. The eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±i, because when you diagonalize sigma_y, you get those. So Ay is c * sigma_y, so the eigenvalues would be c * (±i). So the eigenvalues of Ay are ± i * c.

Since c is h/(4π), that would make the eigenvalues ±i h/(4π). Wait, but that would mean the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary
