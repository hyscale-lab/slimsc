Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let me read it again. So, there are ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, but when we measure the position of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Or does it?

Wait, no, the wave function isn't necessarily zero outside, but the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So maybe the wave function is zero outside of that region, and non-zero within. But the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because it's a complex function. 

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be square-integrable and normalized. Oh wait, but the wave function given is for the part where the particle exists, which is between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is non-zero only in that interval. So perhaps the overall wave function is zero outside, and this expression is valid between 1 and 3. 

But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's a complex function. So the wave function ψ(x) is a complex number. But for the wave function to be physically valid, the integral of |ψ|^2 must be 1,
