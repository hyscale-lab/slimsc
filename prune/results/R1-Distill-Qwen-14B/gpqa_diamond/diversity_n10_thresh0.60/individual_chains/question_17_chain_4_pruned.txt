Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also give me the formation constant, K_ca-edta, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that complicating things, and the temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard for these kinds of calculations.

Hmm, wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed through a series of reactions where EDTA (which is H4Y) binds to the Ca²+ ion. The formation constant, Kf, is often used to describe how strong the complex is. Oh wait, but the given K is K_ca-edta. I think that's the same as the formation constant Kf for the Ca-EDTA complex.

So, the problem says the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let me denote the complex as CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA part.

The dissociation of the complex would be: CaY²− ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4−. The formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the reverse reaction. So, Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]).

But wait, what's the relation between Kf and the problem here? I need to find [Ca²+], the concentration of calcium ions. Since the complex is dissociating, the amount of free Ca²+ and Y^4− will be in a certain ratio. 

The initial concentration of CaY²− is 0.02 M. Let's assume that the complex dissociates a little bit. Let me set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium).

Initial concentrations:
[CaY²−] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] = 0 (since it's just dissociating)
[Y^4−] = 0

Change:
When the complex dissociates by x, then:
[CaY²−] decreases by x, so becomes 0.02 - x.
[Ca²+] increases by x, so x.
[Y^4−] increases by x, so x.

At equilibrium:
[CaY²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kf is large, x should be very small compared to 0.02)
[Ca²+] = x
[Y^4−] = x

So the Kf expression is:
Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]) = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x².

We know Kf is 5x10^10, so:
5e10 = 0
