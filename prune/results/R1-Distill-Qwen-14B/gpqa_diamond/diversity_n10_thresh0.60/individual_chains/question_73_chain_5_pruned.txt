Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics; we need to use Einstein's theory of relativity. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on my special relativity equations.

The problem says the first astronaut has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c. The second has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, we're looking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, I'll tackle the relative speed. I think when two objects are moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds because of relativistic effects. Oh right! The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. The correct formula is:

v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²))

Wait, but wait. Let me get this straight. If both are moving in the same direction, and we're finding the speed of one relative to the other, then yes, the formula should be as I wrote. So substitute v1 as 0.6c and v2 as 0.5c.

Calculating numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c^2) = 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = (0.1/0.7)c ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's about 14% the speed of light.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c, so that's narrowed it down to those two.

Now, for the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic kinetic energy, but wait, I think I should calculate their total energies using the relativistic energy formula, and then sum them. Oh wait, no, because the system's total energy would be the sum of their
