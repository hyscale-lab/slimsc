Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So, when they react, the acid will donate a proton to the hydroxide ions.

The problem states that we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the first thing I think about is the dilution. When you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the total volume.

Wait, right, dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So the initial concentration is 0.05 M, and the volume becomes 40 cm³ after adding 20 cm³ of water. Let me calculate the new concentration.

M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. So, M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Oh, because V2 is 40 now. So 0.05 * 20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next part is titration with 0.1 M NaOH. We're asked about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Let me first handle the equivalence point because I think that's a bit more straightforward.

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate the moles of acetic acid initially.

Moles = M * V (in liters). So acetic acid moles: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Because 40 cm³ is 0.04 L.

Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, the moles of NaOH needed are also 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration. So V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

But wait, wait, I might not need the volume for the equivalence point pH, but the pH calculation. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted into acetate ions, so the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So it's a basic solution.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water. The reaction would be CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e
