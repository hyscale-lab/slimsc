Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I'm supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to recall what stability constants are. Stability constants, or formation constants, measure how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So β4 is 16, which is one of the lower ones here. Wait, let me list the complexes. Usually, the numbering goes from the most labile (easily replaced ligand) to the least. But I'm not sure about the order here. Oh wait, the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^2- for n=1,2,3,4. So β1 is the stability for the first complex, which is [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but the problem is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ligands. So that would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which has β2=40. So I need to find the fraction of this complex relative to all possible cobalt species.

The next step is to calculate the fractions of each complex and then sum them up. The question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the dithiocyanato complex.

So, the approach I remember is to use the stability constants and the concentrations to find the distribution of each complex. The general formula for the fraction of each complex is based on the product of the stability constant and the concentration of SCN^- raised to the power of the number of ligands attached.

Wait, the general expression for the fraction of each complex is given by the formation constants and the concentrations. The fraction f_n for the nth complex is [Co(SCN)_n] / (total [Co]). But since the total [Co] is given, we can compute each f_n as (β_n * [SCN^-]^n) / (sum over all m of β_m * [SCN^-]^m).

Wait, no. Wait, the total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all the individual complexes. So each [Co] in each complex contributes to the total. So for each complex, [CoL_n] = β_n [Co]_free [L]^n, but since [Co]_free is the same for all, when calculating the fractions, it's the ratio of the β_n [L]^n terms.

Wait, no. Let me think again
