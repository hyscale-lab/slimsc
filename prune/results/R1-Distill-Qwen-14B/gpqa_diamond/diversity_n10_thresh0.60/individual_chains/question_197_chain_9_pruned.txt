Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product formed when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which suggests there's either an -OH stretch or an -NH group. But wait, red phosphorus and HI are reagents typically used in the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen is used to reduce ketones to alkanes, right? So maybe compound X has a carbonyl group. The IR also shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl, like a ketone or maybe an ester. The other peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretches. So, perhaps compound X is a methyl ketone attached to a benzene ring or something similar.

Looking at the NMR data now. The H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). That's a really high chemical shift, which usually corresponds to an aldehyde proton. Wait, but wait—Clemmensen reduction doesn't work on aldehydes. Or does it? Or maybe that's a carboxylic acid proton? But if it's a carboxylic acid, the peak would typically be around 10-12 ppm. But wait, in the IR, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. A carboxylic acid would show a broader peak around 2500-3000 cm-1 due to O-H stretching, but the IR here has a broad region from 3400–2500. So maybe it's an -OH group, but the 1720 suggests a carbonyl. Wait, could it be a ketone? But the 10.5 ppm peak is more like an aldehyde's. Hmm.

Wait, but in the options, some of them are benzoic acids. Let me think again. If the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720, that's more like an ester or ketone, not a carboxylic acid. Because a carboxylic acid's carbonyl is usually around 1700-1725, but the O-H would be very broad around 2500-3000. So the 3400-2500 might be an -OH. But if the compound is a benzoic acid, the NMR would have a broad peak around 10 ppm, which matches the 10.5 ppm. So maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but the options don't have a benzoic acid with an aldehyde group. Let me recheck. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

So that's a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group. Its structure would be a benzene ring with ethyl at position 4, and a propanoic acid group attached somewhere else. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So if it's 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-COOH. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The formula would be CH2CH2COOH with the middle CH2 connected to the phenyl group. So it's:

Ph-CH2-COOH, so the structure is benzyl attached to a CH2, connected to COOH. So the NMR would have a peak around 2.5 ppm for the CH2 next to COOH, but I don't see that. Alternatively, maybe the structure is Ph-C(O)OH, which is benzoic acid. But the options don't have benzoic acid. Let me check the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would be a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group at position 4 and a COOH group somewhere. Wait, benzoic acid has the COOH attached to the ring. So 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have the COOH at position 1 and the sec-butyl at position 4. So the structure would be:

Benzoic acid (COOH at position 1) and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

So, looking at the NMR data for option C. The NMR would show a broad peak around 10 ppm for the COOH proton. Then, the aromatic protons. The NMR shows 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and
