Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let's break down what's given.

First, the problem states that Ay is equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is h divided by 4π. Wait, I remember that h is Planck's constant, but sometimes people use ħ which is h/(2π). So c here is h/(4π) which is the same as ħ/2, right? Because ħ = h/(2π), so h/(4π) is ħ/2. That might be useful later.

Next, the matrix S is given. The first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So let me write that out:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh wait, this is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i, maybe? Or perhaps it's another matrix. Well, regardless, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, which is c*S.

So first, let me write out what Ay looks like. Since c is h/(4π), each element of S will be multiplied by this. So Ay would be:

Ay = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
        [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

Wait, let me compute that.
