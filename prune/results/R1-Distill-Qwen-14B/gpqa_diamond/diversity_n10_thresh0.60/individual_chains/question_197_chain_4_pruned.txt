Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy problems. Let's take it step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus with HI is a reagent used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, specifically converting them into amines. Oh wait, no, wait—red phosphorus and HI is more commonly used for the dehydrohalogenation or maybe for elimination reactions? Hmm, no, wait. I think when you have a nitrile and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it converts the nitrile into an amine. Like a hydrolysis reaction but under certain conditions. So maybe the nitrile becomes an amine group. Or wait, perhaps it's a different kind of reaction. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe it's the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? Or is that under different conditions? Or wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an alkyne? Wait, no, I'm mixing things up.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI—I think it's used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, like in the formation of alcohols. Or is it more about dehydrohalogenation? Wait, no. Oh, right! I think red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. So a nitrile group (RCN) would react with red phosph
