Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their photospheres, and I'm trying to figure out which equation correctly relates their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let's break it down.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that in stellar atmospheres under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the excitation of atoms depends on the temperature. The Boltzmann equation probably comes into play here.

The Boltzmann distribution tells us the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, because the energy difference is given, and we're probably assuming the statistical weights are similar for both stars (since it's the same element), the ratio of excitation should relate to the temperatures. So the ratio of the excitation levels (n1/n2) is given as 2 for star_1 compared to star_2. Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So n1 (excited) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1_1 = 2 * n1_2.

Wait no, wait: The problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So the excitation level (number in that state) is twice as much for star_1. So n1 = 2 * n2, where n1 is star_1's state, n2 star_2's.

So n1/n2 = 2. But wait, the formula is n2/n1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ), but since E2 is higher than E1 (because it's excited state), E2-E1 is positive. So perhaps I should write the ratio as n1_1 / n2_1 = 2, where n is the excited state.

Wait, maybe the formula is n_upper / n_lower = exp( -(Î”E)/(kT) ). So for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or
