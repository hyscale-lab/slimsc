Okay, I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and think it through step by step. 

So, the question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots, and how that affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ionization state and the populations of different energy levels are influenced by temperature. 

The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but spots are cooler regions, right? So when spots cover part of the surface, the total emitted flux decreases. How does that affect the overall Teff? Oh, right, because the star's luminosity changes, which in turn affects the effective temperature. 

The problem then says that when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases. And the question is asking by what factor this ratio changes. The transition between these levels corresponds to about 1448 Å, which is in the near ultraviolet or perhaps the blue part of the spectrum. 

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2, where n1 and n2 are the populations of the two levels. In LTE, the ratio is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where E_i is the energy of level i, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. 

So when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower. Wait, but wait! No, wait. The entire photosphere's temperature—when the star has spots, how does that affect the photospheric temperature? Are the spots part of the photosphere? I think so. So when spots cover 40% of the surface, the effective temperature is 5500 K. But the original 6000 K is the Teff when the surface isn't covered by spots. But wait, does the presence of spots lower the photospheric temperature? Or is the photosphere otherwise at
