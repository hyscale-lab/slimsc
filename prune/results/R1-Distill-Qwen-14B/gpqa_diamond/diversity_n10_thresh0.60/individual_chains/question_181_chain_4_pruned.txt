Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. That's the time it takes for sunlight to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So, any neutrinos produced in the pp-III reactions would have stopped coming, and their effects would be felt here on Earth after that time.

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, I need to figure out how the pp-III branch contributes to these bands and what the ratio would be after it stops.

I remember that the pp chain is a major source of solar energy, and the different branches produce different neutrinos. The pp-III branch is one of the steps in the proton-proton chain. Specifically, the pp-III branch involves the fusion of a helium-3 nucleus with a proton to form a carbon-12 nucleus, which emits a positron and a neutrino. I think this produces high-energy neutrinos, maybe around 1 MeV or so.

But wait, neutrinos from different reactions have different energies. The main neutrinos from the pp chain are the ones from the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle and the proton-proton (pp) chain. The pp chain produces lower-energy neutrinos, while the CNO cycle produces higher-energy ones. But within the pp chain, the pp-I and pp-II branches produce lower-energy neutrinos, while the pp-III branch produces higher-energy ones, right?

So, if the pp-III branch stops, those higher-energy neutrinos (like the ones around 1 MeV or so) would stop coming. But neutrinos from the other branches (pp-I, pp-II) and the CNO cycle would still be present.

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio between two specific energy bands: 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So, I need to determine the contribution of the pp-III branch to each of these bands.

Let me think about the typical neutrino energies. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos with energies around 1.4 MeV, I think. Because the
