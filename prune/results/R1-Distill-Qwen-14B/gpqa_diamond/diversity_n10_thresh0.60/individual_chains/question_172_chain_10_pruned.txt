Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through it.

The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature. Oh wait, this must be about the Boltzmann distribution or something like that.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as about 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait, I think that's the same as k (Boltzmann constant) because k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Interesting, so the energy difference ΔE is equal to k*T, maybe? Or wait, no, the energy difference is much smaller than thermal energy, so the probability of excitation depends on the Boltzmann factor.

Right, the Boltzmann factor is e^(-ΔE/(kT)). So the ratio of the populations in two energy levels is given by that. Wait, the number of atoms in an excited state compared to the ground state is proportional to this factor.

In star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So the ratio of excited to non-excited (or maybe to a lower state) is 2:1. Let me think. If N is the number in the excited state, and N' is the number in the lower state, then N/N' = e^(-ΔE/(kT)).

Wait, no, wait. Because for the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio N_i/N_j = e^(- (E_i - E_j)/(kT)). If the energy level is higher, E_i > E_j, so the ratio is e^(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE = E_i - E_j.

But in star_1, the excitation is higher. Let's say the ratio is N1/N'1 = 2, and for star_2, N2/N'2 = 1. So the ratio of the excitation in star_1 compared to star_2 is 2:1.

Wait, maybe the ratio of the excitation for star_1 to star_2 is 2. So (N1/N'1) / (N2/N'2) ) = 2/1 = 2.

But N_i/N_j is e^(-ΔE/(kT)). So for each
