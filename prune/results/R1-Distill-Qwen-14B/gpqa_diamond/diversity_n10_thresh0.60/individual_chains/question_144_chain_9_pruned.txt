Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. Hmm, let's see what the question says. The production energy is 8 GeV, the mass is 1.2 GeV, and the width is 320 MeV. The options are given in meters, so I guess I need to calculate that.

Wait, I remember that decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. The mean decay length is basically how far the particle travels before decaying. So I think the formula involves the lifetime, the speed of the particle, and maybe some constants.

Right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Oh wait, the uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So the uncertainty in energy (which is the width Γ) multiplied by the lifetime (τ) is about ħ. So τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). Or wait, no, I think it's τ ≈ ħ/(Γ), because Γ is the total decay width, which corresponds to the uncertainty in energy.

So first, I need to calculate τ. Once I have τ, I can find out how far the particle travels before decaying. But for that, I need the velocity of the particle. Since the particle is produced with a certain energy, I can figure out its velocity from the energy and mass.

The production energy is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So I can calculate the kinetic energy and then the total energy. Wait, the total energy E
