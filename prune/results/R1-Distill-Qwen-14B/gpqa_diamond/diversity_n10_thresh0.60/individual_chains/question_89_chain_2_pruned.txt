Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's break it down step by step. 

So, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid and has four bridgehead carbons. The molecule has two bromine atoms attached at positions 1 and 3.

The first reaction is heating this with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with bases, especially in such conditions, it's likely an elimination reaction. Wait, wait—dibromides typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. Since adamantane is a bridged structure, the elimination might form an allene or maybe a more substituted double bond.

Wait, wait. The product is a light yellow solid. From the NMR data, let's see. The 1H NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm as a doublet of two hydrogens. That region (around 4.5-5 ppm) usually corresponds to alkenyl protons or maybe an epoxide. But wait, in the IR, there's a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the product probably has a ketone group. Hmm, but elimination usually forms alkenes, not ketones. Alternatively, maybe a substitution?

Wait, maybe the base is causing a substitution but in a position that leads to a carbonyl. Oh, wait! If
