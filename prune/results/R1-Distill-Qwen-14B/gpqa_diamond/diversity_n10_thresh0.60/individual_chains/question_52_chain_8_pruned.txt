Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read it again.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how spots on its surface affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. So the star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The key point here is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. Observers see this ratio decrease when the star has spots. I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Ã…, which I think is in the near-ultraviolet range.

The problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I don't have to worry about non-LTE effects, which simplifies things because I can probably use the Boltzmann equation for the population ratio of energy levels.

Alright, the Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms. So the ratio is n1/n2, since they mentioned the ratio decreases when there are spots. Wait, the observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. Let me make sure I'm tracking that.

When the star has spots, the overall T_eff decreases to 5500 K. Without spots, T_eff is 6000 K. So when the star has spots, the temperature is lower. 

The ratio of n1 to n2 is (n1/n2). The problem says that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T increases, what happens to the ratio?

Wait, let's think about the Boltzmann factor
