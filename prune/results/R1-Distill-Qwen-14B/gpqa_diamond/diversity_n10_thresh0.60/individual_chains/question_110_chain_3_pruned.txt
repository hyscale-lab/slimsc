Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, the question is about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The key is to figure out the apparent magnitudes of each star because each spectrograph has a different brightness limit.

Let me recall: apparent magnitude is how bright a star appears from Earth. The lower (brighter) the magnitude, the better. The question says ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than 17 mag, meaning it can't see stars fainter than that. HIRES can see brighter than 16 mag, so it's more sensitive (can see fainter stars) up to 16.

So for each star, I need to calculate or determine their apparent V magnitudes. If a star's apparent mag is ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES), then both can detect it. Wait, no, wait—because the detection depends on whether the apparent magnitude is brighter than the limit. 

Wait, the question says: with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So if a star's apparent V is ≤17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can see stars with V mag brighter than 16, so ≤16 for HIRES.

So a star must have apparent V mag ≤16 to be detected by both. Because anything above 16 can't be seen by HIRES, and if it's above 17, ESPRESSO can't see it either. Wait, wait—no, wait. Let me clarify:

ESPRESSO detects stars with V ≤17. HIRES detects those with V ≤16. So a star must be ≤16 for both to detect it. Because if it's ≤16, HIRES can see it (since 16 is its limit), and since 16 is also ≤17, ESPRESSO can see it too. But if a star's V is, say, 16.5, then HIRES can't see it (since it's brighter than 16?), but wait no—wait, the way the question is phrased: "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let
