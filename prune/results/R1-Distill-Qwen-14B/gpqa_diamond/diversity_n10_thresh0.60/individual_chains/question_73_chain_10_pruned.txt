Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are provided, so I'll have to calculate both the relative velocity and the total energy and match them to the options.

First, let me parse the question. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. I think c is the speed of light, which is a constant, approximately 3x10^8 m/s.

The two things I need to find are:

1. The relative speed between them (v_rel)
2. The total energy of the system.

Hmm, okay. Let's tackle the relative speed first. I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. I think you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, because of the effects of special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity is: 

v_rel = (u1 - u2) / (1 - (u1 u2)/c² )

Wait, wait. Which astronaut is moving at which speed? The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So I'm trying to find how much faster the first is moving relative to the second. So u1 is 0.6c, and u2 is 0.5c.

So plugging into the formula:

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² )

Simplify numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = (1/7) c ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, that's either C or D, where v_rel is 0.14c.

Wait, but wait a second. Which astronaut is considered the one moving at u1 and u2? Because the problem says the astronauts are moving at those speeds in the same direction. So the relative speed is the difference between the two velocities, as seen from one astronaut to the other.

So, yeah, the calculation looks correct. So v_rel is about 0.14c. Now, looking at the options, both C and D have 0.14c for v_rel. So I'll have to figure out the energy part to decide between them.

Next, the total energy of the system. Since both astronauts are moving, their energies are relativistic. The total energy is the sum of their individual relativistic energies.

The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So each astronaut has their own gamma factor. Let's calculate each.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2 ) 
= 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)
= 1 / sqrt(0.64)
= 1 / 0.8
= 1.25

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² 
= 1.25 * 2 m c² 
= 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2 )
= 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)
= 1 / sqrt(0.75)
= 1 / (sqrt(3)/2) )
= 2 / sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² 
= (2/sqrt(3)) * 3m c² 
= (6 / sqrt(3)) m c² 
= 2 sqrt(3) m c². Because sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 2 * 1.732 ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait wait, let me recheck that calculation.

Wait, 2/sqrt(3) is about 1.1547, multiplied by 3m c²:

E2 = (2/sqrt(3)) * 3 m c² = (6/sqrt(3)) m c². Simplify 6/sqrt(3) = 2*sqrt(3) * (3/sqrt(3)) * (2) ? Wait, maybe another approach.

Wait, 6/sqrt(3) = 6 sqrt(3) / 3 = 2 sqrt(3). So E2 = 2 sqrt(3) m c². Since sqrt(3) is about 1.732, 2 * 1.732 = 3.464. So E2 is approximately 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² ≈ 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c, which matches my calculations.

Option D says E=5 mc², which is less than what I calculated. So option C is the correct one.

Wait, let me make sure I
