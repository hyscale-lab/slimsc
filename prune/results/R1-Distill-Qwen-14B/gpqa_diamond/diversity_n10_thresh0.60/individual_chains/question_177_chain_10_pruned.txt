Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their luminosities. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. Interesting, so both radius and mass scale by the same factor. But wait, I'm not sure how mass comes into play here. The question is about luminosity, which I recall is related to radius and temperature, right? Oh, right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: Luminosity L is proportional to R² T⁴, where R is radius and T is temperature.

The question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's law, λ_max ≈ b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. Wait, but wait, the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same. So, T1 = T2? Hmm, because λ_peak same implies T same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but the stars have different radii. So L is proportional to R² T⁴. If T is the same, then L is proportional to R squared. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. Since R1 is 1.5 R2, then L1/L2 is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. So the answer would be A) ~2.25.

But wait, wait! The problem also mentions something about radial velocities. Oh, the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. Hmm, how does that tie into this? Because the problem says they computed the luminosities assuming they radiate as black bodies. So maybe the radial velocities affect the observed luminosity. Oh, wait, but I think the radial velocity is about the Doppler shift. So if a star is moving towards us, the light would be blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted. But in our earlier analysis, the peak wavelengths are determined by their actual temperatures, so the observed wavelengths would change due to Doppler effect. But the problem says they found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed λ_max is same, which would require that the Doppler shifts are accounted for.

Wait, maybe I didn't consider that. Because the wavelengths they measured (the peak) are the same. But the actual (intrinsic) temperatures might differ. Because if a star is moving, the observed wavelength is shifted. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier by assuming T1=T2.

Let me think again. Let me break down the problem.

So, the observed peak wavelength is the same for both stars. Let's denote the observed wavelength as λ_obs. The intrinsic peak wavelength is λ0, which is proportional to T (λ0 = b/T
