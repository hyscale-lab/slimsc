Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem states: We have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to calculate two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator has a matrix representation A where Aij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. 

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I should probably normalize the given state |alpha>. Because when the problem says it's "proportional" to that expression, that means it's not normalized yet. So the first thing is to find the normalization constant.

The state is |alpha> = c1|up> + c2|down>, where c1 is (1+i) and c2 is (2-i). The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1.

Calculating the inner product: |c1|^2 + |c2|^2. Because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

So |1+i|^2 is (1^2 +1^2) = 2. And |2-i|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1=5. So total squared magnitude is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7), because |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].

Wait, no. Wait, the original |alpha> is proportional to that, so the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because when you compute (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) = (1+1) + (4 +2i -2i +1) = 2 + (5) =7.

So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, we need to find the eigenstates of the operator A. Because the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A. So first, what is operator A?

The matrix representation of A is given as Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Since |up> and |down> are eigenstates of Sz (the z-projection spin operator), they might also serve as a basis here. So A is a 2x2 matrix.

Let me write A in matrix form. The basis is |up>, |down>, so for a 2x2 matrix:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because when i != j, the element is hbar/2, else zero. So diagonal elements are zero, off-diagonal are hbar/2.

Wait, no. Wait the matrix indices i and j. For a 2x2 matrix, elements are A11, A12, A21, A22. So A11 = 0 (since i=j=1), A12 = hbar/2 (i=1, j=2), A21 = hbar/2 (i=2,j=1), A22 =0.

So that's the matrix.

Now, to find the eigenstates of A. Because the eigenstates will determine the possible outcomes when we measure the operator A.

To find eigenstates, I need to solve the equation A |v> = a |v>, where a is the eigenvalue and |v> is the eigenvector.

The matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - a I) = 0.

The characteristic equation is |A - a I| = 0.

Calculating the determinant:

| -a      hbar/2   |
| hbar/2  -a       |

Which is (-a)(-a) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = a² - (hbar²/4) =0.

So eigenvalues are a^2 = hbar^2 /4 → a = ± hbar/2.

Wait, sorry, the determinant is (a²) - ( (hbar/2)^2 ), since (hbar/2)*(hbar/2) is (hbar^2)/4.

So equation: a² - (hbar^2 /4) =0 → a= ± hbar/2.

So eigenvalues are a_plus = hbar/2 and a_minus = -hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For a_plus = hbar/2:

(A - a_plus I) |v> =0.

The matrix becomes:

[ [ -hbar/2 , hbar/2 ],
  [ hbar/2 , -hbar/2 ] ]

So the equations are:

(-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → -v1 +v2 =0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvectors are any scalar multiples of (1, 1). So normalized, it's (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for a_minus = -hbar/2:

The matrix becomes:

[ [ hbar/2 , hbar/2 ],
  [ hbar/2 , hbar/2 ] ]

So the equations are:

(hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → v1 +v2=0 → v1 = -v2.

Eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1, -1). So normalized, it's (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates of A are:

|+A> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),

|-A> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

These are the states we'll measure when we measure the operator A.

Now, the given state |alpha> is expressed in the |up> and |down> basis. But we need to express it in terms of the eigenstates of A, so that we can find the probabilities.

Wait, but actually, it's the other way around. Since the measurement is of operator A, whose eigenstates are |+A> and |-A>, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square
