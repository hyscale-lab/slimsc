Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and honestly, it's a bit confusing, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. We're given the components of the operator P in the X, Y, and Z directions.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, meaning it has components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0,1] and second row [1,0]. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0,-i], second row [i,0]. P_z is (ħ/2) times a diagonal matrix with elements [1,0; 0,-1].

The question is to find the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P in the direction n, which is in the x-z plane. Hmm, wait, so the operator here is along an arbitrary direction, but since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So the direction vector n is some (x,0,z) direction.

Wait, but how does this work? Oh, right, the operator for spin along a direction n is given by the dot product of n with the Pauli matrices. So the operator P along n would be P · n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P · n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, the question is asking for the eigenvector of P along n. But wait, the operator P is given as a vector operator, but in the direction n, so the operator we're interested in is P·n. So I need to find the eigenvector of P·n with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the eigenvector of P itself, but I think that's not the case. No, the operator is along direction n. So the operator is P·n.
