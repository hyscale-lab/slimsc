Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's read it carefully. 

The question is about an electron in a state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Then, there's an operator whose matrix elements Aij are given: Aij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. I need to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of this operator and the average value of the operator.

Wait, first, I should figure out what the operator looks like. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because we're dealing with spin-up and spin-down), and Aij is hbar/2 when i≠j, and zero otherwise. So the matrix would be:

[0   (hbar/2)]
[(hbar/2) 0 ]

So it's a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonals and hbar/2 off-diagonal. That's interesting. Oh wait, this looks like a spin operator in the x or y direction? Or maybe it's a different operator. Hmm, but the point is, we need to find its eigenstates because the question is about measuring the state |alpha> in the eigenbasis of this operator.

But wait, the question says "the eigenstates of the operator," and we have to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of these eigenstates. So I think the first step is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this operator A. Because when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the squares of the amplitudes when you express the state in the eigenbasis.

So let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

The matrix A is:

[[0, hbar/2],
 [hbar/2, 0]]

Eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A - λI) = 0.

So the determinant is (0 - λ)^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = λ² - (hbar²/4) = 0.

So λ² = hbar² /4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

Wait, but the operator is A, which is [[0, a], [a, 0]] where a = hbar/2. So the eigenvalues are ±a√2? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute the determinant again.

Wait, the determinant equation is:

(0 - λ)(0 -
