Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons, so that must be lithium-6, right? Because Li typically has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons makes it Li-6.

So, first, I need to figure out the rest mass of this nucleus. I remember that the mass of a nucleus is a bit tricky because it's the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the binding energy, but for a rough calculation, maybe I can approximate using the individual masses.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I should look up the exact mass of lithium-6. Hmm, from what I recall, the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is similar, around 939 MeV/c². So, lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Let me calculate the total mass.

Protons: 3 * 938 = 2814 MeV/c².
Neutrons: 3 * 939 = 2817 MeV/c².
Total without binding: 2814 + 2817 = 5631 MeV/c². That's 5.631 GeV/c².

But wait, the actual mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of its parts because of the mass defect from binding energy. Oh right, so I need to find the actual rest mass of lithium-6. I'm not entirely sure about the exact value, but perhaps I can look it up mentally. I think the atomic mass of lithium-6 is about 6.017 atomic mass units (u). Oh wait, 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.017 u would be 6.017 * 931.5 ≈ let me calculate that.

6 * 931.5 is 5589, and 0.017 * 931.5 is about 15.8355, so together it's 5604.8355 MeV, or 5.6048 GeV/c².

So the rest
