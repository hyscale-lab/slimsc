Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also gave me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex here is CaY²-, where Y is the EDTA. So when EDTA complexes with Ca²+, the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be low because most of it is tied up in the complex.

Wait, the formation constant K is given. Formation constants are usually for the formation of the complex from its ions. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K for this reaction would be K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this problem, we're given the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So I think the initial condition is that the complex is 0.02 M, and we need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions.

Assuming that the solution is at ideal pH, so the EDTA is mostly in the Y^4- form. That's important because EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on pH, but with ideal pH, we can assume that the EDTA is deprotonated to Y^4-.

So the situation is that the solution is mostly the complex, which dissociates a little into Ca²+ and Y^4-. Because K is very large (5e10), the reaction heavily favors the formation of the complex. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low.

Let me think about the expression. Let's say the concentration of the complex is C, which is 0.02 M. Let's denote the concentration of free Ca²+ as x, and the concentration of free EDTA as y.

But wait, since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, and EDTA is in excess (I think), but wait, wait. Wait, the problem says it's a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So perhaps the initial condition is that only the complex is present, and it dissociates a bit.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is that the complex is formed by mixing Ca²+ and EDTA, but in this case, the complex is present at 0.02 M. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, the equilibrium expression would be:

K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But the complex is 0.02 M. Wait, but when it dissociates, [Ca²+]=x, [EDTA^4-]=y, and [CaEDTA^2-] is approximately 0.02 - x - y. But wait, because K is so large, x and y should be very small compared to 0.02. So [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02.

So, K ≈ 5e10 = (0.02) / (x * y)

But wait, in the complex, each mole of CaEDTA gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So when the complex dissociates, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are both x. Because for each x of Ca²+ released, same x of EDTA^4- is released.

Wait, no. Wait, the stoichiometry is 1:1. So if the complex dissociates, the amount of Ca²+ released is x, and the amount of EDTA^4- released is x. Because each complex gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

So, the concentrations at equilibrium would be:

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4-] = x

And [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 M (since x is very small compared to 0.02).

So plugging into K:

K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10

So,

0.02 / x² = 5e10

Solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) ) = (2 /5 ) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5?

Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me compute that.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2. The square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, because (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13. So sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5.

Wait, 10^-6.5 is the same as 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) = 1e-6 * (1/sqrt(10)) ≈ 3.16e-7.

So 2e-6.5 is approximately 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but why is [EDTA^4-] equal to x? Because each mole of complex dissociation gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

Alternatively, maybe the EDTA is in excess, so [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the initial concentration. But in this problem, the initial solution is only the complex. So unless EDTA is added in excess, which the problem doesn't state, the EDTA concentration would be x.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So perhaps the only species present is the complex, and it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

In that case, the initial concentrations before dissociation are: [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] = 0, [EDTA^4-] =0.

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x.

But again, because K is so large, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So the denominator is x^2, and K=0.02/(x^2)=5e10.

So x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13.

x=sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 6.32e-7.

Yes, that's option C.

Alternatively, someone might think that the concentration of EDTA is very high, so [EDTA^4-] is approximately the initial concentration. But in this problem, the initial concentration is only the complex. So if you have 0.02 M of CaEDTA, then if it dissociates x, the concentration of Ca²+ is x, and the concentration of EDTA^4- is x.

So the approach I took is correct.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M, and assuming ideal pH where EDTA is fully deprotonated (\(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\)), we let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) at equilibrium both be \(x\). Since \(K\) is very large, the dissociation of the complex is minimal, so \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\).

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

\[
x \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
