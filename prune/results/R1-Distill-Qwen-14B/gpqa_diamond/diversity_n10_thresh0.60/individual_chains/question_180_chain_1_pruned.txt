Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: There's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, okay. So I'm dealing with electrostatic potential energy here. Because the charges are either fixed or constrained, their potential energy contributions would add up based on their positions.

First, let's think about what potential energy we're dealing with. The formula for the electrostatic potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But wait, in this case, there are multiple charges. Since the system is isolated, we're probably looking at the total potential energy of the system due to all the charges interacting with each other.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are 2 meters away from P. So, each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th charge. Additionally, the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, but are they also at the same distance from each other? Hmm, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So perhaps they're arranged in a sphere around P, but their mutual distances would vary unless they're all at the same point, which isn't possible. Wait, but if the charges are identical and at same distance from P, but their arrangement isn't specified. Oh, but for the minimum energy, perhaps their mutual interactions contribute in a specific way.

Wait, but maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy due to the interactions between each of the 12 charges and the central charge at P. Because the other interactions between the 12 charges are more complicated, but perhaps they're not being considered here. Or wait, no. The problem says it's an isolated system of 13 particles, so the total potential energy includes all pairs.

Ah, I see. So the total potential energy will
