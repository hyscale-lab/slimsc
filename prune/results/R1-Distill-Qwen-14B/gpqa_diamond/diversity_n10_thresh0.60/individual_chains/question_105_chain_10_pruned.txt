Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. I remember that when stars have spots, it can mimic the effect of an exoplanet passing in front of them, causing dips in brightness. But I'm not too sure about the details, so I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So R_star is same as R_sun. But wait, the star's one hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. Oh, and the spots are cooler by 1000Kâ€”so the star's effective temperature is 6000K, making the spots 5000K?

The problem points out that when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing brightness variations. If the star didn't have spots, what radius exoplanet would produce the same brightness dip?

Wait, so the observed brightness variation is because of the spots, but we're supposed to find what exoplanet would cause the same signal. So I think I need to compare the dip in brightness caused by the spots and the dip from the planet transit.

But wait, how does the spot coverage affect the brightness? When the star rotates, spots come into and out of view. But since the spots are on one hemisphere, when that side is facing us, the brightness would dip a bit. But how much?

Alternatively, the star's brightness fluctuation due to the spots would be similar to a planet transiting the star, blocking some light. So I need to find the transit depth for the
