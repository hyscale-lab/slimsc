Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's important. The NMR data is given, and there are three reagents used in sequence. I need to find the final product from the options A to D. Let me break this down.

First, I'll look at the NMR data. The peaks are:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

I remember that a triplet around 9.7 ppm is likely an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm, and a triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, maybe on a double bond adjacent to the aldehyde?

Wait, but wait—another possibility is an aromatic proton next to an electronegative group, but 9.7 is pretty high. More likely an aldehyde. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group.

Looking at the other peaks: the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm doublets each integrating for 2H. Those could be two sets of aromatic protons, perhaps in a para-substituted benzene ring. The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H—could that be from a vinyl group or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution? Or maybe an -OCH2- group or something else.

The 3.66 ppm doublet (2H) is probably a methylene group (CH2) next to something electronegative, like an oxygen. Maybe an ether or an ester? Or perhaps an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2-O something.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (9)/2 = 4.5? Wait, that doesn't make sense because degrees of unsaturation should be whole numbers. Oh wait, maybe I did the calculation wrong.

Wait, the formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. C=8, H=9, X=0 (no halogens), N=1, O=1. So (2*8+2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees. That could be, say, two benzene rings (each with 3 double bonds is 3 each, but wait, benzene is one ring and three double bonds, so that's 4 degrees, but wait, no—each benzene ring is three double bonds, so that's 4 degrees (1
