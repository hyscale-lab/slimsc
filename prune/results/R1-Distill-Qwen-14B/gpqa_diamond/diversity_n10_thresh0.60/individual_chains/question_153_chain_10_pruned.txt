Okay, so I'm looking at this Michael addition problem, and I need to figure out what each reaction produces. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

First, let's understand what the Michael reaction is. From what I remember, the Michael addition is a nucleophilic addition to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, leading to a conjugate addition, and forms an enolate intermediate which is resonance-stabilized.

So, the problem has three parts, A, B, and C, each with different reactants and conditions. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with part A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a saponified ester. Wait, no, actually, malonate is a di-ester, so it's a good donor, right? It can act as a nucleophile in the Michael reaction. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw the structures.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. Wait, no, wait: the structure of acrylate is CH2=CH-COOR, right? So for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)COOEt? No, wait, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So the substituent on the α,β-unsaturated acrylate is the p-tolyl group. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt, but wait, no—3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl at the beta position. Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the formula for acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon, but wait, the numbering would start from the ester. Let me think. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt. So the carbonyl is the third carbon. So, the substituent at position 3 would be the p-tolyl.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the structure as CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt? No, that can't be because the ester is on the carbonyl. So, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OEt where the CH2=CH is the α,β-unsaturation, and the carbonyl is at the end. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? Wait, no, that would be 2-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Wait, maybe I'm over
