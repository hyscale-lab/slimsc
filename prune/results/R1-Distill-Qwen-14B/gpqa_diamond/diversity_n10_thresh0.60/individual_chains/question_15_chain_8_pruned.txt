Okay, so I've got this question about planet transits and which one is more likely to transit. Let me try to think through this step by step.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their orbits are circular.

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because usually, more massive stars are bigger, but here, they evolved a bit. Oh, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, which probably makes it a bit larger. But in this case, both have the same radius, which is a bit counterintuitive. Hmm.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on a few factors. The main formula I recall is that the probability P is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor involving the inclination.

Wait, actually, the transit probability is given by R*/a, where R* is the star's radius and a is
