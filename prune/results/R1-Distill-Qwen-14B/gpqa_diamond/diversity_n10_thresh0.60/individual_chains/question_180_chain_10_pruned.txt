Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let's see what it says. 

There are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh, wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. But wait, maybe I should just keep it as 2e for now to make calculations easier.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P has the 13th charge, and the other 12 are arranged around it, all at a distance of 2 meters. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. I remember that electric potential energy is involved here. Since the system is isolated, the potential energy should be calculated considering all the interactions between the charges.

Wait, potential energy in a system of charges... I think the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². 

But since there are multiple charges, I need to calculate the potential energy for each pair and sum them all up. But wait, how many pairs are there?

Let me think. There are 13 charges. The one at point P is fixed, so it's interacting with the other 12. Each of the 12 is at 2 meters from P. So, the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 is the same. 

But wait, each of the 12 charges is also interacting with each other, right? Because they're all at the same distance from P, but they're identical particles. So I have to consider the potential energy between each pair of the 12 as well.

So the total potential energy U_total is the sum of two parts: U1 is the energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, and U2 is the energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, because the fixed charge is at P, each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P. So for U1, each of the 12 has a charge 2e, and the fixed charge
