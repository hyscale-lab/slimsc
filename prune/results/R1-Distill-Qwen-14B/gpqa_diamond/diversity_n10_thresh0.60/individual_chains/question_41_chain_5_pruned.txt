Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's see. The setup is a light beam propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects how light propagates. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact principles here. Oh right, this probably involves special relativity because we're dealing with speeds relative to an observer, and the speed of light is a constant in all inertial frames.

So, normally, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But since the glass is moving, I need to think about how that motion affects the observed speed.

Wait, but in special relativity, the speed of light remains c in any inertial frame. Oh, but this is light moving through a medium. Does that change anything? Because I think when the medium itself is moving, it might influence the light's speed as measured in the lab frame.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the frame where the glass is moving. Let me think about how velocities add in relativity. Normally, velocities don't just add linearly; you use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, but the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving at speed v. The light beam is moving through the glass. So in
