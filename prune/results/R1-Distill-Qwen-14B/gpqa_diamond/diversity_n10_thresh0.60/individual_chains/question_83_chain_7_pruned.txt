Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking about the pH at two points: 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I need to understand what's happening here. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When they react, the acid will donate a proton to the hydroxide ion, forming water and the acetate ion. The reaction should be something like:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

So the first step is to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution.

The initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.05 M, and the volume is 20 cm³. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³ (0.040 L).

The moles of acetic acid initially are Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M × 0.020 L = 0.001 moles. Since we're adding equal volumes of water, the total volume doubles, so the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.040 L = 0.025 M. Wait, is that right? Because M1V1 = M2V2, so 0.05 M * 20 cm³ = M2 * 40 cm³ → M2 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point comes when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate that.

Moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.025 M * 0.040 L = 0.001 moles. So for equivalence, moles of NaOH needed are 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question is about pH at 25% titration and equivalence point. So first, let's handle the 25% point.

25% titration means that 25% of the required NaOH has been added. So the volume of NaOH added is 0.01 L * 0.25 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³.

Hmm, but wait, the initial volume of the solution is 40 cm³. When we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume becomes 42.5 cm³. We'll need to account for that when calculating concentrations.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of moles.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added = 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

Acetic acid: initial moles 0.001. After reaction with 0.00025 NaOH, moles of acetic acid left = 0.001 - 0.00
