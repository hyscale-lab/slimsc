Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on EDTA complexes, but I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. So the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions when it's in a complex with EDTA.

The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The K (formation constant) for this complex is 5x10^10. They’re asking for the concentration of calcium ions. The options are A to D, with some pretty varied numbers, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, what's the formula for EDTA complexes? I think EDTA forms a complex with metal ions in a 1:1 ratio. So each Ca^2+ ion binds with EDTA^4- to form the Ca-EDTA complex. The formula would be CaY^2- or something like that.

The formation constant, K, is given as 5x10^10. I remember that the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like:

Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

And Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-])

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says it's a stochiometric solution. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. That means all the calcium is tied up in the complex, right? Or no, because we're looking for the free calcium concentration.

So in a solution where the complex is formed, the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M. But because K is so large (5e10), the reaction heavily favors the formation of the complex. So the concentrations of free Ca^2+ and free EDTA^4- should be really low.

Wait, but in this case, the complex is at 0.02 M. Let me think. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, but it's in solution. So I can write the equilibrium expression.

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-])

But what's the relationship between [CaEDTA^2-], [Ca^2+], and [EDTA^4-]?

Also, considering that the complex is made in a 1:1 ratio, the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, and the sum of [Ca^2+] and [EDTA^4-] would be very small, but I think they’re related because each Ca^2+ comes from the dissociation of the complex.

Wait, more accurately, each mole of CaEDTA^2- can dissociate into one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.
