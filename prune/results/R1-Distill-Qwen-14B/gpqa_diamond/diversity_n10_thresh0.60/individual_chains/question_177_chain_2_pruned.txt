Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me see what the given information is.

Alright, the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, I'm not sure if the mass plays a role here. The question is about luminosity, so maybe mass isn't directly relevant unless it's used for something else, like determining the radius or temperature relation. Hmm.

The problem says that through spectroscopy, they found the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a star's emission is related to its temperature. I remember something called Wien's Law, which says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So, λ_max * T = constant. If both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same? Because if λ is the same, then T must be the same, because λ is proportional to 1/T. So T1 = T2. That's interesting.

Wait, but blackbody radiation also depends on the radius and temperature. The luminosity formula for a star (as a blackbody) is L = 4πR²σT⁴, right? Where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So since both stars have the same temperature, but different radii, their luminosities will depend on R².

So Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2. So plugging into the luminosity formula, L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ T^4, and L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T^4. So the ratio L1/L2 would be ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) / ( R2^2 ) ) = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. That would suggest the answer is A) ~2.25. But wait, the options say option D is ~2.23. Hmm
