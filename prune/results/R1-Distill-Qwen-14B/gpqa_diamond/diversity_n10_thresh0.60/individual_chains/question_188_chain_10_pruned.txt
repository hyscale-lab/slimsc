Okay, so I have this problem about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state physics, but let me try to work through it. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a specific plane in a rhombohedral crystal.

First, I remember that the interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is given by the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane indices. The general formula I think is d = (a) / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ), but wait, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, I recall another formula for rhombohedral systems.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal (a = b = c) and all angles equal (α = β = γ). So for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance formula might simplify. Let me think.

The general formula for interplanar spacing in any crystal system is d_{hkl} = a/(sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos θ + 2hl cos φ + 2kl cos ψ )) ), but I'm not exactly sure about the angles. Alternatively, I might be mixing it up with Miller indices.

Wait, maybe the formula for a rhombohedral system is simpler. Since all edges are equal and all angles are the same, perhaps the formula reduces. Oh right, I think for a rhombohedral system, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ), but I'm not 100% sure. Wait, no, because in a rhombohedral system, each face is a rhombus, so maybe the interplanar distance involves cosines of the angles between the axes.

Alternatively, I remember that for a cubic system (where α=β=γ=90 degrees), the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). But in this case, the angles are 30 degrees, which is not cubic, so we need a different approach.

The given problem is a rhombohedral crystal with a = 10 Angstrom and angles α=β=γ=30 degrees. We're to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

So, let's plug the (111) plane into the formula.

The formula I think is:
