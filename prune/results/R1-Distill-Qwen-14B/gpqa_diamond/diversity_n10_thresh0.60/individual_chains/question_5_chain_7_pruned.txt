Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through it step by step.

The question is about a muon's spin operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these has a matrix form multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So it's probably the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and each component here is a 2x2 matrix.

So, the operator along an arbitrary direction n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction cosines. Or wait, more precisely, the operator is the dot product of the Pauli vector (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) with the direction vector (n_x, n_y, n_z), multiplied by ħ/2.

But wait, n is in the x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since in spherical coordinates, θ is the angle from the z-axis. Wait, or is it (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? Let me think. If θ is the angle from the z-axis, then the direction cosines would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero or π, so sinφ is zero. So the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Hmm, no, wait. No, if the direction is in the x-z plane, φ is zero, yes. So the components would be (n_x, 0, n_z). The magnitude is 1, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ? Or maybe n_x = sinθ and n_z= cosθ? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: the standard spherical coordinates have θ from the z-axis. So a point on the equator (x-axis) would be θ=90 degrees, φ=0. So x= r sinθ cosφ, z= r cosθ. So
