Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, things are a bit different from classical mechanics. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So I need to calculate two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just simple subtraction, right? Because when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just say v_rel = v1 - v2. You have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh yeah, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, I think I might have that wrong. Let me recall: the correct formula for relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Or is it (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²)? Maybe u and v are the velocities as seen from different frames. Let me think. If astronaut A is moving at v1 = 0.6c and astronaut B at v2 = 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's frame, what is B's speed?

Wait, no, wait. If both are moving in the
