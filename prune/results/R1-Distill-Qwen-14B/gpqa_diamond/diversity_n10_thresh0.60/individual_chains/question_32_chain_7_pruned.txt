Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required to make a certain nucleus move at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says that nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, the atomic mass number would be 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So X is Li-6. That makes sense because isotopes are denoted by the mass number, so Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Alright, so I need to find the energy of RHIC such that the speed of this Li nucleus is 0.96c. RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so the energy here refers to the kinetic energy, I think. Or wait, sometimes in these problems, energy can refer to the total energy, which includes rest mass energy. Hmm. Wait, the question says "energy of the RHIC" so I think it's the kinetic energy because typically colliders are concerned with the kinetic energy imparted to the particles. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the total energy (relativistic energy) that includes rest mass.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". So perhaps the energy being referred to is the kinetic energy
