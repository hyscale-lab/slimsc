Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, it's about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y, producing a gas W and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. There's also something about a keto acid reacting with X to give a product with two oxygen atoms. Plus, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of it.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I'll try to identify each substance.

The reaction: X reacts violently with Y. Violent reactions often involve strong acids or bases. Maybe Y is water? But then, what would X be? Alternatively, Y could be a liquid like liquid ammonia or maybe something like bromine water. Wait, but another thought: reacting violently could be like a metal reacting with an acid. For example, sodium reacting with water, but that's not very violent. Maybe something more reactive, like potassium?

Wait, the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the molecule is probably something like H2O, NH3, CO2, etc. Let me think: H2O has 8 neutrons (for O-16) and 2 protons (H is 1 each) but wait, the total for H2O is 2 H and 16 O. The total protons: 2*(1) + 8 = 10. Neutrons: 8 (O) + 0 (H) = 8. Wait, same number? 10 and 8? No, so that's not it. Hmm.

Another possibility: CO2. Carbon has 6 protons, oxygen has 8. CO2 has 6 protons and 16 (8*2) neutrons in the molecule. Wait, so 6 vs 16? Not same. Hmm. What about CH4? Protons: 6 (C) +4*(1)=10. Neutrons: 6 (if C is 12, 6 neutrons) + 4*0 =6. So 10 and 6, not same. Wait, maybe NH3? NH3 has 14 (N:7 protons) + 3*(1) =17 protons. Neutrons: N is 7, so 7 neutrons? Wait, no, NH3 has 14-7=7 neutrons for N, and H has 0, so total neutrons is 7. Protons: 14 +3=17. Not same. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe W is O2? O2 molecule has 8 protons each, so 16 in total. Neutrons: each O is 8, so 16 total. Oh! So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That's same. So W could be O2. But wait, would X reacting with Y release O2? Let's think about substances that release O2 when reacting. That's usually when there's a decomposition reaction, maybe. Alternatively, if X is a peroxide, like H2O2. Then, when it
