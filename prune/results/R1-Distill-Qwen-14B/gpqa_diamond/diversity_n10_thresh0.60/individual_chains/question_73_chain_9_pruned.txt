Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, the question gives me their masses: one is 2m and the other is 3m. Oh right, but in relativity, mass increases with speed, so I can't just use the rest mass. Oh, but wait, in relativity, when they're moving at high speeds, their relativistic mass is gamma times their rest mass. But wait, actually, I'm a bit confused. Because in modern physics, people often use energy and momentum in terms of four-vectors, but for this problem, maybe I can use the relativistic addition formulas for velocities and the total energy.

Let me read the question again. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. So astronaut A has speed v1 = 0.6c, mass m1 = 2m, and astronaut B has v2 = 0.5c, mass m2 = 3m.

First part: the relative speed between them. I think that's the relative velocity as seen from one astronaut's frame. Oh wait, but which one? No, wait the question says "the relative speed", so probably the speed of one relative to the other. So I need to calculate the relative velocity between astronaut A and astronaut B.

Wait, to find the relative velocity, I can't just subtract because they're moving at significant fractions of c. I have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). So let me plug in the numbers.

v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. So approximately 0.14c when rounded. So that would match options C and D because their v_rel is 0.14c.

Wait, but wait a
