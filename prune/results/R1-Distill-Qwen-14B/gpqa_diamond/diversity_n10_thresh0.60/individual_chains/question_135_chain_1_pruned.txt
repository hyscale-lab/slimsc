Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X, given a specific interaction Lagrangian and its mass.

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ_f̄(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, the Lagrangian describes the interactions between particles. So here, the boson X is interacting with some fermion ψ_f.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to find out which decays are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different possible fermion-antifermion pairs.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the energy must be sufficient for the decay products. Since X is a boson, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. But the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of each fermion in the pair because energy and momentum must be conserved.

So first, I should figure out which fermions have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV (because 6 GeV is the mass of X, so each fermion should be at most 3 GeV).

Let me list the masses of the known fermions:

- Up quark (u): around 2 MeV (so way below 3 GeV)
- Down quark (d): about 5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): about 100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): roughly 1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- Electron (e-): 0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ-): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ-): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are very light, but I don't think they're options here.

Wait, the decay products are listed as pairs like b bbar, c cbar, etc., but for neutrinos, since they are leptons, but their masses are negligible. However, the interaction here is between X and fermions ψ_f. So the Lagrangian must be coupling X to some specific fermions.

Looking at the Lagrangian again: L = -λf ψ_f̄ (υ + X) ψ_f. So ψ_f must be a fermion, perhaps a quark, because the interaction is with X. Wait, the ψ is a spinor, so it's a Dirac fermion. The term ψ_f̄ X ψ_f would imply that X is a scalar (since it's just multiplying the spinors, no derivatives or anything). So X is a scalar boson, perhaps similar to the Higgs.

Wait, wait, the Lagrangian is written as -λf ψ_f̄ (υ + X) ψ_f. So this looks like a Yukawa interaction term. The Yukawa coupling would give
