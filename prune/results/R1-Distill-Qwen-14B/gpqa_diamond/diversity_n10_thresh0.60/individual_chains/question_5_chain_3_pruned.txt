Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator corresponding to a specific eigenvalue. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The operator in question is P, which is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. I remember that in quantum mechanics, these operators correspond to the components of angular momentum, but scaled by ħ/2. Oh wait, I think for spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices are involved. Right, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices that represent the spin operators scaled by ħ/2.

The problem states that the muon's operator is given for each component. Let me write down each component matrix:

- P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. That looks familiar—it's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2.
- P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix times ħ/2.
- P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix times ħ/2.

So, the operator vector P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, n is in the x-z plane, so its direction can be represented with an angle θ from the x-axis, I suppose. But since it's arbitrary, maybe the eigenvector will depend on θ.

The eigenvector we need is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So we're looking at the case where P · n (the component along direction n) has eigenvalue ħ/2.

Wait, but wait. The operator in the direction n is the dot product of P with the unit vector n. So, if n is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since n lies in the x-z plane, φ would be zero. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator P_n is P · n.

So the operator P · n would be (P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ) because the y-component of n is zero.

So, P · n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] +
