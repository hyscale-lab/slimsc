Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, it's about selecting the right reagents for two reactions.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when it reacts with NaCN, what's happening here? Oh yeah, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones typically react with nucleophiles in a specific way. So when you add something like HCN or NaCN to a ketone, it should form a cyanohydrin. Right, cyanohydrin formation. That's where the nitrile group adds, and a hydroxyl group is added as well.

But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure should be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the nitrile is added to the carbonyl carbon, and the hydroxyl is attached there too. So the first step is the formation of a cyanohydrin from the ketone.

So what reagents are needed for that? Cyanohydrin formation usually involves using a strong acid as a catalyst. Like H2SO4 or H3O+ maybe. Because the acid helps in the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, so the CN
