Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. And |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I'm dealing with spin-1/2 particles here, since those are the typical eigenstates for spin in the z-direction.

The question asks me to calculate two things: the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator has a matrix representation given by Aij elements. Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, so what's the matrix look like? For a two-level system, the matrix would be a 2x2. The diagonals are zero because when i=j, Aij=0. And off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix is:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, this is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and here each off-diagonal is hbar/2. So the operator A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of this operator A. Let me remember what sigma_x's eigenstates look like. The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. Because sigma_x flips the spin states.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as sigma_x's, except scaled by hbar/2. So their eigenvalues would be (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), because sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

Now, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. But wait, because it's proportional, I'll need to normalize it. So first, let me write |alpha> as a normalized vector.

The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2 - i) for |down
