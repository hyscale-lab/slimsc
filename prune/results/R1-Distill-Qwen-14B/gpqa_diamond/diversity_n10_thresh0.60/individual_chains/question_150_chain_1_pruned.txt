Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. The NMR data is given, and then it's reacted through a series of reagents. I need to figure out what the final product is from the options provided.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The peaks are:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Wait, what does each of these signals represent? Let's break them down.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t). That's a high chemical shift, so probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe it's adjacent to a CH2 group? Because if the aldehyde is at the end, the neighboring could be CH2, which would split it into a triplet.

Next, 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are doublets each with 2H. These are likely aromatic protons. The downfield shift (6.98) could be para-substituted phenyl groups, maybe with electron-withdrawing groups. The 6.51 might be another set of aromatic protons, perhaps ortho to substituents.

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like OH protons, but wait, it's 2H. Maybe it's a conjugated system, like a vinyl proton? Or perhaps adjacent to an oxygen, like a dienol?

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's in the range for a CH2 group next to an oxygen, maybe an ether or an alkoxy group. Since it's a doublet, each of those H's is coupling with one H on each adjacent carbon. Wait, but if it's a CH2, each H would have adjacent H's. But in a CH2 group, each H is next to another H, so maybe it's a geminal coupling? Or perhaps it's a CH2 connected to something else, like an oxygen. Like OCH2CH2, but I'm not sure.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something with a benzaldehyde group, given the aldehyde peak, but wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a cinnamaldehyde derivative, but let me think.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, N=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2= 9/2=4.5, which doesn't make sense. Oh wait, I must have
