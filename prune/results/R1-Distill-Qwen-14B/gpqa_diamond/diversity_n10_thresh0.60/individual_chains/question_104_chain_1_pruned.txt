Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The star moves towards and away from us, causing the spectral lines to shift.

The question says that two stars have the same mass, each similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune, so their masses are the same. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star, right? So the shift in wavelength (or equivalently, velocity) relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital parameters.

I think the key formula here is the one that relates the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) to the orbital period (P), the mass of the planet (M_p), the mass of the star (M_s), and the orbital distance (a). 

The formula I remember is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (P)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) ) ) * (1 / (2π * (1)) ) )

Wait, that's a bit complicated. But since the planets
