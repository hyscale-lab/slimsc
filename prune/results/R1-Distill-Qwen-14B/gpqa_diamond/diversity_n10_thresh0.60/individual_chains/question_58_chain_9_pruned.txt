Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again.

The question is: Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?

The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm. Right, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinite integrals or other infinities that pop up. The idea is to make these terms finite by introducing a cutoff or some other method, and then take the cutoff to infinity in the end, or maybe subtract the divergences somehow. But wait, not all theories need this, right?

So let's go through each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a bit different. Strings are one-dimensional objects, and they vibrate at different frequencies, which gives rise to particles. I remember that string theories are background-dependent and require a lot of dimensions. But wait, do they need regularization? I think string theory deals with high energies, like the Planck scale, but maybe because it's a theory of everything, it doesn't have the same divergences as other QFTs. Or perhaps because it's a theory that incorporates gravity, it handles things differently. Alternatively, maybe string theories do use regularization methods, but perhaps they don't require it in the same way as others? Hmm, I'm not too sure on this one.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I know
