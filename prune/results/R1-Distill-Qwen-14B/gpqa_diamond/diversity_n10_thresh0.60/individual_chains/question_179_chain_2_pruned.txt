Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about matrices and their properties. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question provides four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. I need to evaluate the statements in the options and pick the correct one.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues, which correspond to real measurement outcomes. Also, the evolution operator (time evolution) is a unitary matrix. Unitary matrices have the property that their inverse is equal to their conjugate transpose.

So, looking at each option:

Option A: "There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes." The exponential of a matrix e^X is often used in the context of quantum operations. If X is a Hermitian matrix, then e^X would be unitary, right? Wait, no. Wait, wait. If X is Hermitian, then e^{iX} would be unitary. Because for a Hermitian H, e^{iH} is unitary since (e^{iH})† = e^{-iH} = e^{iH}^{-1}.

But wait, X might not necessarily be Hermitian. Let me check matrix X. X is given as:

i   -1    2i
1    0     1
2i  -1   -i

To check if X is Hermitian, X must equal its conjugate transpose. So, let's compute X†.

The conjugate of X's elements:
i becomes -i, 
-1 stays -1 (since it's real),
2i becomes -2i,
1 is 1,
0 is 0,
1 is 1,
2i becomes -2i,
-1 stays -1,
-i becomes i.

Now, the transpose of X would swap elements across the diagonal. So X† should be:

- -i   1   -2i
- -1    0    -1
- -2i   1    i

Original X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Comparing X and X†, they don't look the same. For example, (X)1,1 is i, but (X†)1,1 is -i. So X is not Hermitian. So e^X would not be unitary, because if X were skew-Hermitian (X† = -X), then e^X would be unitary. Wait, but is X skew-Hermitian? Let me see.

Skew-Hermitian means X† = -X.

Looking at X, let's compute -X:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1,0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Compare with X†:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1,0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Wait, that's exactly -X. Because X is:

i   -1    2i
1    0     1
2i  -1   -i

So, -X would be:

-i   1   -2i
-1    0    -1
-2i  1    i

Which matches X†. So X is skew-Hermitian. Skew-Hermitian matrices have the property that e^X is unitary. Because for a skew-Hermitian S, S† = -S. So e^S is unitary because (e^S)† = e^{S†} = e^{-S} = e^S^{-1}.

Wait, but S skew-Hermitian implies that iS is Hermitian because (iS)† = -i S† =
