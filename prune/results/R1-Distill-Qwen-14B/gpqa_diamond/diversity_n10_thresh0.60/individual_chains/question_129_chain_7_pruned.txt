Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions. Let me read the problem again carefully and jot down the key points.

So, the reaction sequence is:

Compound A → HCN → Compound B
Compound B → H2, Pd → Compound C
Compound C → HNO2 → Compound D
Compound D → elimination of inert gas → Compound E

And there are two hints provided. Let's start by analyzing each step and the hints.

First, looking at the reaction steps. The first step is A reacting with HCN to form B. HCN is a nucleophile, and when it reacts with carbonyl compounds, it typically adds to the carbonyl group. So maybe A is a ketone or an aldehyde. But wait, the product B after HCN addition... If A is a ketone, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an ester or another carbonyl-containing compound, HCN could add there too.

Moving on, the second step is B being reduced with H2 and Pd. Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Since B has a CN group (from HCN addition), reduction of nitriles with H2 and a catalyst like Pd usually gives amines. Wait, no, wait. I think when nitriles are hydrogenated, they typically form amines, but maybe under certain conditions they can form alkanes. Hmm, wait, no. Let me think. H2 and Pd would typically reduce nitrile groups (-CN) to amines (-CH2NH2), but sometimes under different conditions, like with more vigorous hydrogenation, maybe it goes further. Or perhaps I'm confusing the catalysts. Wait, another possibility: if B is a nitrile, maybe the hydrogenation reduces it to a primary amine. So B would be a nitrile, so A must have a carbonyl group that when reacted with HCN forms a nitrile.

Wait, but what if the initial compound is an aldehyde or ketone. For example, if A is a cyclic ketone, then HCN addition would form a cyanohydrin, which is a vicinal diol with a cyano group attached. But then, when that's hydrogenated, perhaps the nitrile group converts into an amine. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation is adding hydrogen to double bonds, perhaps if B has a double bond.

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's look at the hints.

Hint a: Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting a phosphorus ylide with an aldehyde or ketone. So if A reacts with a ylide to form an alkene, then A must be a carbonyl compound. The product given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me try to parse that structure.

So the product
