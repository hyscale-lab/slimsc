Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the decay of a boson X, and the options are various possible decay channels. I remember that in particle physics, the possible decays depend on the mass of the boson and the masses of the particles it can decay into.

The given Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that. Oh, right, the interaction term is λ times the field X(y) sandwiched between two fermion fields ψ_f. So X is a boson field interacting with fermions via Yukawa coupling, I think. The Yukawa interaction typically looks like g ψ ψ X, where g is the coupling constant.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, it can produce fermion-antifermion pairs. The rule is that the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So for X → f f̄, each fermion's mass must be less than half of X's mass. Because if each is m, then 2m must be ≤ M_X.

So M_X is 6 GeV. Let me think about the fermion masses. The known fermion masses are approximately:

- Up and down quarks: light, around a few MeV. So definitely less than 3 GeV each. That's good.

- Strange quark: about 100 MeV, so also fine.

- Charm quark: around 1.5 GeV. So 2m_c is about 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into c c̄.

- Bottom quark: mass around 4.5 GeV. So 2m_b would be 9 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄.

- Top quark: way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So no decay into t t̄ either.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the X is a boson, like a scalar, so when it decays, it must produce a pair of identical particles. Since fermions must come in pairs (like quark and antiquark or lepton and antilepton), but wait, the fermions are Dirac particles, so each has their own mass.

So fermions that X can decay into must have mass less than 3 GeV each. Let me list the possible fermions:

Leptons: electrons (m ~ 0.0005 GeV), muons (0.1 GeV), taus (1.77 GeV), and their antiparticles. For tau, 2m_tau is about 3.54 GeV, which is less than 6? Wait, wait, wait. No, wait: 2 * 1.77 GeV is 3.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into tau pairs.

Similarly, for
