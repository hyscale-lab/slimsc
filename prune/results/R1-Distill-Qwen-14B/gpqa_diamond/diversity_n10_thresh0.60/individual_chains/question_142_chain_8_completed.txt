Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix rho, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical mixture. So this rho is a density matrix for a qubit, right?

Wait, what's the geometrical position of a density matrix in qubit space? I think qubit space is represented as a Bloch sphere. Each point on the Bloch sphere corresponds to a possible state of the qubit. But wait, density matrices aren't pure states; they can be mixed. So how does that translate?

I remember that a pure state |psi><psi| can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The density matrix rho for a mixed state can be represented as a point inside the Bloch sphere, with the position indicating the state. But wait, I'm not sure about that. Maybe I'm mixing things up.

Let me think. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is a 2x2 matrix. It's usually written as rho = [[a, b], [c, d]]. Since rho must be Hermitian, b must equal c^*, and the trace is 1 (since Tr(rho) = 1). Also, rho has to be positive semi-definite, which means its eigenvalues are non-negative.

The given rho is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me compute this. |0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], so when multiplied by 1/2, rho is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So rho is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements as 0.5.

Wait, this looks like a completely mixed state. Because for a qubit, the completely mixed state has equal probabilities for both states |0> and |1>, which is exactly what this rho is. The eigenvalues of rho would both be 0.5, right? Because the matrix is diagonal with those entries. So the eigenvalues are 0.5 and 0.5.

Now, the Bloch sphere representation for a density matrix. I think the density matrix rho can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r. The general form is rho = (I + r·sigma)/2, where sigma are the Pauli matrices and r is a 3D vector. The vector r determines the position on the Bloch sphere.

So if I can express the given rho in that form, I can find r. Let me compute that for the given rho.

Given rho is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So (I + r·sigma)/2 equals [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Let me write sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z.

Sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Sigma_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
Sigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

The dot product r·sigma is r_x sigma_x + r_y sigma_y + r_z sigma_z.

So, r·sigma = [ [r_z, r_x - i r_y], [r_x + i r_y, -r_z] ]

Adding I gives:

I + r·sigma = [[1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y],[r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z]]

Divide by 2, we get:

rho = [[ (1 + r_z)/2, (r_x - i r_y)/2 ],
        [ (r_x + i r_y)/2, (1 - r_z)/2 ] ]

Compare this with our given rho, which is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Looking at the off-diagonal terms: (r_x - i r_y)/2 must equal 0. So r_x - i r_y = 0. Which implies r_x = 0 and r_y = 0. Because if a complex number a + ib = 0, then both a and b are zero.

So r_x = 0, r_y = 0.

Now, the diagonal terms: (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 and (1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5.

Let me solve for r_z. Take the first equation:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Similarly, the second equation: (1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 - r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

So r_z is zero. Therefore, the vector r is (0, 0, 0).

Wait, but let me think again. The given rho is a completely mixed state. So in the Bloch sphere, the completely mixed state is at the center, right? Because any movement along the axes would mean a polarized state in that direction. So the density matrix for the completely mixed state is (I/2), which would correspond to r = (0,0,0). So yes, that makes sense.

So looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). Option B is (0,0,1), which would be the state |0> if I'm not mistaken, but wait, no, the state |0> is represented by rho = |0><0| = [[1,0],[0,0]], which is different. So in this case, the rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is the completely mixed state, at the center of the Bloch sphere.

So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This matrix is diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to \(0.5\), which represents a completely mixed state for a qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector that determines the position of the state in the Bloch sphere.

For the given \(\rho\), we compute:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 + r_z & r_x - i r_y \\ r_x + i r_y & 1 - r_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\), we find:

1. The off-diagonal terms \((r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0\), which implies \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\).
2. The diagonal terms \((1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5\) and \((1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5\), which imply \(r_z = 0\).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the completely mixed state at the center of the Bloch sphere. This matches option C.

Answer: C
