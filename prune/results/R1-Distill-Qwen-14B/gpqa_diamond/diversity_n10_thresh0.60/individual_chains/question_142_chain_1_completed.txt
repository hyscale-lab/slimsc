Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, a density matrix is a way to represent the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states.

I remember that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented in terms of the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of a qubit state, where pure states are points on the surface and mixed states are inside.

Let me recall how the density matrix relates to the Bloch vector. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x, y, z). Each component of r corresponds to the expectation value of the respective Pauli matrix.

So, for the given ρ, it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me expand each term. |0⟩⟨0| is the outer product, which would be a matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is 1 in (1,1) position. Adding them gives a diagonal matrix with 1s in both diagonal positions. Dividing by 2, the diagonal becomes [1/2, 1/2], and the off-diagonal elements are zero.

So ρ is a diagonal matrix:
[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Now, comparing this to the general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let's compute I/2, which is (1/2) times the identity matrix:
I/2 = [[1/2, 0],
        [0, 1/2]]

Wait, so if ρ equals I/2, then adding r·σ must contribute zero. Because I/2 plus (r·σ)/2 equals ρ. So if ρ is I/2, then (r·σ)/2 must be zero matrix. That implies r·σ is the zero matrix.

What does r·σ mean here? It's the sum xσx + yσy + zσz. So each of these terms multiplied by their respective components. The σ matrices are:
σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

If r is (x,y,z), then r·σ is:
x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + y * [[0,-i],[i,0]] + z * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Now, for (r·σ)/2 to be zero, each component must result in a zero matrix when added. So each term must individually be zero?

Wait, no. Because the sum of these matrices should be the zero matrix. So for each element in the matrix, the sum should be zero.

Let me compute r·σ. Let me write out the matrix:

[ x*0 + y*0 + z*1 , x*1 + y*(-i) + z*0 ]
[ x*1 + y*i + z*0 , x*0 + y*0 + z*(-1) ]

Which simplifies to:
[ z, x - iy ]
[ x + iy, -z ]

If r·σ is zero matrix, all elements must be zero.

So:

z = 0
x - iy = 0
x + iy = 0
-z = 0 → z=0 again.

From the second equation, x - iy =0 → x = iy. The third equation says x + iy =0 → substituting x=iy, we have iy + iy = 0 → 2iy=0 → y=0. Then x=iy=0.

So x=0, y=0, z=0. So r is (0,0,0). That's the origin in the Bloch sphere.

So the density matrix ρ here represents a completely mixed state, which is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Its Bloch vector is at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This is a diagonal matrix:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch sphere representation as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), it is evident that:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

which implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This means the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero, i.e., \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which lies at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

From the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the Bloch vector is at the origin.

Answer: C
