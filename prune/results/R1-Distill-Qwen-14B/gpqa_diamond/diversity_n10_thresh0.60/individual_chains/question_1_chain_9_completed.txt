Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might overlap and not be distinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or perhaps, since each state has its own uncertainty, the minimum difference should be greater than the uncertainty of each.

Wait, let me think. The energy uncertainty for each state is ΔE = ħ / τ. So for E1, ΔE1 is ħ/(1e-9 s), and for E2, ΔE2 is ħ/(1e-8 s). Let me compute these.

Wait, but I need to calculate the energy in eV. Because the options are in eV. So, let's compute both ΔE1 and ΔE2.

First, ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

We need to convert this into eV·s. I remember that 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1 eV·s = 1.602e-19 J·s.

So, ħ in eV·s is (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ) ≈ 6.56e-16 eV·s.

So, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.56e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) ) = 6.56e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = (6.56e-16) / (1e-8) = 6.56e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 6.56e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.56e-8 eV.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So for two levels to be clearly distinguishable, the energy difference ΔE between them should be larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy multiplied by some factor, perhaps the Heisenberg criterion for distinguishability. The minimum energy resolution is determined by the uncertainty principle.

So the idea is that the energy difference must be greater than the combined uncertainty of both states. So ΔE >= ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but wait, since the two states are separate, perhaps the energy difference just needs to be greater than the uncertainty of each. Or perhaps the sum. Alternatively, maybe the energy difference needs to be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy uncertainty is related to the lifetime of the state. So each state has an uncertainty in energy of about ħ/(tau). So, to resolve two states, the energy difference must exceed the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the combined uncertainty, the two states might not be distinguishable.

So let's compute the sum: ΔE1 + ΔE2 = (6.56e-7) + (6.56e-8) = approximately 7.216e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be more than about 7.2e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → way too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 0.1e-3, which is much larger than 7e-7. So that's way bigger.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.01e-6 → still smaller than 7e-7.

So the only option where ΔE is bigger than 7.2e-7 eV is option C: 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: perhaps the energy difference just needs to be bigger than the individual uncertainties of each state. Because each state's energy has an uncertainty. So for E1, the uncertainty is about 6.56e-7 eV, and E2 is 6.56e-8 eV. So if the difference between E1 and E2 is larger than the maximum of these two, then perhaps it's sufficient. Because, for example, if the difference is larger than the higher uncertainty, then the two states would be resolvable.

Wait, but let's think about it. If you have two states, say one with a very narrow peak (high τ, low ΔE) and another with a broad peak (low τ, high ΔE), the width of the peaks is determined by their respective ΔE. So the separation between the peaks needs to be greater than the sum of their half-widths to be resolvable. Because if the separation is less than the sum, the peaks might overlap.

Wait, but in the energy-time uncertainty, the uncertainty for each state is ΔE = ħ/τ, so each energy level has a certain width. So for two levels, the minimum separation ΔE between them should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, ΔE1 + ΔE2. Because if the separation is smaller than the sum, the two levels might overlap and not be distinguishable.

So in this case, the sum is roughly 7.2e-7 eV, so the difference must be larger than that. So looking at the options, only option C is larger than that.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV → which is way bigger than 7.2e-7 eV.

So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar
\]

Here, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \Delta E \) is the energy uncertainty. For the two states, the lifetimes are \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The energy uncertainties are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.56 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{6.56 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) must be greater than the sum of their energy uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

\[
\Delta E > 6.56 \times 10^{-7} + 6.56 \times 10^{-8} = 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

Now, we compare this threshold with the given options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so this is also insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition for clear distinguishability is **C**.
