Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me look at each reaction and the options provided.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that when a ketone reacts with sodium cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition reaction. The ketone's carbonyl group gets attacked by the cyanide ion. So the product is a cyanohydrin, which has a hydroxyl and a cyano group added to the same carbon where the carbonyl was.

Wait, but the first product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it adds NaCN, the cyanide would add to the carbonyl carbon, so the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That structure matches 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that's correct.

So the first reaction is forming a cyanohydrin. The reagent used is NaCN, which provides the CN- nucleophile. But wait, what's the role of reagent A here? Oh, because sometimes the reaction conditions might involve acid or base. I think the addition of NaCN to ketones typically occurs under acidic conditions because the acid protonates the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic. So the reaction might be done in an acidic environment. So in the first step, maybe A is H3O+? Because that would provide the acidic conditions needed for the nucleophilic attack.

Moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is the corresponding butanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.

How does that happen? I recall that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under
