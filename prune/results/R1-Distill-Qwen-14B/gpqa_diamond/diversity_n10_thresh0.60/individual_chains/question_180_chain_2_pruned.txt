Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. And their mass is negligible. Now, 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the potential energy between point charges can be calculated using Coulomb's law formula. The formula for potential energy U between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

Since there are multiple charges, I think we'll need to calculate the potential energy between each pair of charges and sum them all up. Because in a system of charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

So the setup is 12 charges at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th charge is at the center, and all the other 12 are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 meters around it.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of these 12 is at a distance of 2m from P. So the distance between the fixed charge (at P) and each of the 12 is 2m. But what about the distance between each of the 12 charges themselves? Are they all at the same distance from each other?

Well, if they're all on a sphere of radius 2m, the distance between any two charges on the sphere isn't the same as 2m. Oh wait, wait. No, the distance between two points on the sphere depends on their separation. If they're all at the same radius, but arranged in some way on the sphere's surface, the distance between any two would be the chord length, which depends on the angle between them.

But wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying things, maybe assuming that the 12 charges are arranged symmetrically, so that each is at the same potential and maybe we can calculate the average or something. Or perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge, and not considering the interactions between the 12 charges themselves. That would make the problem easier, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, no. In a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So we have to calculate all possible pairs.

So, the charges: 13 in total. The 13th is fixed at P. The 12 others are each at 2 meters from P. So the 13th charge is at P, and each of the 12 is 2 meters away.

Now, the potential energy contributions come from two types of pairs: between the fixed charge and each of the 12,
