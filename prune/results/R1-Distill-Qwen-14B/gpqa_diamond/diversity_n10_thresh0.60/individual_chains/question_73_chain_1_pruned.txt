Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I've studied some relativity before, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem states that there are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c. The second has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two velocities, right? Oh right, because of the velocity addition formula. I remember it's something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Let me get that formula right. Oh wait, no—actually, if both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, wait. Wait, let me think again. No, wait, no: if object A is moving at u and object B is moving at v, both in the same direction, then the speed of A relative to B would be (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). So in our case, u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. So the relative speed would be (0.6c -0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

So, the numerator is 0.1
