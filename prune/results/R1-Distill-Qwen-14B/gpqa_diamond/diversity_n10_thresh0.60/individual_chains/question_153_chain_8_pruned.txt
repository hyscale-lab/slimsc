Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three separate reactions, A, B, and C, and I need to determine the major products for each. Then, I'll match them with the options given.

Let's start with reaction A. The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diester with enolizable protons. It can form an enolate which attacks the beta position of another molecule.

So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3, but wait, actually, wait. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituents on the double bond in the trans configuration. The structure would be CH2-C(=O)OCH3 attached to a p-tolyl group via the double bond. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, with the substituents being OCH3 (from the acrylate) and p-tolyl on opposite sides.

When the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the beta carbon (the middle carbon in the double bond), it would add to that position. The malonate has two ester groups, so I think the attack would lead to a conjugate addition. The product after the addition would form a new carbon-carbon bond. So the dimethyl malonate (which is (CH3)2C(COOCH3)2) will form an enolate, which attacks the acrylate.

Wait, no. Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CHCH2? Or wait, no. Wait, malonate is (CH2C(COO-)2). So dimethyl malonate would be CH2(COOCH3)2. So the structure is CH2 with two carboxylate groups attached, each as methyl esters.

When the enolate forms, the base (NaOEt) deprotonates the alpha position (the CH2 becomes a CH- with a negative charge). Then, this enolate attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the acrylate is something like CH2-C(=O)OCH3 connected to p-tolyl via the double bond. Wait, maybe it's more accurate to structure it as CH2-C(=O)OCH2-Ph (p-tolyl) but in the E configuration.

Wait, no, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3, but the substituents are on the double bond. Wait, no, the correct
