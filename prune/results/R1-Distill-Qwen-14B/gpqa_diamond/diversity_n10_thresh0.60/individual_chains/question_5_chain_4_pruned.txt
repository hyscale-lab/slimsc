Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue corresponds to +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, P_z, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. I need to find the normalized eigenvector elements.

Hmm, I remember that the operator P is the angular momentum operator. Since the particle is a muon, which is a lepton, I think it's spin-1/2. So P has eigenvalues ±ħ/2 for each component. But here, we're looking for the eigenvector where the eigenvalue is +ħ/2 when acting along the direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, the operator along an arbitrary direction n would be a combination of P_x, P_y, and P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, the direction can be described by an angle θ from the z-axis, but there's no φ dependence because it's in the plane. So the operator P along direction n would be:

P = P_z cosθ + P_x sinθ, because in the x-z plane, the y-component (P_y) wouldn't be involved since the direction doesn't have a y-component. Or wait, no, wait. The general direction for a unit vector n = (nx, ny, nz) would have the operator P·n = nx P_x + ny P_y + nz P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, ny=0, so P·n = nx P_x + nz P_z.

Right, and n is a unit vector, so nx² + nz² = 1. So we can write nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ, where θ is the angle between n and the z-axis.

So the operator P·n is (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z.

I need to find the eigenvectors of this operator corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but the given components of P are:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So let's write out P·n.

P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] → [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] → [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding them:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So P·n is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

So the matrix is (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ
