Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a start. The NMR data is given, which should help in figuring out the structure. Then, it undergoes a series of reactions, and I need to find the final product from the options.

First, the reagents: The first step is NaNO2 and HCl. Oh wait, I remember that's usually for diazotization. Like, when you have an aromatic amine, especially a primary one, you treat it with nitrous acid (from NaNO2 and HCl) to form a diazonium salt. But wait, the compound has a molecular formula with an NO group. Oh, so the compound probably has a nitro group or an amino group? Because the molecular formula has an N and an O. Let me check: C8H9NO. The degrees of unsaturation might help. Let's calculate that.

Degrees of unsaturation formula: Degrees = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is halogens, which is zero here. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So 5 degrees. That could be from, say, a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and an amine or something (maybe another double bond or ring, but maybe not). Hmm.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm as a triplet, integrating 1H. That's a high shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. So that's the aldehyde group.

Then, 6.98 ppm, a doublet with 2H. 6.51 ppm, another doublet with 2H. Those are probably from a para-substituted aromatic ring, like a benzene ring with substituents in para positions. Because each is a doublet, so each H is next to one substituent. So maybe two aromatic rings, each with substituents in the para positions.

Then, 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet with 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH group or perhaps an enol tautomer. But wait, it's 2H, so maybe two protons adjacent to an electronegative group? Or perhaps a conjugated diene? Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents that cause coupling. Wait, but the other aromatic protons are at 6.98 and 6.51, which suggests substitution.

Wait, another peak at 3.66 ppm, a doublet with 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe an oxygen. Like an ether or an alkoxy group. Or perhaps an amine, but that seems less likely because the aldehyde is present.

Putting this together: An aldehyde group (9.72 ppm), a para-substituted benzene ring (6.98 and 6.51, which is about 2.5 ppm downfield from each other—so perhaps two substituents in the para positions?), a broad singlet for two protons (maybe -CH2-O-?), and a CH2 group next to an oxygen.

Wait, so maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents. Let me sketch this.

The aldehyde is at one end, then perhaps a chain leading to another benzene ring.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: if it's a benzaldehyde (C7H6O) with substituents, but here we have an additional O and N. So perhaps a nitro group or an amino group.

Wait, but the presence of NaNO2 and HCl in the first step suggests that perhaps there's an aromatic amine. Because diazotization typically occurs with aromatic amines. So if the compound has a -NH2 group, then it would react to form a diazonium salt.

But looking at the NMR, do we see any peaks that would indicate an NH2 group? NH2 protons are usually broad and around 1-5 ppm, but in this NMR, there's a peak at 6.27, which is 2H and a broad singlet. Maybe it's an -OH group, but that would usually be a singlet but perhaps in a different region. Or perhaps it's a conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps the compound has a structure like a benzaldehyde with a substituent that's a hydroxyl group or an amino group attached to another benzene ring.

Hold on, maybe the structure is a diaryl compound. Like, two benzene rings connected by a chain that includes the aldehyde and an amino group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzyl group connected to another benzene ring via a chain that includes an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like this: a benzaldehyde moiety (the 9.72 ppm peak) with substituents. Let me think: the 6.98 and 6.51 are likely a para-substituted benzene ring, perhaps with substituents which are another benzene ring or a group that leads to the aldehyde.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a biphenyl structure where one benzene ring has substituents. Let's think about the NMR signals. The triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) is the aldehyde. Then, the two doublets around 7 ppm would be the aromatic protons of a para-substituted ring. The 6.27 (2H, broad) might be another set of aromatic protons or perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to something. Wait, but 6.27 is more upfield than the 6.98 and 6.51, which are more downfield. So maybe it's a different kind of substituent.

Wait, let's think about the possible structure. Maybe the molecule is something like 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Because that would have a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group in the para position, connected via a butenyl group to an aldehyde.

Wait, but I need to think about the NMR. Let me see, for 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

The structure would be:

Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, but the double bond is at position 3, so it's CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CHO? Or maybe not. Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. Let me count:

Phenyl group (C6H5) + butenyl group (C4H7) + aldehyde (CHO). Wait, but butenyl would be four carbons, but with a double bond and an aldehyde, that's five carbons. So perhaps it's a five-carbon chain, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO.

Wait, let me calculate the molecular formula again. C8H9NO: 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 N, 1 O.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Let's count: 4 carbons in the butenyl chain, a phenyl group, and an aldehyde. So:

Phenyl (6 C) + butenyl (4 C) + aldehyde (1 C) → 6+4+1=11 C? Wait, no, that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, the structure could be a diphenyl compound connected by a chain that includes the aldehyde and a nitro group or an amino group.

Wait, maybe the molecule is a benzaldehyde with an amino group attached to another benzene ring. For example, 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. Wait, let's see: but-3-enal would be CH2=CH-CH2-CHO. But if two phenyl groups are attached at positions 2 and 4, then the formula would be (Ph)2CHCH2CHO. Let's count the carbons: each Ph is 6 C, but they're substituents on a four-carbon chain. So the formula would be (6*2) + 4 = 16 C? No, that's way higher than C8. So that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the structure is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. Let's see the formula: each phenyl is 6 C, but if there are two phenyl groups, that's 12 C, which is way more than 8. So that's not possible. Oh wait, no, perhaps the substituents are on the same benzene ring. Hmm, maybe it's a diphenyl structure with a butanal chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's an aldehyde and another group. Maybe a benzaldehyde with an amino group attached to another benzene ring. But then, the molecular formula would have more carbons.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reagents and what's happening in each step.

First step: NaNO2 and HCl → diazotization. So the starting compound must have an aromatic amine group. So the compound has an amino group attached to an aromatic ring. Because when you treat aromatic amines with nitrous acid (from NaNO2 and HCl), you form a diazonium salt.

But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So N is present, but O is as well. If it's an aromatic amine, the structure would have an -NH2 group. But the NMR data doesn't show any peaks for NH2 protons, which usually appear around 1-5 ppm as broad signals. The only singlet is at 6.27 (2H, broad), but that's in the aromatic region. Maybe that's not an NH2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the N is part of an amide or a nitro group. If it's a nitro group, then the structure would have a NO2 group. But the formula is C8H9NO. Wait, nitro is NO2, which would account for two O's, but the formula has only one O. So maybe not nitro. Alternatively, the N could be in an amine group, but perhaps it's a secondary or tertiary amine. Wait, but for diazotization, it's primary amines that react, typically.

Hmm. So maybe the initial compound is a benzene ring with an amino group and another substituent which is a chain leading to an aldehyde.

Wait, the NMR shows an aldehyde proton (9.72 ppm). So that's one functional group. Then, after the reactions, what happens?

The steps are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl → forms diazonium salt.

2. H2O → hydrolysis of diazonium salt.

3. aq. KOH, heat → maybe some elimination or other reaction.

Wait, let's think about each step.

First, the starting compound has an aromatic amine. Treating with NaNO2 and HCl at low temperature (like 0-5°C) forms a diazonium chloride. Then, step 2 is treatment with H2O. Diazonium salts in aqueous acidic conditions typically undergo hydrolysis. If the diazonium is on a benzene ring, hydrolysis under acidic conditions would form a benzoic acid. But if under different conditions, maybe it forms a phenol? Wait, let's think: when you hydrolyze a diazonium salt with aqueous acid (like HCl), you get a benzoic acid. But if you have aqueous KOH, maybe it forms a phenoxide.

Wait, but step 2 is just H2O. So with diazonium chloride, adding water would typically lead to hydrolysis. For example, if the starting compound is an aromatic amine, say, aniline, the diazonium salt would hydrolyze to produce a carboxylic acid. But in our case, perhaps the substituents on the ring would influence the product.

Wait, but after step 2, we have step 3: aqueous KOH and heat. That might be a condition for elimination reactions, like forming a ketone from a secondary alcohol, but more likely, if there's an alcohol present, heating with KOH could lead to elimination (like forming an alkene via an E2 mechanism) or perhaps saponification if there's an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic attack.

But maybe I should try to figure out the structure first.

Looking back at the NMR.

The triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) is probably the aldehyde. So somewhere in the structure, there's an -CHO group.

The 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each with 2H. Those are likely para-substituted aromatic protons. So perhaps two substituents are present on the benzene ring in the para positions.

The 6.27 (2H, broad singlet) is a bit tricky. Maybe it's a di-substituted benzene ring with substituents that cause coupling, but it's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group or a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's probably a CH2 group next to an oxygen. So maybe an OCH2 group. But then, what's attached to that?

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something like this:

Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO

But wait, that would be four carbons in the chain. Plus the phenyl group (6 C) gives 10 C, which is more than 8. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a CH2CHO group, and another substituent that's something else.

Wait, let me think of each peak:

- 9.72 (t, 1H): aldehyde.

- 6.98 (d, 2H): maybe a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions, each having one H. Like a substituent in the para position, and each substituent has one H, so each is a doublet.

Wait, no, a para-substituted benzene would have two sets of doublets. For example, in para-xylene, each aromatic H is a doublet. So if you have a substituent in the para position, the two H's adjacent would be doublets.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a diaryl compound, like diphenylmethane or something similar, but with an aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. If we have an aldehyde (CHO), that's one O. The N is probably in an amine group, which would account for the O in the formula. So the structure might be a benzene ring with an amine group and an aldehyde substituent. But then, how?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like (4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde. But let's count: 4-aminophenyl (C6H5NH2) plus CH2CHO. So that would be C6H5NH2-CH2-CHO. The formula would be C9H11N O. But our formula is C8H9NO. So that's one C too many.

Hmm. Not matching.

Another thought: Perhaps the structure is 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde with another substituent. Let's say 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde is C7H6O2. But we have C8H9NO. So perhaps another substituent: perhaps a methyl group? But then, adding a methyl would make it C8H8O2, which isn't matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: one is an amino group (NH2) and another is a CH2CHO group. So structure is Ph-NH-CH2-CHO. Let's see: Ph is C6H5, so that's 6 C. Then, NH-CH2-CHO is 3 C plus N and O. So total C: 6 + 3 =9. But our formula is C8, so that's one C too many. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in a different arrangement. Maybe the aldehyde is directly attached to the benzene, and there's an amino group attached elsewhere.

Wait, another approach: let's try to figure out the structure from the NMR.

The aldehyde peak is 9.72 (t, 1H). So it's an aldehyde, and the triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehydes typically don't have neighboring protons because the aldehyde is RCHO, with the H adjacent to the carbonyl. But wait, if the aldehyde is at the end of a chain, perhaps it's like RCH2CHO, where the CH2 is adjacent to the aldehyde. So the aldehyde H would be a triplet because it's next to a CH2.

Wait, but in that case, the CH2 would be next to the aldehyde, so each H on CH2 would be split into a triplet by the aldehyde H. Hmm, but wait, the aldehyde H is a triplet, so that would mean it's coupled to two equivalent protons. So maybe the structure is CH2-CHO, where the CH2 is adjacent. That would make the aldehyde H a triplet (coupled to two H's on the adjacent CH2). That makes sense.

So the aldehyde is at the end, and the adjacent group is a CH2. Then, what comes before that CH2?

Looking at the 3.66 ppm peak: a doublet of 2H. That could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen. So perhaps O-CH2-CH2-CHO.

Wait, but where is the N? The molecular formula has N, so the structure should include an N.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CHO attached to a benzene ring that has an amino group. So something like benzene with NH2 and OCH2CH2CHO as substituents.

Wait, but trying to match the NMR.

The aldehyde: 9.72, triplet.

The OCH2CH2CHO group: the CH2 next to O would be around 3.66 (d, 2H), and the CH2 next to aldehyde would be around, say, 3.0 ppm, but not seeing that in the data. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is between the O and the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO

But that would give OCH2CH2CHO connected to a benzene ring. Let's count the formula: Ph is C6H5, O, then CH2CH2CHO is C3H5O.

So total: C6 + C3 = C9, but our formula is C8. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is Ph-NH-CH2-CHO. But that would be C7H7NO, which doesn't match C8H9NO.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, let me think about the reactions again. The first step is diazotization: so the starting material has an aromatic amine. Then, step two is H2O, which would hydrolyze the diazonium salt. Under acidic conditions, it would form a benzoic acid. But step three is KOH and heat, which is basic conditions. So perhaps the hydrolysis in step two is under acidic conditions, forming a carboxylic acid, and then in step three, under basic conditions, it might saponify an ester or something else.

Wait, but the starting compound is an aromatic amine. Let's imagine the structure is benzene with an amino group and another substituent which is a chain leading to an aldehyde.

Wait, another possibility: the starting compound is 4-aminobenzaldehyde. Structure is Ph-NH2-CHO. But wait, that would be C7H7NO. The formula given is C8H9NO. So that's one C too few. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. Structure: Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO. Molecular formula: C8H9NO. Yes! Let's count: Ph (C6H5) + NH2 + CH2CHO (C3H5O). So total C:6+3=9? Wait, no, the formula is C8. Wait, no, the structure would be C6H5-NH-CH2-CHO. Wait, no, that's 6 (Ph) + 1 (N) + 3 (CH2CHO) → 10 C? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me count again. The formula is C8H9NO. So 8 C, 9 H, 1 N, 1 O.

If the structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde, that's C7H7NO: C6H5NH2CHO → C7H7NO. But our formula is C8H9NO. So perhaps there's an extra CH2 group. Oh, wait, if it's 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, that would be C6H5NH2CH2CHO → which is C8H11NO. But our formula is C8H9NO. So two less H, which would require some double bonds or rings.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a double bond somewhere else. Or maybe the substituent is a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde with an amino group attached to another ring. But I'm not getting it.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again.

The triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) is the aldehyde proton, which is split into a triplet because it's adjacent to a CH2 group. So the aldehyde is at the end of a CH2 group.

Then, the 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) is a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative group, perhaps O. So maybe the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CHO.

But where is the N? Oh, perhaps the O is part of an ether group, and the N is attached elsewhere.

Wait, but the initial compound has an amino group which gets diazotized. So perhaps the structure is Ph-NH-CH2-CH2-CHO. But that would be C9H13NO, which doesn't match. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that doesn't account for the N. Darn, I'm stuck.

Wait, another approach: the reaction steps.

Step 1: Diazotization → forms diazonium salt.

Step 2: H2O → hydrolysis. Diazonium salts in aqueous solution can undergo hydrolysis to form either phenols (if under basic conditions) or benzoic acids (if under acidic conditions). Since step 2 is just H2O, perhaps it's under neutral or acidic conditions, leading to a carboxylic acid.

But wait, step 3 is KOH and heat. That's basic conditions. So, perhaps the product from step 2 is a carboxylic acid, which in step 3 undergoes saponification if it's an ester, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, if the product from step 2 is an alcohol, heating with KOH could lead to elimination.

Wait, perhaps the diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to form a ketone or an aldehyde. Wait, no, diazonium salts typically form acids or phenol derivatives.

Wait, another thought: if the starting material is a substituted benzylamine, perhaps a secondary or tertiary amine. But for diazotization, it's usually primary aromatic amines. So maybe the structure is something like benzylamine with another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a nitro compound. But the first step is NaNO2 and HCl, which is more for diazotization.

Hmm. I think I'm getting stuck on the structure, so perhaps I should try to see what the options are and see which one makes sense.

The options are:

A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal → structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO, but with two phenyl groups at positions 2 and 4. That would be a four-carbon chain with two phenyl groups. But how does that fit?

B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal → a four-carbon chain with double bond at position 2, with two 4-hydroxyphenyl groups at positions 2 and 4.

C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal → similar to B but with a hydroxy group at position 3 and butanal (butyraldehyde) instead of buten-al.

D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal → a four-carbon chain with a double bond at position 3, and a 4-hydroxyphenyl group at position 4.

Wait, the starting compound has an amino group. So when it's treated with NaNO2 and HCl, it forms a diazonium salt. Then, hydrolysis with H2O would convert it to a carbocation, perhaps, which could then undergo elimination when treated with KOH and heat.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is 4-aminophenylbut-3-enal. Structure is Ph-NH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond at position 3. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a benzene ring with an amino group and a side chain that includes an aldehyde and a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-(aminophenyl)but-3-enal. Structure: CH2=CH-CH2-PhNH2-CHO. No, that doesn't seem right.

Another approach: think about the reactions.

The starting material is an aromatic amine with an aldehyde group. The first step forms a diazonium salt. Step 2 hydrolyzes it to a phenol or a carboxylic acid, depending on conditions. Step 3 is aqueous KOH and heat, which might be a Hofmann elimination or some kind of elimination reaction.

Wait, if the starting compound is 4-aminobenzaldehyde (Ph-NH2-CHO), then step 1 would form the diazonium salt (Ph-N+≡N-CHO). Then, step 2 hydrolyzes it to Ph-COOH (benzoic acid) and CO (from CHO). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is part of a larger chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-NH-CH2-CH2-CHO, which would be 4-aminobenzylacetaldehyde. So molecular formula: C9H13NO. But our compound is C8H9NO. So that's not matching.

Hmm. Another plan: perhaps the starting compound is a secondary amine, but I don't think so because diazotization is typically for primary amines.

Wait, perhaps the structure has an NH group attached to a benzene ring and a side chain that includes an aldehyde and a double bond. So something like Ph-NH-CH2-CH2-CHO, which would have a double bond forming after the reactions.

Wait, but I'm not getting closer. Maybe I should think about the final product.

The options are four aldehydes or ketones. The reactions involve converting an amine to a diazonium salt, then hydrolysis, then KOH and heat, which might eliminate to form a double bond.

Wait, let's think about the possible transformations.

If the starting material is a benzene ring with an amino group and a side chain that has an aldehyde and possibly an -OH group, then after diazotization and hydrolysis, the amino group is replaced.

Wait, when an aromatic amine is converted to a diazonium salt and then hydrolyzed, it typically substitutes the amino group with a hydroxyl group (phenol) under basic conditions, or a carboxylic acid group under acidic conditions.

So, if the starting compound is Ph-NH-R, after step 1, it's Ph-N+≡N-R. Step 2 (H2O) would hydrolyze it to Ph-OH-R or Ph-COOH-R, depending on conditions. But since step 2 is just H2O, perhaps it's neutral, leading to a phenol.

Then, step 3 is KOH and heat. That's a basic condition, which might lead to elimination if there's a suitable leaving group or an adjacent proton.

Wait, let's imagine the starting structure is Ph-NH-CH2-CH2-CHO. After step 1 and 2, it becomes Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, step 3 with KOH and heat could cause elimination, forming a double bond between the two CH2 groups.

So, elimination would remove two H's and form a double bond, leading to Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO → maybe Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO → after elimination, Ph-CH2-CH=CHO.

Wait, but the aldehyde is at the end. Alternatively, perhaps the structure becomes Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO → upon elimination, it forms Ph-CH2-CH=CHO. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, let me look at the options:

Option D:4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Structure: CH2=CH-CH(Ph-OH)-CHO. No, wait, but but-3-enal would be CH2-CH2-CH=CHO. Hmm, but with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure after elimination is Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO → upon elimination of H2O, it becomes Ph-O-CH2-CHO with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting structure is Ph-NH-CH2-CH2-CHO. After steps 1 and 2, it becomes Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, in step 3, elimination could occur between the two CH2 groups, forming a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, leading to but-3-enal.

So, the product would be Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO → but upon elimination, it becomes Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO → but wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it becomes Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO → elimination to form Ph-O-CH2-CH=CHO, which would be but-3-enal with a substituent.

Hmm, but the options don't exactly match this.

Wait, option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Structure: the aldehyde is at position 1, then CH2, then CH, then CH2 with the phenyl group, and a double bond between positions 3 and 4? Wait, but I'm not visualizing correctly.

But-3-enal is CH2-CH2-CH=CHO. So, the substituents would be on the third carbon.

If the starting material after elimination has a phenyl group attached to carbon 4, then the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH=CHO with a phenyl on the fourth carbon. That would be 4-(phenyl)but-3-enal. But the option says 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl), so the phenyl has a hydroxyl group in the para position.

So, perhaps the final product is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal, which is option D.

So putting it all together:

The starting compound is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a two-carbon chain. Wait, no, perhaps the starting compound is 4-aminophenylpropanal. Then, after diazotization and hydrolysis, the NH2 becomes OH, and then elimination forms a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is 4-aminobenzylacetaldehyde (Ph-NH-CH2-CH2-CHO). After step 1 and 2, it becomes Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, in step 3, elimination occurs to form Ph-O-CH2-CH=CHO, which is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So that would be option D.

Looking at the options, option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

So, the final product should be option D.


The compound has the molecular formula **C8H9NO** and the provided **1H-NMR data** indicates the presence of an aldehyde group (9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H), a para-substituted aromatic ring (6.98 ppm and 6.51 ppm, doublets, 2H each), a broad singlet for two protons (6.27 ppm, 2H), and a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom (3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H). These observations suggest a structure involving an aromatic ring, an aldehyde group, and a side chain with a CH2 group.

The reaction sequence involves:
1. **NaNO2 + HCl**: This step typically diazotizes an aromatic amine, forming a diazonium salt.
2. **H2O**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt can replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group, forming a phenol.
3. **aq. KOH, Heat**: Basic conditions and heat can lead to elimination reactions, forming a double bond.

From the NMR data and the reaction sequence, the starting compound likely contains an aromatic ring with an amino group and an aldehyde group in a specific arrangement. After diazotization and hydrolysis, the amino group is replaced by a hydroxyl group, forming a phenol derivative. The final step, involving KOH and heat, facilitates elimination, resulting in the formation of a double bond in the side chain.

The **final product** matches the structure of **4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal**, which corresponds to **option D**. This structure is consistent with the NMR data and the reaction sequence.

Answer: D
