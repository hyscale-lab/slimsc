Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. 

First, I'll start by analyzing the spectral data given. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since the options don't seem to have amines, maybe it's an aliphatic or carboxylic acid O-H. There's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That's common in esters, ketones, or carboxylic acids. Then, 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ are around the range for aromatic C=C stretches, so the compound probably has a benzene ring.

Looking at the NMR data: The 1H NMR has several signals. The first is at 10.5 ppm, a broad singlet integrating to 1H. That's a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid proton. The broadness suggests it's exchanging, which is typical for -COOH. So the compound likely has a carboxylic acid group.

Next, the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) signals are indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets with 2H each suggest two sets of equivalent protons, which fits para substitution. So maybe something like p-xylene or a para-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions.

Then there's a 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H), which might be a CH group attached to something else. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be adjacent to another CH2 or part of a chain. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of CH3 groups, maybe adjacent to a CH. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a terminal methyl group, like a CH2CH2CH3 structure.

Putting this together, the structure might be a benzene ring with a substituent in the para position. The substituent could be a side chain leading to a carboxylic acid. So maybe something like phenylpropanoic acid, but with some branching.

Let me think about the possible options. The options A, C are acids, B and D are substituted benzenes (probably alkanes, since no functional groups mentioned). 

Looking back at the reaction: the compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Oh, wait, that's a typical reaction for eliminating a leaving group. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the formation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation, but wait, more accurately, it's the Hinsberg reaction? Or maybe it's a substitution. Wait, no. Another thought: when a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it's a way to convert the acid to an acid chloride, but that's usually with thionyl chloride or phosphorus oxychloride. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is for eliminating a group.

Wait, another possibility: when a compound has a leaving group adjacent to a carbonyl, like an ester or a ketone with a leaving group, but in this case, the initial compound is a carboxylic acid. Oh, wait, maybe it's undergoing a substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzyl ester or something similar. 

Wait, but the options given don't include any esters. Let me look again at the options. Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That's a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a methyl group adjacent to a CH2. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, that would be (CH2CH(CH2CH3)). So for 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the structure would be a benzene ring with a -COOH group in position 4 and a sec-butyl group. Wait, but where would the substituents be?

Wait, in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 as a doublet, which is typically a methyl group attached to a CH, which is itself attached to another carbon. Like in an isopropyl group. So, let's say if the substituent is a -CH2-C(CH3)2 group? Or maybe a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

Wait, the substituent could be a sec-butyl group. So, let me think: the substituent
