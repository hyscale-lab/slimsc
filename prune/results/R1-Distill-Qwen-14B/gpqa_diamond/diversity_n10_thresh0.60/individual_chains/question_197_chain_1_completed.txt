Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question involves identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data and predicting its reaction product after treatment with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The IR spectrum shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. Oh wait, the strong peak around 3400 could be an alkene C-H stretch too, but more likely O-H because that's a broad region. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde or ketone? No, wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is a carbonyl (C=O). So maybe a ketone or aldehyde. But wait, looking at the other peaks: 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the regions for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound likely has an aromatic ring.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data. The most downfield peak is at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) which is a strong indicator of an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm and show as a singlet. But wait, the peak is broad here. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, and they're usually broad because of the exchange with water. But the IR didn't show a broad peak around 2500-3000, which is typical for O-H in carboxylic acids. Wait, the IR shows 3400–2500, which could be an O-H stretch for a carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl. Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1, so that fits. But wait, the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, let me think again. Alternatively, the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 could be an ester or ketone. But the presence of the 10.5 ppm in NMR suggests it's more likely a carboxylic acid because a ketone won't have a proton that shifts that far up. Wait, no, a ketone doesn't have an acidic proton. So for a ketone, the only way to get a peak that high is if it's an alpha proton, but that's more around 2-3 ppm usually. So maybe I was right with the carboxylic acid.

Looking at the other NMR signals. The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's typical for a para-substituted aromatic ring. So the aromatic ring is para-substituted. The coupling between the two sets of doublets indicates substituents on opposite positions, like in para-substituted benzene.

So let's imagine the structure. If it's a benzoic acid derivative, the structure would be something like benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at one position and another substituent at the para position.

Wait, but wait, the 1H NMR shows a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). So those are some alkyl chain protons. Let's think about the substituent on the benzene. The 0.9 ppm triplet suggests a methyl group at the end of a chain, like CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3) something. Wait, let me try to figure out the structure.

The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 3H, which is typically a CH3 group attached to a CH2. The quartet (wait, no, it's a triplet) suggests that the CH3 is attached to a CH2. Then, the d at 1.4 ppm for 3H is a CH3 attached to a carbon that's connected to another CH. The m at 2.9 ppm is a CH group between them, perhaps. So let's see:

Looking at the substituent: 0.9 (t, 3H) → CH2CH2CH3. Wait no, the triplet is from the CH2 next to a CH2CH3. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two adjacent CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group? Or maybe a butyl group. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the substituent. The substituent on the benzene ring would be a chain of some sort. The NMR data suggests a chain with branching. Let me think:

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH which is in turn attached to something else. So perhaps the structure is something like CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let's think about the substituent. The substituent is connected to the benzene ring. The NMR shows:

- 0.9 (t, 3H) → this is a methyl group at the end of a chain. So maybe the structure is like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Let's consider the substituent as a propyl group, but perhaps with a branch.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a methylene group that's splitting into a multiplet. So maybe it's a CH group that's connected to two other CH2 groups.

Putting it all together, the substituent is a group like CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene? Or perhaps it's a butyl group.

Wait, the substituent might be a sec-butyl group. Let me think: a sec-butyl group is (CH2)2CHCH2- attached to the benzene. Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene. Let me visualize it: benzene ring with a substituent at one position, and another substituent at the para position.

Wait, but the substituent in this case has the NMR data as follows:

It has a triplet (0.9 ppm, 3H), which is the end of a chain. Let's say it's a -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would be a butyl group. But the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH which is connected to other groups.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached as a branch. Like a isopropyl group? Or perhaps a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Let me think about it.

Wait, the substituent on the benzene is a propyl group, but perhaps with a branch. Let me see:

The substituent would be a group that, when connected to the benzene, gives the NMR signals as per the data. Let's see:

The substituent's structure must have a CH(CH2CH3) group as part of it, since there's a CH3 (1.4 ppm, d), and a triplet at 0.9.

Wait, another approach: The substituent's NMR is like this:

- 0.9 t (3H) → -CH2CH2CH2-CH3? No, wait, triplet suggests the CH2 is connected to another CH2. Let's imagine a substituent as -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)2 group? No, that would have a different NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Let me count the signals.

But wait, perhaps it's a butyl group. Let me think about the substituent as a butyl group. For a butyl group, the NMR would show a triplet at 0.9 (from the terminal CH3), a quartet at around 1.3 (the CH2 next to the CH3), and a triplet around 1.7 (the next CH2). But in our case, the triplet is at 0.9, m at 1.7, and d at 1.4 for 3H.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to something. Let's consider the structure as benzene with a substituent at the para position being a sec-butyl group. Wait, but then the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. So the substituent would be (CH2)2CHCH3, but that's a tert-butyl group. Wait no, no. Wait, sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. So the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, no, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. So the substituent is a butyl group where the branching is on the second carbon.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene. But then the NMR would have certain patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. Let me think about how the NMR would look.

In that case, the substituent would be:

- The terminal CH3 group is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH, which is attached to the benzene.

So the CH2CH(CH2CH3) would be the substituent. Let's think about the NMR signals:

- The CH3 group (CH2CH(CH2CH3)) would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet because it's attached to a CH2 which is next to another CH2.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm is from the CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. The CH2 next to the CH(CH2CH3) would be split into a quartet, perhaps, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a longer chain. Wait, but let's think about the overall structure.

Putting it all together, the compound has a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (if the NMR peak at 10.5 is a COOH) and a substituent at the para position.

Wait, but the IR data shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, which is close. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester (which would have a carbonyl around 1720-1740 cm-1). But the NMR doesn't show any ester oxygen signal, like an OCH2 or something. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is an aromatic aldehyde. The aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm, which fits the 10.5 ppm peak. So maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde with a substituent.

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 would be a ketone, not an aldehyde. Aldehydes typically show a strong peak around 1720 cm-1 as well, but the aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm. So if the IR shows 1720, it could be a ketone or an aldehyde.

But wait, the NMR has a peak at 10.5, which is a bit high for an aldehyde. Aldehydes are usually around 9.5-10 ppm. So maybe it's a ketone with an adjacent acidic proton? No, that doesn't make sense because ketones don't have acidic protons that show up that high.

Wait, perhaps the 10.5 ppm peak is a phenolic OH. But then the IR would show a broad O-H stretch around 3300-3500, which it does (the 3400–2500 cm-1 region includes a broad peak). But the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which could be the carbonyl of a phenol ester or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted benzaldehyde. For example, para-substituted benzaldehyde with a branching substituent.

Wait, let me think again. The aromatic region in the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So the substituents are on opposite positions.

If the substituents are a carboxylic acid group and a substituent that's an alkyl chain (like a butyl group), that would fit. So the structure would be something like para-(substituted alkyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a CH3 group attached to a CH2. Then, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group but with branching. Let me try to visualize:

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. So the full substituent is a propyl group with a branch on the second carbon.

In that case, the structure would be:

Benzoic acid (because of the COOH) with a substituent at the para position. The substituent is a propyl group where the middle CH has a methyl branch. So the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene.

Wait, but then the NMR would have a triplet at 0.9 (the terminal CH3), a quartet at around 1.3 (the CH2 connected to CH), and a multiplet at 1.7 (the CH connected to the benzene). Also, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH group.

Wait, let me count the substituents. The substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene, making it a pentyl group? No, wait, wait, if it's a substituent like -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-, that would be longer. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let's think about the substituent as a butyl group. For a butyl group, the NMR would have a triplet for the terminal CH3, a quartet for the adjacent CH2, and a triplet for the next CH2. But in our case, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet (m) for 2H, which could be two adjacent CH2 groups. The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, which could be a CH group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the substituent would be a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. That would make the substituent a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, but the substituent would then be a neopentyl group or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, making it an isobutyl group. Wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene? Wait, no, isobutyl is -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. Wait, no, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, wait, no: isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's get the structure of each substituent straight.

- n-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH3
- iso-butyl: -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- (but that's not correct, because iso-butyl is actually -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. Wait, no, the correct structure for iso-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, wait, iso-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH3 attached to the benzene. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The substituent is likely a butyl group with branching. The NMR data suggests that the substituent is a butyl group where the branching is on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be: benzene ring with a substituent at the para position that is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group.

So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene. So the structure would be: benzene with a COOH group and a sec-butyl group at the para positions.

Wait, but the question says the compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What kind of reaction is that?

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of esters, but more commonly, I think they are used for the elimination reactions. Alternatively, maybe for the cleavage of certain functional groups.

Wait, another reaction: when a compound with a carbonyl group (like an aldehyde or ketone) reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it might undergo a reduction. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI are used for the reduction of carbonyl groups to alcohols. Wait, or maybe it's for the formation of ylides, like in the Wittig reaction. No, wait, in the Wittig reaction, you use triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Red phosphorus and HI: another possibility is that the compound is a nitrile, and the reaction is hydrolysis. But the IR data doesn't show a nitrile peak (around 2200 cm-1), so that's probably not it.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a benzylic bromide or other alkyl halide, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI could lead to elimination. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, or perhaps the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative. Reacting with HI and red phosphorus might lead to the formation of an alkyne via dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of an ester to form an acid and an alcohol. But the IR doesn't show an ester (like a peak around 1720 and an O-H stretch, but I'm not sure).

Wait, maybe the starting compound is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, and the reaction is some kind of addition. But I think I need to figure out what the starting compound is first.

Let me go back to the spectroscopic data to figure out the structure of compound X.

We have a benzene ring with substituents. The substituents are a carboxylic acid group (if the 10.5 ppm peak is COOH) and a substituent that's an alkyl group.

Alternatively, the substituents could be an aldehyde and an alkyl group if the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton.

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 would be consistent with a ketone or an aldehyde. Let me think: if it's a ketone, then the NMR wouldn't have a peak at 10.5 because ketones don't have protons that show up that high. So maybe it's an aldehyde.

Wait, the aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm, which fits. So maybe the compound is a para-substituted benzaldehyde with an alkyl substituent.

So the structure would be something like (substituted benzaldehyde), where the benzene has an aldehyde group at one position and an alkyl substituent at the para position.

In that case, the substituent is an alkyl group, which we need to determine based on the NMR.

The substituent's NMR:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): this is a terminal CH3 group.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two adjacent CH2 groups.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group.

So the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let's think of it as a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group attached to the benzene. Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group? No, no, wait: the substituent is attached to the benzene, so perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. Wait, that would be a pentyl group, but let me count the carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. So the substituent is a butyl group where the branching is on the second carbon. So the substituent is a iso-butyl group attached to the benzene.

Wait, iso-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. No, wait, iso-butyl is -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. Hmm, no, that's not right. Let me get this straight.

The iso-butyl group is a substituent with four carbons, where the structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. Wait, no, iso-butyl is actually (CH2)2CHCH3, but I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out.

Iso-butyl group:

The structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. So the substituent is:

 benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that would be a pentyl group. Hmm, perhaps it's a butyl group where the branching is on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the middle CH. So the substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group? No, that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

So the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The terminal CH3 as a triplet at 0.9 ppm.
- The adjacent CH2 would be a quartet around 1.3 ppm.
- The next CH2 (connected to the CH) would be a triplet around 1.7 ppm.
- The CH would be a septet or some multiplet around 2.9 ppm.

Wait, but in our data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, which could be two adjacent CH2 groups. The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, which would be the CH group.

So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene. So the substituent is a butyl group with a branch on the second carbon.

So the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the substituent is a pentyl group? Wait, no, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene.

So the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

So the structure of compound X would be para-substituted benzaldehyde with a sec-butyl group and a COOH group. Wait, no, the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which could be the aldehyde proton. If that's the case, then the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

Wait, no, the substituent would be a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene, and the other substituent is the aldehyde group.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more consistent with a ketone or an aldehyde. So if the compound is a benzaldehyde with a sec-butyl substituent, the IR would show a strong aldehyde peak around 1720 cm-1, which it does.

So the structure would be:

The benzene ring has an aldehyde group (-CHO) at one position and a sec-butyl group at the para position.

So the substituents are para to each other: one is -CHO, the other is a sec-butyl group.

So the structure is p-sec-butylbenzaldehyde.

Now, the reaction: compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

What kind of reaction is that? Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the reduction of carbonyl groups. For example, the reduction of ketones or aldehydes to alcohols. But wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the presence of a carbonyl group to form an alcohol. This is known as the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction? Or maybe it's the hydroboration-oxidation? No, that's with BH3.

Wait, another possibility is that the carbonyl group (aldehyde) reacts with HI and red phosphorus to form an alcohol. Alternatively, I think the aldehyde would be reduced to a primary alcohol using H2O and a catalyst, but perhaps under these conditions, it's a different mechanism.

Wait, I remember that when aldehydes or ketones are treated with red phosphorus and HI, the carbonyl group is converted into an alcohol. The mechanism involves the formation of a ylide, which then attacks the carbonyl, leading to the formation of the alcohol.

So in this case, the aldehyde group (-CHO) would be reduced to a -CH2OH group.

So the product would have a -CH2OH group where the aldehyde was.

So the starting material is p-sec-butylbenzaldehyde, and the product would be p-sec-butylbenzyl alcohol.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them seem to match that. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the acid is in position 1, and the sec-butyl is in position 4.

Wait, but wait, the starting compound is a benzaldehyde with a sec-butyl group in the para position. So after reduction, the aldehyde becomes a CH2OH group, making the product 4-sec-butylbenzyl alcohol.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm looking at the wrong starting material.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzoic acid derivative, not a benzaldehyde. Let me reevaluate.

If the starting material is a benzoic acid, then the substituent is a sec-butyl group, making the structure 4-sec-butylbenzoic acid. Then, reacting with red phosphorus and HI... Hmm, but what reaction would that undergo?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are often used to reduce esters. For example, esters can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic conditions, but I'm not sure about the role of red phosphorus here.

Wait, another thought: if the starting material is a nitrile, red phosphorus and HI could hydrolyse it to a carboxylic acid. But the IR doesn't show a nitrile peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But I'm not seeing how that would apply here.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester. The IR would show the ester carbonyl around 1720 cm-1. Then, treatment with red phosphorus and HI could hydrolyze the ester to a carboxylic acid.

But earlier, I thought the starting material might be a benzoic acid, but the IR and NMR might not fit.

Wait, let's go back.

If the starting material is 4-sec-butylbenzoic acid, then the IR would show a strong peak around 1700 cm-1 for the carboxylic acid. The NMR would show a peak at around 10-12 ppm for the -COOH proton, which is in the data as 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). The aromatic protons would be as observed: two doublets, para-substituted.

So the substituents on the benzene are a COOH group and a sec-butyl group, in para positions.

So the structure would be 4-sec-butylbenzoic acid.

Then, when this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Wait, perhaps I was wrong in assuming the starting material is a benzaldehyde. Maybe it's a benzoic acid.

So the reaction is between a benzoic acid derivative and HI, but I'm not sure what reaction occurs.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is an ester, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to the acid. But in that case, the initial IR would have an ester carbonyl, which it does (1720 cm-1), but the NMR would have different features.

Wait, the NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid proton. So if the starting material is a benzoic acid, that makes sense.

But in that case, what reaction would occur with red phosphorus and HI?

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, but if the starting material is already a benzoic acid, that wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reaction is acid-catalyzed hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid. But the presence of red phosphorus is unclear.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is an acyl chloride. If compound X is an acyl chloride, then red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze it to the acid. But the IR doesn't show a strong peak around 1800 cm-1, which is typical for an acyl chloride.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not a hydrolysis but a substitution. The substituent on the benzene is a bromide or iodide, and the reaction replaces it. But I don't see any halide peaks in the NMR data, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile, but again, the IR doesn't show that.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to re-examine the NMR data.

The NMR shows:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) → likely a carboxylic acid or aldehyde proton.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) → para-substituted aromatic.

2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H) → a substituent with a chain.

So the substituent is an alkyl group with a branching. Let's think about the substituent.

The 0.9 (t,3H) is a terminal CH3.

The 1.4 (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH.

The 2.9 (m,1H) is a CH that's connected to both the aromatic ring and the substituent.

The 1.7 (m,2H) is two CH2 groups.

So the substituent could be a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. But that would be a pentyl group with a branch.

Wait, let me count the substituent.

The substituent is:

- Starting from the benzene ring: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's a butyl group with a branch. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think:

The substituent would be: benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's a pentyl group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the substituent is a butyl group with a branch on the second carbon.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

So the structure of compound X is 4-sec-butylbenzoic acid.

So the substituents are a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

So, now, the question is: when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what's the product?

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used to reduce esters to alcohols, but in the case of a carboxylic acid, I'm not sure what reaction would occur. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of the acid to form something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituent on the benzene is a bromide. But the NMR doesn't show any signals for a Br, and the problem doesn't mention any halogen in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an alkyl iodide, but again, the NMR doesn't show iodide signals.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution if the ring is activated. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of benzoic acid with red phosphorus and HI. Perhaps it's a way to form an acid chloride, but that usually involves SOCl2 or similar reagents.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration to form an anhydride, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the starting material again. If the starting material is 4-sec-butylbenzoic acid, and the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's undergoing a reduction of the acid to a primary alcohol. But that would require converting the COOH to CH2OH, which is not a typical reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the acid is transformed into an acid chloride, which then undergoes some reaction. But again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the starting material. Let me reevaluate the starting material.

If the starting material is not an acid but an ester, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI could hydrolyze the ester to the acid. For example, if the starting material is ethyl benzoate, then red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyse it to benzoic acid.

So, in that case, if the starting material is 4-sec-butyl benzoate, then the reaction would produce 4-sec-butylbenzoic acid.

But looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So perhaps that's the product.

Wait, but the question says that compound X reacts to give the product. So if X is the ester and the product is the acid, then option C would be the product.

But I thought the starting material was the acid. Hmm.

Wait, but what's the data for compound X? The IR shows 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester. The NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which would be more consistent with a carboxylic acid. But if X is an ester, the NMR wouldn't have a peak at 10.5 ppm; instead, the ester might have a peak in the 4 ppm region for the OCH2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to think again.

If the starting material is an ester, then the IR would show a peak around 1720 cm-1 for the ester carbonyl. The NMR wouldn't have a peak at 10.5 ppm because esters don't have an -OH proton. So the 10.5 ppm peak must belong to a carboxylic acid. So the starting material is a benzoic acid.

So, if the starting material is 4-sec-butylbenzoic acid, and the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation. But I'm not sure what would cause that under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. If the substituent on the benzene is an iodide, then HI would cause a substitution, but the NMR doesn't show any signals indicative of iodide.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a bromide, but again, no signals in NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an alkoxy group, but the NMR data doesn't show any broad peaks that would suggest an O-H.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is an elimination reaction. If the substituent is a bromide adjacent to a CH2 group, then HI could abstract a proton, leading to elimination to form an alkene. But without a bromide in the structure, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a secondary or tertiary alcohol, and the reaction is an oxidation. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks indicative of an alcohol.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm looking at this from the wrong angle. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that's the product. So what reaction would lead to that?

If the starting material is something else, perhaps an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to the acid.

So, if compound X is the ester, like ethyl 4-sec-butylbenzoate, then treatment with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyse it to the acid (option C).

But the NMR of the starting material (compound X) would have to match that of an ester. But the NMR given has a peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which isn't present in an ester. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a nitrile. If X is 4-sec-butylbenzonitrile, then treatment with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyse it to the acid. The IR would show a nitrile peak around 2200 cm-1, which isn't present in the given data. So that's not it.

Hmm.

Let me try to think of another approach. The reaction conditions are red phosphorus and HI. Another reaction that uses these reagents is the dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides to alkenes. But without halides in the starting material, that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, and the reaction is a reduction to a primary alcohol. For example, benzaldehyde with a sec-butyl group would become benzyl alcohol with the same substituent.

So the product would be 4-sec-butylbenzyl alcohol.

But looking at the options, none of them match that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alkyne. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of alkynes to carboxylic acids. But the IR doesn't show a peak around 2100 cm-1, which would indicate an alkyne.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone. Let's say it's a para-substituted benzophenone. Then, with red phosphorus and HI, it would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. But again, the options don't include such a structure.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a bromide, and the reaction is a substitution, but I don't see any evidence of that in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an alkoxy group, which would be replaced by HI, but again, I don't see any O-H signals.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think again about the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that suggests that the product is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position. So perhaps the starting material is an ester or a nitrile that is hydrolysed to the acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acid chloride, but again, the IR doesn't show that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration followed by something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a oxidation. For example, if the starting material is a benzyl alcohol with a substituent, the reaction might oxidize it to a benzoic acid. So if the starting material is 4-sec-butylbenzyl alcohol, and the reaction oxidizes it to 4-sec-butylbenzoic acid, then option C is the product.

But how would that fit with the initial data?

Wait, the NMR data for the starting material would have to match a benzyl alcohol with a sec-butyl substituent.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- A triplet at 0.9 ppm (CH3 from the substituent).
- A quartet around 1.3 ppm (CH2 next to CH).
- A triplet around 1.7 ppm (CH2 next to CH).
- A multiplet around 2.9 ppm (CH attached to benzene).
- The OH proton would be a broad peak, but where? In the case of an alcohol, the OH would be around 1-5 ppm, but since the starting material has a peak at 10.5 ppm, that can't be.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a propargyl alcohol or something else, but I'm not making progress.

Let me try to make a different approach.

The reaction product's options are A-D. Let's look at them.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the product is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at para position.

If the product is C, then the starting material must have been something that can form this after reaction.

If the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, then the starting material would be the ester.

But the starting material's NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which doesn't fit an ester. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a nitrile, which is hydrolysed to the acid. The NMR of the starting material would be different, though.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, which is reduced to a primary alcohol, but that doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzyl chloride, which upon treatment with HI would undergo substitution to form benzyl iodide. But the product options don't include such a structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a bromo-substituted benzene, which undergoes substitution with HI to form the corresponding iodide. But I don't see any evidence of that in the NMR.

Hmm. I'm not making progress so I'll have to make an educated guess.

Given that the starting material likely has a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that has an alkyl chain, and the reaction conditions suggest a reduction or hydrolysis, the product is likely a benzoic acid (option C) if the starting material was an ester or nitrile.

But the NMR data suggests a carboxylic acid in the starting material, so I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, and the reaction reduces the aldehyde to a CH2OH group. But the product options don't have that either.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a propanoic acid derivative, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the IR of compound X shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. The NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is typical for a carboxylic acid. So the starting material is a carboxylic acid.

So, the structure is 4-sec-butylbenzoic acid (option C). Then, what reaction could it undergo with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Arndt-Eistert synthesis, but that's for forming ketones. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a di-esterification, but I don't see how that applies.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but that's not fitting.

Hmm. I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the substituent. Let me re-examine the substituent's NMR.

The substituent's NMR signals are:

- 0.9 (t,3H)
- 1.4 (d,3H)
- 1.7 (m,2H)
- 2.9 (m,1H)

This suggests a structure like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would be a pentyl group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a iso-butyl group. Let me think about the structure:

The iso-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. But the NMR doesn't show two CH3 groups attached to the same CH.

The substituent's NMR shows 1.4 ppm as a d (3H), which is a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch on the middle CH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Then the NMR would show the CH3 at 0.9 (t), the adjacent CH2 at 1.7 (m), the CH at 2.9 (m), and the CH3 attached to the CH at 1.4 (d).

So that would make the substituent a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene.

So the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, making it a iso-pentyl group? Not sure.

But regardless, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch, likely a sec-butyl group.

So, the starting material is 4-sec-butylbenzoic acid.

Now, when this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what is the product?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an iodide, and the reaction is a substitution. But the substituent is a sec-butyl group, not iodide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of the acid to form CO2 and an alkane. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't see how.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a protection/deprotection of the acid. But I don't see how red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the acid into an acid chloride, but that's not in the product options.

Wait, perhaps the product is an alcohol, but none of the options except B and D are alkanes.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So if the starting material was an ester, the product would be the acid. But the starting material's NMR doesn't fit an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a secondary alcohol, which is oxidized to the acid. But the starting material's NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which would be the -OH of the acid, not the alcohol.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the starting material is something that becomes this upon reaction.


The question involves identifying the final product of a reaction involving compound X, which has the following spectroscopic data:

### IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates O-H or N-H stretching, possibly from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid or ester.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.

### ¹H NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted aromatic ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Indicate an alkyl chain with branching, likely a sec-butyl group.

### Analysis of Compound X:
1. The **10.5 ppm** peak in the NMR is consistent with a carboxylic acid proton, and the IR data supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group due to the strong O-H stretch and carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.
2. The aromatic protons (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm) suggest a para-substituted benzene ring.
3. The alkyl chain signals (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, and 0.9 ppm) correspond to a sec-butyl group (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃).

Thus, compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of esters or nitriles to carboxylic acids. However, since the starting material is already a carboxylic acid, no further reaction would occur under these conditions. Therefore, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Incorrect, as the substituent is not an ethyl group, and the structure does not match the spectroscopic data.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as this is an alkylbenzene and does not contain a carboxylic acid group.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Correct, as it matches the spectroscopic data and is the same as the starting material.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as this is an alkylbenzene and does not contain a carboxylic acid group.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

Answer: C
