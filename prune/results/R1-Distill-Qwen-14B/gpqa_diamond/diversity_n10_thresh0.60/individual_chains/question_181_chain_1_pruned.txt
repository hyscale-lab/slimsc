Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but let me try to think it through.

First, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, right, that's the approximate time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III stops, the change in neutrino flux we detect here would only be noticeable after that delay. But in this question, it's already happened, so we're considering the current state.

The pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, right? The main way the Sun produces energy. The pp-III branch involves higher energies because it's a later step in the fusion process. Oh, right, pp-I is the initial step where two protons fuse into deuterium via a positron and neutrino emission. Then pp-II and pp-III build on that. So, pp-III probably emits higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, but when the pp-III branch stops, what happens? Well, the other reactions (like pp-I and pp-II) are still ongoing. So the production of neutrinos from pp-III would stop. But other sources would still contribute. Oh wait, but the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So only pp-III is stopped.

Neutrinos are produced mainly in the proton-proton chain. The dominant neutrinos are the electron neutr
