Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see what I can remember.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks familiar. I think this is a two-dimensional metric, so it's probably describing some kind of surface. Oh right, maybe a 2-dimensional space embedded in a higher-dimensional space, like a sphere or something else.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere... I remember that term from general relativity. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Unlike a regular sphere, which has positive curvature, a pseudosphere has a saddle-shaped geometry. The area of a pseudosphere... I think it's infinite because as you go further out, the area keeps increasing.

But wait, the options don't have 'infinite' as an option. Let me check the options again. Oh, option D is +infty. So maybe that's the answer. But wait, I should probably think this through more carefully.

The metric given is written in terms of x and y coordinates. Let me see what the denominator looks like: 4 - x² - y². So the denominator is zero when x² + y² =4. So the radius here is 2, because 4 is 2 squared. So the metric is defined for points where x² + y² <4. So it's a region inside a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait a second, this is similar to the metric of a sphere, but with a negative curvature. Let me think about the metric of hyperbolic space. Hyperbolic space has a metric that looks like (1/(R² - r²)) dr² + r² dθ² or something like that, where r is the radial coordinate and R is a constant related to the curvature. For a pseudosphere, which is a 2D hyperbolic space, the metric might resemble something similar.

In this case, our metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me write it as ds² = (32)/(4 - (x² + y²)) (dx² + dy²). So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator goes to zero, making the metric blow up. That suggests that the boundary of the space is at x² + y² =4, which is a circle of radius 2, matching the radius r=2 given in the question.

Now, the area of a pseudosphere. If the pseudosphere has a constant negative curvature, I think its total area is infinite. Wait, isn't the area of a regular sphere finite? Like 4πr². But for a pseudosphere, which is an infinite surface, the area should be infinite. So if r is 2, the area is infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty, which would be the case. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but maybe I should compute the area using the metric. The area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Let's see, the metric is diagonal with components (32/(4 - x² - y²)) and the same for y. So the
