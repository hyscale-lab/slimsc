Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

The problem is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are four steps described:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
Hint b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options given are four ketones, so E must be a ketone. Since elimination of an inert gas likely forms a carbonyl, I think the last step is a dehydrohalogenation or similar, forming a ketone.

Let me break down each step.

First, from A to B: A reacts with HCN. HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, B would be an cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde or another carbonyl compound. Wait, but looking at the IR, A has a peak at ~1750, which is typical for a ketone or maybe an ester. But since the product is B, which after reduction becomes C, maybe A is a ketone, and B is a secondary alcohol after reduction? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, HCN adds to ketones to form a cyanohydrin. So A is a ketone, and B would be a cyanohydrin. Then B is reduced with H2 and Pd. Hydrogenation of the nitrile group perhaps. Wait, the cyanohydrin is a vicinal diol with a nitrile group attached. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about what each reaction does.

A â†’ B: HCN addition. So A is a carbonyl compound, probably a ketone because the IR is ~1750, which is a
