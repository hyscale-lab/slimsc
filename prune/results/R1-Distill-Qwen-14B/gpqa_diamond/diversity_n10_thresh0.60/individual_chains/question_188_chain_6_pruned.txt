Okay, so I've got this problem about crystal planes and interplanar distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let me think through this.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Right, rhombohedral structures are a type of hexagonal crystal system, but wait, no, wait, actually, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system? Or is it a separate system? Oh wait, no, I think rhombohedral is its own system, sometimes called trigonal. It has a unit cell where all edges are equal, and all angles are the same. So in this problem, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for calculating the interplanar distance d for a plane (hkl) is given by the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ) )

Wait, wait, or is it different for different crystal systems? Because in cubic systems, the formula simplifies because all angles are 90 degrees, so the cross terms go away. But here, the angles aren't 90, so I can't ignore those terms.

So let's write down what's given. The crystal is rhombohedral, so a = b = c, and α = β = γ = 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, which I think refers to the lattice parameter a. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance would be the edge length, right? So a = 10 A here.

The plane in question is (111), so h = 1, k = 1, l = 1.

Plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) - 2*(1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30) )

Let me compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

First, compute the numerator: a is 10 A.

Denominator inside sqrt: (1+1+1) is 3. Then subtract
