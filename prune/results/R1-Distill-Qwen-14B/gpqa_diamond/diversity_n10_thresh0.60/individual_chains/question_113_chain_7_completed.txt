Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The possible formulas given are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. The options are A to D.

First, let's go through each piece of data given.

FTIR Spectrum:
- Very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but a very broad peak could also be an alcohol or maybe a ketone? No, ketones have sharp peaks around 1700. So the broad peak at 3000 is probably O-H from something like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H around 2500-3300, often a very broad one. But wait, the problem says very broad, which might suggest a carboxylic acid. Hmm.

Also, the FTIR has strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Let's think: 1700 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 is a bit lower. Could that be conjugated, like an aromatic ring or an amide? Wait, but the possible compounds don't have nitrogen. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or maybe a conjugated ketone. Or maybe it's an acid derivative. But wait, 1650 could also be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a ketone with an aromatic group. Alternatively, considering the 1700 and 1650 together, perhaps it's an ester or a conjugated carbonyl group. Wait, esters have a carbonyl around 1730-1750 usually, but maybe in some cases it's lower. Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is an ester and the 1650 is another functional group. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the 1700 could be a ketone, and the 1650 could be a conjugated double bond, like an aromatic ring. For example, like acetophenone, which has a carbonyl around 1680-1700 and an aromatic ring. But that's just a guess.

1H NMR Spectrum:
- Several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule must have an alkene group somewhere. So, maybe something with a double bond, like an ester with a double bond or a ketone with a double bond.

Mass Spectrometry:
- Fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let's think about what gives a m/z of 45. Common fragments include CH3CO (43?), but wait, 45 could be something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group or something similar. Alternatively, another approach is to think about the possible formulas and see which could produce a fragment of 45.

Now, let's look at the possible formulas and see which make sense.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: Each degree is a double bond or ring. For C6H12O2, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one degree of unsaturation. But wait, no, wait: The general formula for degrees of unsaturation is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C6H12O2: (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. So that could be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR says there are vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond. So one DoU is a double bond. So the compound has a double bond, and perhaps an oxygen-containing group, maybe an ester or a ketone.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: could be two double bonds, or one double bond and a ring, or two rings. But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. So another degree could be a ring or another double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. So like a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU: (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU, likely a double bond.

The IR shows a very broad peak at 3000, possibly O-H from a carboxylic acid, alcohol, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. But another possibility: if there's an ester, the O-H in the IR might not be present, unless it's an acid. Wait, esters don't have O-H, so for the broad peak, it's likely something with an O-H, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, the FTIR also shows 1700 and 1650. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad. So maybe that's the case.

But wait, let's think about the possible functional groups. A carbonyl at 1700 could be an ester, ketone, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 might suggest conjugation.

Looking at the options, the O and O2 could be from ester groups or maybe a ketone and something else.

Wait, another possibility: the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring. So maybe it's something like an aromatic ketone or an ester attached to an aromatic ring.

Now, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so the compound has a double bond, perhaps an alkene.

Looking at the mass spec, the m/z 45 could come from a fragment that's a ketone or perhaps a methyl group attached to something. Alternatively, 45 is the mass of a methyl ester group? Hmm, not sure. Let me think: 45 is the mass of (CH3CO)+, which is 43, but 45 is maybe CH2CH2O or something else. Alternatively, perhaps a fragment like (CH2)2O, but that's 44... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a (COO-) group? Wait, COOH is 60, but perhaps a smaller fragment.

Wait, 45 could be a methyl group attached to something. Alternatively, let me think about the possible formulas and see which one would produce a fragment with m/z 45.

For example, if the compound is an ester, say, something like methyl something. Let's think about the molecular formulas.

Option A: C6H12O2. That's 6 carbons. If it's an ester, the formula for an ester is RCOOR', which would have (n + m + 2) O? Wait, no, each ester is RCOOR', which is (n carbons from RCOO) and m from R' (like methyl: 1 carbon). So for example, ethyl acetate is C4H8O2.

So if the formula is C6H12O2, perhaps it's an ester with a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester, but that's less likely.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so maybe it's a vinyl ester or something with a double bond.

Wait, another angle: what would give a mass fragment of 45? Let's see, 45 is the mass of (CH3COO)+, which is 59? Wait, no, wait: CH3COO is 60? Wait, no: CH3COO- would be 60. But as a fragment, maybe it's losing something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CH2O group, which is 44. But that's not 45.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketene group? Not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a CH2CO fragment. CH2CO has a molecular weight of 43 (12*2 + 1*2 + 16) = 24 + 2 +16=42? No, 12*2 is 24, 2 H's is 2, 16 for C=O, so 24+2+16=42. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps a CH2CH2O group is 44, but that's not 45. Another thought: the fragment could be a methyl group attached to O, like OCH2CH2 something. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3CH2O group, which is 45? Let's compute: CH3CH2O would be 12*2 + 6 + 16 = 24 +6 +16=46. Hmm, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2O group, but that's 30.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible molecular formulas and see which could produce a fragment at 45.

For each option:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight is (6*12) +12 + (2*16)=72+12+32=116.

If the molecular ion is at 116, but the fragment is at 45. So 116 - 45 =71. What would lose 71? Maybe the molecule breaks into two parts.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment at 45 is a part of the molecule. What's the structure that would have a fragment of 45.

Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. So what's 45? Let's think of possible groups.

- CH3COOH (carboxylic acid): molecular weight 60, but maybe a fragment. Alternatively, maybe a methyl ester group: CH3OOC- would be part of an ester.

But perhaps a better approach is to think about what each formula would imply in terms of functional groups.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: ester, ketone plus something else. But the IR has a broad peak at 3000, which would indicate O-H, so maybe a carboxylic acid. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would be CnH2nO2. But let's check: For a carboxylic acid, the general formula is CnH2nO2. So for n=6, it would be C6H12O2. That matches option A.

So if it's a carboxylic acid, then the IR would show a broad O-H peak around 2500-3300, which matches the first IR peak. The 1700 peak would be the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak? Hmm, maybe that's a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aromatic ring (but with six carbons, that's possible). So perhaps it's benzoic acid or something similar.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So if it's a carboxylic acid, maybe the structure is something like CH2CH2COOH, but that's more like an unsaturated acid, or perhaps a substituted one.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. For example, if it's an ester with a double bond, like vinyl acetate. Wait, vinyl acetate is C4H6O2. But the options here are C6H12O2, which is a higher molecular weight.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, but that's a lactide or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: The presence of a broad peak in IR at 3000 suggests an O-H, either from a carboxylic acid, an alcohol, or perhaps a phenol. But the options don't suggest phenol, as the O count is either 1 or 2.

Wait, the IR shows strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, and the 1650 could be a conjugated double bond or an aromatic ring.

Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl is usually around 1730-1750. But in some cases, it can be lower if conjugated. So the 1700 could be an ester with conjugation, and the 1650 could be an aromatic ring or a conjugated double bond.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so it must have a double bond adjacent to something else. Like an alkene.

Let me think about the possible structures.

If the formula is C6H12O2, and the structure is a carboxylic acid, it would be something like CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but that's a straight-chain acid, which doesn't have a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. That would have a double bond (vinyl Hs) and a carboxylic acid group (O-H). That fits the IR and NMR.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Let's say it's an ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's a vinyl ester. The ester group would give peaks around 1700 in IR (maybe a bit lower if conjugated). The vinyl Hs would show up in the NMR. The O-H in IR would be from an acid, but in an ester, there's no O-H unless it's an acid. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a ketone with a double bond. Let's think about that. If it's a ketone, the IR would show a peak around 1700. But then where does the O-H peak come from? Unless it's an alcohol as well, but that would complicate the formula.

Wait, maybe the O-H is from an alcohol group in the molecule. So the compound could be a diol or a ketone with an alcohol group. But that would change the formula, like maybe having two O's: one from the ketone and another from the alcohol. Let's see the possible formulas.

Looking back, the options with two O's are A and C: A is C6H12O2, C is C6H10O2.

So considering option A (C6H12O2) as a possibility, perhaps it's a diol with a ketone, but that would require a structure like having both an alcohol and a ketone group. Alternatively, an ester and an alcohol, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an aromatic compound with a ketone and an ester group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's consider the possible functional groups based on the IR.

Broad peak at 3000: O-H (like alcohol, acid, or phenol).

Peaks at 1700 and 1650: carbonyl (C=O) and maybe conjugated.

If it's a carboxylic acid, then 1700 is the C=O, and 1650 could be a conjugated double bond (like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated acid). So the structure would have a double bond adjacent to the COOH group. That would fit the NMR vinyl Hs.

So a possible structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. Formula for this would be C6H10O2. Wait, let's check:

CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH: The formula is C6H10O2. Because:

CH2=CH (2 C, 3 H), CH2CH2 (2 C, 4 H?), wait no. Let me count:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH.

Carbon: 2 (from CH2=CH) + 2 (CH2-CH2) + 2 (from COOH: COOH has 2 O's, but the carbons are 2— wait, no. COOH is -COOH: that's one carbon. So the chain is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH: that's 5 carbons? Wait, 1 (CH2=CH) is 2 carbons, then another two (CH2-CH2), and then the COOH is one carbon. So 2+2+1=5. But the formula is C6H12O2. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, no: each CH2 group is one carbon. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH. So that's:

CH2=CH (2 carbons) + CH2 (1) + CH2 (1) + COOH (1) → 2+1+1+1=5 carbons. But the formula is C6, so perhaps I'm missing a carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a six-carbon chain with a double bond and a COOH group. For example, CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH but with a double bond somewhere else. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula.

Option A: C6H12O2. For a six-carbon molecule with a double bond (since NMR has vinyl Hs) and a carboxylic acid group.

The general formula for a carboxylic acid is CnH2nO2. For n=3: C3H6O2. For n=4: C4H8O2. For n=5: C5H10O2. For n=6: C6H12O2. So yes, option A is a six-carbon carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but that's a saturated acid (no double bond), which would not have vinyl Hs in NMR. So that's a problem because the NMR shows vinyl Hs, so the compound must have a double bond.

Ah, so if the compound is a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond, the formula would be C6H10O2. Because a double bond reduces the number of H's by two (since each double bond reduces H by 2). So for C6, the general formula for a saturated acid is C6H12O2. But if there's a double bond, it would be C6H10O2. So that's option C.

Wait, but then the IR would have O-H from the acid (broad peak), the 1700 would be the C=O, and 1650 could be the conjugated double bond. That would fit.

So the structure would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid, like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. Wait, but that's five carbons. Oh, wait, perhaps with the double bond in a different position.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic structure, but I'm not sure.

But wait, the formula for option C is C6H10O2. So if it's a carboxylic acid, it would have a formula of C6H10O2, which is a six-carbon acid with a double bond. So that would make sense.

But wait, how does that affect the degrees of unsaturation (DoU)? For C6H10O2: DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. That could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds. Since the NMR shows vinyl Hs, which are from a double bond, that accounts for one. So the other DoU could be a ring or another double bond.

But in a carboxylic acid, the DoU would be one from the C=O and another from the double bond. So that fits.

So, IR: broad peak at 3000 (carboxylic acid O-H), 1700 (C=O), and 1650 (double bond conjugated with C=O).

NMR: has vinyl Hs, so the double bond is present.

Mass Spec: fragment at m/z=45.

But wait, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, would the mass spec show a fragment at 45? Let's think: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(10*1)+(16*2)=72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion would be at 114. The fragment at 45 is 45/114 ≈ 0.39 fraction, so perhaps it's a neutral loss or a break in the molecule.

Alternatively, the fragment could be from the carboxylic acid part. For example, losing the COOH group as a fragment. But the COOH is 60 (12+16*2 +1 for the H?), wait, actually, the carboxylic acid group is -COOH, which is 46 (12+16*2 +1). Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another approach: in mass spectrometry, common fragments include the tropylium ion (m/z 91 for benzene), but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH2=CH group. The mass of CH2=CH is 28 (12*2 +1*4). But 28 is not 45. Alternatively, perhaps a fragment like (CH2CH2O) would be 44 (12*2 + 6 +16= 24+6+16=46? Hmm, not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a ketene group. A ketene is RC=O, which has a mass of 45? Let me compute: R is CH3, then CH3C=O would have a mass of 45 (12*2 +1*3 +16=24+3+16=43). Hmm, close but not exactly 45.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CH2O group, which is CH2CH2O. Wait, CH2CH2O is (12*2) + (1*4) +16=24+4+16=44. No, that's 44. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a CH2CH2OCH3 group? No, that's larger. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3COO group, which is 59 (12*2 +3 +16*2=24+3+32=59). That's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CH2O- group, but that's 44. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe I should think about the mass in terms of the molecular formula. The fragment at 45 could be a CO group plus something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH3 group attached to something else. Not sure. Another thought: 45 is the mass of (CH3COO)- which is 59? No, (CH3COO-) is 60-1=59.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2O group with a methyl, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an ester. Let's reevaluate.

If the compound is an ester, the formula for an ester is RCOOR', where R and R' are alkyl groups. The formula would be CnH2nO2.

So, for example, ethyl acetate is C4H8O2. The formula given in the options is C6H12O2 (Option A), which would correspond to an ester where R is something like pentyl and R' is methyl, but that's a bit unlikely.

But wait, the formula C6H12O2 would be an ester with R and R' such that the total carbons sum to 6. For example, R could be pentyl and R' methyl, but let me compute: RCOO is (n+1) carbons for R being n carbons. So if R is butyl (4 carbons), RCOO would be 5 carbons, and R' is methyl (1 carbon), making the ester C5+1=6 carbons. So that would be an ester like methyl pentanoate. Structure: CH3OOCCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, but that's a saturated ester. The NMR has vinyl Hs, so the ester would have a double bond. That would make it a vinyl ester, like something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Let's compute the formula: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 → that's 3 carbons (CH2=CHCOO) plus 2 carbons (CH2CH3) → 5 carbons in total. Wait, but the formula needs to be C6H12O2. So perhaps a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That's CH2=CH (2 C) + CH2 (1 C) + COO (2 C) + CH2CH3 (2 C) → 2+1+2+2=7 C. No, that's too much. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3: that's 3 (CH2=CHCOO) + 3 (CH2CH2CH3) → 6 C. So the formula would be C6H10O2. Because each double bond reduces H by 2. So for C6H12O2 (if fully saturated), but with a double bond, it's C6H10O2. So that would match option C.

But wait, the mass spec fragment is 45. What would that correspond to in an ester structure? For example, the ester group is O-CO-O. If the molecule breaks between the two oxygen atoms, perhaps the fragment would be the RCOO group or the OR' group.

If the fragment is the RCOO group, the mass would be RCOO. For example, in methyl pentanoate, RCOO is pentanoyloxy (CH2CH2CH2CH2COO, which is 84 g/mol). That's way higher than 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the OR' group. For methyl, OR' is CH3O, which is 31 g/mol. Not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the R' group. For example, if R' is ethyl, then the fragment would be 46 (C2H5). No, but 45 is close. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a ketene group, which has the formula R-C=C=O. The mass of the ketene ion would be (R's mass) + 44 (since C=O is 28 +16=44). So if the fragment is CH3-C=C=O, that would be (15 [CH3]) +44=59. No, that's not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from an aldehyde group. The aldehyde fragment would be CHO, which is 30. Not 45.

Hmm. Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. Let's think about the options again, considering the possible functional groups and the mass fragment.

Option C is C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So possibilities: one double bond and one ring, or two double bonds.

If it's a di-substituted benzene with ester groups, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester (lactone), but that would have a ring and an ester group. But the NMR shows vinyl Hs, so that would require a double bond.

Wait, another angle: the presence of vinyl Hs suggests a double bond, so the molecule has at least one double bond. The IR shows a carbonyl, which could be a ketone or ester or acid. The O-H peak suggests an alcohol or acid.

Putting it all together: if the compound is a vinyl ester, like CH2=CHCOO-R, then the ester group would have the carbonyl peak around 1700, the vinyl Hs would be in NMR, the O-H would not be present (since esters don't have O-H), so that would contradict the IR data. So that can't be.

So the O-H must come from a carboxylic acid group. So the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid, like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. The formula would be C6H10O2 (since each double bond reduces H by 2: from C6H12O2 to C6H10O2).

In this case, the IR would show O-H at 3000, C=O at 1700, and the conjugated double bond leading to a peak at 1650.

The NMR would show vinyl Hs from the CH2=CH group.

The mass spec fragment of 45 could be from the COOH group losing something. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks to release a CH2CH2O group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let me compute the possible fragments. If the molecule breaks at the double bond, perhaps the COOH part and the rest.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone. For example, if the molecule breaks to form a ketone fragment with mass 45. A ketone would be R-CO-. The mass of the CO is 28, so R would be 17 (CH3- is 15, which is close but not 17). Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CO group, which is 43 (12*2 + 1*4 +16= 24+4+16=44). Hmm, not 45.

Wait, let me compute the possible structure again. If the formula is C6H10O2, and it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid, the structure would be something like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. Let me calculate the molecular weight: 6 carbons, 10 H, 2 O.

Yes: 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 2*16=32. Total 114.

In mass spec, when the molecule breaks, possible fragments could be from either side of the double bond. The COOH group is 60 (12+16*2 +1=60?), but perhaps the molecule breaks to lose part of the chain.

Alternatively, the fragment at 45 could come from the CH2CH2O group, but as I thought earlier, that's 44. Not matching.

Wait, another approach: the formula C6H10O2 has a molecular weight of 114. So if the fragment is at 45, perhaps the molecule loses a larger fragment, leaving 45. So 114 - 45 =69. So the molecule could lose a 69 fragment. But what's 69? Possible a hexyl group (69 is 69? Let me see: hexyl would be C5H11, which is 72 g/mol). No, that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps a butyl group (C4H9 is 57, not 69).

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 could be a water molecule (18), but that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CO (28) plus something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's the COO group. COO is 44, but the fragment is 45. Hmm, 44 plus a hydrogen? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH3CO (43) group. But 43 is close to 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group (44) plus a hydrogen? Not likely.

Hmm, I'm not making progress on the mass spec part. Maybe I should focus on the other data and see which option fits best.

So, considering the IR, NMR, and possible functional groups:

- O-H (from acid): option A and C have two O's, but let me check their formulas.

Wait, option A is C6H12O2. If it's a carboxylic acid, it's a saturated acid (no double bond), which doesn't fit the NMR. So that's eliminated.

Option C is C6H10O2. This fits a carboxylic acid with a double bond, so it's a likely candidate.

Now, the mass spec fragment at 45. Let's think about the possible structures again.

If the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH (C6H10O2), the possible fragments could be from cleavage at the double bond. For example, if it breaks between the double bond and the rest, maybe the COOH part remains as a fragment. The COOH group is 60, which is higher than 45. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the CH2CH2COOH part, which is 59. Still not 45.

Wait, another approach: maybe the molecule undergoes a McLafferty rearrangement, which is common in ketones and esters. The McLafferty rearrangement produces a fragment with a mass that is the parent mass minus 44 (since it's the loss of an alkene and a hydroxyl group). But in this case, the parent mass is 114. So 114 -44=70. But the fragment is at 45, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule undergoes a beta-scission, losing a part of the chain. For example, breaking after the second carbon.

But I'm not getting closer. Maybe I should think about the possible options again.

So, the options are:

A) C6H12O2 → O-H (acid) and a double bond elsewhere → but requires a double bond for the NMR, but the formula for a saturated acid is C6H12O2, which doesn't have a double bond. So unless it's an ester with a double bond, but then there's no O-H.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. But the O-H would be from a lactone? No, lactones are cyclic esters and don't have O-H unless it's a hemiacetal, which is not the case here.

Alternatively, the compound is a diester with a double bond. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group. Let's think.

If it's a ketone, the IR would have a peak around 1700. The O-H from an alcohol would be a broad peak around 3000. The NMR would have vinyl Hs if there's a double bond. So the formula would be C6H12O2 (if it's a ketone and an alcohol, each O is accounted for).

Wait, but the formula for a diol with a ketone would have more H's. Let me compute.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the degrees of unsaturation for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2 → DoU=1. So one ring or double bond.

Option B: C6H10O → DoU=2. So two rings, two double bonds, or one ring and one double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2 → DoU=2.

Option D: C6H12O → DoU=1.

Now, the NMR shows vinyl Hs, so at least one double bond is present, so DoU must be at least 1.

Looking back, the IR has a broad peak at 3000 (O-H), 1700 (C=O), and 1650 (conjugated C=O or double bond).

So, for each option:

Option A: DoU=1. If it's a ketone (C=O) and an O-H (alcohol), but then where's the vinyl Hs? No, because DoU=1 implies only one double bond or ring. But the NMR has vinyl Hs, so it must have a double bond. So for option A, it's possible if it's a ketone, an alcohol, and a double bond. But wait, that would require three O's? No, because the formula is C6H12O2. So that can't be. So perhaps option A is not the right choice.

Option C: C6H10O2, DoU=2. So could be a double bond and another double bond or ring. If it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, that fits.

Option B: C6H10O, DoU=2. If it's an alcohol with two double bonds, but then where's the C=O? Because the IR has a peak at 1700, which suggests a carbonyl group. So the molecule must have a C=O, which would require an O in the formula. So option B (C6H10O) has one O, so that can't account for the C=O. So option B is eliminated.

Option D: C6H12O, DoU=1. So only one ring or double bond. But the IR has a C=O, which would require an O. So it could be a ketone and an alcohol. But then, the NMR shows vinyl Hs, implying a double bond. So DoU=1 would mean one double bond. So, yes, but the formula would be O=1. So the C=O would be from a ketone, and the O-H from an alcohol. But would that fit the IR?

The IR would show a strong C=O peak around 1700, a broad O-H around 3000, and another peak at 1650 which could be a conjugated double bond.

So for option D, the structure could be a ketone with an alcohol and a double bond. Let's see the formula: C6H12O. DoU=1, so one double bond or ring. Wait, no, that can't be, because a double bond requires DoU=1, but if there's a double bond, then the formula would have H's reduced by 2 per double bond. Let's compute: for option D, C6H12O. The formula for a ketone would be CnH2nO. For n=6, C6H12O. So yes, that fits. But then, if there's a double bond, the formula would require H's reduction. So that can't be, unless the DoU is 2. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should list the possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Possible structures: ester, carboxylic acid, ketone with alcohol.

But if it's a carboxylic acid, it's C6H12O2, which is saturated, so no double bond, which contradicts NMR. So no.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Structure: carboxylic acid with a double bond. Fits all IR, NMR.

Mass spec: fragment at 45. Maybe it's losing a part of the molecule, but I'm not sure.

So, given all that, the best fit is option C: C6H10O2.

But wait, the options are A, B, C, D. Wait, the options for the answer are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

So the correct answer would be option C.


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The possible molecular formulas are **C₆H₁₂O₂**, **C₆H₁₀O**, **C₆H₁₀O₂**, and **C₆H₁₂O**. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### FTIR Data:
- **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol.
- **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), possibly from a carboxylic acid, ester, or ketone.
- **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹**: Likely due to a conjugated carbonyl group or aromatic system.

### ¹H NMR Data:
- Peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** (H attached to a double bond) indicate the presence of a double bond in the molecule.

### Mass Spectrometry Data:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is observed. This could correspond to a common fragment such as CH₃CO (43) or a related group.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **C₆H₁₂O₂**:
   - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1, indicating one double bond or ring.
   - If it is a carboxylic acid, the formula **C₆H₁₂O₂** corresponds to a saturated acid (e.g., hexanoic acid), which lacks a double bond. This contradicts the NMR data showing vinyl hydrogens, so this option is eliminated.

2. **C₆H₁₀O**:
   - DoU = 2, indicating two double bonds, a ring, or a combination.
   - The IR data shows a strong C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, requiring at least one oxygen in the carbonyl group. However, this formula has only one oxygen, which cannot account for the C=O group. This option is eliminated.

3. **C₆H₁₀O₂**:
   - DoU = 2, indicating a double bond and another functional group (e.g., a carbonyl group).
   - This formula is consistent with an **α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid** (e.g., CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂COOH). The broad O-H peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carboxylic acid, the C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is from the acid, and the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak is due to the conjugated double bond. The vinyl hydrogens in the NMR are explained by the double bond. This option fits all the data.

4. **C₆H₁₂O**:
   - DoU = 1, indicating one double bond or ring.
   - The IR data shows a C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, suggesting a carbonyl group. However, this formula has only one oxygen, which cannot account for the C=O group. This option is eliminated.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with **C₆H₁₀O₂**, as it explains the O-H and C=O peaks in the IR spectrum, the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR, and the molecular formula matches the data.

**Answer: C**
