Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm. It's about the Michael addition reaction. I remember the Michael addition involves enolate ions attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each is a Michael addition reaction, and I need to figure out the products. Then match them with the options given, which are A to D, each providing possible products for A, B, and C.

Let me tackle each part one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). The product is labeled (A).

Okay, dimethyl malonate is a good donor in the Michael reaction. It's a diethyl ester of malonic acid, right? So its structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. The enolate would form at the alpha position, which is the central carbon here. So the enolate would have negative charge on the central carbon, adjacent to the two ester groups.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH–C(p-tolyl)–OCH3. Wait, no. Wait, E-configuration. Let me think: the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 maybe? Let me structure the molecule. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO–. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO–, but in this case, the substituent is at the 3 position, so perhaps the structure is CH2–CH2–C(p-tolyl)=O? No, wait, wait. Let me get this right. Acrylate is CH2=CHCO2R. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon, but I think I'm getting confused. Let me write it properly.

If it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure would be CH2=CH–C(p-tolyl)–OCH3. Wait, but that would be a three-carbon chain. So the main chain is CH2=CH–C(p-tolyl)–OCH3. Wait, but that's four carbons? No, wait: acrylate is two carbons, so maybe it's a three-carbon chain. Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH–CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group substituting on the triple bond? Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is on the middle carbon of the double bond. So the structure is (E)-CH2–CH(p-tolyl)–CH2–OCH3? No, that's
