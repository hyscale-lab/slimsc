Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is, relative to the observer. Oh, and they mention that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1. So, I guess units are in terms of c, which is 1.

Wait, I remember from my studies that when dealing with moving media and light, it's related to special relativity. Oh right, in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, here the light is in a medium, so maybe it's different? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. Wait. The speed of light in a medium isn't c, but it's v = c/n, where n is the index of refraction. So normally, when the medium is stationary relative to the observer, the speed of light inside is c/n. But this is when the medium is at rest in the observer's frame.

But now, the glass is moving. So the medium is moving relative to the lab frame. So we need to find the speed of the light beam as observed in the lab frame when the medium is moving.

Hmm, right. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving.

Wait, but in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. So if the glass is moving, how do we transform this into the lab frame?

I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Let me recall that formula. The velocity u' in one frame is related to the velocity u in another frame moving at velocity v by:

u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²)

Wait, but wait. Which frame is moving? Oh, in special relativity, when you have two frames, S and S', where S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. The formula is for transforming velocities from S' to S.

Let me think: in the glass's rest frame (let's say S'), the light's speed is u' = c/n. Because in the glass, the light is moving at c/n in the same direction as the glass is moving towards the
