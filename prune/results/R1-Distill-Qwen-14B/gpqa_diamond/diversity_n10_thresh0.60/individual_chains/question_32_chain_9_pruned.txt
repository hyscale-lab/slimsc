Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at a certain speed. Hmm, let's see what I can remember about this.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So X is Li-6, I think. So the mass number A is 6.

I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, the energy of a particle isn't just its rest mass energy. Oh right, the total energy includes kinetic energy and rest mass energy. The formula for total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

So first, I need to calculate gamma. The speed v is 0.96c. Let me plug that into the gamma equation. Gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2). Simplifying that, the c^2 cancels out. So it's 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2).

Let me compute 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... Hmm, square of 0.28 is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma becomes 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, 0.28 * 3.5714 is 1. Because 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28 times 0.5714 is approximately 0.16, so 0.84 + 0.16 = 1. So yes, gamma is about 3
