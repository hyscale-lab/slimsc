Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the seven crystal systems. Right, it's also called the trigonal crystal system sometimes. The question gives the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. 

Wait, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula I think I remember is something like d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos(alpha) - 2mn cos(beta) - 2nl cos(gamma)) ), but wait, no, I'm getting confused. Or is it for hexagonal systems? Maybe it's the Miller indices l, m, n, and the structure factor... Oh wait, no, the general formula for interplanar spacing is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of squares of the reciprocals scaled by the lattice parameters and angles. Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance for a crystal plane (hkl) is given by the formula 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/a² - 2(hk cosθ)/(a²) where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should think in terms of the metric tensor.

Oh right, the formula for d-spacing is derived from the structure
