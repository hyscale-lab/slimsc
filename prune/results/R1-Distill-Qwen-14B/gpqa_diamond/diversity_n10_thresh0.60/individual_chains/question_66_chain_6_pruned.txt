Okay, so I'm trying to answer this SMEFT question about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. Hmm, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that these theories are used when you have new physics at a high scale, and you parameterize the effects of that new physics on the Standard Model particles.

The question gives four options, all about symmetries. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. I need to figure out which of these must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Wait, wait. So the operators in SMEFT are constructed in a way that they respect certain symmetries. I think that SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model (SM) Lagrangian. These operators should preserve the same symmetries as the SM, except for those potentially broken by new physics.

Let me think about each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: I remember that the SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So any operator added in SMEFT should also respect Lorentz symmetry. Because if it didn't, that would mean the operator isn't covariant under Lorentz transformations, which would complicate things. So operators must be Lorentz scalars, which means their structure is Lorentz-invariant. So yes, Lorentz symmetry is a must.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. The SM and thus SMEFT respect Poincare symmetry because the effective operators are local. But wait, are all operators in SMEFT automatically Poincare invariant?
