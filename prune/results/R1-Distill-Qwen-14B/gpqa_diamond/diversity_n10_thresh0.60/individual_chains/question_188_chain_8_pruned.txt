Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances in crystals are calculated using some formula from X-ray diffraction. Let me think. Oh right, the formula is related to the reciprocal of the interplanar distance being equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices divided by something involving the lattice parameters and the angles.

Wait, the formula I think is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) * [1 + 2cosα cosβ cosγ - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ]. Is that right? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact terms. Oh wait, that's for a general hexagonal or rhombohedral crystal? No, wait, maybe that's for a tetragonal system. Hmm, no, wait, the formula is actually derived for a cubic system, but when the angles aren't 90 degrees, it's more complicated.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance formula for a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c (but in this case, it's a rhombohedral, so a = b = c, and all angles are same, 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral or maybe even a trigonal system.

So for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by the formula: 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) * [1 + 2cosα cosβ cosγ - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ]. Oh right, because in a rhombohedral crystal, the unit cell has all edges equal (a = b = c) and all angles equal (α = β = γ).

In this case, the Miller indices are (111), so h = k = l = 1. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom, but wait, that's the interatomic distance, which I think is the lattice parameter 'a' in this case. Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', but for other structures it could be different. Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is rhombohedral, so each atom is at the corners, and the interatomic distance would be a√(something), maybe? Wait, no, if it's a simple cubic, the interatomic distance is 'a', but in a BCC or FCC structure, it's different. But the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So I think a is 10 Angstrom.

Wait, let me be careful. The interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms. In a simple cubic structure, it's equal to 'a'. So if the structure is simple cubic, with a = 10 Angstrom, then yes. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps each atom has neighbors at a distance 'a' because it's a primitive unit cell. Hmm, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe the given interatomic distance is 'a' for the rhombohedral structure. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So the given a is 10 Angstrom, and the angles α = β = γ = 30 degrees each. So let's plug them into the formula.

So first compute the denominator, which is a squared: a²
