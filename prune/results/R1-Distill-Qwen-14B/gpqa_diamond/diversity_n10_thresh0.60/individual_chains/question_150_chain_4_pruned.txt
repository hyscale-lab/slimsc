Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning. Let's see what I can do.

So, the question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, and then determining the product after a series of reactions. The reaction steps are: first, treatment with NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and finally aqueous KOH with heat.

The molecular formula given is C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is C8H9NO. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees: could be a benzene ring (3 double bonds equivalent), a double bond or ring, and maybe an aldehyde group or something else.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's probably an aldehyde proton, but the integration is 1H. Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But a triplet? Aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and appear as singlets. Hmm, but maybe in a conjugated system, it's split. Wait, could it be an enol or some coupling?

Wait, no, another thought: Maybe it's an aldehyde (like RCHO) but perhaps it's coupled with another proton. Or wait, maybe it's an aromatic proton? No, aromatic protons are typically lower than 9.72. So aldehyde makes sense. So 9.72 is the aldehyde proton, maybe.

Next, 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). That's a typical pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets suggest coupling between adjacent protons. So maybe a para-substituted aromatic ring where each pair of protons is split into doublets. Like two substituents on the benzene ring, perhaps. But wait, the integrations are each 2H. So perhaps two sets of two equivalent protons each. So maybe a substituted benzene with two substituents in para positions, but that
