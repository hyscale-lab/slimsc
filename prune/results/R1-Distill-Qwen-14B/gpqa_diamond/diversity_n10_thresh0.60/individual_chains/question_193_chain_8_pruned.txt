Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So it's n = 1 / plx^5, where n is the number of stars. They're asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, right. Parallax is related to distance, so I think I need to express parallax in terms of distance and then see how n depends on that.

Wait, what's the formula that connects parallax and distance again? Oh right, parallax (plx) in parsecs is equal to 1 divided by the distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. Or, rearranged, d = 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

So if plx is 1/d, then let's substitute that into the given equation. The number of stars n is proportional to 1 / (plx)^5. Substituting plx with 1/d, we get:

n ‚àù 1 / ( (1/d) )^5

Let me compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. So 1 divided by that is d^5.

Wait, because 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So n is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range
