Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question gives me the FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, and I need to figure out which one matches all the given data.

Starting with the FTIR: There's a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. A very broad one might be from an alcohol, but wait, another possibility is a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch because the -OH is more acidic and the hydrogen is more tightly held, leading to a broader peak. Also, the O-H in an alcohol is usually less broad but can vary. So this peak suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the other absorption peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 cm^-1 peak is a bit lower than 1700; maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl group. Wait, another thought: if there's a carbonyl, and maybe an ester or a ketone, but the 1650 could be an aromatic C=C stretch. Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which might explain the lower wavenumber. Like a ketone with a conjugated double bond.

Looking at the NMR data next. It mentions peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens, which are the protons on a double bond, like CH2=CH-. So the compound probably has an alkene group. Also, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that the molecule has a double bond, maybe part of a conjugated system.

Now the Mass Spec: a fragment peak at m/z=45. Let me think about what fragments would give that. 45 is a common mass. For example, the (CH3)2O group (like in ethers) would be 45 (29 for (CH3)2O: Wait, wait, wait. Wait, let me calculate. CH3-O
