Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice science question here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question talks about a substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. When X reacts with liquid Y, it releases a gas W. The molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms from this reaction, and when heated, G releases B. B has a melting point very close to 277 K, which under normal conditions is about 4 degrees Celsius, right? Because 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is 4°C.

So, the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's similar to its very close analog. Hmm.

The question is asking about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. So, I need to figure out what elements are in X and then sum the lightest and heaviest.

Let me break down the information:

1. Gas W: same number of neutrons and protons. So, the molecule must be something with an equal number of protons and neutrons. Wait, but wait. The molecule's atoms, or the molecule as a whole? If it's the molecule, then the total protons and total neutrons are equal.

Wait, for a molecule to have the same number of neutrons and protons, maybe it's a diatomic molecule? Let's think about common gases. For example, H2O is not a gas at room temperature, but maybe CO2? No, CO2 is a gas but let's see.

Wait, another approach: think about the gas whose molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons in total. Let's think about possible gases. Maybe H2? Hydrogen gas. Hydrogen atoms have 1 proton and 0 neutrons each. So H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Wait, that's not equal. So not H2.

Wait, another possibility: maybe CO2? Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (for the most common isotope, 12C). Oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (16O). So each CO2 molecule has 6 + 8
