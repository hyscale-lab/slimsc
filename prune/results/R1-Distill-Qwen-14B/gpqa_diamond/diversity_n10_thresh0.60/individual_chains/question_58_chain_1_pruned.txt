Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me go through it step by step.

The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a temporary cutoff or some other method to handle these infinities, and then you take the cutoff to infinity again later.

So each option is a different theory. Let's think about each one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I recall that string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics and general relativity. Because it's a theory that includes gravity and works at high energies, but I'm not sure if it requires regularization. Wait, I think string theory doesn't have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories because it's background-independent and maybe the way it handles high energies is different. Or does it require regularization? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Maybe since it's a theory that's supposed to be finite, it doesn't need regularization. But I'm not certain.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics. QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Yang-Mills. I remember that QCD has issues with things like confinement and asymptotic freedom. How about regularization? Well, QCD calculations often involve dealing with things like renormalization, which sometimes requires regularization. Wait, but wait, does QCD require regularization when you're doing perturbative calculations? Because when you calculate loop diagrams, you can get divergences. So you might need to regularize, using methods like lattice regularization or Pauli-Villars. So QCD does require regularization in its calculations, I think.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics. QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established, renormalizable theory. But I also remember that renormalization in QED involves dealing with infinities, which are handled through regularization methods. So you have to regularize the calculations, like using a cutoff or dimensional regularization, before you can renormalize. So QED does require regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, this is the classical version, not quantum. So in
