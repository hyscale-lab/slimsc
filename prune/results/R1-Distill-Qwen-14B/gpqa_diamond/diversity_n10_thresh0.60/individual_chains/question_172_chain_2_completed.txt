Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, LTE means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so I can probably use some standard formulas here.

I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in different energy states is given by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference over (k*T), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

So the formula is n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) )

Wait, but in this case, the higher energy level must be the one with more excitation. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, if the energy level is more excited, that implies higher energy. So for the iron atoms in star_1, the excited state population is twice that of the same level in star_2.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh, no, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So for the same energy level, the population is twice as much as in star_2. Or maybe it's the ratio between two levels. Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous, but I think it's that the excited state in star_1 is twice as populated compared to star_2. Wait, no, no. Wait, the excited state is a higher energy state. So the number of atoms in the excited state relative to the ground state would depend on temperature.

Wait, the problem says iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps it's that the number of iron atoms in a certain excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or maybe it's the excitation compared to a lower level.

Wait, but the question mentions the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. So perhaps for each star, the number of atoms in the higher level (excited) compared to the lower level is given. So, for star_1, n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2. For star_2, n_upper2 / n_lower2 = 1, maybe? Wait, no, the problem says that the excitation is twice as much for star_1. So perhaps the ratio of n_upper/n_lower is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2? No, that can't be right because the energy difference is same for both stars, right?

Wait, perhaps the question says that the excitation (meaning the population of the excited state) is twice as high in star_1. So, for each star, the number of atoms in the excited state is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. So, for star_1, the ratio is (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) = 2, and for star_2, that ratio is (n_upper2)/(n_lower2) = 1. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is the same as the thermal excitation, so for each star, it's a function of their respective temperatures.

Wait, let me think again. The situation is that in star_1, the excited level is twice as populated (compared to star_2's same level). Or wait, no. Let me read the question again.

"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

Hmm, perhaps it's that the excitation (like the number in the excited state) is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So n_upper1 = 2 * n_upper2. Or n_upper1 / n_upper2 = 2. But wait, no, the question is about the same energy level in each star, so maybe that's not the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation potential is the same, but the number of atoms in that state is twice as much in star_1. So the ratio of n_upper / n_lower for star_1 is twice that for star_2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is given for each star. For example, in star_1, the ratio of the upper level to lower level is 2, and in star_2, it's 1. Or wait, maybe the ratio in star_1 is twice as high as in star_2. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But that doesn't necessarily make sense because the number of atoms depends on the temperature and the partition functions, which depends on more than just the ratio of two levels.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio of the excitation for each star. So, for star 1, the ratio of n_upper to n_lower is r1, and for star 2, it's r2. The question says r1 = 2 * r2.

But wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level as in star_2. So perhaps the excitation (n_upper) for star_1 is twice that for star_2. So n_upper1 = 2 * n_upper2. But that's not necessarily correct because the ratio depends on the temperature and the energy difference.

Wait, but perhaps the excitation ratio is the same for both stars, but star_1's temperature leads to a higher population. Wait, no, the problem states that the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So perhaps, the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) for star_1 is twice that for star_2.

So, let's write the Boltzmann equation for each star.

For star_1:

n_upper1 / n_lower1 = exp( - (ΔE) / (k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2:

n_upper2 / n_lower2 = exp( - (ΔE) / (k T2) )

But the question says that the excitation (n_upper) is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. Wait, but how? Because the ratio is n_upper/n_lower, so perhaps in star_1, n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2). Or maybe n_upper1 = 2 n_upper2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the excitation potential is the energy difference, so the ratio is n_upper / n_lower = exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

In star_1, the ratio is 2 times that of star_2. So:

For star_1: n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower) )

But wait, the energy difference ΔE is the same for both stars, because it's the same energy levels. So, for each star:

n_upper / n_lower = exp( - ΔE/(k T) )

So for star_1:

r1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2:

r2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The question states that r1 = 2 r2.

Wait, no, the question says that the excitation in star_1 is twice as much. So maybe the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n_upper1 = 2 n_upper2.

But the ratio n_upper / n_lower is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for each star, that's r = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So n_upper1 = r1 * n_lower1

n_upper2 = r2 * n_lower2

But for each star, the number of lower and upper states depends on the total population. Hmm, perhaps it's better to take the ratio of the two stars' excitation ratios.

Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the question states that the excitation (the population in the excited state) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n_upper1 = 2 n_upper2.

But each n_upper is determined by the Boltzmann factor for their respective temperatures.

So n_upper1 = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) * n_total1

Similarly, n_upper2 = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) * n_total2 )

But unless we have information about the total number of atoms or the degeneracies, perhaps we can assume that the ratio of the upper states is the same as the ratio of the Boltzmann factors, assuming same g_upper and g_lower for both stars.

Wait, but the problem says to assume LTE, so perhaps the ratio of excitation (n_upper) between the two stars is given. So n_upper1 = 2 n_upper2.

So, the ratio n_upper1 / n_upper2 = 2.

But each n_upper is (g_upper / g_lower) exp(-ΔE/(k T)) multiplied by n_total. But unless n_total is the same, that's not straightforward. Hmm, perhaps the stars have the same number of atoms, but that's not given.

Alternatively, perhaps we can take the ratio of the Boltzmann factors.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the excitation ratios is r1 / r2 = 2.

Because r1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), r2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So, r1/r2 = exp[ (ΔE/k)(1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ]

Set this equal to 2.

So:

exp[ (ΔE/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ] = 2

Take natural log of both sides:

(ΔE/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) = ln(2)

Let me rearrange this equation.

ΔE/(k) [ (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T1 -1/T2 = (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2).

So:

ΔE/(k) * (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Alternatively, that can be written as:

(ΔE (T2 - T1 )) / (k T1 T2 ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but wait, I think I might have an error in the sign. Let's check.

1/T1 - 1/T2 = (T2 - T1 )/( T1 T2 )

If T1 is larger than T2, then 1/T1 < 1/T2, so 1/T1 -1/T2 is negative. Since ΔE is positive, then (ΔE/k)(1/T1 -1/T2 ) = ln(2), which is positive. So 1/T1 -1/T2 must be positive, so T1 < T2.

Wait, but wait, in our case, because r1 = 2 r2, which implies that star_1 has a higher excitation ratio. So star_1 must be hotter than star_2, because higher temperatures lead to higher excitation (more atoms in higher energy states).

Wait, but wait, because r is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), higher T makes r larger. So if star_1 has a higher r, then T1 is higher than T2.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Let's say T1 is higher than T2. Then 1/T1 is less than 1/T2. So 1/T1 -1/T2 is negative. So (ΔE/k)(negative) = ln(2), which is positive. So that would require ΔE to be negative, which isn't possible.

Ah, that's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the excitation ratio is n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So if star_1 has higher excitation (r1 = 2 r2), then r1 > r2.

Take the ratio r1/r2 = 2.

r1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1 ) )

r2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2 ) )

So r1/r2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1 ) + ΔE/(k T2 ) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Set this equal to 2:

exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Take ln of both sides:

(ΔE/(k)) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ) = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

So:

(ΔE (T1 - T2)) / (k T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2)

Then, rearranging:

ln(2) = [ ΔE (T1 - T2) ] / (k T1 T2 )

Hmm, but I don't see any of the options directly matching this. The options are in terms of ln(2) equals some expression involving T1 and T2.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

But in our case, we have ln(2) = (ΔE (T1 - T2)) / (k T1 T2 )

But the question includes the energy difference ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but the options don't include any constants, so perhaps the equation is simplified, considering that ΔE/(k) equals something, but wait, 1.38e-23 J is the same as k_B * T where T is about 1 K, since k_B is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * T, so perhaps that's being used.

Wait, but the question gives ΔE as approximately 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (Boltzmann constant) = 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k.

Therefore, ΔE = k * 1 K. So when we substitute ΔE =k, the equation becomes:

ln(2) = [ k (T1 - T2) ] / (k T1 T2 ) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which is exactly option D.

Looking at the options again:

Option D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct equation is option D.


To solve the problem, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the ratio of populations of two energy levels in thermal equilibrium:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]

Here, \(n_{\text{upper}}\) and \(n_{\text{lower}}\) are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, meaning the ratio of the upper to lower energy levels is twice as large in star_1 as in star_2. Let \(r_1 = \frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}}\) and \(r_2 = \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}\). Then:

\[
r_1 = 2 r_2
\]

Using the Boltzmann distribution for each star:

\[
r_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad r_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

Taking the ratio \(r_1 / r_2\):

\[
\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right)
\]

Since \(r_1 / r_2 = 2\), we have:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Rearranging the terms:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which is equal to \(k\) (the Boltzmann constant). Substituting \(\Delta E = k\):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{k}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

This matches **Option D**.
