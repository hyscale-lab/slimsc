Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we have to use relativistic equations. So I guess I'll need to use some formulas from special relativity here.

Wait, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons and 4 neutrons, but this one has 3 neutrons? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh, no, wait. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So normally, lithium has 3 protons. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would be Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

So first, I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be calculated using the mass of its constituent protons, neutrons, and electrons, but wait, since it's a nucleus, I think we can consider it as a single particle. But I'm not sure about the exact numbers. Alternatively, maybe I can look up the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, but since I'm supposed to think this through, maybe I should remember that the mass of a nucleus can be found using the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons minus the binding energy, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the concept of relativistic energy without knowing the exact mass. Hmm, but probably, I should find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the rest mass using the standard atomic mass. Let me think. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0141 u (unified atomic mass units), right? Because Li-7 is more common, but this is Li-6. So assuming the mass is 6.0141 u.

Wait, but wait. The actual atomic mass of ^6Li is about 6.0141 u. But that includes the electrons. Oh, but in the nucleus, the electrons aren't part of the nucleus. So perhaps I should subtract the electrons. Wait, but the nucleus is Li^3+, right? Because Li normally has 3 electrons. So if it's a bare nucleus, it's +3 charge. So the mass would be the atomic mass minus 3 times the mass of an electron. But electrons are much lighter than nucleons. Let me think: the mass of an electron is about 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons would be about 0.001645 u. So the nuclear mass would be approximately 6.0141 u minus 0.001645 u, which is about 6.012455 u.

Wait, but maybe this level of precision is overkill. Because in practice, when dealing with heavy ions, the electrons' mass is negligible compared to the nucleons. So perhaps the mass of the nucleus is approximately 6.0141 u.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look up the exact mass of the ^6Li nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed without the exact mass because maybe the problem expects me to use a formula involving the velocity.

Wait, the problem is asking for the energy of the RHIC when the speed is 0.96c. So the energy in question is the total relativistic energy, which is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m_0 * c².

So I need to compute gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let me compute that.

So v = 0.96c.

So v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Then sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 (since 0.28^2 is 0.0784).

So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but let me compute 0.96 squared more precisely. 0.96 * 0.96 is (96/100)^2 = (9216/10000) = 0.9216 exactly. So yeah, 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is 0.28, as 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714286.

But wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me think: 0.28 * 3.5714286 ≈ 1. So that's correct.

Now, I need to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m_0 c². But m_0 is in atomic mass units, so I need to convert that to GeV.

I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So to convert u to GeV, I multiply by 931.5 MeV/u and then divide by 1000 to get GeV.

So m_0 c² = 6.0141 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

Let me compute that.

6.0141 * 931.5 = ?

Let me approximate 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.0141 * 931.5 ≈ 13.09 MeV.

So total is approximately 5589 +13.09 = 5602.09 MeV, which is about 5.60209 GeV.

Wait, but wait, but the problem says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. So, as I thought earlier, it's Li-6, which has a mass of about 6.0141 u.

So m_0 c² is 6.0141 * 931.5 MeV.

Compute that more accurately:

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.0141 * 931.5 = let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315, and 0.0041 *931.5 ≈ 3.81915. So total is 9.315 +3.81915 =13.13415 MeV.

So total m_0 c² is 5589 +13.13415 = 5602.13415 MeV, which is 5.602134 GeV.

So the rest energy is about 5.6021 GeV.

Now, the total energy is gamma * m_0 c². So 3.5714 * 5.6021 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5.6021.

Let me compute:

3 *5.6021 = 16.8063.

0.5714 *5.6021 ≈ let's see, 0.5 *5.6021=2.80105, 0.0714 *5.6021≈0.4017 (since 0.07 *5.6021 is 0.3921, and 0.0014 *5.6021≈0.00784, so total 0.400 approx). So 2.80105 +0.400 ≈ 3.20105.

So 3.20105 +16.8063 = 20.00735 GeV.

Wait, but wait, perhaps more accurately: 3.5714 *5.6021.

Alternatively, 3.5714 *5.6021 = ?

Calculate 3.5714 *5 = 17.857.

3.5714 *0.6021: let's compute 3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284, 3.5714 *0.0021 = 0.0075.

So 2.14284 +0.0075 = 2.15034.

Total is 17.857 +2.15034 = 20.00734 GeV.

So approximately 20.0073 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419 GeV, and option B is 23.069 GeV.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the exact gamma value again.

Wait, when v = 0.96c,

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Yes, correct.

And the rest mass energy is 6.0141 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

6.0141 *931.5 = let's compute accurately:

6*931.5 = 5589.

0.0141 *931.5: 0.01 *931.5 =9.315, 0.0041 *931.5= let's compute 0.004 *931.5=3.726, plus 0.0001 *931.5=0.09315. So 3.726 +0.09315=3.81915. So total is 9.315 +3.81915 =13.13415 MeV.

So 5589 +13.13415 =5602.13415 MeV =5.602134 GeV.

So E = gamma * m = 3.57142857 *5.602134 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.602134.

Let me approximate it as (35/10) *5.602134 = 3.5 *5.602134 = 19.60747.

Wait, but 3.5714 is 35/10 + 0.0714, which is 25/350? Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach:

3.57142857 *5.602134.

Break it down:

=3 *5.602134 + 0.57142857 *5.602134.

3*5.602134=16.806402.

0.57142857 *5.602134.

Compute: 0.5 *5.602134 =2.801067.

0.07142857 *5.602134.

0.07 *5.602134=0.392149.

0.00142857 *5.602134≈0.00800 (approx 0.00142857 *5.602134 = approx 0.00800).

So 0.392149 +0.00800 =0.400149.

So total for 0.57142857 *5.602134 is 2.801067 +0.400149 =3.201216.

So total E is 16.806402 +3.201216 =20.007618 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.0076 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher than what I got.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass.

Wait, wait, the mass of ^6Li is 6.0141 u. But when considering a nucleus, do I need to include the binding energy? Because the mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the masses of its parts. But in the case of computed m_0 c², it's the rest mass of the nucleus, which would already account for the binding energy. So perhaps the approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as a collection of nucleons, each moving relativistically, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. But the question says "the energy of the RHIC", which is the collider's energy, which is typically the total energy (kinetic + rest mass energy) of the ions. So I think my approach is correct.

But wait, let me check the calculation again.

E = gamma * m_0 c².

gamma is 3.57142857.

m_0 c² is 5.602134 GeV.

So 3.57142857 *5.602134.

Let me compute it step by step.

3.57142857 ×5.602134.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.602134.

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 ×0.002134 ≈0.007615.

So 2.14285714 +0.007615 =2.15047.

So total E is 17.85714285 +2.15047 =20.00761 GeV.

Hmm, same as before. So about 20.0076 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Hmm, none of the options exactly match 20.0076 GeV. But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me double-check the mass of ^6Li.

Wait, the standard atomic weight of ^6Li is approximately 6.0141 u. So perhaps I'm correct there.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as a proton, neutron, and alpha particle or something else. Wait, no, ^6Li is 3 protons, 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rest mass more accurately. Let me do that.

The exact atomic mass of ^6Li is approximately 6.0141 u.

But perhaps I should use more precise values. Let me check:

The exact value is 6.014103 u.

So m_0 c² =6.014103 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

Compute 6.014103 *931.5.

Let me compute this more accurately.

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.014103 *931.5 = let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.004103 *931.5.

0.004 *931.5 =3.726.

0.000103 *931.5≈0.0957.

So 3.726 +0.0957≈3.8217.

So 0.014103 *931.5 =9.315 +3.8217=13.1367 MeV.

So total is 5589 +13.1367 =5602.1367 MeV=5.6021367 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 ×5.6021367 GeV.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.57142857 ×5.6021367.

Let me compute this as (35/10) ×5.6021367 =3.5 ×5.6021367=19.60748 GeV.

Wait, no. 3.57142857 is actually 25/7 approximately, because 25/7 is 3.57142857.

25/7 *5.6021367 = ?

25 *5.6021367 =140.0534175.

Divide by 7: 140.0534175 /7 ≈20.00763107 GeV.

So approximately 20.0076 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have 20.0076. The closest one is option C, which is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recalculate gamma.

v =0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 =0.9216.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely.

Wait, perhaps I should compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

0.0784 is 784/10000.

sqrt(784)=28; sqrt(10000)=100. So sqrt(784/10000)=28/100=0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.57142857.

So no mistake there.

Hmm, I'm getting about 20.0076 GeV, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Let me think.

Kinetic energy (K.E.) is (gamma - 1) * m_0 c².

So in that case, E would be m_0 c² + K.E., which is the same as gamma * m_0 c², which is what I computed earlier.

Wait, unless RHIC's energy is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. So perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy.

Let me recalculate.

If E is the kinetic energy, then E = (gamma -1) * m_0 c².

So gamma is 3.57142857.

gamma -1 = 2.57142857.

So E =2.57142857 *5.6021367 GeV.

Compute that:

5.6021367 *2.57142857.

Let me compute 5 *2.57142857 =12.85714285.

0.6021367 *2.57142857.

0.6 *2.57142857=1.54285714.

0.0021367 *2.57142857≈0.0055.

So total is approximately 1.54285714 +0.0055=1.54835714.

So total E is 12.85714285 +1.54835714 ≈14.4055 GeV.

Hmm, that's not matching any of the options either.

Wait, but perhaps RHIC's energy is given as the total energy, including rest mass.

So I'm back to my original calculation of about 20.0076 GeV. But none of the options match exactly. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the actual mass of ^6Li is 6.0141 u, but perhaps I should include the binding energy more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach.

Wait, another approach: The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m * c², where m is the rest mass.

But perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of the proton plus neutrons, not considering the binding energy. But that would be incorrect because nuclei have their own rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rest mass as the sum of protons and neutrons minus the binding energy, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using an average value for the mass.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact calculation step again.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

Rest energy is 5.602134 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.602134=20.0076 GeV.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps the actual mass of ^6Li is 6.0141 u. Let me confirm that.

Wait, looking it up, the exact atomic mass of ^6Li is about 6.01410321294 u. So yes, that's correct.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps I should use the exact value of 1 u =931.494063 MeV/c². So perhaps I used 931.5, which is an approximation, but maybe using the more precise value would change the calculation.

Let me recalculate m_0 c² with the exact value.

m_0 c² = 6.01410321294 u * 931.494063 MeV/c²/u.

So compute 6.01410321294 ×931.494063.

Let me compute this more accurately.

First, 6 ×931.494063 =5588.964378 MeV.

0.01410321294 ×931.494063.

Compute 0.01 ×931.494063 =9.31494063.

0.00410321294 ×931.494063 = let's compute this:

0.004 ×931.494063=3.725976252.

0.00010321294 ×931.494063≈0.09603 (since 0.0001 *931.494063=0.0931494063, and 0.00000321294 ×931.494063≈0.003.

Wait, 931.494063 ×0.00010321294.

Let me compute 931.494063 ×0.0001 =0.0931494063.

931.494063 ×0.00000321294 = let's approximate as 931.494063 *3.21294e-6 ≈ approx 3.0 (exact would be 931.494063 *3.21294e-6 ≈ 3.0 (exact: 931.494063 * 3.21294e-6 = approximately 0.00300000000).

So 0.00010321294 ×931.494063 ≈0.0931494063 +0.003=0.0961494063.

So 0.00410321294 ×931.494063 ≈3.725976252 +0.0961494063 ≈3.822125658 MeV.

So total 0.01410321294 ×931.494063 ≈9.31494063 +3.822125658 ≈13.13706629 MeV.

So m_0 c² =5588.964378 MeV +13.13706629 MeV =5602.101444 MeV, which is 5.602101444 GeV.

Now compute E =3.57142857 *5.602101444.

3.57142857 ×5.602101444.

Let me compute this precisely.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.602101444.

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 ×0.002101444 ≈0.00750000 (approx).

So 2.14285714 +0.00750000=2.15035714.

So total E is 17.85714285 +2.15035714 =20.0075 GeV.

Same result as before. So about 20.0075 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is charged and thus have electrons, but that's not the approach I took earlier. Or perhaps the calculation required the use of the ion's charge, but I don't see how that would affect the rest mass.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of a single nucleon, multiplied by the number of nucleons. Wait, but that's not correct because the nucleus is a single entity. No, that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy per nucleon and then multiply by the number, but no, because the nucleus is moving as a whole.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the Lorentz factor in terms of beta and gamma, but no, the approach was correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

So my calculated value is approximately 20.0076 GeV, which is closest to option C at 20.132 GeV. But there's a discrepancy of about 0.124 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me double-check that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more precisely.

Wait, 0.28 squared is exactly 0.0784, so the square root is exactly 0.28.

So no error there.

Hmm, this is puzzling. Maybe I should consider that the nucleus is Li-6, which has a charge of +3e. So perhaps the mass includes the electrons, but no, the nucleus doesn't include electrons.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the rest mass as 6.0141 GeV/c². No, wait, no, because 1 u is about 931.5 MeV, so 6 u is 5.589 GeV, which is close to our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value using more precise gamma.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator for gamma.

Wait, beta is 0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²).

Compute 1 - beta² = 1 - 0.96^2 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

No error here.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the exact value for the rest mass, but perhaps the problem expects me to use a different value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the nucleus as a collection of protons and neutrons, each with their own rest mass, but that's not the correct approach. Because the nucleus as a whole has its own rest mass, which is less than the sum of individual nucleons due to binding energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy expression in terms of the rest mass of a single nucleon, but that doesn't make sense because the nucleus is moving as a whole.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass energy.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass of ^6Li is actually 6.0141 u, and the calculation of m_0 c² is 6.0141 * 931.5 MeV.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation is better done with more precise numbers.

Let me compute 6.0141 * 931.5.

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.0141 *931.5 = let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.0041 *931.5=3.81915.

So 9.315 +3.81915=13.13415 MeV.

So 5589 +13.13415=5602.13415 MeV=5.602134 GeV.

So same as before.

Hmm. So I'm confident that the calculation is correct, leading to about 20.0076 GeV. But none of the options match that exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the calculation using exact values.

E = gamma * m_0 c².

gamma = 25/7.

m_0 c² =6.0141 u *931.5 MeV/u.

=6.0141 *931.5 MeV.

=5602.13415 MeV.

So E = (25/7) *5602.13415 MeV.

25/7 =3.57142857.

Compute 3.57142857 *5602.13415.

Breaking it down:

3 *5602.13415 =16,806.40245.

0.57142857 *5602.13415.

Compute 0.5 *5602.13415=2,801.067075.

0.07142857 *5602.13415.

Compute 0.07 *5602.13415=392.1493905.

0.00142857 *5602.13415≈8.00 MeV.

So 392.1493905 +8.00=400.1493905.

So total for 0.57142857 *5602.13415 is 2,801.067075 +400.1493905≈3,201.216466 MeV.

So total E =16,806.40245 +3,201.216466 ≈20,007.61892 MeV, which is 20.00761892 GeV.

So approximately 20.0076 GeV.

Again, the same result. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but the closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should check if the problem is considering the energy per nucleon or something else.

Wait, the nucleus in question is ^6Li, which has 6 nucleons. So if the energy is per nucleon, then the total would be 6 times the energy per nucleon. But that's not likely because the question is about the energy of the nucleus, not per nucleon.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma again.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for c or for the speed. But v is given as 0.96c, which is correct.

Hmm. Maybe the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. So let's compute that.

Kinetic energy K.E. = (gamma -1) * m_0 c².

So gamma is 3.57142857.

gamma-1=2.57142857.

So K.E. =2.57142857 *5.602134 GeV.

Compute 2.57142857 *5.602134.

2 *5.602134=11.204268.

0.57142857 *5.602134.

As before, this is approx 3.2012 GeV.

So total K.E. =11.204268 +3.2012=14.405468 GeV.

But that doesn't match any options either.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the use of the approximation gamma ≈ 3.5, leading to 3.5 *5.602=19.607 GeV. But that's not matching any options either.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic work-energy theorem, which states that the kinetic energy is the integral of force over distance, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use beta = v/c =0.96 and compute gamma as (1 - beta^2)^(-1/2).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma using a calculator.

beta =0.96.

beta²=0.9216.

1 - beta²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think my calculation is correct, but the options don't include the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one is closest.

My computed value is 20.0076 GeV.

Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.124 GeV higher.

Option D is 21.419 GeV, which is higher.

Option B is 23 GeV, higher.

Option A is 18.475 GeV, lower.

So the closest is option C.

But wait, perhaps I should check if the rest mass is correctly 6.0141 u.

Wait, perhaps ^6Li has a different mass. Let me think: ^6Li is 6.0141 u, yes.

Wait, perhaps in the problem, the nucleus is a different isotope. Wait, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons, so ^6Li. So that's correct.

Hmm. Perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of a proton and neutron multiplied by the number.

But that wouldn't make sense because the nucleus has a different rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon and then multiplied by 6.

But that's not the usual approach. The total energy would be gamma times the rest mass of the nucleus.

So I'm confident in my approach, but perhaps the answer isn't among the options. However, given the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass energy. Let me compute 6.0141 u *931.5 MeV/u again.

6.0141 *931.5 = ?

6 *931.5=5589.

0.0141 *931.5=13.13415.

So 5589 +13.13415=5602.13415 MeV=5.602134 GeV.

Yes, correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but given the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma as 3.5714286, and multiply by 5.602134 GeV.

So 3.5714286 *5.602134.

Let me compute 3.5714286 *5.602134.

Using a calculator approach:

3.5714286 ×5.602134.

Let me compute it as 3.5714286 ×5 =17.857143.

3.5714286 ×0.602134.

0.6 ×3.5714286=2.14285716.

0.002134 ×3.5714286≈0.007623.

So 2.14285716 +0.007623=2.15048016.

So total E=17.857143 +2.15048016=20.00762316 GeV.

So around 20.0076 GeV.

Hmm, no, that's the same as before.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but given the options, I have to choose the closest, which is option C:20.132 GeV.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma with more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma without approximating sqrt(0.0784) as 0.28.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.0784) with more precision.

0.0784 =784×10^-4.

sqrt(784)=28.

sqrt(10^-4)=0.01.

So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

Hence gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the exact value of the speed of light and relativistic equations, but that's unlikely to change the outcome.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using 6.0141 u multiplied by 931.494 MeV/u, which would give a slightly different result.

Wait, 6.0141 u *931.494 MeV/u =?

6.0141 ×931.494.

Let me compute 6 ×931.494=5588.964.

0.0141 ×931.494=13.138 MeV.

Total is 5588.964 +13.138=5602.102 MeV=5.602102 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 ×5.602102.

3.57142857 ×5.602102.

Compute 3 ×5.602102=16.806306.

0.57142857 ×5.602102.

0.5 ×5.602102=2.801051.

0.07142857 ×5.602102≈0.400136.

So 2.801051 +0.400136=3.201187.

Total E=16.806306 +3.201187=20.007493 GeV.

Same result.

So, I'm confident that the correct answer is approximately 20.0075 GeV, which is not among the options. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the kinetic energy, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different velocity, but the question states 0.96c.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the error is due to the approximation in the value of 1 u.

Wait, 1 u is exactly 931.494063 MeV/c².

So perhaps using that precise value would change the calculation.

So, m_0 c² =6.01410321294 u *931.494063 MeV/c² per u.

So 6.01410321294 ×931.494063 MeV = ?

Let me compute this precisely.

6 ×931.494063=5588.964378 MeV.

0.01410321294 ×931.494063 MeV.

Compute 0.01 ×931.494063=9.31494063 MeV.

0.00410321294 ×931.494063.

0.004 ×931.494063=3.725976252 MeV.

0.00010321294 ×931.494063≈0.0961494063 MeV.

So 3.725976252 +0.0961494063=3.822125658 MeV.

So 0.01410321294 ×931.494063≈9.31494063 +3.822125658=13.13706629 MeV.

Total m_0 c²=5588.964378 +13.13706629=5602.101444 MeV=5.602101444 GeV.

E=3.57142857 ×5.602101444.

3.57142857 ×5=17.85714285 GeV.

3.57142857 ×0.602101444.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×0.6=2.142857142 GeV.

3.57142857 ×0.002101444≈0.007500 GeV.

So 2.142857142 +0.0075=2.150357142 GeV.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.150357142=20.0075 GeV.

Same result.

Hmm. Given that, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but since option C is the closest, I'll have to choose that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the options might have a typo, and the intended answer is approximately 20 GeV.

But among the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is the closest.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem expects the use of the exact gamma value without rounding, leading to a slightly different result.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more decimal places.

gamma=3.5714285714285714...

m_0 c²=5.602101444 GeV.

E=3.5714285714285714 ×5.602101444.

Using a calculator, 3.5714285714285714 ×5.602101444 =20.00750195 GeV.

So approximately 20.0075 GeV.

Given that, none of the options are exactly correct. But perhaps the intended answer is option C:20.132 GeV.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic momentum instead of energy, but that's unrelated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of the proton and neutron, not the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rest mass of a single proton and neutron and then multiply by 6, but that's not correct.

Wait, each proton has a rest mass of about 938.3 MeV, and each neutron about 939.6 MeV.

So for ^6Li, it's 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Total rest mass would be 3*(938.3 +939.6) =3*(1877.9) =5633.7 MeV=5.6337 GeV.

But that's the sum of the individual masses, not the actual rest mass of the nucleus, which is lower due to binding energy.

So the actual nuclear rest mass is about 5.6021 GeV, which is lower than the sum.

But if the problem mistakenly uses the sum, then:

E=gamma *5.6337 GeV=3.57142857 ×5.6337 ≈20.132 GeV.

Which matches option C.

Ah, so perhaps the problem intended to use the sum of the individual masses, not the actual nuclear mass.

In that case, the correct answer would be option C:20.132 GeV.

That makes sense. So perhaps the problem made an error in considering the rest mass as the sum of the nucleon masses, leading to option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy equations. The total relativistic energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The velocity of the nucleus is \( v = 0.96c \). Thus:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \)
The nucleus is Li-6 (\(^6\text{Li}\)), which has a rest mass of approximately \( 6.0141 \, \text{u} \) (atomic mass units). Using the conversion \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the rest mass energy is:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.0141 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV/u} = 5602.13415 \, \text{MeV} = 5.602134 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Substituting \( \gamma \) and \( m_0 c^2 \) into the relativistic energy equation:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.602134 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:
\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857 \, \text{GeV}, \quad 3.5714 \times 0.602134 \approx 2.150 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
E \approx 17.857 + 2.150 = 20.007 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.007 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:
- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

### Step 5: Consider potential discrepancies
The calculated value of \( 20.007 \, \text{GeV} \) does not match any option exactly. However, the closest option is **C) 20.132 GeV**. A possible explanation is that the problem assumes the rest mass energy as the sum of individual nucleon masses (protons and neutrons) rather than the actual nuclear rest mass, which would yield a slightly higher energy.

### Final Answer
Given the options and the analysis, the best choice is:

**Answer: C**
