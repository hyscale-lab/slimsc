Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question gives me a Lagrangian for the interaction between the bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). 

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on Lagrangians, but I think this term is the interaction term. So, the X boson couples to fermions because it's part of this term. The psi_f represents fermion fields, and lambda_f is the coupling constant for each fermion species.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, X can decay into different fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Because in the Lagrangian, X is interacting with the fermions, so it can annihilate and create these pairs.

But wait, the decay must conserve energy. So, the mass of X has to be at least twice the mass of the fermions it's decaying into. Because each fermion has some mass, and for pair production, you need at least 2m_f energy.

So, I need to figure out which fermions have masses such that 2m_f is less than or equal to 6 GeV. The boson's mass is 6 GeV, so any fermion with mass m where 2m ≤6 GeV is allowed.

Let me list the known fermion masses. The fermions in the Standard Model are quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top), leptons (electron, muon, tau, and their neutrinos). But neutrinos are very light, almost massless, so their contribution would be negligible. So, let's consider the charged leptons and quarks.

Quark masses (approximate, in MeV):
- Up: ~2 MeV
- Down: ~4-5 MeV
- Strange: ~100 MeV
- Charm: ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom: ~4.5 GeV
- Top: ~173 GeV

Lepton masses:
- Electron: ~0.5 MeV
- Muon: ~105.7 MeV
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV

So, let's compute 2m for each:

Electron: 2 * 0.5 MeV = 1 MeV << 6 GeV → allowed.
Muon: 2*105.7 MeV = 211.4 MeV <<6 GeV → allowed.
Tau: 2*1.78 GeV = 3.56 GeV ≤6 GeV → allowed.

Now the quarks:

Up: 2*2 MeV =4 MeV → allowed.
Down: 2*4 MeV=8 MeV → allowed.
Strange: 2*100 MeV =200 MeV → allowed.
Charm: 2*1.5 GeV =3 GeV ≤6 GeV → allowed.
Bottom: 2*4.5 GeV=9 GeV >6 GeV → not allowed.
Top: way too heavy, 346 GeV >6 GeV → not allowed.

So, the fermions that can be produced are: electron, muon, tau (leptons) and up, down, strange, charm (quarks). 

Wait, but the question asks about the allowed decays. So, the X boson can decay into any of these pairs. But looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: X→ b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but wait, bottom quark has 4.5 GeV mass. 2m =9 GeV>6 GeV. So X can't decay into b and anti-b.
