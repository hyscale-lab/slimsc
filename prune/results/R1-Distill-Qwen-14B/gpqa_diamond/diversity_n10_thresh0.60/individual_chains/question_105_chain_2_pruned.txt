Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. The question is about comparing the brightness variation caused by a planet transiting a star to the variation caused by star spots.

Alright, the setup is that there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because the star is rotating, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness changes. But the interesting point is that this setup can look similar to a planet transiting the star, so the question is asking what the radius of a planet would need to be to produce the same brightness change.

Wait, no, not exactly. The question specifically says, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve. So, the amplitude here is the change in brightness when either the spots are blocking part of the star or the planet is blocking part.

I remember that the change in brightness (the dip) when a planet transits a star is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. The formula I think is (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius. So if a planet causes a certain dip, that's the formula.

But wait, the star spots are a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the side we can see, they make the total brightness of the star decrease. But when the star rotates and the spots are on the opposite side, the brightness goes back up. So the variation is the difference between when the spots are facing us and when they're not.

Wait, the problem says the star's hemisphere is covered with spots. Oh, so when the spot hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots, and when it's the other hemisphere, we don't. So the star's brightness will dip when the spotted side is facing us.

So let's think about the flux from the star. The star's normal flux is based on its effective temperature. The spots are cooler, so each spot emits less flux. The filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the hemisphere is spots. Wait, but a hemisphere is half the star's surface, right?
