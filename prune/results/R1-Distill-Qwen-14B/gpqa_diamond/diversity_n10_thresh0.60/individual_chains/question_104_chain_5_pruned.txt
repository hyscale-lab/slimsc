Okay, so I've got this question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods compare between the two planets. Let me see what I remember about the radial velocity method.

Alright, the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves back and forth due to the planet's orbit, and this causes a shift in the wavelength of the spectral lines. The shift is periodic, right? So, the question gives me the shifts for two planets and asks about their orbital periods.

Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have masses similar to Neptune. So, same star masses, same planet masses. The shift in spectral lines are different: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2.

Wait, but how does the shift relate to the planet's orbital period? I think the Doppler shift depends on the speed of the star's movement. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K = (v) which relates to the mass of the planet and the star.

The formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (1-e²)^(1/2) )) )^(1/3) * ( (sin i) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star) ) ) ), but since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so it simplifies. Also, e is zero because the orbits are circular, so we can ignore that. And sin i is 1 if the orbits are edge-on, but since both planets are detected, their inclination must be such that sin i is the same, I guess.

Wait, actually, the Doppler shift (the semi-amplitude K) is given by K = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^2 ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star) ) ) ) * ( (1)/( (2π G) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 year in seconds) ) ) ) ) Wait, maybe I should think about the formula for K in terms of the orbital period.

Alternatively, I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i)/(M_star) ) * ( (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(
