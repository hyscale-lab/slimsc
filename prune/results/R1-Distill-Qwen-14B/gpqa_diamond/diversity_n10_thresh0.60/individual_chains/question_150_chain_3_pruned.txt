Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, wait, let me count the degrees of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, and O is 1. So, (2*8 + 2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18 -10)/2 = 4. So four degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds equivalent) and maybe a double bond or ring somewhere else, or an aldehyde group which adds another degree.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a strong peak, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm, so that fits. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons.

Then, 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. Could be aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted because of the doublet. Wait, if it's a doublet, maybe it's adjacent to another substituent? Or perhaps it's part of a coupling with another aromatic ring. Alternatively, perhaps they're part of a conjugated system.

6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Another aromatic set. The doublet again suggests coupling with two others perhaps. Wait, maybe these are para-substituted on another ring, but I'm not sure yet.

6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad could mean it's either an aromatic ring with some exchange, or maybe it's a conjugated diene or something else, like an enol. Hmm, but wait, 2H as a broad singlet. Maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to something? Or perhaps it's a dienol, but I'm not certain.

3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's a quartet? No, it's a doublet, so two neighboring Hs. Maybe a CH2 group next to something else. Wait, the chemical shift is around
