Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance based on their parallax. Hmm, parallax, right. I remember that parallax is related to distance. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, wait, no, I think it's the opposite. Because parallax is the apparent shift in position due to our orbit around the Sun. So the closer a star is, the bigger the parallax angle. Because when you're closer, the angle you can see when moving is larger. So parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance, something like that.

The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Wait, wait. So number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Or maybe N is proportional to 1 over plx to the fifth power. So N ∝ 1/plx^5.

But since plx is inversely proportional to distance, plx = k/d, where k is some constant. So if I substitute that into the equation, I can express N in terms of distance.

Let me think: plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So N ∝ (plx)^(-5) = (1/d)^(-5) ) → d^5. Because (1/d)^-5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So per unit range of distance r, which I guess is a small change in r?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential. Because the question is about the change in the number of stars per unit distance. So perhaps I need to find dN/dr, the derivative of N with respect to r.

If N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5 r^4. But wait, the options don't have 5 as a coefficient. They just have the exponents. So the change in number per unit distance is proportional to r^4. Hmm, looking at the options:

Option C is r^4. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me go through it again.

Given N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d. So N ∝ (d)^5. So N is
