Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me read it again.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so I need to find out what A and B are from the options given. The options are A, B, C, D where each gives A and B as different reagents.

Okay, starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, what typically happens? Oh right, ketones reacting with cyanide usually undergo nucleophilic addition. So NaCN would provide the cyanide ion as a nucleophile. But wait, isn't cyanide a strong nucleophile? So in ketones like butan-2-one, the alpha position is where the addition would happen. But wait, in this product, I see a nitrile group attached and a hydroxyl group. Hmm.

Wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide, the initial product would be the cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is formed by the addition of cyanide to the carbonyl group
