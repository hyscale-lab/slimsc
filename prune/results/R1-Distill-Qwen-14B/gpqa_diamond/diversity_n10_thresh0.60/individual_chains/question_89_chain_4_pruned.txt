Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. From what I remember, KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with it, it's often an elimination reaction, like the E2 mechanism. So heating dibromoadamantane with KOH probably leads to the formation of an alkene. Wait, but the product here is a light yellow solid. Oh right, maybe it's an epoxide since I remember that when vicinal dihalides (halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a base like KOH, especially in a specific condition, they can form an epoxide. Wait, no, wait. Wait, elimination would typically form an alkene, but if it's a dihalide, maybe it's elimination to form a diene? Or wait, no, another possibility is that the KOH is causing the halogen atoms to leave, and the adjacent hydroxides form an oxide bridge. Oh wait, perhaps it's an epoxide formation.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, they could eliminate to form an epoxide. So the product 1 would be adamantane-1,2-epoxide perhaps? Because 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent carbons, so when
