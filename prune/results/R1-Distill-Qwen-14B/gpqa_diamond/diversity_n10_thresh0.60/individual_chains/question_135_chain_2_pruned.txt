Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson particle. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question gives me a Lagrangian term, and I need to figure out the possible decay channels of the boson X based on that. The mass of X is 6 GeV, which is pretty heavy but not super massive.

First, I remember that in particle physics, the decay products must satisfy certain conditions. The most important is the energy and mass condition. For a particle X to decay into two particles, say a fermion and its antiparticle, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because each fermion and antifermion would need to have energy equal to their rest mass if they're produced at rest.

Looking at the Lagrangian given: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f̄ (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe that's a typo, perhaps it's more like -λ X ψ_f̄ ψ_f? Because the original expression looks a bit off. Oh, perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling term. So the interaction is between the scalar field X and fermions ψ_f.

In the Standard Model, Yukawa interactions couple a scalar (like the Higgs) to fermions, giving them mass when the scalar gets a vacuum expectation value (VEV). Here, the term looks like X coupling to fermions. So the mass term for the fermions would come from the VEV υ, but the interaction term is with X.

Wait, but the Lagrangian is written as -λ f ψ_f̄ (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I should parse this correctly. It seems that the interaction term is proportional to X(y) times ψ_f̄ ψ_f. So the interaction part is λ f X(y) ψ_f̄ ψ_f. Which would mean that the X boson can couple to the fermion ψ_f.

So for the decay X → f f̄, the X must have mass greater than or equal to 2 m_f. So I need to find all fermions where 2 m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

Let me list the masses of the known fermions. The top quark is way too heavy, around 173 GeV, so no way X can decay into top quarks. The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. So 2 m_b is about 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks either.

Hmm, wait, the question says the mass is 6 GeV. So X can decay into fermions where each is less than 3 GeV. So let's check each fermion's mass:

Electron (e-): mass ~0.0005 GeV. 2m_e is negligible, so e+ e- is allowed.

Muon (μ-): mass ~0.1 GeV. 2m_mu is 0.2 GeV, way below 6 GeV. So allowed.

Tau (τ-): mass about 1.78 GeV. 2m_tau is ~3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pairs are allowed.

Quarks: Up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top.

Up and down quarks are very light. Their masses are like a few MeV. So 2m_u and 2m_d are way under 6 GeV. So their pairs (uū, dđ) are allowed.

Strange quark: mass around 100 MeV (0.1 GeV). 2m_s is 0.2 GeV, so allowed.

Charm quark: mass about 1.5 GeV. 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So c c̄ is allowed.

Bottom quark: as mentioned before, about 4.5 GeV. 2m_b is around 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄.

What about the top quark? Mass is way higher, so no decay into t t̄.

So possible fermion pairs: e+, e-; μ+, μ-; τ+, τ-; u, ū; d, đ; s, s̄; c, c̄.

Wait, but what about other fermions like the bottom and top? We already saw they are too heavy.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ+τ-, e+e-.

But wait, since 2m_b is 9 GeV which is higher than 6 GeV, X can't
