Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The first part is a reaction involving butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO, right? And it's reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part is another reaction where the product from the first part, but with a benzyl group added (2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile), is treated with reagent B and water to give a carboxylic acid, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with HCN or its salts, like NaCN, they undergo a ketone cyanation. But wait, I think the cyanation of ketones usually involves something like NaCN and maybe an acid catalyst. Oh right, the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction is for carboxylic acids, though. Wait, no, maybe that's for introducing halides. 

Wait, for the cyanation of ketones, the reaction typically uses NaCN with an acid catalyst, like H3O+ (which is option A and B for reagent A). Because ketones can react with HCN in an acid-catalyzed addition. So for the first step, butan-2-one would add HCN. But wait, butan-2-one is (
