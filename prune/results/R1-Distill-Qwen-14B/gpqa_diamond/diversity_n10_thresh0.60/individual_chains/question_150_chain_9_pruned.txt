Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question gives a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and the compound undergoes a series of reactions. I need to figure out what the final product is from the given options.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to deduce the structure of the starting material.

The 1H NMR shows:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Let me break this down. 

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's probably an aldehyde proton (CHO). Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but in the options, some are aldehydes, some are ketones. Hmm. Or maybe it's an aromatic proton in a para-substituted ring? Wait no, wait. Wait, the triplet suggests coupling with two equivalent protons. Like maybe adjacent to two protons. Or perhaps it's an aldehyde next to a CH2 group. Hmm.

Wait, but let me think: The triplet at 9.72 ppm. Aldehyde protons are usually singlets because there's no adjacent protons. Unless it's something else. Oh wait, maybe it's a vinylic proton adjacent to an aldehyde. Like in an enal. Because in an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde, the aldehyde is at one end, and the vinylic proton would be next. So, the aldehyde proton might be a triplet if it's coupled with two equivalent protons on the adjacent carbon. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring proton, but that would be more downfield, but 9.72 is a bit high for a benzene ring, unless it's an activated ring like with electron-withdrawing groups. But wait, the options have diphenyl structures, so maybe the compound has two phenyl groups.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 -
