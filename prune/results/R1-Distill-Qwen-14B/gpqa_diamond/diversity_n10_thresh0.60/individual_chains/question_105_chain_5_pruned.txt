Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question again and understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. It says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The setup is such that when the star rotates, the spots come into view and change the brightness we observe, which mimics the effect of an exoplanet transit. But the question is asking: if the star wasn't spotted, what would be the radius of a planet that would cause the same brightness variation amplitude in the light curve?

Wait, I think I get it. So, right now, the spots are causing the brightness to dip periodically as the star rotates. But if instead, it was a planet transiting in front of the star, what size planet would give the same dip in brightness?

Wait, but the problem says that the star has spots, so the brightness variation comes from the spots, not a planet. But the question is, what planet radius would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve without the spots. So, the goal is to find Rpl/Rstar such that the planet's transit would cause the same brightness change as the spots do.

So first, I need to figure out the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, I can figure out what planet radius would cause the same dip when it transits.

Let's think about the brightness variation caused by the spots. The star's emitting light, and when a spot is facing us, it's cooler and thus emits less light. The filling factor is 20%, which I think is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. But wait, it's one hemisphere that's covered, so maybe the area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere? Or is it 20% of the entire star's surface?

Wait, the question says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So a hemisphere has (pi R^2) area, so the spots cover 0.2 * pi R^2. But wait, the entire star's surface is 4 pi R^2, so each hemisphere is 2 pi R^2. So if one hemisphere has spots covering 20% of that hemisphere, the total spot area is 0.
