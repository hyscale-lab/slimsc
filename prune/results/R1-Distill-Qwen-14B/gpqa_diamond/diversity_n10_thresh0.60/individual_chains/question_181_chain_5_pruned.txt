Okay, so I have this physics problem about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I need to figure out the ratio of flux in two energy bands after the pp-III branch stops. Let me think through this step by step.

Wait, the pp-III branch is one of the proton-proton chains in the Sun's core. I remember that the pp-I branch is the main one, right? And pp-II and pp-III are alternative branches, maybe involving different isotopes. Oh right, pp-III involves boron-8, which then decays into beryllium-8 and emits a positron and a neutrino. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. No, wait, I think pp-III is when two protons combine with a boron-8 nucleus, producing two helium-4 nuclei and a bunch of positrons and neutrinos. Or wait, no, maybe I'm mixing this up. Let me get this straight.

So, in the Sun's core, the dominant process is the proton-proton chain. The main pp-I branch: two protons fuse to form deuterium, which captures another proton to become tritium, then the tritium undergoes beta decay to helium-3 and emits a neutrino. Then two helium-3 nuclei combine into helium-4, releasing two protons in the process.

The pp-II branch is another pathway where a helium-3 nucleus captures a proton, turning into boron-8, which then decays into two helium-3 nuclei. But wait, pp-III might involve boron-8 as well. Oh
