Okay, so I have this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So, the setup is there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both are Earth-like, and they've been detected using the RV method. That means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But the question is about their transit probabilities. Oh right, transit method is when the planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But the probability depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight.

The question says both planets have the same mass. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star because shorter period means it's orbiting more quickly—Kepler's third law, right? The star's mass comes into play with the period. Oh wait, Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius, even though Planet_2's is slightly evolved. Interesting.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet relative to the orbital distance. Oh, and the angle—it's a geometric probability. The formula I think is P = (R_star / a) * (something?), but wait, maybe it's more precise. The transit probability is approximately (Rstar / a) * (some factor), but I think it's actually the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, more precisely the semi-major axis. But wait, no, the planet's size is much smaller, so the main factor is (R_star / a) * (something else?).

Wait, the transit probability is actually given by the formula P = (R*/a) * (something else). Let me recall. I think the probability is (R*/a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since both orbits are circular, e is zero, so the probability simplifies to (R*/a). Because the eccentricity doesn't affect it in the case of a circular orbit.

Wait, no, wait. The formula for the transit probability for a circular orbit is R*/(a * (1 + (R_p/a)^2)^0.5 ), but maybe I'm mixing things up. Wait, no, I think the transit probability is simply (R*/a) multiplied
