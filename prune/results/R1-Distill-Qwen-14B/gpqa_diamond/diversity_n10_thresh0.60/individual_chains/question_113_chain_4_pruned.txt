Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me break down each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in the IR usually indicate O-H stretching. A broad peak suggests that the O-H isn't in a very strong hydrogen bond environment, so maybe it's an alcohol or a ketone? Wait, no, ketones don't have O-H. Oh right, alcohols have O-H stretches that are broad. So this compound probably has an -OH group.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. Wait, another thought: maybe the 1650 is an aromatic C=C stretch? But wait, the question says the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are protons on a double bond. So the molecule has a double bond, maybe an alkene.

So putting that together, the molecule has an -OH group (from the broad peak) and a carbonyl group. Could it be a ketone? But then the O-H might come from something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a carboxylic acid? Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad and strong, maybe even a peak around 2500-3300. But the given peak is at 3000, which is a bit lower. Also, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700, but maybe that's the same as the ester.

Wait, but in the IR, two strong absorption peaks: 1700 and 1650. So two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one carbonyl and another functional group. Alternatively, perhaps one is a carbonyl (like ester or ketone) and the other is an aromatic ring (like conjugated C=C). For example, if the compound is an aromatic ester, maybe.

Moving on to the 1H NMR: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So that means there are protons attached to a double bond. So the molecule has a C=C structure. So possible functional groups: maybe an ester with a double bond, or a ketone with a double bond, or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, 45 is a familiar mass. Let me think: common fragments. Well, 45 could be a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3COOH (32 for CH3CO and 13 for O? Wait, no. Let me compute: 12*2 (C) + 4 (H2O) + 16 (O) = 2*12=24, 2 H's (since H2O is 18). Wait, no. Another approach: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, which is 45 (12*2
