Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer? The options are given.

Wait, I remember that in physics, the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium with refractive index n is v = c/n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. But wait, the glass is moving, so does that affect the observed speed? Oh, right, this might involve some relativity concepts, but wait, since the speed of light is a constant in any inertial frame according to Einstein's theory, maybe that's the key here.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1. So in the glass, the speed would normally be 1/n, right? Because v = c/n. But since the glass is moving, does that change the speed as observed in the lab frame?

Hmm, I think when the medium itself is moving, the speed of light in that medium (as observed in the lab frame) isn't simply v_medium + v_light_in_medium. Because light's speed in a vacuum is always c, but when in a medium, it's 1/n. But wait, in this case, the medium is moving. So does the observer
