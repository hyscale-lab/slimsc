--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, all on the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and velocity. Oh right! The formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime, but I think it's adjusted for relativistic speeds because particles like mesons are moving pretty fast.

So the first thing I need is the mean lifetime, which is the inverse of the decay rate. The decay rate Γ is given, so the lifetime τ would be h-bar divided by Γ. But wait, what's h-bar? Planck's constant over 2π, right? So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, units are important here. Let's make sure I convert everything correctly. Γ is given in MeV, which is an energy unit. Hmm, to get the units right for time, I think I need to use natural units or convert MeV to J.

Wait, natural units. Because in particle physics, they often use units where ħ = 1 GeV·s approximately, but I'm not exactly sure. Let me think. Oh right, ħc is about 197.33 MeV·fm, but maybe that's for other calculations. Alternatively, I can use the conversion factors to get the time.

Wait, perhaps using the relation between energy and time. From the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But I think that's for natural units. Alternatively, the proper formula for the mean lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ.

So in natural units (where c=1 and ħ=197.33 MeV·fm, wait no, ħ is actually about 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me clarify units.

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But when working in GeV units, it's often convenient to express ħ in GeV·seconds. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J. So 1 J = 1/(1.602e-10) GeV. So ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. To convert to GeV·s, we multiply by 1.602e10:

ħ (GeV·s) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 * (1.602e10) ≈ 1.69e-24 GeV·s.

Wait, wait, maybe it's easier to use the natural unit conversion. Natural units set ħ = c = 1, but when we're not in natural units, we have to be careful. Alternatively, I can use the formula for the mean proper lifetime: τ = ħ/(Γ), where Γ is in energy units.

So Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / (0.32 GeV).

But then, ħ is about 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, is that right? Let me check.

Yes, I think ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·seconds. So, τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s.

Calculating that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is 20.568e-25 s? Wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

So the lifetime τ is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. But wait, that's the proper lifetime, right? Because in meson decay, the lifetime is the proper time. But when the meson is moving, we need to consider its velocity to get the mean decay distance.

The mean decay distance is L = v * τ, where v is the velocity of the particle. Wait, but v is a fraction of the speed of light, so perhaps I should write it as βcτ, where β = v/c.

So I need to find β, the velocity of the meson. How to find β given its energy and mass?

Hmm, the meson is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV, mass m_X=1.2 GeV. So I can find the velocity from the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

The total energy E is gamma * m c^2. The momentum p is gamma m v.

Alternatively, using E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. Let me write this down.

E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, (p c) = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2). So p = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4) ) / c.

Wait, but since we're working in natural units where c=1, perhaps I can simplify. But I'm not too sure, better to proceed carefully.

Wait, let's compute p in units where c=1. So E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², but when c=1, m is in GeV.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute beta as (p c)/E. Because beta = v/c = (pc)/(E), since p = gamma m v, and E = gamma m c^2.

So beta = (p c) / E.

So I can compute (p c) as sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ). But wait, in units where c=1, that simplifies to sqrt(E² - m²).

Wait, but E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So (E^2 - m^2 c^4) = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 (c^4). But in natural units where c=1, this is 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2.

So (p c) = sqrt(62.56) GeV = approximately 7.91 GeV. Then, beta = (7.91 GeV) / 8 GeV ≈ 0.98875.

So beta is about 0.98875, which is a velocity of approximately 0.98875c.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I did the math correctly. 8 squared is 64, 1.2 squared is 1.44, so 64-1.44 is 62.56. Square root of 62.56 is sqrt(62.56) = let's see, 7.91 because 7.91^2 is approx 62.56.

So p c is 7.91 GeV, E is 8 GeV, so beta = pc/E = 7.91 /8 = 0.98875.

So beta ≈ 0.98875, which is 0.98875 times c.

So velocity v is 0.98875c.

Now, the mean decay distance is L = v * τ. But wait, τ is the proper lifetime. However, when the particle is moving, the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. Oh right! Because the lifetime we calculated is the proper time, which is the lifetime in the rest frame. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma times τ.

Wait, but wait a second. The decay length is L = v * t_lab, where t_lab is the lifetime in the lab frame. And t_lab is gamma * tau.

Alternatively, since gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), which is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.98875)^2).

Calculating beta squared: (0.98875)^2 ≈ 0.97765. So 1 - 0.97765 = 0.02235.

So sqrt(0.02235) ≈ 0.1495. So gamma is 1/0.1495 ≈6.69.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

0.98875^2 = (0.98875)(0.98875). Let me compute 0.98875 * 0.98875.

Approximate:

= (0.98 + 0.00875)^2 ≈ 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.00875 + 0.00875^2.

0.98^2 is 0.9604.

2 * 0.98 *0.00875 = 2 * 0.008575 = 0.01715.

0.00875^2 ≈ 0.00007656.

Adding them: 0.9604 + 0.01715 = 0.97755, plus 0.00007656 is 0.97762656.

So 1 - beta^2 = 1 - 0.97762656 ≈ 0.02237344.

Square root of 0.02237344. Let me find sqrt(0.02237344).

Well, 0.149^2 = 0.022201, 0.1495^2 = (0.149 +0.0005)^2 = 0.149^2 + 2*0.149 *0.0005 + (0.0005)^2 = 0.022201 + 0.000149 + 0.00000025 = approx 0.022350. Which is about 0.02235. But our value is 0.02237344. So the square root is approximately 0.14955.

So gamma is 1/0.14955 ≈6.69.

So t_lab = gamma * tau = 6.69 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.378e-23 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me double-check. So tau is the proper time, so in the rest frame, the lifetime is tau. When the particle is moving, the lab frame observes a longer lifetime, which is gamma*tau.

So L = v * t_lab = v * gamma * tau.

Alternatively, since v = beta c, then L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, but beta is v/c, so v = beta c. So L = (beta c) * (gamma tau).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1-beta²), and beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)}.

Wait, maybe it's easier to express beta in terms of gamma. Let me think again.

Alternatively, since gamma = E/(m c^2), because E = gamma m c^2. Wait, E is given as 8 GeV, m c^2 is 1.2 GeV.

So gamma = E/(m c^2) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So gamma is approximately 6.6667, which is 20/3.

Oh, that's a simpler way. Because E = gamma m c^2. So gamma is E/(m c^2) when E is given in energy terms and m is mass.

So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

So that's a quicker way to get gamma, which is about 6.6667.

So going back, the proper lifetime is tau = ħ / Gamma.

Earlier, I calculated tau as approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, because Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So tau = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 ≈ (6.666666...) * 2.056875e-24.

Let me compute that: 2.056875e-24 * 6.6666667.

2.056875 * 6.6666667 ≈ 13.7125. So 1.37125e-23 seconds.

So t_lab ≈1.37125e-23 seconds.

Now, the velocity is v = beta c. Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Gamma is 6.6667, so 1/gamma^2 = (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, yeah, we got that earlier.

So v ≈0.9887 c.

So the distance L is v * t_lab = 0.9887 c * 1.37125e-23 s.

Let me compute that.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So 0.9887 * 3e8 = approx 2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply by t_lab: 2.9661e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Let me compute that:

2.9661e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (2.9661 * 1.37125) * 1e-15.

2.9661 *1.37125. Let me compute:

2.9661 *1 ≈2.9661

2.9661 *0.37125 ≈2.9661 *0.3 = 0.88983; 2.9661 *0.07125≈0.2109. Summing 0.88983 +0.2109 ≈ 1.1007.

Total approx 2.9661 + 1.1007 ≈4.0668.

So 4.0668e-15 meters.

So that's approximately 4.0668e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option D is 4.0655e-16 m. So the correct one is B.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations to see if it's closer to 4.066 or maybe a bit different.

Wait, let me compute beta more accurately. Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6666667.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(6.6666667)^2 )).

1/(6.6666667)^2 = (3/20)^2 =9/400=0.0225.

So 1 -0.0225=0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) = let me compute that more accurately.

Using a calculator approximation: sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887056.

So beta ≈0.9887056.

So v = beta c = 0.9887056 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661168e8 m/s.

Then, t_lab = gamma * tau = (8/1.2) * (6.582e-25 / 0.32) = (20/3) * (2.056875e-24) = 1.37125e-23 s.

So L = v * t_lab = 2.9661168e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Multiply the numbers: 2.9661168 *1.37125.

2.9661168 *1 =2.9661168

2.9661168 *0.37125 = Let's compute 2.9661168 *0.3=0.88983504; 2.9661168 *0.07125=0.21091416.

Adding 0.88983504 +0.21091416= 1.1007492.

So total is 2.9661168 +1.1007492=4.066866.

So 4.066866e-15 meters. So approximately 4.0669e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655 *1e-15 m. So that's very close. The slight difference is due to more precise calculation of beta.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using more precise ħ value. Let me see.

Wait, the value of ħ is about 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, right? So when I compute tau = ħ / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 /0.32) e-25 s.

6.582 /0.32 = let me compute that more accurately.

0.32 * 20 = 6.4, 0.32 *20.5625=6.58 (since 0.32*0.5625=0.18). So 6.582 /0.32 = 20.56875.

So tau=20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, t_lab= gamma * tau = (20/3)*2.056875e-24 s = (6.6666666667) *2.056875e-24.

20/3 is exactly 6.6666666667.

6.6666666667 *2.056875e-24 = let me compute 6 *2.056875=12.34125, 0.6666666667 *2.056875= approx 1.37125. So total is 13.7125e-24 s.

Wait, 6.666666667 *2.056875e-24 = 6.666666667 *2.056875 = ?

Compute 2.056875 *6 =12.34125.

2.056875 * 0.666666667 ≈1.37125.

So total is 13.7125.

So 13.7125e-24 s.

So t_lab=1.37125e-23 s.

v= beta c=0.9887056 *3e8=2.9661168e8 m/s.

So L=2.9661168e8 m/s *1.37125e-23 s.

Multiply 2.9661168e8 by 1.37125e-23:

2.9661168e8 is 2.9661168 x 10^8.

1.37125e-23 is 1.37125 x 10^-23.

Multiply the coefficients: 2.9661168 *1.37125.

Let me compute that:

2.9661168 *1.37125.

= (2 + 0.9661168) * (1 + 0.37125)

Expanding:

2*1 + 2*0.37125 +0.9661168*1 +0.9661168*0.37125

=2 + 0.7425 + 0.9661168 + 0.358469.

Adding: 2 +0.7425 = 2.7425. 2.7425+0.9661168=3.7086168. +0.358469=4.0670858.

So 4.0670858e-15 meters.

Hmm, so approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Looking back at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. The slight difference is due to rounding in calculations.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relationship \( L = v \cdot t_{\text{lab}} \), where \( v \) is the velocity of the particle and \( t_{\text{lab}} \) is the lifetime observed in the lab frame. The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is calculated using the formula \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \), where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant and \( \Gamma \) is the decay width. The lab frame lifetime is then \( t_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau \), where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, given by \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \). The velocity \( v \) is related to \( \beta \) by \( v = \beta c \), where \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The decay width \( \Gamma \) is given as \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), the proper lifetime is:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The total energy \( E \) is \( 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and the mass \( m \) is \( 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Using \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the lab frame lifetime \( t_{\text{lab}} \)
The lab frame lifetime is:

\[
t_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is related to \( \beta \) by \( v = \beta c \), where \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \). First, calculate \( \beta \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

Thus, the velocity is:

\[
v = \beta c = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = v \cdot t_{\text{lab}} = (2.9661 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) \, \text{m}.
\]

First, multiply the coefficients:

\[
2.9661 \cdot 1.37125 \approx 4.0669.
\]

Thus:

\[
L \approx 4.0669 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 6: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 4.0669 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**

Answer: B
