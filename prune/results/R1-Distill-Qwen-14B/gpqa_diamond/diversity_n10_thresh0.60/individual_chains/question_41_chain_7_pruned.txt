Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving. Let me read it again carefully. The question says, a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer? And the options are given.

Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. Like, when light enters glass, its speed changes based on the refractive index. Oh right, in a medium with refractive index n, the speed is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Since c is given as 1 here, the speed would be 1/n.

Wait, but the glass is moving. So I think this is a case where I need to consider the relative motion between the light and the medium. Because the glass is moving, maybe I have to do some velocity addition, like in special relativity? Or is it a simpler classical mechanics approach?

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer. So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. Let me visualize this. The glass is moving forward, and the light within it is also moving forward. So from the lab frame, what's the speed of the light?

In classical mechanics, when objects move relative to each other, their velocities add up. But wait, that's for objects, not light. Because light's speed is always c in vacuum, regardless of the source's motion.
