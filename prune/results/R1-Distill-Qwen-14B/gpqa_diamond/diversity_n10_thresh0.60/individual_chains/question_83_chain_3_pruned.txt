Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. So, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate them, they react to form acetate ions and water. Right.

The setup is: We dilute 20.00 cm³ (which is 20.00 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe I can figure it out by calculating each part.

First, I think I should find the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes according to the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So, initial volume is 20 mL, initial concentration 0.05 M. After adding 20 mL water, total volume is 40 mL. So, M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Plugging numbers: (0.05 M * 20 mL) / 40 mL = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Let me double-check the dilution. The formula is correct. So the diluted concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, another approach: 20 mL of 0.05 M. Moles of acetic acid is Molarity * Volume (L) = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 mL water, the volume is 40 mL, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's right.

So, the diluted solution before titration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. So, the first part is the pH at 25% titration. So, 25% of what volume? Let's see. The total volume of the solution after dilution is 40 mL. But when titrating, you add NaOH until a certain point. Wait, maybe it's 25% of the equivalence point volume. Hmm.

Wait, no. The 25% titration indicates that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So, I should find out how much moles of NaOH are added at that point.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. So, 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. So, moles of NaOH added at 25% titration is 0.00025 mol.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So, 25% titration means 25% of the required NaOH has been added to reach that point.

Alternatively, perhaps the 25% refers to the volume of NaOH added, but I think it's more about the progress of the reaction.

So, for the 25% titration point, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So, initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. After 25% reaction, moles reacted is 0.00025 mol. So moles remaining of acetic acid is 0.00075 mol. And moles of acetate ions produced is 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the solution's volume will have increased because we added some NaOH. Let me think about that. Hmm, how much NaOH is added? Let's calculate the volume of NaOH needed to add 0.00025 mol.

Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume V is moles / Molarity = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 mL.

So, the total solution volume at 2
