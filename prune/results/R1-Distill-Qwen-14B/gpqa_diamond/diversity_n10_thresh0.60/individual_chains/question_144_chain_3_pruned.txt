Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various values in meters.

Wait, what's the mean decay distance? I remember that when a particle decays, the mean proper lifetime (or mean lifetime) is related to the decay width. Then, the mean distance it travels before decaying depends on its velocity and lifetime.

The formula for the mean decay distance (L) is L = γ * v * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, and τ is the mean proper lifetime. But I also recall that Γ is related to the decay width, which is connected to the mean lifetime.

Right, the width Γ is the total decay width, and the mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, the units here are in GeV and MeV, so I need to make sure I handle the units correctly.

First, let's write down the steps I need to take:

1. Calculate the mean proper lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Calculate the Lorentz factor γ using E_X and m_X.
3. Find the velocity v using γ and β relation.
4. Compute the mean decay distance L = γ * v * τ.

Wait, but E_X is the production energy. For a relativistic particle, the energy E is related to the mass and momentum. So E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. So I can find the momentum p, then velocity v from p and energy.

Alternatively, since E = γ m c², and since m is given, maybe I can find γ directly.

Wait, E_X is 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV. So E = γ m c² → γ = E / (m c²). But since the units are GeV and GeV, maybe the c² will cancel out in terms of energy. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let's think about units.

Wait, perhaps in natural units where c=1, E (in GeV) equals γ m (in GeV/c²
