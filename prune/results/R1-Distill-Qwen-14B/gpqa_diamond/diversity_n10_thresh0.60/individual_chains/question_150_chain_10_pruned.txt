Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The molecular formula given is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let's think about the possible structures. The NMR data is provided, so maybe I can use that to determine the structure before reaction.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the molecule.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): Two protons, doublet. Could be part of a benzene ring. Maybe para-substituted aromatic protons.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, maybe adjacent to something. Also aromatic, perhaps another para-substituted ring or maybe part of a conjugated system.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests exchange or maybe OH groups, but in this case, it's 2H. Could it be vinyl protons? Or perhaps adjacent to an oxygen, like in a conjugated dienol? Or maybe an enol tautomer?

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet. 2H, maybe CH2 groups adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen. Like OCH2 or something.

Putting this together. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees: likely one ring (benzene) which is 4 DoU, and a double bond or another ring. Benzene plus a double bond would give 5.

So the structure probably has a benzene ring and another double bond. The aldehyde proton suggests a carbonyl group. So maybe the compound has a benzaldehyde group attached to another aromatic ring or a chain.

Looking at the NMR again: the 6.98 and 6.51 doublets could be two para-substituted benzene rings. The 6.27 is a singlet, maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, the 3.66 ppm is a d (doublet) of 2H, perhaps an OCH2CH2 group? Or maybe an OCH2-CH2- something else.

Wait, another thought. The 9.72 ppm is a triplet. For an aldehyde proton, the triplet suggests coupling with two equivalent protons. So maybe the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group. Like RCH2CHO. So the H on the CH2 would couple with the aldehyde proton, giving a triplet. So in the NMR, the aldehyde H would be a triplet if it's next to a CH2.
