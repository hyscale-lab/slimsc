Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. I need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. The options are A to D, each with a different power of r.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on parallax and distance relationships. Let me recall. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

The problem states the number of stars, N, varies with 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to d, then plx = 1/d. Substituting that into the equation, N is proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that: (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1 divided by that is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a shell at distance d, with thickness dr, would be proportional to the surface area multiplied by the volume element or something? Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars as a function of distance. The problem says the
