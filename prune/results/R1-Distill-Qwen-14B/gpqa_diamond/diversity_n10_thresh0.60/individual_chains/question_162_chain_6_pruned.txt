Okay, so today's problem is about finding the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) * (dx² + dy²). Hmm, wait, that looks a bit odd. I remember that the metric usually has terms in dx², dy², and maybe cross terms like dxdy. But here, it's scaled by this factor. So it's a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx² and dy².

I think the first step is to figure out what kind of surface this metric represents. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². That makes me think of the equation x² + y² = 4, which is a circle of radius 2. So as x² + y² approaches 4 from below, the denominator gets small, and the metric's coefficient blows up. That suggests some kind of singularity at r=2. But wait, the question says it's a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudosphere... oh right, I remember the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Its metric is similar to the hyperbolic plane but compactified.

Wait, no, wait. Pseudosphere is a finite area surface with constant negative curvature. So maybe this metric is similar to the one for a pseudosphere. But let's think about the standard metric for a pseudosphere. I think the metric for a pseudosphere (which is a surface of revolution of a tractrix) in polar coordinates (r, θ) would have a specific form. Alternatively, maybe in terms of x and y coordinates here.

Wait, but the given metric is in terms of x and y. Let me try to write it as ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). To find the area, I need to compute the area element for this metric, which is sqrt(det(g)) dr, but since it's 2D, the area element is just the determinant of the metric tensor divided by some factors, but wait, the area element in 2D is typically sqrt(det(g)) dθ dφ or something, but here it's in terms of dx and dy. Wait, no, in flat space, the area element is dx dy, but when you have a metric, it's sqrt(det(g_ik)) dx^i dx^k. But wait, in 2
