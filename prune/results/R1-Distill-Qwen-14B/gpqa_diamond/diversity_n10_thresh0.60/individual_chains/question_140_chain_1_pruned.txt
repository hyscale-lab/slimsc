Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem describes a reaction involving Substance X and Liquid Y. When they react, they release a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Another clue is that the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of X.

Hmm, so I need to figure out what X is. Let me break it down.

First, the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule of W has equal neutrons and protons. Let me think about possible gases. Common gases include H2, O2, N2, CO2, etc.

Wait, for a molecule, the number of protons is the same as the number of electrons in a neutral molecule. If W's molecule has equal neutrons and protons, maybe it's a molecule like H2O? No, because H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and O with 8 protons, 8 neutrons. Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Let me think differently.

Wait, maybe W is a molecule where each atom contributes protons and neutrons. For example, maybe NH3? No, because then each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons? Wait no, that's not correct because each N atom would have 7 protons and a certain number of neutrons. Wait, but W's molecule as a whole has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. So total protons = total neutrons in the molecule.

Suppose W is H2O. Then H2O has 2 H (each 1p, 0n) and 1 O (8p, 8n). So total protons: 2 + 8 =10. Total neutrons: 0 +8=8. So 10 vs 8. Not equal. So that's not it.

What about CH4? No, but that's a gas but maybe not relevant here.

Wait, maybe W is a molecule like D2O? No, because D is deuterium. Or perhaps W is CO2. Let's see. CO2 has C (6p,6n) and two O (8p, 8n each). So total protons:6 + (8*2)=22. Neutrons:6 + (8*2)=22. Oh! That's 22 each. So W could be CO2, but wait, does that make sense in the reaction?

Alternatively, think about something else. Another possibility is that the gas is C2H2 (acetylene), but wait, each carbon has 6 p and 6 n, each H has 1 p and 0 n. Let's see: 2 C = 12 p, 12 n. 2 H = 2 p, 0 n. So total p:14, n:12. Not equal.

Wait, what about NH3? Let
