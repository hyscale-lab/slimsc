Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me break it down. I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Or wait, sometimes I've seen it written as plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs.

The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So if I substitute plx with 1/d, that equation becomes number of stars N = 1/( (1/d)^5 ) = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, so they're asking for the change in N with respect to r, which I think is the distance. So maybe they're asking about the derivative of N with respect to r.

Let me think about that. If N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is proportional to 5r^4. But wait, the options don't have 5r^4 as an option. The options are r^3, r^5, r^4, r^2.

Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance, plx = k / d (where k is a constant), so 1/plx is d/k. So 1/plx^5 is (d/k)^5 = d^5 / k^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

So N = C * d^5, where C is a constant. So when the distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of the distance.

But the question is, how does the number change with distance per unit range of r? Wait, maybe it's about the differentialâ€”like how much the number changes when you move a small distance dr. So dN =
