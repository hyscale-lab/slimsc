Okay, so I've got this question about the density matrix of a qubit, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what a density matrix represents. From what I remember, a density matrix describes the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ><ψ|), while mixed states are statistical ensembles.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, wait, that looks familiar. I think that's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Because |0> and |1> are orthogonal, right? So when you have a density matrix that's a classical mixture of the two basis states, each with equal probability, that should correspond to a completely mixed state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this state in the qubit space. I remember that qubits can be represented in the Bloch sphere, which is a way to visualize quantum states. The Bloch sphere is a unit sphere where each point corresponds to a quantum state. For a pure state, it's on the surface, and for mixed states, it's inside.

The Bloch vector representation is a way to describe a qubit state. Let's think about how the density matrix relates to the Bloch vector. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x, y, z). 

Wait, let me write that out. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So, the density matrix can be expanded as:

ρ = (I + (r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz )) / 2.

So, substituting the given ρ into this form. Let's compute the given ρ:

Given ρ = 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me compute each term.

|0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them:

|0><0| + |1><1| = [[1,0],[0,1]] which is the identity matrix I. So ρ is (I)/2.

Wait, because 1/2 * I is the same as (I + 0 * σx + 0 * σy + 0 * σz ) / 2. Oh! Because I is equal to (I + 0), so the Bloch vector r would be (0,0,0). 

So the Bloch vector is zero, meaning the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. That suggests it's a completely mixed state. Because, for a pure state, the Bloch vector has a length of 1, but for a maximally mixed state, it's at zero.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that should be the correct answer.

Let me double-check. The maximally mixed state has no coherence and equal probabilities for both |0> and |1>, so it's the center of the Bloch sphere. Yeah, that makes sense.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. A general qubit density matrix can be written as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices. Substituting the given \( \rho \), we find:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right) = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is zero, as there are no contributions from the Pauli matrices. A Bloch vector of \( (0, 0, 0) \) corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, which represents the completely mixed state. Since the state has equal probabilities for \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \) and no coherence, it is at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
