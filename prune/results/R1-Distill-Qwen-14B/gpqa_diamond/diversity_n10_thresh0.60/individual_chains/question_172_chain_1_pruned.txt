Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that stars emit light and their photospheres are where the light comes from. The question is about iron atoms in the photosphere and their energy levels. Oh right, it's about excitation of atoms.

So the problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, but what does "excited" mean here? Oh, right, the excitation refers to the energy state they're in. So the number of atoms in a higher energy level compared to a lower one.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, and we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I think that means we can use the Boltzmann distribution here. Because in LTE, the population of energy levels follows the Boltzmann factor.

The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states is given by (n2/n1) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So the ratio n1/n2 is 2. Wait wait, wait. Let me get this straight. Wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So for a specific energy level, maybe the population is higher. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says the energy difference is the same for both stars since it's the same energy levels. So ΔE is the same for both. So, for each star, the ratio of the excited level to the lower level is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star_1, n1_2 / n1_1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)), where n1_2 is the number in the higher level and n1_1 is the lower level. Similarly for star_2, n2_2 / n2_1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

But wait, the problem states that in star_1, the excited level is twice as much as in star_2. Or wait, I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again.

"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when
