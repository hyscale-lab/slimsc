Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let's see. The question says that two stars with the same mass are being observed, each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both stars have masses similar to our Sun, and the planets are in circular orbits.

The RV method is used here. I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravity. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbital period.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, I think the RV method relates to the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift. The formula I recall is something like K = (v * sin(i)) / (1 + m_p/M_*), but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, maybe it's the radial velocity semi-amplitude K given by a specific formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination (which we can assume is 90 degrees, edge-on, so sin(i)=1).

Alternatively, I think the formula is K = ( (2π G) / (c T) )^(1/3) * (m_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) (1 + m_p/M_* )^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps there's a simpler way. I remember that for the same star mass, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the planet's orbital period to the first power, but I'm not certain. Or was it something else?

Wait, another approach: For the same star mass, the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (m_p) / (P)^(1/3). Because the formula for K involves P in the denominator under a cube root. Let me think. The formula is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * [ (2π) / (c * P) ) ]

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the expression for K. From what I remember, the formula is:

K = (v * sin i) = ( (2π G) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / (
