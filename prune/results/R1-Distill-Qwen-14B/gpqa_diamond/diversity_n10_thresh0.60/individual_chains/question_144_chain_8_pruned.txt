Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question gives me some parameters: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I'm supposed to find the mean decay distance from these values. The options are A to D, with various numbers in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (or proper mean lifetime) is related to the particle's lifetime. The formula I vaguely recall is something like c multiplied by the lifetime τ, which is the mean lifetime. Oh, right, the mean decay length L is c * τ.

But how do I find τ? I think the relationship involves the particle's width Γ and its mass m. Oh right, the uncertainty principle comes into play here. The mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the width Γ. The formula is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, but wait—Γ is given in MeV, and the other units are in GeV. I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Let me jot down the values:

E_X = 8 GeV
m_X = 1.2 GeV
Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

But wait, the production energy is different from the mass. I'm not sure how that factors in here. Or does it? Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, the mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / (Γ), but I also need to consider the energy of the particle. Because the decay width Γ is energy-dependent, right? Or maybe in this context, Γ is already a given value, so I don't need to calculate it from other parameters. The question gives Γ, so I can just use it directly.

So let me proceed with τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, ħ is in units of GeV·s or something? I think I need to get all the constants right.

Wait, the Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Right, because ħ = h/(2π), and h is about 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s, but when converted to GeV·s, it
