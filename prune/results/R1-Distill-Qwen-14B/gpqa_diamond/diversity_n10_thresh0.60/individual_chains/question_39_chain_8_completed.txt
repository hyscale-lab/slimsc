Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, so there are these particles in a system, each moving along a tube which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, no, more precisely, the wave function ψ(x) is (a divided by the square root of (1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me parse that again. The wave function is (a/sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by something? Or is it a minus 0.5i as in the imaginary unit?

Wait, the question says: the wave function can be described as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. Hmm, but wait, that seems a bit odd because typically wave functions are complex, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, perhaps the question is written in a way where ψ has a real part and an imaginary part. Or maybe the expression is (a / sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by something that includes i, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the problem says that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x<1 and x>3. So the wave function is zero outside of x=1 to x=3. No, wait, that's not exactly right. The measurement results show that all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be non-zero only in that region. But the given wave function is ψ(x) = a / sqrt(1 +x) - 0.5i. Wait, but that seems to be defined for all x, but we have to ensure that the probability is zero outside the region x=1 to x=3.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I misunderstood the wave function. Maybe the wave function is given only in a certain domain. Let me think again. The wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, but I think perhaps that's a mistake. Because in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually a complex function, but the modulus squared is the probability density. But the way it's written here, maybe it's a product of a real function and e^{-i something}.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1 +x)) * e^{-iθ}, where θ is some phase. Maybe that's the case. But the way it's written here is a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is written as (a/(sqrt(1+x))) multiplied by a term that includes i, but that might complicate things.

Wait, but the given wave function has a real part and an imaginary part. Or perhaps it's a typo and the wave function is ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] e^{-i something}. Hmm, but the problem states it as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but in that case, the wave function has a real component and an imaginary component. That's possible, but maybe I should proceed.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by an exponential term. Because in quantum mechanics, the time-independent Schrödinger equation's solutions often involve exponential terms when dealing with infinite potential wells or similar. But the problem states that the wave function is given, so I have to work with that.

Wait, but the main issue is that the wave function must be zero outside the region x=1 to x=3 because the measurements never find any particles outside that interval. So the wave function must be zero for x <1 and x>3. But the given wave function is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, which doesn't seem to be zero outside this region. So perhaps this is part of an infinite square well scenario, and the wave function is zero outside the well.

Wait, but perhaps the wave function given applies only within the region x=1 to x=3, and is zero elsewhere. So let me model this. So the region where the wave function is non-zero is between x=1 and x=3. So for x <1 and x>3, ψ(x)=0.

But the given ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that can't be, because that expression would be non-zero for all x where sqrt(1+x) is defined, i.e., x >= -1. So that's not compatible with the measurements. So perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero otherwise. But the given expression is for the wave function within this region. So perhaps the wave function is ψ(x) = a/sqrt(1+x) for 1 <= x <=3, and zero elsewhere. Oh wait, but the expression also includes a -0.5i term. Hmmm, that complicates things.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the wave function. Let me read the question again. The question states that the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, maybe that's a typo, and it should be (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by a complex exponential, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) times e^{-i something}, but as written, it's a real part and an imaginary part, which is a bit strange.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by e^{-iθ}, where θ is a constant phase factor. That would make the wave function have a magnitude a/sqrt(1+x), and the phase might not affect the probability density, which is |ψ|².

Wait, but regardless, the key point is that the wave function must be zero outside the region x=1 to x=3. So perhaps the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) for x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. But the given expression also includes a -0.5i term, which makes me think that maybe I'm misunderstanding the wave function's form.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is written as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) * e^{-i π/4}, because 0.5i is -0.5i, which could be part of a phase factor. Oh wait, no. Let me see: e^{-iπ/4} is cos(π/4) - i sin(π/4) = sqrt(2)/2 (1 - i). Hmm, but the given ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So perhaps the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by (1 - i), but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) ) * (1 + i something). But I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the problem again.

The problem states that all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3, so the wave function must be zero outside of that interval. So the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3, and non-zero between 1 and 3. Thus, the wave function must be a solution to the Schrödinger equation that satisfies the boundary conditions of being zero at x=1 and x=3. Wait, no, because if the potential is infinite outside x=1 to x=3, then the wave function is zero outside. But in the region between 1 and 3, the wave function is non-zero and given as ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

Wait, but that seems problematic. Let me think differently. Perhaps the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) multiplied by a time-dependent exponential term, but perhaps the problem is stationary, so time isn't considered. Alternatively, perhaps the given wave function is in the form ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) ), and the -0.5i is a typo or something.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is supposed to be ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) ) multiplied by e^{-i k x}, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is real, and the -0.5i is a mistake. But that can't be, because if the wave function is real, then the probability density is ψ^2, but the given form has an imaginary component.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is written as (a/(sqrt(1+x)) ) * (1 -i), making the real and imaginary parts equal in magnitude. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is a normalized function. The question is asking for the value of 'a' such that the wave function is normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1.

So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|^2 dx equals 1. Because the wave function is zero outside this interval.

So let me proceed under that assumption. So, ψ(x) is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. Then, |ψ(x)|^2 is [a^2/(1+x)] because the other term is a real number and the imaginary part—wait, no, the wave function as given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) is a complex number with real part a/sqrt(1+x) and imaginary part -0.5. So |ψ(x)|^2 is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, that would make the normalization integral ∫ from 1 to 3 of [ (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because usually, the wave function is either purely real or has a phase factor, but not a combination like this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the wave function. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is written as ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) e^{-iθ}, where θ is a constant. In that case, the modulus squared is |a|^2/(1+x), and the integral would be ∫ [a^2/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3, set equal to 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the given wave function is only the real part, and the imaginary part is zero. But the question states that the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, which implies both real and imaginary parts.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) ) * (1 - i), where i is the imaginary unit. Then, the modulus squared would be (a^2/(1+x)) * (1 + 1) ) = (2 a^2)/(1+x). Because (1 - i) has a magnitude of sqrt(2), so |1 -i|^2 is 2. But then the integral becomes 2 a^2 ∫ [1/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3.

Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated, and I'm not sure if I'm on the right track.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach. Let me calculate the integral of |ψ(x)|^2 from 1 to 3, set it equal to 1, and solve for 'a'.

So, ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

So |ψ(x)|^2 is (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (0.5)^2 = (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but that's assuming that the real and imaginary parts are orthogonal. Wait, no, in a complex number, the modulus squared is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So yes, in this case, it would be [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a^2/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute that integral:

Integral [a²/(1+x) dx] from 1 to 3 → a² [ln(1+x)] from 1 to 3 → a² (ln(4) - ln(2)) ) = a² ln(2).

Integral [0.25 dx] from 1 to 3 is 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.5.

So the sum is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.693147.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.7213478.

So a = sqrt(0.7213478) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close to 0.849, so that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function is given as ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So in that case, the modulus squared is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, which is correct. So the calculation should proceed as above.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the wave function is written as (a/(sqrt(1+x))) multiplied by e^{-iθ}, which would make the modulus squared (a²)/(1+x), as the exponential term has modulus 1. But in our case, the wave function is given as a combination of a real and imaginary term, which may imply that each part contributes to the modulus squared.

Alternatively, perhaps the given wave function is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) ), and the -0.5i is a typo, but I can't assume that. So proceeding with the given ψ(x), the calculation leads to a≈0.849, so option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Compute ∫ from 1 to3 [a²/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx =1.

∫ [a²/(1+x) dx] = a² ln(4) - a² ln(2) ) = a² ln(2).

∫ [0.25 dx ] from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1)=0.5.

So a² ln(2) + 0.5=1 → a² ln(2)=0.5 → a²= 0.5/(ln2) ≈ 0.5/0.6931≈0.7213 → a≈sqrt(0.7213) ≈0.849. So yes, option B is 0.85, which is the closest.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given wave function and the normalization condition. The wave function is described as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

where \(i\) is the imaginary unit. The wave function is non-zero only between \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\), as particles are never found outside this region. The normalization condition requires that the integral of the probability density \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over all space equals 1:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Since \(\psi(x)\) is zero outside \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\), the integral reduces to:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

The probability density \(|\psi(x)|^2\) is computed as:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Substituting this into the normalization condition:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 (\ln(4) - \ln(2)) = a^2 \ln(2)\)
2. \(\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5\)

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest value to \(a \approx 0.849\) among the options is \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.
