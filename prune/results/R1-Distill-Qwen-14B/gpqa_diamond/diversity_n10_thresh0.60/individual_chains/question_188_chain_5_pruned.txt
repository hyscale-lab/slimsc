Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, what do I remember about rhombohedral crystals?

Rhombohedral, right? So that's a type of crystal system where all the lattice parameters are equal, but the angles between them are all the same and not necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait a second. I think in a rhombohedral system, all edges (a, b, c) are equal, and the angles are all equal but not 90 degrees. So this crystal has a = b = c, let's say a is the interatomic distance given as 10 Angstrom. 

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is d, right? I remember there's a formula involving the Miller indices (hkl) and the lattice parameters, including angles. Oh wait, the formula for d is 1/sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2hk cos α)/(a²) - (2hl cos β)/(a²) - (2kl cos γ)/(a²) ) ). Wait, but wait, because in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, alpha = beta = gamma, which is
