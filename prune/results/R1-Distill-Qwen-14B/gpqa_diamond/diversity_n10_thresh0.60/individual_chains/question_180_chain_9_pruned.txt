Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me try to understand it. So the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

I remember that electric potential energy for a system of point charges is calculated by considering each pair of charges. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

Wait, but wait, since we're dealing with multiple charges, I think the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But because it's an isolated system, I have to consider all possible pairs.

So let's break it down. There are 13 particles. The 13th is fixed at point P, so the other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th charge. But also, each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from each other? Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Oh wait, the problem
