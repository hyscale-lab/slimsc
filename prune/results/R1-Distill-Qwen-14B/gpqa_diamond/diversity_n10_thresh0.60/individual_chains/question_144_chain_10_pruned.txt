Okay, so I have this physics problem about a meson resonance and I need to find the mean decay distance. Hmm, let's see. I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and when they decay, their mean lifetime is related to their width. Oh wait, the mean lifetime τ is the inverse of the total decay width Γ. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, so the mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, I think Γ is the total width here. Right, because the width is related to the uncertainty in energy, which affects the lifetime. So first I need to compute τ, then multiply by the velocity v to get the decay length, L = v * τ.

Wait, but what's the velocity of the meson? Oh, right, because the meson is moving when it decays, so the mean decay distance depends on how fast it's moving and its lifetime. So I think the formula is L = (Γ * v) / m, but wait, no, maybe it's β times c times τ, where β is v/c.

Wait, let me think again. The mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ by τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I think I might have that backwards. Because Γ is the decay rate, which is ħ times the decay width. So Γ = ħ * width. So τ is ħ/(Γ) which would be 1/(width * ħ) multiplied by ħ^2? Wait, perhaps I should get the formula correctly.

Alternatively, another approach: the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But since ħ is in units of GeV·s or something, I need to handle the units carefully.

Then, the mean decay length is L = v * τ, where v is the velocity of the meson. So we need to find v, probably from the given energy E and mass m.

Wait, the production energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, and mass m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the energy is the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy. So E = γ m c². So γ is E / (m c²). But since E and m are given in GeV, perhaps the c² is already accounted for in the units. But I'm not entirely sure about the unit handling here.
