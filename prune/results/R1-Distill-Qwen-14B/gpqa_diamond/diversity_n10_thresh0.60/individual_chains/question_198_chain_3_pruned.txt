Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to stability constants and complex equilibria, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question asks for the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that stability constants relate to the formation of complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, β4 is 16, which is the fourth complex. But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ complex. So that would be the second complex, because dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands. Hmm, wait no, wait: wait, [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) for different n. So the first complex is [CoSCN]^+, the second is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the third is [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and the fourth is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But the question refers to the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue color is associated with the tetrahedral complexes, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, the dithiocyanato complex might be the second one, [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Because, I think that the tetrahedral complexes are often blue. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- might be blue. Or maybe it's the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 that's blue. Hmm.

Wait, the problem statement says "dithiocyanato", which is two SCN ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So that's the second complex, with β2=40.
