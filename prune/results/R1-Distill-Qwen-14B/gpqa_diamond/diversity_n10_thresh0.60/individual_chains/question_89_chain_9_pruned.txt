Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break it down.

First reaction: Heated with excess KOH to 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are given. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

Alright, let's tackle each step.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH (a strong base) sounds like an elimination reaction, probably dehydrohalogenation. But wait, since it's dibrominated, maybe it's a double elimination. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is quite rigid. So, when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, the bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Wait, no, 1,3 positions. Let me think about the structure of adamantane.

Adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon with a structure similar to four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two bridgehead carbons that are three positions apart. When KOH is heated, it's likely to eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming a diene.

Wait, but wait. Eliminating two HBr molecules from 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form a conjugated diene. So product 1 would be 1,3-diene in adamantane, perhaps. Let me think about the structure. If there are two adjacent Br atoms, elimination would form a double bond. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not adjacent, but separated by a bridge. So elimination would not form a double bond between 1 and 2, but rather between 1 and 3? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination would create two double bonds or maybe a ring contraction.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a different bridge, and elimination
