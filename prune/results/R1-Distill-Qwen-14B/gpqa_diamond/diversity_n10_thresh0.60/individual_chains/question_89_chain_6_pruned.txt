Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom, excluding those that exchange with the deuterated solvent.

Alright, let me break this down. I think I'll have to work through each step, see what reactions are happening, and figure out the structures of each product.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. KOH is a strong base, so this sounds like an elimination reaction, probably dehydrohalogenation. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, the bromines are on adjacent carbons? No, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the bromines on carbons that are diagonally opposite each other on the adamantane structure. But when KOH is used, especially in elimination, it might form an epoxide or something else. Wait, no, elimination would typically form an alkene if two adjacent bromines are present. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't adjacent, right?

Wait a minute, maybe it's a di-elimination. Adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on opposite ends. Heating with KOH—maybe it's dehydrohalogenation but in a way that forms a bridge. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dieckmann-type elimination, but that's for esters. Or maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but with two equivalents, perhaps forming an epoxide? Wait, no, epoxides are formed from vicinal dihalides, I think. So if the dihalide is not vicinal, maybe it's something else.

Wait, the product 1 has an IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak, probably an ester or ketone. But considering the reaction conditions: KOH is a base. Another possibility is that it's a condensation reaction forming a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is undergoing an intramolecular elimination to form a ketone or an ester.

Wait, if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps it's undergoing two elimination reactions, each releasing HBr, and forming a ketone. Let me think: when you have a dihalide with two adjacent X groups, elimination gives a double bond. But in this case, the dihalide isn't adjacent. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination would form a bridge with a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the KOH is acting as a base, abstracting a β-hydrogen and causing the elimination of Br- twice,
