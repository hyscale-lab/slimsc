Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. Half of this star's surface (one hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered in spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spots must be at 5000 K, right? Because 6000 minus 1000 is 5000.

The question is about photometric observations, which measure the brightness of the star over time. As the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing the brightness to vary. Because only one hemisphere has spots, when the star spins, the spots will rotate in and out of the observed hemisphere. But the way it's worded, it says that these brightness variations can closely resemble an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. So the idea is that the dip in brightness when a planet transits (blocks some light) is similar to the dip caused by the spots.

The main question is: To produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve, what should be the radius ratio (Rpl/Rstar) of a hypothetical exoplanet compared to the star's radius? So we need to calculate the exoplanet's radius such that its transit causes the same dip in brightness as the spots do.

Wait, but the problem states that if the star was not covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would give the same signal. So the star without spots would have a certain light curve, and we're comparing the scenario where spots cause a dip similar to a planet transit. Hmm, no, wait. The actual scenario has spots, but the question is asking, if the star had no spots, what size planet would cause the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do.

Wait, perhaps better to think: The brightness variation caused by the spots is being compared to the brightness variation that would be caused by a planet. So we need to model both scenarios and find the planet radius that would have the same amplitude.

Let me think about the brightness (flux) contributions. The total flux from the star is the sum of flux from the unspotted and spotted regions.

The star's total flux without any spots would be F0 = 4πRstar² * σ * Teff^4, since the star emits according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. But when part of the star is covered by spots, the flux changes.

Wait, but the star's surface is divided into two parts: the spotted and the unspotted. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20%, that means 20% of the hemisphere is covered, so 0.2 * 0.5 of the total surface area. Wait, no: the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So 20% of the hemisphere is spots. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) since a hemisphere is 2πR². So the area of spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4 π R².

But wait, the star's total surface area is 4π R², so the fraction covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1, or 10% of the entire star's surface. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Because the spots are only on the hemisphere that's facing us, but when the star rotates, the other hemisphere comes into view. Wait, no, the problem says only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, we only see the spotty hemisphere when it's in a certain position, but perhaps the spots are on the surface that's always visible as the star rotates. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

But perhaps the way to think about it is that the spots are covering 20% of the hemisphere we see. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are in view, and when it turns away, the spots are on the far side. But the problem says the star is only having one hemisphere with spots. So perhaps the spots are always on, say, the front side, and as the star rotates, that side comes into and out of view as we see it. Wait, no, if it's a tidally locked star, maybe the same side is always facing us, but I think that's not necessarily the case here.

Wait, maybe the star is rotating, and the spots are on one hemisphere, so as it spins, the spots move into and out of view, causing the brightness to dip when they are in the field of view.

But perhaps the key is to model the brightness variation due to the spots and compare it to the variation caused by a planet transit.

So, when the
