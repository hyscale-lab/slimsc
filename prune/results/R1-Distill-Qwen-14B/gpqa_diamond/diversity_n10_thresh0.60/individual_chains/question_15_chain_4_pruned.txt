Okay, so I have this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. So the probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance.

Let me start by recalling the formula for the probability of a transit. I think the probability P is roughly given by the ratio of the planet's orbital plane's area where the transit would occur, which is related to the star's size. Wait, no, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_p / a), where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the orbital semi-major axis. Or is it (R_p + R_s) / a? Wait, I might be mixing up terms. Oh right, the transit probability formula is P = (R_p + R_s) / a, but if the planet is much smaller than the star, it's approximately R_p / a.

Wait no, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, I think when the star is much larger than the planet, the transit probability is approximated as (R_s / a) * (something else). Or wait, perhaps the probability is (R_p / a) multiplied by the probability that the inclination is just right. Oh wait, maybe it's (R_p / a) * (R_s / a) or something like that.

Wait, I think the formula for the transit probability is given by P = ( (R_p) /
