Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Let me think. I remember that for crystals, interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So in this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, no, wait. Interatomic distance in a crystal is usually 'a' in the unit cell, but wait, rhombohedral might have a different structure. Oh, right, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all the same, but the angles alpha, beta, gamma are also the same. So the lattice is a rhombohedron, which is a special case where a = b = c, and angles are equal but not necessarily 90 degrees.

The formula for interplanar distance is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * cosθ ), wait wait, no, I'm getting confused. Or is there another formula for non-cubic systems? Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is given by:

1/d^2 = (h²/a²)(sin²β sin²γ + (cosβ cosγ - cosα)^2) + ... wait, no, that's probably not right. Maybe
