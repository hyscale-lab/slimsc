Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the product when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let me start by carefully analyzing the data provided.

First, looking at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but wait, that's a broad region, so maybe it's an -OH group. There's also a peak at 1720 cm-1, which I think is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, probably from a ketone or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretches. So that suggests the compound has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – that's a broad singlet, which could be an -OH proton. If the IR had a strong O-H, then this fits with a carboxylic acid's -OH. Carboxylic acids typically show a broad peak around 10-12 ppm.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) – these are likely two sets of doublets, suggesting a para-substituted aromatic ring. The downfield shift suggests electron-withdrawing groups. If the substituents are in the para positions, then the coupling would give doublets for each set of protons.

Then we have 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which might be a CH adjacent to something, like a carbonyl. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – perhaps another CH2 group, maybe part of a chain. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a triplet of three protons, which could be a CH(CH3) group or maybe a branching. 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a terminal CH3, like at the end of a chain.

Putting this together, the molecule seems to have a para-substituted benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group and possibly an ethyl chain or something similar.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm-1 could be a ketone or an ester, but if there's an O-H stretch at 3400-2500, it's more likely a carboxylic acid. Because ketones don't have O-H. So the carbonyl is probably a carboxylic acid, so the structure might be something like benzoic acid with substituents.

Looking at the NMR again, the 10.5 ppm peak is the -OH of the carboxylic acid. So the aromatic ring has a carbonyl group as a substituent. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but the IR also shows peaks at 1610 and 1450, which are typical for aromatic C=C, so that fits.

So the benzene ring is para-substituted. The
