Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The options given are A to D, all in GeV. 

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3. The standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons and usually has a certain number of neutrons. If X has 3 neutrons, that means it's Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. Alternatively, regular lithium is Li-7, but this is Li-6. Right, so the mass number A is 6 for X.

So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number of 6. Its mass is going to be important for calculating the relativistic energy.

The problem is about finding the energy of the collider. So when particles are accelerated to a certain speed, their relativistic energy is given by the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. But wait, the question might be asking for the kinetic energy or the total energy. Hmm, I need to clarify that.

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So RHIC accelerates nuclei to that speed. The energy of the collider would be the kinetic energy, because the rest mass energy is the energy when the particle
