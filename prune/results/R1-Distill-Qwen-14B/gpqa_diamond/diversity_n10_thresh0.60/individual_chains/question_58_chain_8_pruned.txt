Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? I remember that it's a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are like infinities that pop up in calculations, making the math not work unless you handle them. Regularization introduces a temporary momentum cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite, and then you remove the cutoff later, hopefully getting a finite result after renormalization.

So, which theories don't need this? Well, the key here is that some theories are "renormalizable," meaning that after you regularize, you can absorb the divergences into a finite number of parameters, like mass and charge. Others might be non-renormalizable, requiring an infinite number of counterterms, which would be a problem. But wait, regularization is a step before renormalization, right?

Wait, the question is about whether regularization is ever needed. So, if a theory is finite, it doesn't need regularization. But are any of these theories finite?

I think Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a renormalizable theory. It's the theory of electromagnetism with quantum mechanics. But it still has divergences that need to be handled. So they must use regularization techniques. But wait, because it's renormalizable, maybe the diverg
