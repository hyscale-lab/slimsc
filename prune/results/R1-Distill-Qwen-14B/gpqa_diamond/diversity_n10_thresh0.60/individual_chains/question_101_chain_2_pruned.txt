Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction between 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A to form 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to choose the correct reagent A and catalyst B from the options given.

First, I'll try to understand what's happening in the reaction. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, which is a cyclic secondary amine. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Looking at the product, it seems like a cyclohexylidene group (which is a cyclohexane ring with a double bond) is attached to the pyrrolidine ring. So, this looks like a ring expansion or some kind of addition.

Wait, the product has a substituent on the pyrrolidine. The starting molecule is pyrrolidine, which is a five-membered ring with one nitrogen. The product has an additional substituent: cyclohexylidenemethyl. Let me try to draw it mentally. The substituent is a cyclohexane ring connected via a methylene group (CH2) that's part of a double bond. So it's like a cyclohexene ring attached through a CH2 group to the pyrrolidine.

Hmm. So the reaction is forming a new ring. I'm thinking maybe it's an alkylation or some kind of addition. Since the catalyst is acid, it's probably an acid-catalyzed mechanism, like a Friedel-Crafts or some aldol-like reaction, but wait, pyrrolidine is a secondary amine, which can act as a nucleophile.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe it's an example of a ring-opening alkylation? Or perhaps it's a condensation reaction. Alternatively, could it be a Claisen or Aldol condensation?

Wait, wait. The product looks like a bicyclic compound. The pyrrolidine ring has a substituent that's a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene bridge. So, perhaps the reaction is a ring expansion via some mechanism. I remember that in the presence of acid, certain amines can undergo alkylation. But in this case, the substituent is a cyclohexylidene group, which suggests a ring
