Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that X is a meson resonance with some given parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. They're asking for the mean decay distance, and the options are provided. 

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (also called the decay length) is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ) multiplied by the velocity (βc), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think—oh right, the formula is usually written as L = γβcτ. Because the particle is moving relativistically, so you have to account for time dilation.

But first, how do I find τ, the proper lifetime? Oh yes, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. I think Γ is the total decay width, and the uncertainty principle tells us that Γ ≈ ħ/τ. Or wait, the relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, units might get tricky here.

Wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ in natural units where ħc is a certain value. Hmm, I should probably convert everything into compatible units.

Let me jot down the given data:

E_X (production energy) = 8 GeV
m_X = 1.2 GeV
Γ_X = 320 MeV

Wait, E_X is the production energy, but for a resonance, the energy is around its mass energy, right? Or does E_X being higher than m_X imply some kinetic energy? Hmm, but E_X is the energy of the produced meson. So the meson is produced with some energy, which could be higher than its rest mass. 

But for the decay length, I think what matters is the meson's velocity when it decays. So perhaps I should compute the velocity from the energy. Or maybe not—if the meson is moving, its lifetime is dilated. But to find the mean decay distance, I need its velocity and lifetime.

Wait, the meson's lifetime as measured in the lab frame would be longer than its proper lifetime because of time dilation. The proper lifetime τ is calculated from the width Γ. 

So, let's get started. First
