Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters, which are really tiny distances, so we're probably dealing with something that decays very quickly, maybe at the atomic level or smaller.

Wait, I remember that decay distance has to do with the particle's lifetime and speed. The formula I think is something like the mean decay length L = gamma * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime. Right, because the particle moves at relativistic speeds, so time dilation affects the lifetime.

But how do I find tau? Oh, right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle says that Γ is the energy uncertainty, and the lifetime is inversely proportional to Γ. The relation is Γ = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Another way I remember is that the natural linewidth is Γ, and the width is related to the lifetime via Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So tau = ħ/(Γ). But I'm not 100% sure, maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, the decay width Γ is equal to ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is in MeV, and ħ is in GeV·s. Oh wait no, let's think about units. ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So when I have Γ in GeV, tau would be in seconds.

So first, let me compute tau, the proper lifetime. Gamma is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau = ħ * (GeV·s) / (Γ in GeV). So tau = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV. Let me calculate that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, that's really short, but mesons are short-lived, so that makes sense.

Now, gamma is the Lorentz factor. How do I find gamma? Gamma is E/(m c^2), but since we're working in units where c=1, it's E/m. Here, E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667, which is 20/3.

So now, the mean lifetime as observed in the lab frame is gamma * tau. Because of time dilation, the lifetime is longer when the particle is moving. So the lifetime tau_lab = gamma * tau.

Wait, but tau is the proper lifetime (from the particle's rest frame), so in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer. So tau_lab = gamma * tau = gamma * (ħ / Γ).

Wait, but we have to compute the decay length L = v * tau_lab, where v is the velocity of the particle. Since the particle is moving at relativistic speeds, v is approximately c. So L ≈ c * tau_lab.

Putting it all together: L = c * gamma * (ħ / Γ).

Wait, let me write that as L = (c * gamma * ħ) / Γ.

Now, let's plug in the numbers. Let's make sure all the units are consistent.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

Gamma (Γ) is 0.32 GeV.

Hmm, so let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute gamma: 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.66666
