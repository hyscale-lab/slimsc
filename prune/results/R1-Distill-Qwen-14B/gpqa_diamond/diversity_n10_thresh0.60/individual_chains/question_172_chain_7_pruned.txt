Okay, so I've got this physics problem about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with excitation states, the Boltzmann distribution comes into play. Let me try to break this down.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, but the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think this has to do with the Boltzmann factor, which relates the population of different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann distribution formula is something like the ratio of populations being equal to the exponential of the energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. So if n1 and n2 are the populations of two energy levels, then n1/n2 = exp( (E1 - E2)/(k*T) ). But wait, in this case, the higher energy level is more excited, right?

Wait, but the question states that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let me think, because E is the energy difference. So for star_1, the number of excited atoms is twice that of star_2, but wait, which one is higher in temperature? Because if a star is hotter, more atoms get excited into higher energy levels.

Wait, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level.
