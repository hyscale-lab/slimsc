Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx^5). And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, with different exponents.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (plx in arcseconds). So, distance r = 1 / plx. Wait, that's right because parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

So, the given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx^5). Let me express this in terms of distance because the question is about how N changes with r. Since r is 1/plx, I can write plx as 1/r. Plugging that into the equation.

So, N ∝ 1/( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5. Because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so the reciprocal is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. That would mean as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of r.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The number of stars varies as 1/(plx^5). So when plx is small (which happens when r is large), 1/(plx^5) becomes a large number. But how does the number of stars in a region depend on the distance? Because the more distant a star is, the fainter it appears, but the density in a region at distance r, perhaps?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. The question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5". So when parallax increases, the number decreases, as 1 over plx^5.

But since parallax is inversely proportional to distance (plx = 1/r), a larger distance (r) means smaller plx. So 1/(plx^5) would be (r^5), so N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. So per unit range of r, the number increases more rapidly as r increases.
