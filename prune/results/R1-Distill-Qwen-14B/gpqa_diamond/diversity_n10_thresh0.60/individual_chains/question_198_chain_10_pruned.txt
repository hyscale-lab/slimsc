Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Wait, stability constants—right, they’re for the formation of complexes. The stability constant β tells us how much a complex will form. Higher β means more stable complex. Each β corresponds to a different complex.

So, the complexes here are Co(SCN)n^2−n, where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. So, the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]²+, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, [Co(SCN)₃]²−, [Co(SCN)₄]^4−. But wait, the question mentions "blue dithiocyanato" complexes. Oh wait, wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So that's the [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ complex, right? Because di means two.

So we need to find the percentage of Co in the [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ complex relative to all Co species.

I remember that the fraction of each complex can be found using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. The formula involves the formation of each complex step by step.

But how do I calculate the fraction for each complex? I think we model the distribution of Co between the different complexes using their stability constants and the concentrations of SCN-.

The general approach is to calculate the formation of each complex in sequence. The fraction of each complex depends on the stability constant and the concentrations of the ions involved.

Wait, each stability constant is for the formation of a complex with a specific number of ligands. So for [Co(SCN)]²+ (n=1), the formation is Co²+ + SCN⁻ → [Co(SCN)]²+ with β1=9.
