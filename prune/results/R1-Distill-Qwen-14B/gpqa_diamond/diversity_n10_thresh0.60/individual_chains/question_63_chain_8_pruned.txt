Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. The question is about what momentum a photon must have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So, when it absorbs a photon, it must go to the next state, which is the first excited state. But wait, the model here is the non-rigid rotor model, which probably combines both rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, the model is called the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, that model includes both rotational and vibrational energy levels. But the question is about the transition, so I think it's about the change in energy when a photon is absorbed.

But wait, the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which for rotation-vibration would be the state where both rotational and vibrational quantum numbers are at their lowest. So the vibrational state is v=0, and the rotational state is J=0, I think. So the fundamental state is the lowest possible.

When it absorbs a photon, it must go to the next higher state. But wait, the next state could involve either a change in vibrational state or a change in rotational state. Or maybe a combination? But the question says the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the smallest energy change would involve a vibrational transition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the next state is
