Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think. The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, which I guess means that the EDTA is in its proper form for complexing. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so I probably don't need to adjust for that. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. 

Wait, so what's the question again? Oh right, what's the concentration of calcium ions in that solution. So, I think I remember that when EDTA complexes with a metal ion like Ca²+, it forms a complex, and the stability of that complex is given by the formation constant, K. 

So the formation constant K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA (Y^4-) combine to form the complex. The reaction is something like Ca²+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY²−. The K for this reaction is given as 5x10^10. 

But wait, the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of CaY²− is 0.02 M. Now, when this complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and Y^4−. But because K is so large (5e10 is a big number, so the reaction is product-favored), the dissociation is minimal. So the concentration of free
