Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through step by step.

The question is asking about the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The speed of light is c, and we need to find v_max from the given options.

Wait, I remember that in the case of a harmonic oscillator, whether classical or quantum, the maximum speed occurs when the potential energy is zero, right? So at maximum displacement (x=A), the potential energy is maximum, and the kinetic energy is zero. As it moves towards the equilibrium position (x=0), kinetic energy is maximum there, and potential is zero. But wait, this is relativistic, so I can't just use the classical expressions.

In the classical case, the maximum speed v_max would be sqrt(kA^2/m), but since this is relativistic, we have to consider the effects of special relativity. Oh right, because at high speeds, the relativistic effects become significant.

Wait, so in relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). For a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energy, but in the relativistic case, the expression for kinetic energy is different.

Wait, but how does the potential energy look in a relativistic harmonic oscillator? I think the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², similar to the classical case. But the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. No, relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc².

So the total energy E would be (gamma - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx². But at maximum speed, the potential energy should be zero, right? Because when the oscillator passes through the equilibrium point, all energy is kinetic. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the classical case, when x=0, all energy is kinetic. But in the maximum displacement x=A, all is potential. But wait, if the oscillator is relativistic, the equations of motion are different. Hmm.

Wait, the problem states that it's a relativistic oscillator obeying Hooke's law F = -kx. So the force is the same as the classical case. But the equation of motion would involve relativistic mass or maybe a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is conserved, and at maximum displacement x=A, the speed is zero, so all energy is potential. At x=0, speed is maximum, so all energy is kinetic. But wait, wait. Wait, that's the classical assumption, but in relativity, maybe the expressions are different.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. At maximum amplitude, the oscillator is at rest momentarily (v=0), so the potential energy is maximum. So the total energy E would be the potential energy at x=A, which is (1/2)kA². Because even in the relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA²?

Wait, but the kinetic energy is zero there, so E = (1/2)kA². At x=0, the potential energy is zero, so E would be the kinetic energy, which is (gamma - 1) mc². So setting these equal:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc²

But gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so gamma - 1 is [1 - sqrt(1 - v²/c²)] / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated.

Wait, maybe it's easier to write the equation as:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc²

But then gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), so we can write:

gamma = 1 + (1/2)kA²/(mc²)

Wait, substituting, gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²).

Wait, let me rearrange that equation:

gamma = (1/2)kA²/(mc²) + 1.

So, gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

Hmm, but wait, that can't be right because if (kA²)/(2 mc²) is a large number, gamma would be large, which would imply v is close to c, which might be possible, but let's see.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

Wait, no, because (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc², so gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc^2)

Then, solving for v:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²)).

So, 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 / [ (1 + (kA²)/(2 mc^2) )^2 ]

Hmm, let me square both sides.

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [ 1 / (1 + (kA²/(2 mc^2)) )^2 ]

Wait, wait, let me compute it step by step.

Let me denote (kA²)/(2 mc²) as some term, say, alpha.

So, alpha = (kA²)/(2 mc²)

Then, gamma = 1 + alpha.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1 + alpha.

Taking reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1/(1 + alpha)

Square both sides:

1 - (v^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + alpha)^2

Then,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ]

= [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2

Expand numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2) - 1 = 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2

= alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2

Wait, but if alpha is small, then higher order terms can be neglected, but the problem doesn't specify that. So we have to keep it exact.

But let's substitute back alpha:

alpha = (kA²)/(2 mc^2)

So, v^2/c^2 = [ (kA²/(2 mc^2)) (2 + (kA²/(2 mc^2))) ] / [ (1 + (kA²/(2 mc^2)))^2 ]

Hmm, that's getting complicated. Let me see if I can factor this better.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express v in terms of gamma. Alternatively, maybe the maximum speed equation can be written differently.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the answer can be found by considering the expression for v_max.

Wait, if we have gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²), then:

gamma = [ (2 mc^2) + kA² ] / (2 mc^2) ]

So,

gamma = (2 mc² + kA² ) / (2 mc² )

Then, 1 / gamma = 2 mc² / (2 mc² + kA² )

But 1/gamma = sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), so:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (2 mc²) / (2 mc² + kA² )

Squaring both sides:

1 - v^2/c^2 = (4 m² c^4) / (2 mc² + kA² )^2

Multiply both sides by c^2:

c^2 (1 - v^2/c^2 ) = (4 m² c^6) / (2 mc² + kA² )^2

Wait, perhaps not the best approach. Maybe I should go back to the equation:

gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²)

So,

gamma = (2 mc² + kA²)/(2 mc²)

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (2 mc² + kA²)/(2 mc² )

Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2):

1 = [ (2 mc^2 + kA^2)/(2 mc^2) ) ] * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )

Then,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (2 mc^2) / (2 mc^2 + kA^2 )

Square both sides:

1 - v^2/c^2 = (4 m^2 c^4) / ( (2 mc^2 + kA^2)^2 )

Then,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [4 m² c^4 / (2 mc^2 + kA^2 )^2 ]

Hmm, but I'm not seeing how this directly matches any of the options.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B says v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2 mc^2 )) )

Wait, but that seems off because the denominator inside the sqrt would be 1 - something, and if that something is greater than 1, you could get a negative inside, which can't be. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the energy at maximum speed is all kinetic. So E = (gamma - 1) mc^2.

But E is the total energy, which in the classical case would be (1/2) k A^2. Wait, but wait, that's the potential energy at x=A, but in the relativistic case, perhaps the total energy is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Maybe in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy isn't (1/2)k x². Because in relativity, the expressions can change, especially if we're considering relativistic dynamics.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is not conserved in the same way as the classical case. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator can be derived from the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian might be L = -(gamma) mc² - (1/2) k x², but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the Lagrangian is (gamma) mc² - (1/2)k x^2, but I'm not certain. Or perhaps it's more complicated due to relativistic velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps the oscillator can be treated using the relativistic equation with F = -kx, which would give a modified equation of motion. Let's think about that.

In classical mechanics, F = ma = -kx → m d²x/dt² = -k x → the equation of motion is d²x/dt² + (k/m) x = 0.

But in relativity, the expression for force is F = d(momentum)/dt. Momentum p = gamma m v.

So F = d/dt ( gamma m v )

Which is m d/dt ( gamma v )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so d gamma/dv = (1/2) (1 - v²/c²)^(-3/2) * (2 v/c²) ) = v/(c² sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

So,

d gamma/dt = d gamma/dv * dv/dt = (v/(c² sqrt(1 - v²/c²))) ) * a,

where a is dv/dt.

But F = m d gamma/dt + gamma m a.

Wait, no, maybe I should write F as the time derivative of gamma m v.

So,

F = d/dt (gamma m v) = m d/dt (gamma v )

Expand this:

= m [ d gamma/dt v + gamma dv/dt ]

But, d gamma/dt is d gamma/dv * dv/dt = (v/(c² sqrt(1 - v²/c²))) ) * dv/dt.

So,

F = m [ (v/(c² sqrt(1 - v²/c²))) * a + gamma a ]

= m a [ (v/(c² sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ) + gamma ]

But since F = -k x,

m a [ (v/(c^2 sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)) ) + gamma ] = -k x.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, maybe I can find the maximum speed by considering the condition where the force equals the relativistic expression. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the energy approach.

Wait, another thought: in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic, so (1/2)k A² = (1/2) m v_max² → v_max = sqrt(kA²/m).

But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So, setting the potential energy equal to the kinetic energy:

(1/2)k A² = (gamma -1) mc².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

Then,

1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

Let me solve for v_max.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 mc²) as alpha. So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Square both sides:

1/(1 - v^2/c^2) = (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which gives,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

= [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding the numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2) - 1 = 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 mc²)^2 to make it clearer perhaps.

But let's substitute alpha back in:

alpha = (k A²) / (2 mc²).

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ 2 (k A^2)/(2 mc^2) + (k A^2/(2 mc^2))^2 ] / [ (1 + k A^2/(2 mc^2) )^2 ]

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A²)/(2 mc²) is (k A²)/(mc²).

And (k A^2/(2 mc^2))^2 is (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

So,

v²/c² = [ (k A^2)/(mc^2) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 mc^2) )^2

Hmm, but this seems a bit messy. Let's factor out (k A^2)/(2 mc^2) from numerator and denominator.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor out (k A^2)/(2 mc^2) in the numerator.

Wait, the numerator is:

(k A^2)/(mc^2) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4) ) = (k A^2)/(2 mc^2) [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 mc^2) ) ]

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A^2/(2 mc^2) ) ( 2 + (k A^2/(2 mc^2)) ) ) ] / ( ( 1 + (k A^2/(2 mc^2)) )^2 )

Let me write this as:

v² = c² * [ (k A^2/(2 mc^2) ) ( 2 + (k A^2/(2 mc^2)) ) ) ] / ( 1 + (k A^2/(2 mc^2)) )^2 )

= c^2 * [ (k A^2/(2 mc^2) ) * (2 + (k A^2/(2 mc^2)) ) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 mc^2)) )^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps this can be simplified. Let's denote beta = (k A^2)/(2 mc^2).

Then,

v² = c² * [ beta ( 2 + beta ) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

= c² * [ 2 beta + beta^2 ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Which is v = c * sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2) / (1 + beta)^2 ) )

= c * [ sqrt( beta (2 + beta) ) ] / (1 + beta )

But I'm not seeing an obvious simplification here, but let's look at the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m))² )

Hmm, not sure. Let's compute what's inside the sqrt.

Option B: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2 m c²) ) )

Wait, not sure. Option C is sqrt(kA^2/m), which is the non-relativistic case.

Option D: c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c^2) )² )

Hmm, let's compute the expression I have:

v = c * sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2) ) / (1 + beta )

Where beta = (k A^2 )/(2 mc^2 )

= [ (2 beta + beta^2) ] / (1 + beta )^2 inside the sqrt.

Wait, let's compute the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2 beta + beta² = beta (beta + 2 )

Denominator: (1 + beta)^2 = 1 + 2 beta + beta².

Hmm, perhaps it's better to write as:

sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2)/(1 + beta)^2 )

= sqrt( [ beta (beta + 2) ] ) / (1 + beta )

Wait, perhaps I can factor it differently. Let me try to factor the numerator:

2 beta + beta² = beta (beta + 2 )

Hmm, not much help. Let me compute the fraction inside the sqrt:

(2 beta + beta²)/(1 + beta)^2 = [ beta (beta + 2) ] / (1 + beta )^2.

Hmm, not seeing a clear pattern. Let's see if any of the options can be rewritten in this form.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - beta')² ), where beta' is (kA²)/(2m).

Wait, but in this problem, the denominator involves 2 m c^2 in beta. So perhaps option A is not correct.

Option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 )

Wait, which would be sqrt( [ (1 + beta )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + beta )^2 ) )

= sqrt( (1 + 2 beta + beta^2 - 1 ) / (1 + beta )^2 )

= sqrt( 2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta )

Which is exactly the expression I have for v/c.

So, v_max = c * sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2) ) / (1 + beta ) )

Which is the same as Option D.

Wait, let's check:

Option D says v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 mc^2) )^2 )

Which is:

sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + beta )^2] )

= sqrt( [ (1 + beta )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + beta )^2 )

= sqrt( (1 + 2 beta + beta^2 - 1 ) / (1 + beta )^2 )

= sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta )^2 )

Which is the same as sqrt( [beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta )^2 )

Which matches our expression for v/c.

So, v_max = c * sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2) )/(1 + beta ), which is the same as option D.

Wait, but let me recheck the expression for option D.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 mc^2))^2 )

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations.

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. At maximum amplitude \( x = A \), the speed is zero, and all energy is potential, given by \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At \( x = 0 \), the speed is maximum, and all energy is kinetic, given by \( E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

Equating the total energy at \( x = A \) and \( x = 0 \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \), we get:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we find:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( \beta = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \beta.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + \beta)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \beta)^2}.
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \beta)^2}.
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
v^2/c^2 = \frac{(1 + \beta)^2 - 1}{(1 + \beta)^2}.
\]

Expanding the numerator:

\[
(1 + \beta)^2 - 1 = 1 + 2\beta + \beta^2 - 1 = 2\beta + \beta^2.
\]

Thus:

\[
v^2/c^2 = \frac{2\beta + \beta^2}{(1 + \beta)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \beta = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{\frac{2\beta + \beta^2}{(1 + \beta)^2}}.
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}.
\]

The other options do not align with the derived expression. For example, **Option A** and **Option B** involve incorrect denominators or terms, and **Option C** corresponds to the non-relativistic case, which is not applicable here.

**Answer: D**
