Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos and the Sun's reactions. I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands after the pp-III branch stops in the Sun's core. The flux ratio is band1 (700-800 keV) over band2 (800-900 keV). The options are A to D, with various ratios.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several proton-proton (pp) chains. The main pp cycles are I, II, and III. Each produces neutrinos of different energies. 

The pp-I branch is the simplest, involving two protons fusing into deuterium, then another proton to form helium-3. This produces a positron and two neutrinos (I think they're electron neutrinos, Î½e). The energy of these neutrinos is around 0.511 MeV (since that's the Q-value of the reaction). So that's lower than the bands in the question.

The pp-II and pp-III branches involve higher energy reactions. Wait, pp-II is when a helium-3 captures a proton to make helium-4, emitting a neutron which then captures a proton. But more importantly, the pp-II branch produces higher energy neutrinos. But wait, I think the pp-III chain is a more complex reaction where two helium-3 nuclei undergo reactions. Let me think... Oh right, the pp-III chain is when two helium-3 nuclei (He-3) undergo a reaction to form carbon-12, but I'm not sure if that's the exact process. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III involves a two-step process where He-3 captures another He-3, but that's perhaps not the right way to think about it. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is when two He-3 ions (each with 2 protons and 1 neutron) undergo a reaction to form He-4 plus a photon or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify. The pp-I chain produces lower-energy neutrinos, while the higher branches (II and III) produce higher-energy neutrinos. Now, the question is about the pp-III branch stopping. So, if the pp-III suddenly stops, how does that affect the neutrino flux in the two bands given?

Neutrinos from the Sun are mainly produced in the pp chains, with the majority coming from the pp-I, II, and III reactions. So, if the pp-III branch stops, the production of neutrinos from that process ceases. But the question is about the flux ratio between the two bands, so I need to think about how the pp-III contributes to each of these bands.

Wait, but what's the energy range of the neutrinos produced by each branch?

I think the main neutrinos from the Sun are the ones from the pp-I chain, which have lower energies, around 0.5 MeV. The pp-II and pp-III produce higher-energy neutrinos. For example, the pp-II produces neutrinos with energies around 1.4 MeV, and the pp-III produces even higher, maybe up to a few MeV. But I'm not certain about the exact numbers.

Wait, I remember that the neutrinos from the pp-I chain are around 0.511 MeV, and the rest are from higher branches. So, if the pp-III stops, then the high-energy neutrinos (like from pp-III) would stop being produced. So, which bands are affected?

The bands given are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So 700 keV is 0.7 MeV, and 900 keV is 0.9 MeV. So the question is about the flux in these bands after the pp-III stops.

Wait, but the pp-III produces higher-energy neutrinos, so in the range above, say, 1 MeV? So, the 700-800 keV band would be below that
