Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet, I think. But wait, the shifts are given in milliangstroms, right?

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, so they both have the same mass. Each has a Neptune-like planet, which I guess means similar mass. But the Doppler shifts are different: 5 milliangstrom for planet 1 and 7 for planet 2. Wait, no, actually, the shifts are different. Oh wait, no, planet 1's shift is 5 and planet 2's is 7. Or wait, no, wait: the question says "the periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom." So star 2 has a larger shift.

Now, I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the star's velocity. The formula I recall is K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ... wait, I might be mixing up the formula. Alternatively, another formula I remember is K = ( (2π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

But wait, since both stars are similar to the Sun and the planets have similar masses to Neptune, M_p is much smaller than M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So maybe I can approximate that term as M_*.

So the formula becomes K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( c^(1/3) * M_*^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, another approach is that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_* ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, I think a better approach is to think in terms of the RV method. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2 * pi * c^3 ) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate (M_* + M_p) as M_*, so the formula simplifies to K ≈ (G P)^(1/3) (M_p sin i) / ( (2 pi c^3 )^(1/3) M_*^(2/3) ) )

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the ratio between the two planets. Since both stars have the same mass, and the planet masses are similar, the ratio of their K values (K2/K1) should be equal to the ratio of their (M_p sin i) divided by the cube root of their orbital periods, but wait, no. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the formula for K is K = (v) = ( (2 pi G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) ) )

Since both M_* are the same and M_p is similar, let's say M_p is same for both planets, then K would be proportional to (1 / P^(1/3) ).

Because:

K ∝ (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

If M_p and M_* are same, then K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Wait, no: If K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * const, K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * const.

So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, because K1 = const / P1^(1/3)

K2 = const / P2^(1/3 )

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Alternatively, K1 = (const) * (1/P1^(1/3))

K2 = (const) * (1/P2^(1/3))

So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, that's right because when you take K1/K2, the constants cancel, and you have (1/P1) / (1/P2) )^(1/3) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

But wait, given that K1 is 5 microang and K2 is 7, so K2 is larger than K1.

Wait, the problem says: the shift for planet 1 is 5 milliangstrom, and for planet 2, it's 7. So K2 is larger than K1.

So, K2 = 7, K1=5. Thus, K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4

We have K2/K1 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, no. Because if K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), then higher K → lower P.

So, let's re-examine.

If K1 = (const) / P1^(1/3 )

K2 = (const) / P2^(1/3 )

Then K2 = (const) / P2^(1/3 )

So, K2/K1 = [P1^(1/3) / P2^(1/3) ] = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

Wait, no, K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me re-derive.

K = (some constant) * (M_p / M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Assuming M_p and M_* are same for both stars, then K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3 )

So, K1 = k / P1^(1/3 )

K2 = k / P2^(1/3 )

So, K2/K1 = (P1^(1/3 )) / (P2^(1/3 )) )

Which is equal to (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

So, if K2 is larger than K1, then the ratio K2/K1 is greater than 1, which implies that (P1/P2)^(1/3) > 1 → P1/P2 >1 → P1 > P2 → P2 < P1.

So, the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1, so the orbital period of planet 2 is shorter (smaller) than planet 1. But the question is asking how many times longer is planet 2's period than planet 1's. Wait, no. The question says: "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So, if P2 is shorter than P1, that ratio would be less than 1. So, the answer would be less than 1. Let's look at the options. The options are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85.

So, if K2 is larger than K1, P2 is smaller than P1, so P2/P1 is less than 1.

But wait, let's compute it. Let me get back.

We have K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

So,

(7/5) = ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(7/5)^3 = P1/P2

So, (343 / 125 ) = P1/P2

So, P1 = (343/125) * P2 → P2 = P1 * (125/343 )

We're to find P2 / P1.

So,

P2 / P1 = (125/343 ) = approx 0.364.

Because 125 *3 = 375, which is a bit more than 343. So 125/343 is approximately 0.364.

So, the period of planet 2 is approximately 0.364 times that of planet 1. So, it's about 0.36 times longer. Wait, but 0.364 is less than 1, meaning that P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So, how many times is P2 longer than P1? It's less than once, so 0.36 times as long.

But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, P2 is shorter, so the answer would be 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but the question says "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So, if P2 is shorter, then it's 0.36 times as long, which is the same as 0.36 times longer.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 36% longer than P1? No, wait, no. Because if P1 is, say, 100 days, P2 is 36 days. So, P2 is 36 days, which is 36% of P1, but it's 64% shorter. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me think.

Wait, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then P2 is 36% the length of P1. So, the period of P2 is 0.36 times that of P1, which means it's shorter. So, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's not, it's shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36. So the question is How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So, the answer would be approximately 0.36 times. So, the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times longer than planet #1's period, which is the same as saying it's shorter by 64%. But the options include 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, am I getting K and P right? Let me make sure.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. So, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So, if K2 > K1, that means P2^(1/3) < P1^(1/3) → P2 < P1.

So, the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1. So, the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1. So, the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times longer.

So, the answer is option A: ~0.36.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity signal, \( K \), is proportional to \( \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. This relationship arises because \( K \propto \frac{M_p \sin i}{M_*^{2/3} P^{1/3}} \), and since the stars and planets are similar in mass, \( M_p \) and \( M_* \) can be approximated as constants.

Given that Planet #1 has a radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and Planet #2 has \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4
\]

Since \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), the ratio of the orbital periods is related to the inverse cube of the semi-amplitude ratio:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately \( 0.36 \) times longer than that of Planet #1. This means Planet #2 has a shorter orbital period than Planet #1.

The question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. Since \( P_2/P_1 \approx 0.36 \), the answer is approximately \( 0.36 \).
