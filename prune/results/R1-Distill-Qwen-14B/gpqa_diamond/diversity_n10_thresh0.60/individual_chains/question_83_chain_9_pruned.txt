Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

Alright, the problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I think I'll start by understanding what's happening when we dilute the acetic acid and then titrate it.

So, initially, we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20.00 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³. Wait, because 20 + 20 is 40. So the concentration of acetic acid will change because we're diluting it.

Let me calculate the new concentration after dilution. I remember that M1V1 = M2V2. So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20.00 cm³. V2 is 40.00 cm³. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2.

Calculating that: (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 → wait, wait. 0.05 *20 is 1, and 1 divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So after dilution, the concentration of acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. So the reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base). The reaction should be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. But before that, the question asks for the pH at 25% titration. So let's first find the equivalence point volume and then the 25% point.

Wait, what's the equivalence point volume? Let me think. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution would be M * V = 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) → 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is same as moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. Volume of NaOH needed would be moles / concentration → 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So equivalence point is at 10 cm
