Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, which I think makes it Li-6, right? Because lithium usually has 3 protons, and adding 3 neutrons gives it a mass number of 6.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, Li normally has an atomic number of 3. So if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus. But for the purpose of calculating its energy, I think I need to know its rest mass energy. 

The problem is about relativistic energy, so I'll need to use the relativistic energy formulas. The speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high—so relativistic effects will definitely matter here. 

The formula for relativistic energy is E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I can compute γ first.

Calculating γ: v is 0.96c. So v² is (0.96)^2 c². Let me compute that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 equals 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So γ is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is indeed 0.9216. Subtracting from 1 gives 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So γ is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

So the energy E is γ times m times c squared. But wait, the mass here is the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. So I need to find the rest mass energy of Li-6.

Hmm, how do I find that? Well, I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be calculated using the mass defect formula, but perhaps for this problem, it's easier to look up the approximate rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

Alternatively, I can think about the atomic mass of Li-6. Let me think: each proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So the total rest mass would be (3 * 938) + (3 * 939) MeV/c².

Wait, but wait. Let me be precise. The mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li
