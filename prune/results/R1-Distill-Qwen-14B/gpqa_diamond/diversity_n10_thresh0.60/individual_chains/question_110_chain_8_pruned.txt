Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal Observatory and HIRES at Keck Observatory. Let's try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out the criteria for each spectrograph. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, I think I should be careful with the wording. Oh right, the wording says "brighter than 17 mag." In astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star with V magnitude less than 17 is brighter than 17, which means it's detectable. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag. So any star with V mag ≤17? Or wait, no, because the way it's phrased is "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So if the apparent V magnitude is brighter than 17, meaning ≤17, then it's observable. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. If a star is brighter than 17, its magnitude is less than 17. Because higher magnitudes are dimmer. So for ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag ≤17 can be observed.

Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed. So for HIRES, apparent V mag must be ≤16. Because 16 is the limit. So any star with apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16 is detectable by HIRES.

So the task is to find which of the stars have an apparent V magnitude that's ≤17 (so detectable by ESPRESSO) and also ≤16 (so detectable by HIRES).

Wait, no. Wait, the question is which stars can be detected with both spectrographs. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 (to be observed by ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (to be observed by HIRES). Because HIRES requires it to be brighter than 16, meaning apparent V mag ≤16.

So for a star to be observable by both, its apparent magnitude in V must be ≤16. However, wait: let's clarify. Because HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag (so V ≤16), and ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than
