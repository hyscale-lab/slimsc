Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to picture the setup. There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small cavity. The cavity isn't at the center because the center is separated by a distance s from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R, so it's definitely inside. 

Now, someone places a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l is greater than R. Oh, and there's an angle theta between l and s.

Wait, I think I should draw a diagram in my mind. The conductor is a sphere, and the cavity is offset. So the charge q is inside this cavity. Since the conductor is uncharged, but it's a conductor, the charges should redistribute. Oh wait, waitâ€”wait, the conductor is uncharged, so initially, it has no net charge. But when you place a charge inside the cavity, what happens?

I remember from Gauss's Law that the electric field inside a conductor is zero. But wait, when you have a cavity inside, the conductor's charges respond. So the charge +q inside the cavity will induce equal and opposite charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor itself is uncharged, the outer surface must then have a charge equal to +q, right? Because the inner surface has -q (since it's induced by +q), so the conductor as a whole must have +q to balance.

Wait, wait. No, because the conductor was initially uncharged. So when the charge +q is added inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q. But since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have +q. That makes sense.

So, from the point of view of the outside, the conductor behaves as if all the charge is on the outer surface. Because for points outside the conductor, the electric field is as if the charge were concentrated at the center. So any charges inside the conductor (like the inner induced charges) don't contribute to the external field.

So, the point P
