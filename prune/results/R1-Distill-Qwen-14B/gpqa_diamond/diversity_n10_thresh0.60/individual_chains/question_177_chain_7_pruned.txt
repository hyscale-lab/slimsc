Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given info is: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured their radial velocities as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to calculate the luminosity ratio. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I recall is L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But wait, the question says they appear brightest at the same wavelength. That probably relates to their temperatures.

Oh right! The peak wavelength (λ_max) of a black body's emission is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula is λ_max * T = constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, if λ_max is the same for both, then T must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. Right, because for a black body, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same, T is the same for both stars.

Wait, but wait a second. The radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s, so it's not moving towards or away from us, I suppose. Star_2 has 700 km/s. Radial velocity would affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. Oh, right! So the measured wavelength might be different because of the Doppler effect. Wait, but the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, so the observed λ_max is the same for both.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think. Each star emits light with its own λ_max based on its temperature. But because of the Doppler effect, if
