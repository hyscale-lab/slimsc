Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to move at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it's Li-6, because 3 protons and 3 neutrons make 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. But wait, sometimes isotopes can vary, but I think for this problem, it's just about the mass being that of a nucleon. So the mass of the nucleus will be about 6 times the mass of a proton. But wait, actually, the mass of the nucleus is approximately 6 times the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron).

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if the nucleus is considered as a single entity. So, the problem says nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons, so that's Li-6.

So the mass of the nucleus is 6 times the mass of a proton, approximately. Let me note that down.

The problem is asking for the energy of the RHIC when the speed v is 0.96c. So the energy here is the relativistic energy, right? So I think I need to calculate the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So when v is 0.96c, let me compute gamma.

So let's calculate gamma first. v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². Then 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is approximately 0.28. Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784 exactly. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that. 0.28 times 0.28 is 0.0784, right. So yes, 1 divided by 0.28 is about
