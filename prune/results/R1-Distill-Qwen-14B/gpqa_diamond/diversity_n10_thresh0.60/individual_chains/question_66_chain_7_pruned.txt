Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is like a framework that includes the Standard Model plus some higher-dimensional operators. But wait, what symmetries do these operators have to respect?

The question lists four symmetries and asks which must be obeyed by all operators in SMEFT. The options are combinations of these. Let me think about each symmetry one by one.

First, Lorentz Symmetry. I remember that in the Standard Model, all interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. So the SMEFT, which is an effective theory built upon the SM, should also respect Lorentz symmetry. So any operator in SMEFT must be Lorentz-invariant. That means option 1 is definitely correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Since the SM respects Poincare, I think that SMEFT operators should also be Poincare-invariant. Because if the original theory (SM) is Poincare symmetric, the effective theory built from it would too. So option 2 must be correct as well.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2. But the question says which must be respected by all operators. So if all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare, then options 1 and 2 are correct. But let me think againâ€”is there a reason why SMEFT operators wouldn't have to respect Poincare? Well, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so I think yes, they must. So 1 and 2 are both required.

Then, what about CP symmetry? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I know that the SM doesn't respect CP due to things like the CKM matrix. So SMEFT operators could violate CP. Because if the SM already allows for certain CP-violating terms, then the effective operators could too. For example, the Weinberg operator is CP-even, but maybe other operators are not. So not all operators in SMEFT must respect CP symmetry. So point 3 is not necessarily a must.

Lastly, CPT symmetry. Oh right, I think all Lorentz-invariant theories respect CPT symmetry. Because in relativity, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. So if the SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, then it must respect CPT as well. So point 4 is correct.

Wait, but SMEFT might have operators that explicitly break CPT? Or is that impossible because of being Lorentz-invariant? Because if the
