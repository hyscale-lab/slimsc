Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, the question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubit space. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that the density matrix describes the state of a quantum system, including any entanglement or mixedness. So, what does this matrix look like?

Let me write it out. The |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (0,0) and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 at (1,1). So when I add them together and multiply by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2. So the matrix becomes:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Right, this is a diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal. Now, I've heard that density matrices for qubits can be represented in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation in three dimensions, where each point corresponds to a quantum state.

The general form for a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix and σ are the Pauli matrices. The vector r = (x, y, z) determines the position on the Bloch sphere. If r has a magnitude of 1, it's a pure state; else, it's a mixed state.

So let's compare this to our given ρ. Our ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2 = I/2, since |0><0| + |1><1| equals the identity matrix I. So ρ = (I + 0)/2, which means r·σ must be zero. That would imply that r is the zero vector (0,0,0).

Wait, but I thought the completely mixed state is represented by this. Oh right! The maximally mixed state is when the density matrix is I/2, which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. Because the Bloch sphere has radius 1, the center is at (0,0,0). So in this case, the state is at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

I don't think any other options make sense. Option A is (1,1,0), which is a pure state on the equator, but our state is mixed. Option B is (0,0,1), which is the north pole, perhaps a pure state like |0> or |+> if it were a different setup. Option D is all ones, but that's beyond the Bloch sphere's radius of 1, so that doesn't fit either.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This simplifies to 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. In the Bloch sphere representation, a single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is a vector determining the position of the state in the Bloch sphere. Comparing this to the given \(\rho\), we see that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), which implies \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is located at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A (\(r = (1, 1, 0)\))**: This represents a pure state on the equator of the Bloch sphere, which does not match the given mixed state.
- **Option B (\(r = (0, 0, 1)\))**: This represents a pure state at the north pole of the Bloch sphere, which also does not match the given mixed state.
- **Option C (\(r = (0, 0, 0)\))**: This represents the completely mixed state at the center of the Bloch sphere, which matches the given density matrix.
- **Option D (\(r = (1, 1, 1)\))**: This represents a pure state outside the Bloch sphere, which is not valid.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
