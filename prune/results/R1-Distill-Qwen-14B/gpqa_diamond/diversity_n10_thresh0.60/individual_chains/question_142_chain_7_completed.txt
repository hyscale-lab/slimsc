Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm trying to remember what I learned about density matrices and qubit states. Let me think through this.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, I think this is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Maxmally mixed, so it's a completely mixed state, which means it has maximum entropy. 

But wait, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, qubit space is represented by the Bloch sphere, right? So the density matrix corresponds to a point on the Bloch sphere. 

I remember that for a single qubit state, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z) and σ are the Pauli matrices. So the density matrix ρ is a function of this vector r.

Let me write that down. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So, expanding, ρ would be (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z )/2.

In this problem, the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1| ) /2. Wait, because |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 in the top-left, zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is diagonal with 1 at the bottom right. Adding them gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on both diagonal elements. Then, multiplying by 1/2, each diagonal element is 1/2. So ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. 

But wait, the maximally mixed state for a single qubit is indeed (I)/2, because I is the identity matrix. So in this case, r must be zero. Because if I expand ρ as (I + r·σ)/2, then if r is zero, ρ is (I)/2, which matches the given matrix.

So the Bloch vector r has components (0,0,0). So the point in the qubit space (the Bloch sphere) is at the origin. So looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which would be the correct answer.

Let me make sure I didn't mix anything up. Another way to see it: the density matrix for a pure state would have trace 1 and rank 1, but this one is a mixed state. For a pure state |ψ>, the density matrix is |ψ><ψ|, which would correspond to a point on the surface of the Bloch sphere. But if it's mixed, like a completely mixed state, the Bloch vector is zero, so the point is at the origin.

So yeah, the correct answer is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This corresponds to the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation of qubit space, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. For the given \(\rho\), the diagonal matrix \(\frac{I}{2}\) matches the structure of the maximally mixed state, which implies that the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero (\(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), \(r_z = 0\)). This places the state at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
