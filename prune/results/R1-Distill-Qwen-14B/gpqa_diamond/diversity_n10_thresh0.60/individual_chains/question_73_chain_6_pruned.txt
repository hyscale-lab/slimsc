Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just add them normally. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. But wait, the problem is asking for the relative speed between them. So I need to find the speed of one astronaut from the other's frame of reference.

The first astronaut has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c. The second has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So from Earth's frame, they're moving in the same direction. But relative to each other, their speeds will be different.

Wait, no. Actually, the relative speed isn't about mass; it's purely about their velocities. Because relative velocity is calculated based on their speeds, not their masses. So the mass might not come into play for the relative speed part. Oh wait, but wait. No, for the relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds, you do use the velocity addition formula. So the formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv/cÂ²)).

But which one is moving at u and which is v here? Let me think. Let's say we're in the frame of the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c). So from his perspective, what's the speed of the second astronaut (3m, 0.5c in Earth's frame)?

Wait no, perhaps it's the other way around. If
