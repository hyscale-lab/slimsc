Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Both planets have already been detected using the radial velocity method, which gives us their minimum masses and orbital periods. The question is about choosing which one to observe because of a higher transit probability.

Hmm, so the setup is that Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius, which is a bit interesting because if a star is more massive, it's typically larger, but here they have same radii. Oh, wait, the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, so maybe that's why their radii are the same despite different masses.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the size of the orbit. Oh, right, the formula for transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star) squared multiplied by something else... Wait, no, wait. I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star) squared, but also depends on the orbital parameters.

Wait, no, wait. More accurately, the probability of a planet transiting is given by (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (a / (2R_s))², but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's orbit that
