Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² equals 32 divided by (4 - x² - y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So, ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Oh wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric in some sort of space. Since it's (dx² + dy²), it's probably in polar coordinates if we consider x and y as r and θ, but maybe not. Alternatively, the metric could be conformal, meaning it's a scaled version of the Euclidean metric.

So, the first thing I think is that the area element in a two-dimensional space is calculated using sqrt(det g) dθ dφ or something like that, but wait, this is a metric in 2D. The general formula for the area is the integral of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, multiplied by the differentials. But since this is in 2D, the determinant would be g_xx * g_yy - g_xy², and for a diagonal metric like this, it's just g_xx * g_yy.

But wait, the metric here is written in terms of dx² and dy². So the metric tensor is diagonal: g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_yy is the same. So the determinant is (32/(4 -x² - y²
