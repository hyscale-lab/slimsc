Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to work through it step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's quite rigid. When it's treated with a strong base like KOH, especially under heat, elimination reactions can happen. Since there are two bromine atoms on the adamantane, maybe it's an E2 elimination, leading to the formation of a diene. Oh wait, but KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Since it's in excess, maybe it's dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... the two bromine atoms are probably on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Eliminating two Br atoms would lead to the formation of a double bond. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane has a structure similar to four cyclohexane rings fused together. So, if we have bromines on carbons 1 and 3, elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3? Or maybe the positions are such that the double bond forms in a different location.

Alternatively, maybe it's more about the formation of a ketone. Because when dihalides react with a strong base like KOH, sometimes they can form alcohols or ketones via elimination and then oxidation. Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. Light yellow solids often indicate something like a ketone
