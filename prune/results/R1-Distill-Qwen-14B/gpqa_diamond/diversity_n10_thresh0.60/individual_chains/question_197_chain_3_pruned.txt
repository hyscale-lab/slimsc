Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of substitution reaction, maybe a dehydrohalogenation or a cleavage. Wait, no, I think when you have a vicinal dihalide and treat it with red phosphorus and HI, you get a diene. Or wait, red phosphorus is used with HI for the dehydrohalogenation, right? Like, removing HX or something. Or maybe it's a cleavage reaction. Oh right, I think it's the cleavage of vicinal dihalides. When you have two adjacent halogens, like in a dihalide, and you treat it with P and HI, it cleaves the C-C bond between the two halides, forming two separate compounds.

So, the first thing I need to do is figure out what compound X is. Let me look at the spectral data given.

The IR data: 3400-2500 cm^-1. That's a broad region, probably O-H or N-H stretch. But in the options, some are acids, which have O-H. The other peaks are at 1720, which is likely a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester), and 1610 and 1450 cm^-1, which might be aromatic C=C stretching. So, maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and an alcohol or acid group.

The NMR data: The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H). That's a high chemical shift. It could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but in a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually around 10-12 ppm and broad because of hydrogen bonding. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Other peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. So, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which suggests two substituents opposite each other on
