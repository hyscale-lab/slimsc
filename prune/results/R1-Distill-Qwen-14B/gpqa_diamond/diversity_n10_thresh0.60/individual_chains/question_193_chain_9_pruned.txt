Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax is usually denoted as 'p' or 'plx' sometimes. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. 

Wait, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Like, the formula is that distance d is approximately 1 over parallax p in parsecs. So d = 1/p. Oh right, because parallax measures how much the star's position shifts over a year, so closer stars have larger parallax. So if I have a star that's closer, its parallax is bigger, and vice versa.

So the problem says N varies with 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in might help. Let's see: plx = 1/d, so 1/(plx) is d. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait plx is 1/d, so plx = 1/d. So 1/(plx) is d. But in the given, N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which is (d)^5. Wait, no, 1/(plx) is d, so [1/(plx)]^5 is d^5. So N ∝ (d)^5.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So the number of stars per unit distance. Hmm, so the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r would be proportional to the surface area times the volume element or something? Or perhaps the question is simply about the number as a function of r, not considering volume. Wait, this might be more about the relation between N and r.

Wait, I'm a little confused. Let me think about this. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So as distance increases, parallax decreases. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which is the same as (1/(1/d))^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. Oh, wait, maybe it's the differential. Like, the number of stars in a small range dr around r. So if N is the total
