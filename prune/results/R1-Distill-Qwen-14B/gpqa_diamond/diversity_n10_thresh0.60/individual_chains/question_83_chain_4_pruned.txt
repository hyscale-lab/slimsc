Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titrations and pH calculations. Let's break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. Then, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I think I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so they should react in a neutralization reaction.

First, let me read the problem again. We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Wait, I need to find the concentrations and the points where these occur. Let me think about the first part: the initial dilution.

The initial volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³, 0.05 M. So, the moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration is moles/volume. Moles are 0.001, volume is 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, wait, wait—that can't be right. Because 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then, diluting to 0.04 L (40 cm³), so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, right, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M CH3COOH.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's think about the equivalence point. At equivalence, moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.001 mol (from before the dilution). Since we're titrating that, moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point occurs when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. But the question is about 25% titration, which would be 25% of this equivalence point volume. Hmm, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So at that point, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted.

Wait, but to clarify, when they say 25% titration, do they mean 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added, or 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized? Oh, in titration terms, 25% titration usually refers to the volume added relative to the equivalence point. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³, so the volume at 25% is 2.5 cm³. But I need to make sure that's correct. Alternatively, sometimes it's based on the moles. Either way, the approach should be similar.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider the moles. At equivalence point
