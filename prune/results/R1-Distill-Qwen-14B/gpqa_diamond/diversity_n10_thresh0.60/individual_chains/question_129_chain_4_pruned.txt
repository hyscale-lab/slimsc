Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what we've got here. The question involves a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through several steps to form compound E. Then, there are some hints and options to consider.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR of A has a peak at ~1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is at ~1715 cm^-1.

Looking at the IR peaks, I remember that a peak around 1750 is typical for a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester. But since A is reacting with HCN, which is a nucleophile, perhaps A is a ketone. Like, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So, for example, if A is cyclohexanone, adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin, which would have an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent.

Wait, but after that, compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd. H2 and Pd are usually for hydrogenation. So if B has a nitrile group, reducing it would add two hydrogens, making an amine? Or wait, maybe it's a ketone that's being hydrogenated. Wait, no, the initial step is A reacting with HCN. Let me think again.

A is a ketone. So A + HCN â†’ B (cyanohydrin). Then B is hydrogenated. Hydrogenation of a nitrile would produce an amine. Wait, but H2 with Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation, so maybe it's hydrogenating the nitrile group into an amine. So B is a cyanohydrin (with a -CN and -OH group), and upon hydrogenation, the CN becomes CH2NH2? Or wait, maybe hydrogenation of a nitrile
