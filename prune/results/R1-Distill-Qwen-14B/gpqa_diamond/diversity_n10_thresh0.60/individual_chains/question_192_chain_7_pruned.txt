Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity of radius r, and the center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So the conductor has a hole in it, not touching the center. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Wait, the point P is outside the conductor, so its distance from the conductor's center is L, and it's also a distance l from the cavity's center. Oh, and the angle between l and s is theta. So the geometry must be a bit tricky.

I remember that for conductors, the charges reside on the surface. But since the conductor was initially uncharged, and then a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, what happens? Oh right, in such a case, the conductor will redistribute its charges. But wait, the conductor was neutral. So the inner cavity has +q, which would induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged, but we added +q in the cavity. So the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Because inside a conductor, the electric field is zero. So the cavity's charge +q induces -q on the inner surface, leaving the outer surface with a charge of +q because the total conductor was neutral. Wait, no. Wait, the conductor was uncharged, so the total charge on the conductor is zero. The +q inside the cavity induces a -q on the inner surface. Since the conductor itself must remain neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the inner surface has -q, and the conductor started with zero, the outer must be +q.

Wait, wait, I might have that mixed up. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have an induced charge of -q. Because inside the conductor (the material part, not the cavity), the electric field must be zero. So the charges rearrange so that the cavity's field
