Okay, so I've got this science problem here about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which was detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. But their orbital periods are different: Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter orbital period means it's nearer, right?

The host stars have different masses but the same radii. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but same radii? I think more massive stars are usually bigger, but maybe in this case, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so perhaps it's a subgiant or something, leading it to have the same radius despite being less massive. Interesting.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. So the probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital inclination. I remember the formula for transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / (a√(1-e²) )) ... no, wait, wait. Maybe I should think about the basic transit probability.

Oh right, the transit probability is approximately (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a * sin i)), but I might be getting confused. Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star, but that's when the orbital plane is edge-on. But since we don't know the inclination, the probability depends on whether the orbit is aligned such that the planet transits. So the probability is (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (1 / (d), where d is some factor based on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the actual formula.

Wait, I think the probability that a planet transits is given by (R_*/ (a * (1 - e²)^0.5)) )^2 multiplied by ( (R_p + R_*) )^2 / (R_* )^2. No, that's for the
