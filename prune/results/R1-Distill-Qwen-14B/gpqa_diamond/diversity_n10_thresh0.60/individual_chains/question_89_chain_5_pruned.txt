Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and ending with product 3. The question is about the NMR coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The options are A to D, with various splitting patterns.

First, I'll break down each step of the reaction sequence.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with strong bases like KOH, an elimination reaction occurs to form an alkene. This is probably a dehydrohalogenation reaction. Since it's heated, it's likely an E2 mechanism, which would form an alkene. The product here is a light yellow solid, which makes me think of an adamantyl structure because adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose HBr twice to form 1,3-diene adamantane? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromo would lose two HBr molecules, right? So the product would be an alkane with two double bonds? Or maybe a single double bond. Hmm.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with four cyclohexane rings connected in a chair-like formation. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on adjacent carbons in this structure. So when KOH is used, it would eliminate HBr to form a double bond. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, and you eliminate two HBr molecules, would that form a conjugated diene? Or maybe a single double bond? Wait, perhaps the reaction only eliminates once, forming a single double bond because losing two HBr might not be possible in this structure.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid, which suggests an alkene, maybe just one double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a more substituted structure, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the NMR data given for product 1.

The product 1's 1H NMR shows peaks at:
- 4.79 ppm (2H)
- 2.41-2.
