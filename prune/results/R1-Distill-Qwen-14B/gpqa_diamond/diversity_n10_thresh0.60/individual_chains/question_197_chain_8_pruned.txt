Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out the final product. The options are four different compounds, labeled A to D. 

First, I should probably figure out what Compound X is, right? Because once I know that, I can predict what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Looking at the data provided: IR and 1H NMR. Let's start with the IR data because that often gives me functional groups.

IR peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. Hmm, the broad peak between 3400 and 2500 usually suggests O-H or N-H stretching. But the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which I think is a carbonyl group (C=O). The peaks at around 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching, so there's probably a benzene ring involved.

So, putting that together: there's a benzene ring, a carbonyl group (maybe an ester or ketone or acid?), and an O-H group (since the IR shows that broad peak). Wait, but if there's a carbonyl and an O-H, maybe it's a carboxylic acid? Because carboxylic acids have both a carbonyl and an O-H. But wait, the presence of red phosphorus and HI is a reaction condition I remember. Red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of esters under acidic conditions. Or wait, or maybe it's the hydrolysis of a nitrile? No, wait, nitriles usually require different conditions. Or perhaps it's the elimination of an acid from an ester? Let me think.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI is used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, which is for removing carbonyl groups, like converting ketones to methylene groups. But wait, that's under high temperature and with NH3. Or is it something else? Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction where a ketone is being converted into something else. Wait, maybe I'm getting that mixed up. Alternatively, I've heard that red phosphorus and HI can cleave esters. Oh yeah, esters can react with HI in the presence of red phosphorus to undergo acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Wait, when an ester is treated with HI (a strong acid), it typically undergoes acid-catalyzed hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. But wait, red phosphorus is often used to remove oxygen from certain compounds. Or wait, another possibility: if the compound is a nitrile, red phosphorus and HI can hydrolyze it to an amine. Or wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should first figure out what the structure of Compound X is, using the NMR data provided.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm suggests an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols usually have O-H around 1-5 ppm, but a carboxylic acid O-H is typically around 10-12 ppm. So that fits. So probably a carboxylic acid proton.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. That's likely aromatic protons, specifically para-substituted. So maybe a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Wait, but in a para substitution, the protons are typically two doublets, each with two protons. So maybe a para-disubstituted benzene, like two substitu
