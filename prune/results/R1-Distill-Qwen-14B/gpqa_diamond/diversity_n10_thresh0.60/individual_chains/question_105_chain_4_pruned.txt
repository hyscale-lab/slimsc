Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When we observe this star, the brightness variations due to rotation would look similar to those caused by an exoplanet. The question is asking, what's the radius of such an exoplanet compared to the star's radius to produce the same brightness change?

Hmm. So the key here is to calculate the light variation caused by the spots and then figure out what an exoplanet's radius would need to be to cause the same change.

First, I need to understand what causes the brightness changes. For a star with spots, when the spots rotate into and out of view, the observed brightness changes. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears a bit dimmer.

For the exoplanet scenario, when the planet transits in front of the star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.

Wait, but in this case, the spots are causing a modulation in brightness as the star rotates. So the star's brightness isn't perfectly uniform; part of it is dimmer because of the spots. So the question is, how much does the star's brightness vary because of the spots, and then, what planet radius would cause the same dip.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, the star's total brightness when not considering the spots. The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But since the star has spots, the observed flux will change as the spots rotate into view.

The problem says the filling factor is 20%. Filling factor, I think, refers to the fraction of the hemisphere that is covered by spots. So, if one hemisphere is covered 20% by spots, then the total area of spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

The area of a hemisphere is 2πR². So the area of the spots would be 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². But wait, the star's total surface area is 4πR². So the spots cover 0.4πR² / 4πR² = 10% of the entire star's surface. Oh, because one hemisphere is 50% of the star, so 20% of that is 10% of the total surface area.

Wait, correction: filling factor is the fraction of the visible hemisphere covered by spots. So the star's brightness variation depends on how much of the light is obscured when the spots rotate.

The star's observed flux when a spot is visible would be different. The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = σTeff^4. But the spots have a lower temperature (Teff - 1000K = 5000K), so their flux per unit area is lower.

The flux from the spots would be F_spot = σ
