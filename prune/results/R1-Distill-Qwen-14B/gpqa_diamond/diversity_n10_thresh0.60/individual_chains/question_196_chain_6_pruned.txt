Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

Alright, the question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It's relativistic, so I can't ignore relativistic effects, which usually become significant when speeds approach the speed of light, c. 

In the non-relativistic case, I remember that the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is (1/2)kA², and this gets converted into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point, where all potential energy is turned into kinetic. That gives (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², so v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's one of the options, option C. But wait, the question is relativistic, so I can't use that directly.

In special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So maybe I need to use relativistic energy conservation here.

The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², right? But wait, in the relativistic case, I'm not sure if the potential is still the same. I think for small oscillations, the potential can be approximated as (1/2)kx², but since it's a maximum amplitude scenario, maybe that's a good enough approximation.

So, at maximum displacement x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The total energy would then be the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy, but wait, no. Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which equals the kinetic energy at x=0. But in relativity, the total energy would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Hmm, maybe I should model this.

At maximum displacement, the oscillator is momentarily at rest in the non-relativistic case. But wait, actually, no, in the case of an oscillator, at x = A, the velocity is zero. So, in non-relativistic, the kinetic energy is zero there, and all energy is potential. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is higher. Wait, but how does that apply when
