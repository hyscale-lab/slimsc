Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Oh wait, parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position due to Earth's orbit. The formula for distance is something like distance = 1 / parallax, but I'm not exactly sure of the units here. Oh right, parsecs. So the distance in parsecs is 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, if stars are uniformly distributed, that means their actual number depends on the volume they occupy. But wait, since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, higher parallax means closer stars, and lower parallax means more distant.

If stars are uniformly distributed in space, then the number density is uniform. So the number of stars in a volume would increase with the volume. But how does that relate to parallax?

Let me think. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance d would depend on the volume of that shell. The volume of a shell is 4πd² * dr, where dr is the thickness. But distance d is related to parallax plx. Since plx = 1/d (in parsecs), d = 1/plx.

So the volume element in terms of parallax would be a bit tricky. Let me see. Let's think about how d changes with plx. If plx is a small range, say from plx to plx + dplx, then the corresponding distance range would be from 1/plx to 1/(plx + dplx). Wait, perhaps it's easier to express the volume in terms of plx.

Alternatively, let's make a substitution. Let’s define a small change in parallax, say dplx. The corresponding change in distance would be related to d. Since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. But maybe it's better to consider the volume between two parallaxes.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of stars per unit volume. If the distribution is uniform, the number per unit volume is a constant, say n. Then, the number in a certain volume should be n multiplied by that volume.

But how to relate that to parallax. So, for a given parallax range, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding volume of space
