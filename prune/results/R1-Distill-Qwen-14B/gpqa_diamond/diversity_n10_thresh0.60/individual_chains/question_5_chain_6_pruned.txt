Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Hmm, first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when a measurement is made. So the operator here is P, which I think is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So that direction would be something like making an angle θ with the z-axis and φ with the x-axis. But wait, no, because if it's in the x-z plane, the direction would have φ=0 or π, maybe. Or perhaps more accurately, the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so it's any direction where the angle from the x-axis is 0 or 180, but varying θ from 0 to π. Hmm, not entirely sure, but maybe that's not the main point right now. 

The question is to find the eigenvector of P along n with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Oh right, the operator P is a vector operator, so the operator P is P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z, where x, y, z are the direction vectors. So along direction n, which is in the x-z plane, the operator we're looking at is P·n. That would make sense because the eigenvalues of angular momentum (or any vector operator) along a specific direction n are the possible outcomes of measuring that component.

So, the first step is to construct the operator P·n. Let's see, n is a unit vector in the x-z plane. So n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in spherical coordinates, θ is the angle from the z-axis, and φ is the angle around the z-axis. But since the direction is in the x-z plane, φ is 0, so n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

Wait, but wait, if it's in the x-z plane, then the
