Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light passing through a moving glass. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. We need to find the speed of light relative to the lab frame. Oh wait, the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1, so maybe everything is scaled by c, which is 1 here.

I remember that when dealing with velocities in different frames, especially with light, relativity comes into play. But wait, the glass is moving, so how does that affect the light's speed as observed from the lab? Oh, wait, in special relativity, the speed of light remains constant in all inertial frames. But wait, the glass is moving, but the light is inside the glass. So does that change anything?

Wait, no. Because the speed of light in a medium is usually less than c, right? Like in glass, it's c/n. But the medium is moving. So do I apply the velocity addition formula here?

Wait, but wait. Let's clarify. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed c/n. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the light's speed in the lab frame?

Hmm, so I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, in this case, what's u and what's u'?

Wait, in the glass's frame, the light has velocity u = c/n. Because in the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n. Then, the lab frame is moving at velocity v with respect to the glass frame. Wait, no, the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. Oh, right, so to get the velocity in the lab frame, we can use the velocity addition formula. So u (lab) is the velocity in the lab frame.

Wait, let me get the frames straight. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So the lab is the stationary frame, and the glass is moving. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n (because in the medium, the speed is c/n). But wait, no—the light is moving through the glass, so in the glass's frame, the speed is c/n in the direction of the beam.

So to find the speed in the lab frame, we apply the velocity addition formula. The formula is u_lab = (u_glass + v) / (1 + u_glass * v / c²). But wait, since c is 1 in this problem, it's u_lab = (u_glass + v) / (1 + u_glass * v).

Wait, but u_glass is the speed of the light in the glass's frame, which is c/n. But since c is 1, u_glass = 1/n.

So substituting, u_lab = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v )

But wait, let me make sure. Is the glass's velocity v in the same direction as the light's motion? Yes, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, the beam is going toward the observer, so if the glass is moving toward the observer, that's the same direction as the beam's propagation. So both the glass and the light are moving in the same direction in the lab frame.

So the formula should be u_lab = (u_glass + v) / (1 + u_glass*v / c²). But since c=1, it's (u_glass + v)/(1 + u_glass * v).

Wait, but wait. When the medium is moving, doesn't the speed of light in that medium change? Or is the speed of light always c in any frame? Because according to relativity, in any inertial frame, the speed of light should be c. But that's when the light is in vacuum, right? Or is it that in any medium, the speed is c/n regardless of the medium's motion?

Hmm, this is where I might be getting confused. Because in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. But from the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, would that speed change?

Wait, but no. Because in the lab frame, the glass is moving, but according to relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the lab frame, the light is moving through the glass which is moving. But the glass is a medium, not a vacuum. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be less than c because it's inside a medium. But wait, in reality, according to special relativity, the speed of light in a medium can be less than c, but the speed of light in vacuum is always c in any inertial frame.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think. Let's clarify the problem: the light is propagating through the glass. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light, towards the observer. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v. The light's speed in the glass is c/n, but how does the glass's motion affect the lab frame's measurement of the light's speed?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Because according to relativity, the speed of light in the lab frame should still be c. Wait, but that can't be right because the light is in a medium, the glass. So the speed of light in the medium is c/n, which is less than c. So if the glass is moving, would that affect the observed speed of the light in the lab frame?

Wait, perhaps the answer is simply c/n, because the speed of light in the medium is just c/n regardless of the medium's motion. But wait, that can't be right because if the medium is moving, the light's speed should transform according to the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but maybe the situation is that the glass is moving, but the light is moving through it. So in the lab frame, the speed of the light would be the speed in the glass plus the glass's speed, but considering relativistic effects.

Wait, but let's think about it step by step. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at u = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So to find the lab frame's speed of the light, we can use the velocity addition formula.

So substituting:

u_lab = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

Since c=1, u = 1/n.

So plugging in:

u_lab = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to simplify:

Numerator: 1 + n v

Denominator: n + v

So u_lab = (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v). So that's what I got.

But wait, another approach: the glass is moving at velocity v. The light's speed in the glass is c/n. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be (c/n + v)/(1 + (c/n v)/c² ). Since c=1, that's ( (1/n +v ) ) / (1 + (v)/(n c) )

Wait, but c=1, so denominator becomes 1 + v/(n).

Wait, but let me compute it again.

u_lab = [u_glass + v] / [1 + u_glass * v]

u_glass is 1/n, so:

u_lab = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (v)(1/n) )

Which simplifies to ( (1 + n v)/n ) / ( (n + v)/n )

The n's cancel, giving (1 + n v)/(n + v), which matches option A.

But wait, another way to think: since the glass is moving, but the light is in the glass. So in the glass frame, light moves at 1/n. So when you boost to the lab frame (which sees the glass moving at v), the light's speed is as we derived.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, and the light's speed in the glass is \( \frac{1}{n} \) (since \( c = 1 \) in this problem). 

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
u_{\text{lab}} = \frac{u_{\text{glass}} + v}{1 + u_{\text{glass}} \cdot v}
\]

Here, \( u_{\text{glass}} = \frac{1}{n} \), which is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame. Substituting \( u_{\text{glass}} = \frac{1}{n} \) into the formula:

\[
u_{\text{lab}} = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{1}{n} \cdot v}
\]

To simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u_{\text{lab}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \), which corresponds to option A.
