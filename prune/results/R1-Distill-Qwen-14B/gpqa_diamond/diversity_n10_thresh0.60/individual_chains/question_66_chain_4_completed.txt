Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, meaning it incorporates the Standard Model (SM) with higher-dimensional operators. Effective theories usually respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory, which in this case is the SM.

What do I know about the symmetries of the SM? Well, the SM is a Lorentz invariant theory. So all its interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, the SMEFT operators must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So point 1 is probably correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Since the SM respects Poincare, any effective theory based on it would too. But wait, do all SMEFT operators automatically respect Poincare? I think that in SMEFT, you can have operators that are local, so they should respect translation symmetry. So yes, Poincare symmetry must be respected. So points 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, what about CP symmetry? Wait, the SM doesn't have CP as a symmetry. In fact, the SM has CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT doesn't need to respect CP symmetry because the SM itself doesn't. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP. So point 3 is not necessarily a symmetry that all operators must respect.

Then there's CPT symmetry. I remember from quantum field theory that CPT is a fundamental symmetry in any relativistic quantum field theory, including the SM. So all interactions in the SM respect CPT, and thus SMEFT operators must also respect CPT. So point 4 is correct.

So putting it together, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait, the options don't have all three. Let me look: option C is 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4. The question is which must be respected by all operators.

Wait, but wait a second. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translation. So if you already have Lorentz symmetry, Poincare is also part of it. Because if you have a theory invariant under Lorentz and translations, that's Poincare.

So the operators must respect Lorentz (so they must also respect Poincare, since Poincare includes Lorentz). So points 1 and 2 are both correct. But wait, no, the question is whether each of the four must be respected. So 1 is Lorentz, 2 is Poincare. But wait, if any operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz as a subset. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So all operators must respect Lorentz, so 1 is correct. But what about Poincare? Because if an operator is not Lorentz invariant, it's not Poincare either. So I think that if the operator respects Lorentz, it automatically respects Poincare because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. Wait, but maybe I should think about it the other way: does an operator that respects Poincare necessarily respect Lorentz? Yes. But the other way around: does respecting Lorentz imply respecting Poincare? No, because you might not have translation invariance. But in SMEFT, all operators are supposed to be local, so translation is included. So SMEFT is Poincare invariant.

Wait, but SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, so operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Poincare is a bigger symmetry that includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator is Poincare-invariant, it's Lorentz-invariant. But the converse isn't true unless it's also translation-invariant.

Wait, but all SMEFT operators are local, so they respect translation symmetry. Therefore, they must respect Poincare. So both 1 and 2 must be respected. So the first two points, 1 and 2, are correct.

But looking back at the options, the possible correct options are A) 1,2; C) 1,2,4; etc. So if 1 and 2 are both correct, that's points 1 and 2. But wait, the question is which must be respected by all operators. So, for example, if an operator respects Poincare, it must also respect Lorentz, but does the opposite hold? Not necessarily, but for SMEFT, I think that all operators must respect Poincare because the theory is Poincare-invariant.

Wait, maybe I should clarify. SMEFT is built from local operators, so their terms must be invariant under all Poincare transformations. So any operator in SMEFT must respect Poincare. Therefore, both 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, looking at the options. Option C is 1,2,4. Option A is 1,2. So which is correct?

Wait, the first two points are 1 and 2. So are both required? Or is 2 redundant because if you have 1 (Lorentz), then 2 (Poincare) may not necessarily be required unless you also have translations.

But in SMEFT, the operators are built from the SM fields, which are Poincare invariant. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare. So yes, both 1 and 2 are required.

So that leaves the options with 1,2,4 as correct (option C). But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So the SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So including 4.

Wait, but CPT symmetry is a separate thing. The SM respects CPT, so SMEFT must as well. So all operators must respect CPT. So that brings us to points 1,2,4.

So the correct options would be 1,2,4, which is option C. But let me double-check.

Wait, the other possibilities: CPT is a product of C, P, and T. If the theory respects CPT, it doesn't necessarily mean it respects each individually. But the question is which must be respected by all operators. So all operators must respect CPT symmetry, but they don't have to respect CP or T individually. So point 4 is correct.

So the required symmetries are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So the correct choice is C) 1,2,4.

But wait, the options are:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C) 1,2,4

D) 1,3,4

So the correct answer would be C. Because all operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4).

Wait, but let me think about this again. Does SMEFT respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations. The SM is Poincare-invariant, so SMEFT must be as well. Therefore, all operators must respect Poincare. So 1 and 2 are correct. Plus, they must respect CPT (4). So option C is correct.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) with higher-dimensional operators. SMEFT respects the same symmetries as the SM, which is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1). 

Poincaré symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry, is also a fundamental symmetry of the SM. Since SMEFT is built from local operators, it must respect translation symmetry, and thus Poincaré symmetry (2) is also required. 

CP symmetry, on the other hand, is not a symmetry of the SM, as it exhibits CP violation. Consequently, SMEFT operators do not need to respect CP symmetry (3). 

CPT symmetry, however, is a fundamental symmetry in relativistic quantum field theories, including the SM. Since SMEFT is derived from the SM, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry (4). 

Thus, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct combination of these symmetries is provided in option C.

Answer: C
