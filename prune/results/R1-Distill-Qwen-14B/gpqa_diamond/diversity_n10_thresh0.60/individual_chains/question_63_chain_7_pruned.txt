Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model of a diatomic molecule. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled as a rigid rotor and a harmonic oscillator. But wait, the question says it's using the non-rigid rotor model, so maybe that's a bit different. Let me think.

The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon. Right, because photons carry momentum, and when a molecule absorbs a photon, its energy state changes based on that photon's energy.

Wait, the molecule's energy levels are quantized. For a diatomic, the energy comes from both rotation and vibration. But since it's the fundamental state, which probably means the lowest energy state, maybe that's the ground state where both rotation and vibration are at their lowest.

Wait, but the question is about moving to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the first excited state. But I'm not entirely sure whether the energy transition involves both rotation and vibration changes or just one. Oh wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". So it's the next state, which I think is the first energy level above the ground state.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state but the ground rotational state as well. So when it absorbs a photon, it could either get promoted to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But which one requires the least energy? Because the photon's momentum is related to its energy, so the lower the energy needed for the transition, the smaller the momentum.

Wait, the question is about the lowest possible energy. So the photon should be the one that allows the smallest possible energy transition. So I should probably find the minimum energy required to move from the current state to the next state, and then compute the photon's momentum from that.

Wait, but if the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. So the next state would be the first excited state. But the energy levels for a diatomic are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. So the energy levels are given by E = E_vibrational + E_rotational.

The fundamental state is when both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers are at their lowest. So v=0 (vibrational ground state), and J=0 (rotational ground state). The next state would be the one with the lowest possible energy, which could be either v increases by 1 (v=
