Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

Now, the main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The task is to find by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. We're told the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I think means that each region of the photosphere behaves as if it's in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings.

So, the problem is about how the ratio of populations in two energy levels changes with temperature. I remember that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is something like N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the overall temperature is lower (5500 K instead of 6000 K). Let me think about how the ratio N1/N2 changes with T. Let's define the ratio as R = N1/N2. Using the Boltzmann equation, R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). 

So when temperature decreases, what happens to R? The exponential term is exp( (E2-E1)/(k*T) ). Since E2 is higher than E1 (because it's an energy level transition, higher to lower or vice versa?), wait, the transition is between two levels, but the wavelength is 1448 Å. Let me think: that's in the near ultraviolet or perhaps visible. So the photon emitted when transitioning from a higher to lower energy level. So E2 is higher than E1. So E2 - E1 is positive.

So the term (E2 - E1)/(k*T) is positive. Then the exponential is e^positive. So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k*T) becomes smaller because denominator is bigger. So the exponent decreases. So the exponential term is smaller when T increases. Wait, so when T increases, the ratio R = (g1/g2) * e^{(E2-E1)/(kT)} would decrease because the exponential becomes smaller. Because imagine T goes up, the exponent becomes smaller, so e^something smaller is smaller. So R is proportional to e^{(E2-E1)/(kT)}.

Wait, but wait, let's be precise. Let's say the energy difference is delta E = E2 - E1. So when the temperature is higher, delta E/(k*T) is smaller (since T is larger). So the exponent (delta E)/(k*T) is smaller, so e^{(delta E)/(k T)} is smaller. So R, which depends on this, is smaller when T is higher.

So when the star has spots, the overall temperature is 5500 K, which is lower than 6000 K. So when T goes down, the exponent (delta E)/(k T) increases because T is smaller. So e^{(delta E)/(k T)} increases, so R increases. Oh wait, but the problem says that when there are spots (lower T), the ratio R decreases. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait wait, let me get this straight. The question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the ratio is higher without spots (6000 K) than when it's covered with spots (5500 K). But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is higher, the ratio R (N1/N2) would be lower. So if the ratio decreases when the star has spots (lower T), that would mean R is higher when T is higher. Because without spots, T is higher, so R is lower? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me rephrase. The ratio R is N1/N2. When T increases, does R increase or decrease? Let's suppose T increases. The exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller. e^{something smaller} is smaller. So R is smaller when T is higher.

Wait, so higher T leads to lower R. Lower T leads to higher R.

But in the problem,
