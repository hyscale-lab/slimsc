Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Michael reaction and some related organic reactions. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let me try to think this through step by step.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each involves a Michael addition reaction. I need to figure out the reactants and products for each, then match them with the options given.

Starting with part A: the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound (the Michael acceptor) by an enolate or enol.

In the Michael addition, the enolate acts as the nucleophile. Dimethyl malonate is a good source of an enolate because it's a diethyl malonate derivative. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it deprotonates to form an enolate ion. The enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Looking at the other reactant, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=C(p-Tol)CO2Me, where the double bond is between C2 and C3. Wait, actually, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO2Me, but with the substituent on the third carbon? Hmm, maybe it's CH2-C-(p-Tol)=CH-CO2Me? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon, which is the same as the alpha position? Or wait, perhaps it's more accurately CH2=CH-CO2Me, but the substituent is at the 3-position—wait, that might not be right. Maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH- with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)propenoate. So the structure would be CH2-CH(p-Tol)-CO2Me, but in the (E) configuration, meaning the p-tolyl and CO2Me groups are on opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it:

The acrylate is CH₂=CH-CO₂Me. But in (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent is on the third carbon, which would be the same as the alpha position. Wait, no, the alpha carbon is adjacent to the carbonyl. So in CH₂=CH-CO₂Me, the carbonyl is at position 3, and the double bond is between C2 and C3. So if the substituent is on the third carbon, which is already the carbonyl, that can't be. Oh wait, maybe
