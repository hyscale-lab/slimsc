Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about particle physics and decay modes of a boson. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ_f f(y) ψ̄_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on the exact notation, but I think this is describing a Yukawa interaction. Typically, Yukawa couplings involve terms like ψ X ψ, where ψ is a fermion field and X is a scalar boson field. So this looks like X is interacting with fermion fields.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question asks about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to consider which fermions the X boson can decay into, considering their masses.

First, I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions (like fermion-antifermion), the mass of the fermion must be less than half the mass of the boson. Because in the rest frame of the boson, the energy available to each fermion must be at least equal to their rest mass energy. So m_fermion * 2 ≤ m_X.

So m_X is 6 GeV. So each fermion must have mass less than 3 GeV because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. Because if the fermion's mass is more than 3 GeV, the boson can't produce that pair.

Wait, but wait. I think the actual condition is that each fermion's mass must be less than or equal to m_X / 2. Because if the fermion's mass is exactly 3 GeV, then each would get 3 GeV each, and that's the threshold. So any fermion with mass less than or equal is allowed.

Now, I need to list all the known elementary particles with mass below or equal to 3 GeV. Let's think about the fermions in the Standard Model.

Fermions include quarks (like up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top), leptons (like electrons, muons, taus, neutrinos), and their antiparticles.

Wait, but wait again. The Lagrangian given in the problem is written with ψ_f, which probably represents a set of fermions. The term includes ψ_f(y) and ψ̄_f(y), so X can decay into any of the fermions that are in this term.

But wait, maybe the exact form of the Lagrangian isn't crucial for the decay. The problem is about which fermions X can decay into, so it's about what fermion pairs are allowed kinematically, regardless of whether the interaction term includes them. Because maybe the interaction term is given, but the question is about the possible decays based on mass and energy.

Wait, the Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ_f ψ_f(y) ψ_bar_f(y) (v + X(y)) ... Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me parse the term again. It's written as -λ_f f(y) ψ̄_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe the f(y) is part of the notation. Or perhaps it's a typo, like maybe it's a product of fields.

Alternatively, perhaps L(y) is the interaction term. But the exact form might not matter as much as the fermions that are involved. So perhaps the interaction term allows X to decay into any of the fermion species that are present in the term.

Wait, but without knowing the exact fermions in ψ_f, maybe we can assume that X can decay into any fermion as long as the mass condition is satisfied. Because the problem gives the Lagrangian as an interaction term, implying that X couples to a variety of fermions, perhaps.

So, let's list all known fermions with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Quarks:
- Up (u): mass about 2.2 MeV. Way below 3 GeV.
- Down (d): similar, around 4-5 MeV.
- Strange (s): around 95-100 MeV.
- Charm (c): about 1.2-1.5 GeV.
- Bottom (b): around 4.1-4.7 GeV. Oh wait, that's over 3 GeV. So can't decay into b quarks because 4.1 GeV is more than 3 GeV. So b quarks are out.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): 0.511 MeV.
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
