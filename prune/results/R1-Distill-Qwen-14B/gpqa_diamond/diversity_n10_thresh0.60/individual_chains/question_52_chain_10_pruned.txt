Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K.

The main point of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, levels 1 and 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. They're asking by what factor the ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Ã…, and the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The equation relates the ratio of populations of two energy levels to the temperature and their respective energies. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, but in this case, the ratio of n1/n2 is given to decrease when spots are present. So when spots are present, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K), and that affects the ratio.

Let me think. Without spots, Teff is 6000 K. With 40% spots, Teff is 5500 K. So when the spots are present, the photosphere's average temperature is lower.

But wait, the spots themselves are cooler regions on the star. So when spots are present, part of the surface is cooler, but the entire photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K. So we model the whole star as having T=5500 K when spots are present.

Wait no, no. The problem says when the surface isn't covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the star's average
