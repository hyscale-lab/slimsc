Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem is about a star with similar radius to the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, the spots cause brightness variations that look like an exoplanet transit. The question is asking what the radius of a planet (Rpl) would need to be relative to the star's radius (Rstar) to produce the same brightness change.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The same principle applies here—the spots modulate the star's brightness as they rotate into and out of view.

Wait, but in this case, the spots are causing a variation, not a planet. So the observed signal is similar to a planet transit. So we need to find what planet radius would cause the same change in brightness as the spot-induced variation.

Let me think about the brightness variation due to the spots. The star's brightness without spots is based on its total surface area and temperature. When spots are present, the brightness drops because the spots are cooler.

The filling factor is 20%, so the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. Wait, the star is a sphere, so each hemisphere is half the surface. So if one hemisphere is 20% covered, that's 20% of half the surface, but wait, wait—no, the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface covered by spots. Because the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh wait, no, no. Wait, actually, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered. So if it's one hemisphere with 20% coverage, then the total area covered is 0.2 * (π R^2), because a hemisphere is half the sphere.

Wait, no, I think the fill factor is the fraction of the surface that's covered. So if a hemisphere has 20% coverage, then the total area covered is 0.2 * (surface area of the hemisphere). Wait, no, this is confusing. Let me clarify.

The star is a sphere, surface area 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR². The filling factor is 20%, so the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. So area covered is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, no, the way it's phrased: "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So I think that the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere) = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Alternatively, maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface covered by spots. But the problem says only one hemisphere is spotty. So perhaps the total area covered is 0.2 * (surface area of the star). Hmm, no, because the spots are on one hemisphere. So the area covered by the spots is 0.2 times the area of that one hemisphere.

Wait, maybe I should think of the filling factor as the fraction of the star's disk (as seen from Earth) that is covered by spots. So if the filling factor is 20%, then the area of spots is 0.2 times the area of the star's disk. Because that's how filling factors are usually presented—like in sunspots, the fraction of the solar disk covered.

So, probably, the area of the spots is 0.2 * π R², since the star's disk is a circle with area π R² (where R is radius). Wait, no, wait—if the star's radius is R, its surface area is 4πR². But when viewed from Earth, it's a disk of area π R². So, the filling factor is the fraction of that disk covered by spots. So, in this case, the area of the spots is 0.2 * π R².

Wait, but the problem says that "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So, if the entire star is a sphere, and one hemisphere is 20% covered, then the total area of spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R². Because each hemisphere is half the surface area, so 2π R².

Wait, now I'm confused. Let me think again. The star's surface area is 4π R². One hemisphere is 2π R². If the filling factor is 20% for that hemisphere, then the area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But if the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, that would be 0.2 *4π R² = 0.8 π R². But the way the question is phrased, it's that one hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%, so the spots are only on that hemisphere. So yes, the area is 0.2 times the area of that hemisphere, which is 2π R².

So, area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Now, the area of the star's disk is π R². Wait, no, wait. The star is being observed over time as it rotates, so the disk is the same as the star's radius. So the area of the star's disk (as seen by the observer) is π R².

But wait, the star is a sphere, so when it's viewed edge-on, the disk is a circle of radius R, area π R². So the star's disk area is π R².

But the spots are on a hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the observer will see the spots come into and out of view. So the maximum area of spots that can be seen at any time is 0.4 π R², but that seems more than the star's disk area. Wait, no. Because 0.4 π R² is less than π R² (since 0.4 <1). So that makes sense.

Wait, no, 0.4 π R² is 40% of the disk area. But wait, the star's disk is π R². So 0.4 π R² is 40% of the disk, which is within the 20% filling factor of a hemisphere.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should proceed. So the brightness variation is due to the spots blocking the light. But the spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible side, the star's total brightness is less than when they are not visible.

Wait, no, the spots are dark, so when a spot is on the side visible to us, it appears as a dip in brightness. So the maximum dip occurs when the maximum area of spots is visible.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots come into view as the star rotates. So the amplitude of the brightness variation depends on the difference in brightness between the spotted regions and the rest of the star.

So the star's total brightness without spots is L0 = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

But when spots are present, the total brightness is L = L0 - (area of spots) * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) * (σ / σ) ?

Wait, because the spots are cooler. The flux from the spots would be F_spot = σ T_spot^4, and the flux from the rest is F_rest = σ T_star^4.

So the total flux when spots are visible is F_total = (Area_rest * F_rest + Area_spot * F_spot) / (Area_rest + Area_spot).

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the change in flux.

The change in flux ΔF is the difference between the star without spots and with spots. So when the spots are fully visible, the flux is F = ( (4π R² σ T_star^4) - (Area_spot) (σ T_spot^4 - σ T_star^4) ) / (4π R²) ?

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the fractional change in brightness.

Fractional change ΔF/F0 = (F_with_spots - F_without_spots) / F_without_spots.

F_without_spots = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

F_with_spots = (4π R² - Area_spot) σ Teff^4 + Area_spot σ T_spot^4.

So F_with_spots = 4π R² σ Teff^4 - Area_spot σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

Thus, the fractional change is [ (4π R² σ Teff^4 - Area_spot σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)) - 4π R² σ Teff^4 ] / (4π R² σ Teff^4 )

Simplify numerator: - Area_spot σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) 

So ΔF/F0 = [ - Area_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (4π R² Teff^4 )

But since the spots are cooler, T_spot = Teff - 1000 K. So T_spot = 5000 K.

So Teff is 6000 K, T_spot is 5000 K.

So ΔF/F0 = [ - Area_spot (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / (4π R² *6000^4 )

But the fractional change is negative because the flux decreases when spots are visible.

The amplitude of the variation is the depth of the dip, which would be the absolute value of this ΔF/F0.

So the amplitude A = (Area_spot (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (4π R² *6000^4 )

But wait, Area_spot is the area of the spots as seen from Earth, which is the same as the area of the spots on the surface of the star. So if the filling factor is 20%, the area of spots is 0.2 * (area of the hemisphere) ?

Wait, no, the star's total surface area is 4π R². The hemisphere is 2π R². So if the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, then Area_spot = 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So substituting Area_spot = 0.4 π R²:

A = (0.4 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (4 π R² * 6000^4 )

Simplify:

A = (0.4 * (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (4 * 6000^4 )

Let me compute the numbers.

First, compute 6000^4 and 5000^4.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 *1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 -6.25e14 = (1.296 -0.625) e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

Wait, wait that's wrong. Let me calculate more accurately.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 = 1296, so 1296 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So the difference is 1.296e15 -6.25e14 = (1.296 - 0.625) e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

So plugging back in:

A = (0.4 * 6.71e14) / (4 * 1.296e15 )

Calculate numerator: 0.4 *6.71e14 = 2.684e14.

Denominator: 4 *1.296e15 =5.184e15.

So A = 2.684e14 / 5.184e15 = approximately 0.0518.

So A is about 5.18% approximately.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed brightness variation is due to the spots, which can be confused with a planet transit. We need to find the planet radius Rpl such that the transit depth (when Rpl transits) would be the same amplitude.

The transit depth is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, assuming the star's brightness is dominated by its own light and the planet doesn't emit. So the planet would block (Rpl^2)/(Rstar^2) of the star's light, leading to a fractional change of (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but wait. The transit depth is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, correct. Because the area blocked is π (Rpl)^2, and the star's area is π (Rstar)^2, so the ratio is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So for the transit depth to be the same as the spot-induced variation, which is about 0.0518 or 5.18%, we set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = A = 0.0518.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because in the options given, the highest option is 0.39 and the others are lower. Hmm.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the area of the spots. Let me re-examine the earlier steps.

The question says: one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. Each hemisphere has area 2π R². So the area of the spots is 0.2 *2π R² = 0.4 π R². That part seems correct.

So plugging into the formula, the amplitude A is 0.0518, which is about 5.18%. The planet's transit depth would be (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So (Rpl/Rstar) is sqrt(0.0518) ≈ ~0.2276. So approximately 0.23. But looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~0.32 and option C) ~0.11.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the denominator. Let's recheck.

Wait, the denominator is 4π R² *6000^4.

Wait, but wait, the star's surface area is 4π R². The area of the spots is 0.4 π R², which is 0.1 times the star's surface area (since 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1). So the area of the spots is 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, but when a planet transits, it blocks a fraction (Rpl/Rstar)^2 of the star's light. So if the spot-induced dip is 5.18%, the planet's dip would need to be 5.18% as well. So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276 or 22.76%.

But the options don't have 0.23. The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C)~0.11, D)~0.32.

Hmm, none of the options match 0.23. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere. Let me try that possibility.

If the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, then Area_spot = 0.2 *4 π R² = 0.8 π R².

So then the amplitude A would be:

A = (0.8 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (4 pi R² *6000^4 )

Simplify: (0.8 * (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (4 *6000^4 )

Compute the numbers again.

6000^4 = 1.296e15, 5000^4=6.25e14.

Difference is 0.671e15.

So 0.8 *0.671e15 = 5.368e14.

Denominator:4*1.296e15=5.184e15.

So A=5.368e14/5.184e15 ≈ 0.1035, or about 10.35%.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035)= ~0.3217, which is approximately 0.32. That matches option D.

Ah, so I think I initially misapplied the filling factor. The problem says that one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the spots are covering 20% of that hemisphere, which is 20% of 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but now I'm confused because with this calculation, when taking the entire star's surface, I get a higher amplitude. So perhaps the initial approach was correct, but the problem is that the star's brightness variation is only when the hemisphere is facing us. So when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view. So the maximum area of spots visible is 0.4 π R², but the star's disk (as seen from Earth) is π R².

Wait a minute, that's another point. When the star is viewed from Earth, we see a disk of area π R². The spots are on a hemisphere, which is the far side when the star is not rotated. So when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view. So the maximum area of spots that can be seen is not 0.4 π R², but only the part that is on the near side.

Wait, no. The star's rotation means that the spots on the hemisphere (either the near side or the far side) will come into view. But from our perspective, the hemisphere that's facing us will have a certain area of spots.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the star as being observed edge-on, so as it rotates, the spots on the near side (the hemisphere facing us) will come into view. So the area of the spots that we can see at any time is the area of the spots on the near side.

But the initial problem states that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the entire hemisphere has 20% coverage. So when that hemisphere is facing us, we can see all the spots on that hemisphere. So the area of the spots as seen from Earth is 20% of the hemisphere's area, which is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But the star's disk is π R², so the spots cover 0.4 / π R² = 40% of the disk? Wait, no, the disk's area is π R², so 0.4 π R² is 40% of the disk. So when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 40% of the star's disk. But wait, that would cause a dip of more than 40% of the star's light, which is a large dip. That doesn't make sense because the star's brightness would drop a lot.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from the definition of filling factor. Let me think again.

The filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface (as viewed from Earth) that is covered by spots. So if the entire hemisphere is covered with 20% filling factor, then the area of the spots as seen from Earth is 0.2 times the area of the star's disk.

Because the star's disk is π R², the area of spots is 0.2 * π R².

Ah, that makes more sense. So then Area_spot = 0.2 * π R².

So let's recalculate A with this.

So A = (0.2 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (4 π R² *6000^4 )

Simplify:

A = (0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (4 *6000^4 )

Compute the numerator and denominator.

6000^4 is 1.296e15, 5000^4 is 6.25e14.

Difference is 0.671e15.

So numerator:0.2 * 0.671e15 = 1.342e14.

Denominator:4 *1.296e15 =5.184e15.

A = 1.342e14 /5.184e15 = approx 0.02587, or 2.587%.

So the amplitude is about 2.587%.

Then, the planet's transit depth would have to be the same, so (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.02587 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.02587) ≈ 0.1608 or about 16%.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.11 and option D is ~0.32. So 16% is not in the options. Hmm.

But perhaps I'm still miscalculating. Let me think about the problem again. The star is rotating, so the spots come into view, leading to a dip as they cover part of the star's disk.

But the problem says that the brightness variation is due to the spots on one hemisphere. So the maximum dip occurs when the hemisphere with spots is fully facing us, and the spots cover a certain area.

Wait, but if the star is a sphere, the maximum area of spots that can be visible is the area of the hemisphere. But the problem says that one hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%—so the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere.

Wait, but the star's disk is a circle, so the area of the disk is π R². The hemisphere is a spherical cap of area 2π R². So when the hemisphere is facing us, the area of the spots that we see is 20% of that hemisphere's area, which is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the area of the spots as seen from Earth is 0.4 π R².

The star's disk is π R², so the spots cover 0.4 π R² / π R² = 40% of the disk. So when the hemisphere is facing us, 40% of the star's disk is covered by spots.

That's a big coverage, but let's proceed.

So the amplitude A is (Area_spot * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (4π R² Teff^4 )

Wait, wait, no. The formula for the fractional change when the spots are visible is:

A = (Area_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (4 π R² Teff^4 )

Because the spots are cooler, so each spot contributes less flux. So the total flux when the spots are visible is F = F0 - (Area_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (4 π R²), divided by F0.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute it as (F0 - F_spotted) / F0.

F0 = 4 π R² σ Teff^4.

F_spotted = (4 π R² - Area_spot) σ Teff^4 + Area_spot σ T_spot^4.

So F_spotted = 4 π R² σ Teff^4 - Area_spot σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

So the change is ΔF = F0 - F_spotted = Area_spot σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

Thus, the fractional change is ΔF/F0 = (Area_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (4 π R² Teff^4 )

So plugging in the numbers:

Area_spot = 0.4 π R².

Teff = 6000 K, T_spot =5000 K.

So,

ΔF/F0 = (0.4 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (4 π R² *6000^4 )

Simplify:

0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (4 *6000^4 )

Compute the numbers:

6000^4 = 1.296e15, 5000^4 =6.25e14.

Difference is 0.671e15.

So,

ΔF/F0 = 0.4 * 0.671e15 / (4 *1.296e15 )

= (0.2684e15) / (5.184e15 )

= 0.2684 /5.184 ≈ 0.05174.

So the fractional change is about 5.174%.

So the amplitude is about 5.174%.

So the planet's transit depth must be the same, which is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.05174.

Taking the square root, Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But looking at the options, the closest is D) ~0.32 and A) ~0.39, etc. So 0.2275 isn't present. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area of the spots. Let me think again. If the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 20% of 2π R², so 0.2 *2π R² = 0.4 π R². That's correct.

Wait, but what if the star's rotation causes the spots to only cover part of the disk? No, when the hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4 π R² is visible. So the calculation is correct.

So why is the option not present? Let me check the options again.

Options are:
A) ~0.39
B) ~0.07
C) ~0.11
D) ~0.32

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area of spots. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the area of the spots as seen when the hemisphere is viewed, which would be half the star's disk. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the star's disk is π R², and the hemisphere's area is 2π R², but the area of the spots is 0.2 *2π R² =0.4 π R². So when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 0.4 π R², which is 40% of the star's disk (since the disk is π R²). So the maximum dip is 40% of the star's disk, but since the spots are cooler, the dip is not 40% but less.

Wait, but the calculation shows a dip of about 5.17%, which requires a planet with Rpl/Rstar ~0.227. But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Teff^4 - T_spot^4.

Let me compute (6000^4 -5000^4):

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 =6.25e14.

So the difference is 1.296e15 -6.25e14 = 0.671e15 =6.71e14.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 6000^4 -5000^4 more accurately.

6000^4 = (6*10^3)^4 =6^4 *10^12 =1296 *1e12 =1.296e15.

5000^4 =5^4 *1e12=625 *1e12=6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 =1.296e15 -6.25e14 = (1.296 -0.625) e15 = 0.671e15 =6.71e14.

Yes, that's correct.

So the expression is correct.

So the amplitude A is approximately 5.17%.

So the planet's transit depth should be the same, which requires (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the temperature difference is 1000 K in the other direction. The star's Teff is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so T_spot =5000 K. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the planet causing the same amplitude as the spot-induced variation. So the spot-induced dip is 5.17%, so the planet must cause a 5.17% dip.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the area of the spots.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that each hemisphere has a filling factor of 20% of the entire star's surface. So each hemisphere is 20% of the total surface.

Wait, the total surface is 4π R². Each hemisphere is 2π R².

If each hemisphere has a filling factor of 20% of the total surface, then each hemisphere has 0.2 *4π R² =0.8 π R².

But that's impossible because each hemisphere is only 2π R². So 0.8 π R² is less than that, so it's possible.

Wait, but the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So perhaps the filling factor refers to the entire star's surface. So the entire star's surface has 20% spots, but they are all on one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 *4π R² =0.8 π R².

But that would mean that the hemisphere where the spots are located has 0.8 π R² spots, but the hemisphere's area is 2π R², so the filling factor on that hemisphere is 0.8 pi R² /2 pi R² =40% (0.8 /2=0.4=40%). But the problem says the filling factor is 20%, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere's area, which is 0.2 *2 pi R²=0.4 pi R².

So that brings us back to the earlier calculation where the amplitude is about 5.17%, leading to a planet radius of ~0.227 Rstar. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the phase curve effect. Because the star is rotating, the spots will only be visible when that hemisphere is facing us. So the brightness variation would be periodic, with the maximum dip when the spotty hemisphere is fully facing us.

But in that case, the dip would be the same as if the entire 0.4 pi R² spots are blocking the light. So the earlier calculation holds.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots on the hemisphere and how that affects the observed light curve. But I'm not seeing the mistake in the math.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star emits more flux when the spots are on the far side, so the minimum brightness is when the spots are on the near side. But perhaps I should calculate the change in flux when the spots are on the far side and when they are on the near side.

Wait, when the spots are on the far side, the star's brightness is normal (F0). When the spots are on the near side, the brightness is F0 - (F_spot - F_rest) * Area_spot.

So the amplitude is (F0 - F_spotted)/F0 = [ (F0 - (F0 - A (F_spot - F_rest)) ) ] / F0

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think of it as: when the spots are on the near side, the flux is F = F0 - (Area_spot) * (F_spot - F_rest) / (Area_total).

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to calculate the fractional change as (F_spotted - F0)/F0.

F_spotted = F0 - (Area_spot) * (F_spot - F_rest) 

Since F_spot < F_rest.

So F_spotted = F0 - Area_spot (F_spot - F_rest)

The fractional change is (F_spotted - F0)/F0 = [ - Area_spot (F_spot - F_rest) ] / F0

= [ Area_spot (F_rest - F_spot) ] / F0.

Which is the same as earlier.

Now, F_rest is the flux per unit area of the rest of the star, which is sigma Teff^4.

F_spot is sigma T_spot^4.

So the formula is correct.

In any case, based on the calculations, the amplitude is about 5.17%, which would require a planet with Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is because the spots are causing a variation in the light curve, but the planet would cause a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2, which is the same as the amplitude of the spot-induced variation.

So if the spot-induced variation amplitude is A = 5.17%, then the planet's (Rpl/Rstar)^2 =0.0517 → Rpl/Rstar ≈0.227.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I should look for the answer in the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option C) ~0.11. Because sqrt(0.0121) is 0.11, which would be an amplitude of about 1.21%.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the area of the spots. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't considering the entire area of the spots but just the portion that is on the near side as the star rotates. Wait, but when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view, so the entire spot area is visible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is not just the dip when the spots are visible but also when they are not. So the total variation would be between F0 and F_spotted.

Wait, but the problem states that the photometric time-series will show periodic variations due to rotational modulation. So the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

Wait, no, the star's brightness without spots is F0. When the spots are visible, it's F_spotted. The amplitude is the difference between F0 and F_spotted, divided by F0, which is what I calculated.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is comparing the area of the planet to the area of the spots. So the planet's area must be equal to the area of the spots to cause the same dip. But that would be (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.4 pi R² / (4 pi R²) ) = 0.4 /4 = 0.1 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316, which is option D.

Wait, that's an alternative approach. Let me think.

If the spots cause a dip of 0.4 pi R² /4 pi R² =0.1 (10% of the star's area), then the planet would need to block 10% of the area, so (Rpl/Rstar)^2 =0.1 → Rpl/Rstar= ~0.316. So option D is ~0.32.

But in this case, the calculation was based on area, not considering the temperature difference. So perhaps the problem is considering the area of the spots, not the flux difference due to temperature.

Wait, but the problem states that the spots are cooler, leading to a lower flux. So the dip is not just due to the area but also the temperature difference.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of another angle.

When the star is not spotted, the planet's transit would block a fraction of the star's light. The amplitude of the transit is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

In the case of the spots, the amplitude is the fractional change in flux due to the spots being visible. So the problem says that the observed flux variation is similar to the planet's transit.

So perhaps the spot-induced amplitude is (Area_spot / Area_star) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

Which is (0.4 pi R²) / (4 pi R²) ) * (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4

Simplify: 0.4/4 * (0.671e15)/(1.296e15) → 0.1 * (0.671/1.296) ≈ 0.1 *0.5176= 0.05176.

So the amplitude is ~5.176%, which is the same as before.

So the planet's transit depth must be 5.176%, so (Rpl/Rstar)^2=0.05176 → Rpl/Rstar≈0.2275.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the spots cause a change in brightness that's equivalent to the planet's transit, and the answer is the Rpl/Rstar of around 0.23.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the starspots are on the hemisphere, but when the star rotates, only a part of the spots come into view, leading to a smaller effective area.

Wait, no. When the star is rotating, the hemisphere with spots will be facing us, so the entire area of the spots on that hemisphere will be visible. So the maximum dip is when the hemisphere is fully visible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's effective temperature is given, and the spots are cooler, but the star's overall flux isn't just the sum of the spotted and unspotted areas. Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness is calculated as the sum of the areas multiplied by their respective fluxes.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be simpler. The amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is the same as the amplitude due to the planet. So the area of the spots is equal to the area of the planet, leading to (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = Area_spot / Area_star.

Wait, but in that case, the area of the spots is 0.4 pi R², and the area of the star is 4 pi R². So (0.4 pi R²)/(4 pi R²) = 0.1 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1)= ~0.316, which is option D.

But this ignores the temperature difference, which would change the flux. So perhaps the intended approach is to equate the area, not the flux.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be that the area of the planet must be the same as the area of the spots to produce the same dip, regardless of temperature.

In that case, the planet's area is 0.4 pi R².

Wait, but the star's disk area is pi R². So the spots cover 0.4 pi R², which is 40% of the disk. So (Rpl^2)/(Rstar^2) =0.4 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.4)=~0.632, which isn't an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up. Let me try to find another approach.

The problem states that the brightness variation due to the star's spots can be confused with a planet transit. The question is asking what planet radius would cause the same amplitude in the light curve.

The amplitude caused by the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

The amplitude caused by the spots is:

A = (Area_spot / Area_star) * (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 )

Because each spot contributes less flux. So,

A = (0.2 *2 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Simplify:

(0.4 π R²)/(4 π R²) ) = 0.1.

(5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So,

A = 0.1 * (1 - 0.4823) = 0.1 *0.5177=0.05177 or 5.177%.

So, the planet's amplitude is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 =0.05177 → Rpl/Rstar≈0.2275.

But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on one hemisphere, and when the star rotates, only a small portion is visible at any time, leading to a smaller amplitude. But that doesn't make sense because as the star rotates, the entire hemisphere comes into view, leading to maximum dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's rotation period is such that only a part of the spots come into view at any given time, but the problem states that the entire hemisphere is covered, so when it's facing us, all the spots are visible.

I'm stuck. Given the options, the closest to 0.227 is not present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area of the spots.

Wait, wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 *4 pi R²= 0.8 pi R².

So then,

A = (0.8 pi R² (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (4 pi R² *6000^4 )

= (0.8 * (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (4 *6000^4 )

Which gives:

0.8 * 6.71e14 =5.368e14.

Denominator:4 *1.296e15=5.184e15.

A=5.368e14 /5.184e15 ≈0.1035.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2=0.1035 → Rpl/Rstar≈0.3217. That's option D.

So perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. So the area of the spots is 0.2 *4 pi R²=0.8 pi R².

But the problem states that "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor refers to the hemisphere, not the entire star.

Hmm. This is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have the filling factor as a percentage of the star's surface, not the hemisphere. So in that case, the area of spots is 0.2 *4 pi R²=0.8 pi R².

Which gives the amplitude as 0.1035, requiring Rpl/Rstar≈0.3217, option D.

Given that, and considering that the options don't have 0.23, perhaps the intended answer is D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:  
   - Radius \( R_{\text{star}} \) is equal to the Sun's radius.  
   - Effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).  
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.  

2. **Spot Properties**:  
   - Spots are cooler, with \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 \, \text{K} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).  
   - The filling factor of 20% refers to the area of the hemisphere covered by spots.  

3. **Objective**:  
   - Find the radius \( R_{\text{pl}} \) of an exoplanet such that its transit causes the same fractional brightness variation (amplitude) as the spotted hemisphere.

---

### Analysis:
1. **Fractional Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:  
   The amplitude of the brightness variation is determined by the difference in flux between the spotted and unspotted regions. The formula for the amplitude \( A \) is:  
   \[
   A = \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{spot}} \cdot (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4)}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot T_{\text{eff}}^4}
   \]  
   - The area of the star's surface is \( 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).  
   - The area of the spots on one hemisphere is \( 0.2 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).  

   Substituting values:  
   \[
   A = \frac{0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot (6000^4 - 5000^4)}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot 6000^4}
   \]  
   Simplify:  
   \[
   A = \frac{0.4 \cdot (6000^4 - 5000^4)}{4 \cdot 6000^4}
   \]  

   Compute \( 6000^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15} \) and \( 5000^4 = 6.25 \times 10^{14} \):  
   \[
   6000^4 - 5000^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15} - 6.25 \times 10^{14} = 6.71 \times 10^{14}
   \]  
   \[
   A = \frac{0.4 \cdot 6.71 \times 10^{14}}{4 \cdot 1.296 \times 10^{15}} = \frac{2.684 \times 10^{14}}{5.184 \times 10^{15}} \approx 0.0518
   \]  
   The amplitude is approximately \( 5.18\% \).

2. **Exoplanet Transit Depth**:  
   The transit depth is given by:  
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = A
   \]  
   Substituting \( A = 0.0518 \):  
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.0518} \approx 0.227
   \]  

3. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated value \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.227 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the filling factor is interpreted as 20% of the entire star's surface (not just the hemisphere), the area of the spots becomes \( 0.2 \cdot 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.8 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \). Recomputing the amplitude with this interpretation:  
   \[
   A = \frac{0.8 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot (6000^4 - 5000^4)}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot 6000^4}
   \]  
   Simplify:  
   \[
   A = \frac{0.8 \cdot 6.71 \times 10^{14}}{4 \cdot 1.296 \times 10^{15}} = \frac{5.368 \times 10^{14}}{5.184 \times 10^{15}} \approx 0.1035
   \]  
   The amplitude is approximately \( 10.35\% \).  

   For the planet:  
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035 \implies \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.321
   \]  

   This matches **Option D (~0.32)**.

---

### Conclusion:
The most consistent interpretation of the problem, given the options, is that the filling factor refers to the entire star's surface. Thus, the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately **0.32**.
