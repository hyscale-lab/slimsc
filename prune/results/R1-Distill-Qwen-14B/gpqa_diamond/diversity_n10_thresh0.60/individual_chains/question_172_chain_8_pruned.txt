Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. Since the problem states that the photospheres are in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), I can apply the Boltzmann equation here.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ), right? Where n_i and n_j are the number densities of the two energy levels, g_i and g_j are their statistical weights, E is the energy, k_B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, but wait: the way it's worded, the energy levels are twice as excited. Oh, maybe I should clarify. Oh, I think it means the number of atoms in the excited state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2 for the same energy level.

Wait, wait. The problem says the iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So for the same energy level, the number in that level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, n1 = 2 * n2. Or perhaps n1/n2 = 2.

But wait, I think the actual ratio is n1/n2 = 2. Because for the same level. So the ratio of the populations is 2.

But wait, I should make sure. Let me re-read the question. It says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So the excitation level (population) is twice as high for star_1 in that energy level. So n1 = 2n2. So n1/n2 = 2.

Now, the energy difference between the levels is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but wait, the equation uses (E_i - E_j), but which one is higher? Oh, because if it's an excitation, usually the higher energy level is the excited state. So probably E_i is the higher energy, E_j is the lower.

Now, the problem is to find the relation between T1 and T2. The options involve equations with ln(2) equal to some function of T1 and T2.

So putting it into the Boltzmann equation, let's set up the ratio. Let me denote the energy levels for each star.

For star_1: (n_i1)/(n_j1) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) )

For star_2: (n_i2)/(n_j2) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) )

Assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars, since they are iron atoms in the same energy levels. So g_i/g_j is a constant and cancels out when taking the ratio of the two equations.

So, take the ratio of n_i1/n_j1 divided by n_i2/n_j2 = (n_i1/n_j1) / (n_i2/n_j2) = [ (g_i/g_j exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) / (g_i/g_j exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( (ΔE/(k_B)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because when you divide the exponents, it's exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me think again. The exponents in the two cases are -
