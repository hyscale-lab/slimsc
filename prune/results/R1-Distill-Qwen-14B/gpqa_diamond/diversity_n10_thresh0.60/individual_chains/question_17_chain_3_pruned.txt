Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like calcium. The problem gives me the formation constant, K_ca-edta, which is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, what's the formation constant again? Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where the metal ion and EDTA form the complex. So for the reaction Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But wait, the concentration given is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let me denote that as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Since the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be zero, and as the complex forms, they take up those ions. 

But wait, in reality, some of the Ca²+ and EDTA are free. So the solution is in equilibrium. So, the formation constant equation should be Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But I don't know [EDTA^4-], right? Hmm, but maybe I can make some assumptions. Because the formation constant is so large (5x10^10), which means the reaction heavily favors the formation of the complex. So, almost all the Ca²+ and EDTA would be tied up in the complex. 

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions. So, I think the idea is that the amount of free Ca²+ is very small because most of it is bound in the complex. So, perhaps I can set up an expression where [Ca²+] is x and [EDTA^4-] is also x, because for each mole of
