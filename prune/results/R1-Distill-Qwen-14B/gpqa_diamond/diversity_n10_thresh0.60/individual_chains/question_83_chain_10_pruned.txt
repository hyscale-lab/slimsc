Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, this diluted solution is titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I think I need to find the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution. Then, determine how much NaOH is added at 25% titration and at equivalence. From there, I can calculate the pH at each point.

Starting with the initial concentration: 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20.00 cm³ of water, the volume doubles. So the new concentration should be half of 0.05 M, which is 0.025 M. Let me check: M1V1 = M2V2. Oh yeah, 0.05 * 20 = M2 * 40. So M2 = (0.05 *20)/40 = 0.025 M. Got that.

Now, the titration with NaOH. The reaction is acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with NaOH to form acetate (CH3COO^-) and water. The reaction equation is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. Volume is 40 cm³ (20+20), which is 0.04 L. So moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

Wait, wait. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, right? So 20 cm³ *0.05 M is 0.001 moles initially. Then diluted to 40 cm³, so same moles? Yes, because dilution doesn't change the number of moles, only the concentration. So yes, moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol.

So for equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume of NaOH needed at equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

But wait, the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Now, let's tackle the pH at 25% titration. At this point, not all the acetic acid has been neutralized. Some has been converted to acetate.

The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added (which is 2.5 cm³ *0.1 M) is 0.0025 L *0.1 = 0.00025 mol. So NaOH will react with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. So moles of CH3COOH remaining = 0.001 -0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO^- formed = 0.00025 mol.

The total volume of the solution is the initial 40 cm³ plus the 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L. 

So concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

First, find pKa. Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5-0.267 = 4.733. Wait, wait. Wait, pKa is -log10(1.85e-5) → 1.85e-5 is 5 orders of magnitude, so 5. Hmmm, 1.85 is between 1.78 (10^-0.73) and 1.99 (10^-0.7). Let me think. Log(1.85) is approximately 0.267. So pKa = 5 - 0.267 = 4.733. So pKa ≈4.733.

Now, [A^-]/[HA] = (
