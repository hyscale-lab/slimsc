Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux ratio problem. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about what happens if the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops suddenly. I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that produce energy through proton-proton interactions. The pp-III branch is one part of that chain. So if that stops, the other parts, like pp-I and pp-II, are still going?

But wait, the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So only the pp-III branch is stopped. Hmm, I need to think about what the pp-III branch contributes in terms of neutrinos.

Solar neutrinos are mainly produced by two processes: the proton-proton (pp) chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle. Each of these produces different types of neutrinos at different energies.

The pp chain produces neutrinos at lower energies, around 0.5 MeV. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, like around 1 MeV or more. But wait, the pp-III branch is a specific part of the pp chain. Let me recall: the pp chain has several branches. The main pp-I branch produces a positron and two neutrinos. The pp-II and pp-III branches might produce different particles and maybe different neutrino energies.

Wait, more specifically, the pp chain has different branches based on the number of protons and the reactions they undergo. The pp-I branch is the dominant one, producing 78% of the Sun's energy. The
