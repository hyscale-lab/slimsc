Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and then match them with the options provided.

First, let me recall what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction is a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile, usually an enolate, attacks the beta carbon of the conjugated system, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond and forming a new enolate intermediate which then tautomerizes or protonates.

So, let's tackle each part one by one.

Part A: Reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol).

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good enolate precursor. Under basic conditions like NaOEt, I think it would deprotonate to form the enolate. The other component is an alpha-beta unsaturated esterâ€”methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 where the CH2 is attached to p-tolyl?

Wait, no: the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- with the ester. So, 3-(p-tolyl) means the substituent is on the third carbon. So the structure is probably CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-COOCH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=C(C6H4-tolyl)COOCH3. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the structure.

But the point is, the E-configuration means the substituents across the double
