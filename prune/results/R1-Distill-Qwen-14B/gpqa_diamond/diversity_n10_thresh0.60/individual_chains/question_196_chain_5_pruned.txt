Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a particle in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The setup is that it has mass m and maximum amplitude A, and it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. Right, and the speed of light is c, which is a clue that relativity is involved here.

Wait, in a regular, non-relativistic harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is achieved when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². So in non-relativistic case, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is a relativistic case, so I can't just use that.

Relativistically, the energy considerations change. The total energy isn't just kinetic anymore; it includes rest mass energy. Oh right, the total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the energy oscillates between kinetic and potential. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv², it's (gamma - 1)mc². So the total energy would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, but perhaps in this case, the potential energy is analogous to the non-relativistic case.

Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². But when velocities get high, relativistic effects become important. So the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement. Because at maximum amplitude A, the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so all energy is potential. Then, as it moves towards the equilibrium, potential energy converts into kinetic energy.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², right? Because that's the energy stored in the spring at maximum displacement. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA² + mc². Because the rest energy is mc², and the potential energy adds to that.

Wait wait, but in the non-relativistic case, E is (1/2)
