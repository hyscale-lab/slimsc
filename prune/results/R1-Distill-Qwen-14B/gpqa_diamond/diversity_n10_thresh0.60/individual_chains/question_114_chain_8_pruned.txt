Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two different reactions. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A leading to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give possible combinations for A and B, so I need to figure out which reagents fit each step.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And it's reacting with NaCN. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So the cyanide ion would attack the carbonyl carbon. But wait, after the addition, what happens next? Oh right, usually in such additions, the product is a cyanohydrin. The cyanide adds to the carbonyl, and then a proton is added, probably from an acid workup.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that's 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? Wait, wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me count the carbons. Butan-2-one is four carbons, so (CH3)2CO, adding CN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, no. The product would have the same number of carbons as the ketone, I think. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see: butane has four carbons. So the structure is CH2CH2C(OH)(CH3)CN? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the nitrile group on the fourth carbon? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. Wait, no, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH2)2C(OH)(CH3)CN? No, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the product given is butanenitrile, so perhaps the initial ketone is butanone, which is (CH3CH2)CO something. Hmm, wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the product
