Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says I need to calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue corresponding to this eigenvector is +ħ/2. 

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the operator P is often related to angular momentum, maybe spin. Oh right, because muons are spin-1/2 particles, so their spin operator is similar to the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

The given operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So if we have an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, the operator along n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the direction cosine. So the operator P along n = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since n is in the x-z plane, φ must be 0 or π, so cosφ is either 1 or -1, but let's think. Well, in the x-z plane, any direction can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because φ is 0, so the y-component is zero. Wait, no. Wait, actually, in spherical coordinates, the direction in the x-z plane would have φ=0 or φ=π. So the direction vector is ( sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ ). Since φ=0 => direction is x-z plane, so yes, the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator P along n would be P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So substituting, P_n = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z. Because n_y is zero here.

Let me compute P_n:

P_n = sinθ * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]
= (ħ/2) [ [ sinθ * 0 + cosθ *1 , sinθ *1 + cosθ *0 ],
          [ sinθ *1 + cosθ *0 , sinθ *0 + cosθ*(-1) ] ]

Wait, wait, no, I think I got the math wrong. Let me compute each element.

First, P_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by sinθ, it's [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]] multiplied by ħ/2.

P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], multiplied by cosθ and ħ/2,
