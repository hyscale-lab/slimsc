Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a star with certain parameters and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Interesting.

Wait, why does having spots lower the effective temperature? Oh right, because spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when spots cover parts, those areas emit less light, reducing the overall luminosity. But wait, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the star appears dimmer and cooler overall because of the spots.

Now, the main part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the ratio is lower than when there are none. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so it's ratio when no spots divided by ratio when spots are present.

The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range, I think. And the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so
