Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The conditions are ideal pH, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A through D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which forms complexes with metal ions. So Ca-EDTA would be a complex where EDTA binds to calcium ions. The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of this complex.

The formula, I think, would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (or some charge, but that's the general idea). The K for this reaction is given as 5e10, which is a pretty large number, meaning the complex forms almost completely.

The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Since the reaction is at equilibrium, I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in the solution.

Wait, but in this case, the complex is already formed. So, perhaps the dissociation of the complex is what's important here. Let's model it.

The dissociation would be: CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. The K for this is the same as the formation constant but in reverse. So K_dissociation = 1/K_form = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, is that correct? Because formation constant K is [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]). So dissociation would have K = [Ca][EDTA]/[CaEDTA], which is indeed 1/K_form.

So, in this problem, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we can assume that the amount of Ca²+ and EDTA released is x. So, let's
