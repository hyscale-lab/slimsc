Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me read it again carefully.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor, which is a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

So, the options are A to D, each giving a different expression for E.

I remember that conductors have some properties regarding charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, the total charge on it is zero. But when you place a charge inside the cavity, something happens. I think the charges inside the conductor will redistribute. Wait, when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces charges on the inner surface and the outer surface.

Right, the inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q because the conductor is neutral overall. Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance it out. Because the conductor was initially neutral, so inner surface gets -q, outer +q.

Wait, but wait. The conductor is uncharged, so the net charge is zero. The charge +q in the cavity would cause the inner surface of the conductor to have -q, making the outer surface have +q. So the conductor's total charge is +q (outer) + (-q) (inner) = 0, which matches the initial condition.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So, when considering the electric field outside a conductor, I think it's determined by the total charge enclosed within the conductor. Because, for a spherical conductor, the electric field outside depends only on the total charge.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor itself has a net charge of zero. Wait no, the conductor's total charge is zero because the initial conductor was uncharged. But when we add +q inside the cavity, the inner surface gets -q, and the outer surface +q. So the conductor's total charge
