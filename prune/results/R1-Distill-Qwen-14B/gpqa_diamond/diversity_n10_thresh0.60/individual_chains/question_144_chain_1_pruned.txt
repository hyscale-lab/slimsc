Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think through it.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

Wait, mesons are bosons, right? And when they decay, their mean lifetime or the mean distance they travel before decaying depends on their lifetime. Oh right, the mean decay length is usually calculated using the formula: L = γ * c * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame).

But wait, how do I get τ? Oh, right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle says that Γ ≈ ħ/τ, so τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). But wait, Γ is the energy width, so I need to be careful with units.

So first, let's compute the proper lifetime τ. Γ is given as 320 MeV. Since ħ has units of GeV·s, I think Γ in GeV needs to be converted. Let me think, Γ is 320 MeV, so that's 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / (Γ c²?), wait no, perhaps it's
