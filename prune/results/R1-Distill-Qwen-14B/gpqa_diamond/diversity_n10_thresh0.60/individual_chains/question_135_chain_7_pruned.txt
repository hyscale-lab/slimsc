Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by a Lagrangian term: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm not entirely sure I read that correctly. Oh wait, no, the actual Lagrangian is probably written as something like L = -λ f ψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y), maybe? Because usually, terms in the Lagrangian describe interactions between fields. Oh, maybe the term is -λ f X ψ_f^† ψ_f, which would indicate that the boson X couples to the fermion ψ_f with strength λ f, and the Yukawa coupling is involved.

But the main point is, the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and we're supposed to find out the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Wait, kinematically allowed decay means that the decay products' rest masses must be less than the mass of X, right? So X can decay into particles whose combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Looking at the options, all of them are pairs of particles. Each option lists different possible decay channels.

In the Lagrangian, the interaction is between X and ψ_f. So the fermion ψ_f is the one that X can decay into. So what's the fermion here? The notation is a bit confusing. The term is λ f, which is probably a Yukawa coupling. So the fermion ψ_f must be a Dirac fermion, like a quark or lepton.

But wait, the interaction term is written as -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh wait, maybe that's a typo, and the actual term is like -λ X ψ_f^† ψ_f, but including the vacuum expectation value (vev) υ would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's a Yukawa coupling term of the form X ψ_f ψ_f, which would imply that X can decay into two fermions of type ψ_f.

So if X can decay into
