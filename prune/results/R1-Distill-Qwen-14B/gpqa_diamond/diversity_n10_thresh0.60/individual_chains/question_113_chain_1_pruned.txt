Okay, so I've got this question here about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the question says the compound is prepared and they used FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Wait, I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Or maybe it's an amine? But wait, the other peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹.

So, 1700 is a strong peak. That could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 is a bit lower. Oh, wait, maybe that's a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or a ketone with some conjugation? Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like C=C. Because 1650 is around where C=C in aromatic rings absorb. But wait, the FTIR also showed a broad peak, so maybe it's a carbonyl and some conjugated group.

Looking at the NMR next. The 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl H are the protons on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond, probably
