Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. Hmm. The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. I remember that the RV method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key information here is the shift in the spectral lines: planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Wait, what determines the size of the Doppler shift? I think it's related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K) depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. The formula I recall is something like K = (v) = (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) )) ) ) * (something... maybe a cube root? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.)

Wait, but since both stars have the same mass (like the Sun) and the planets have similar masses (Neptune), maybe the sin i is the same for both since the orbits are circular, so inclination is 90 degrees, but wait, sin90 is 1, so that's same for both. So the shifts are due to the velocity semi-amplitude K.

So the formula for K is K = [ (27 * pi * G) / (8 c^3 ) ]^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) (P)^(1/3) ) ) ?

Wait, maybe I should think of the relation between K and the orbital period P. Let me try to write the correct formula. I think K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2 pi)) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2)) )

But since e is zero (circular orbits), that last term is
