Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question has three parts, each involving a Michael addition. I need to figure out the reactants and products for each, then match them with the options provided.

First, let's recap what the Michael addition is. The Michael reaction is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile (like an enolate) attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The result is a new carbon-carbon bond formation, usually adding a substituent to the alpha-beta unsaturated system.

The problem has three separate reactions labeled A, B, and C. I'll tackle each one.

Starting with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. It's a diethyl ester of malonic acid, so when deprotonated, it can form an enolate. Since the reaction is in NaOEt (a strong base), the malonate will deprotonate to form an enolate ion. The enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which in this case is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate structure: It's an acrylate with the substituents on the double bond. The structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituents on the double bond? Wait, no. Wait, wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-p-tolyl would be on the third carbon? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the CH2? No, wait, maybe it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOR? No, wait, wait. Let me think: For (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. The third carbon (carbon 3) is attached to the p-tolyl group. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt.

Wait, so the structure of the acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt. So when the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks, it will add to the beta carbon, which is the CH2 group next to the double bond.

Wait, no. The alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt. So the carbonyl is the COOEt, the alpha is the CH2, beta is the C with the p-tolyl.

Wait, actually, I think I might have this wrong. The structure of 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? No, that
