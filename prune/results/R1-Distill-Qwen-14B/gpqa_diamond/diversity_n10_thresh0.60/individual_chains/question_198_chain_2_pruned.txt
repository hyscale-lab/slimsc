Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with stability constants and all that, but let's try to work through it.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants β1 to β4 are 9, 40, 63, and 16. Hmm, wait, stability constants usually refer to the formation of complexes. So each β is the formation constant for a complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands.

I remember that the stability constant (β) for a complex tells us how much the metal ion is complexed with the ligand. The higher the β, the more stable the complex is. So the species with higher β will dominate if the ligand concentration is sufficient.

In this case, the solution has Co(II) and SCN^- ions. The complexes are presumably Co(SCN)_n^2+ where n is the number of thiocyanate ligands. The problem gives four β values. Wait, but what do these β's correspond to? Let me think. Usually, the first β is for the first ligand, β1 is for the first complex, maybe CoSCN^+, β2 would be for the second complex, like Co(SCN)_2^2-, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, sometimes the stability constants are given in a stepwise manner. So β1 is the constant for adding the first SCN-, β2 for the second, etc. So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n^2+ would be the product of the stepwise β's up to n.

Wait, but in the question, the problem is about dithiocyanato complexes, which are [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. So the complex with two SCN- ligands. So the overall β for this complex would be β1 * β2.

Wait, no, maybe each β is for a different complex. Like, β1 is for Co(SCN)^+, β2 is for Co(SCN)_2^2-, β3 for Co(SCN)_3^3-, and β4 for Co(SCN)_4^4-. I think that's more likely. So each β represents the formation constant for each successive complex.

Wait, no. I think in some contexts, βn is the overall constant for the nth complex, i.e., adding n ligands. So for [Co(SCN)_1]^+, β1 would be 9. For [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β2 is 40. For [Co(SCN)_3]^3+, β3 is 63, and for [Co(SCN)_4]^4- (since Co is +2, adding four SCN^- (each -1) gives Co +4(-1) = -2 charge?), wait that doesn't add up. Wait Co is +2. Each SCN^- is -1. So for n ligands, the charge would be +2 -n. So for n=4, the charge would be +2 -4 = -2.
