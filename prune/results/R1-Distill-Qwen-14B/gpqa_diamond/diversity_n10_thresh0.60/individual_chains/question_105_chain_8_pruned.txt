Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. So, R_star is equal to R_sun, which I remember is approximately 7e5 km or about 1.09 million km? Wait, no, actually, I think the Sun's radius is about 695,700 km. But maybe I don't need the exact number here.

The star has one hemisphere covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%. Filling factor, right, that's the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So 20% of one hemisphere is covered. Wait, but the problem says that one hemisphere is spotty. So the spots are only on one side, not both. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 (filling factor) multiplied by the area of one hemisphere.

Wait, no, the filling factor is for the hemisphere. So the total spotty area is 0.2 times the area of one hemisphere. But how much of the star's total area is a hemisphere? The star is a sphere, so the surface area is 4πR². A hemisphere would be 2πR². So the spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4πR². So the fraction of spots is 0.4πR² /4πR² = 0.1 or 10% of the total surface. But wait, the problem says the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So perhaps the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, which is part of the star's surface. So 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². So 0.4πR² is the area of spots.

But the star's total area is 4πR², so the fraction is 0.4/4 = 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots. Hmm, okay.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spot temperature must be 5000 K, since 6000-10
