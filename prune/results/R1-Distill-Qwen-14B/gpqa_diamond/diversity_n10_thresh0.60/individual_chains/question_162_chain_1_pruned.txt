Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a 2-dimensional metric. Oh right, because it's only involving dx and dy, so we're in two dimensions here.

I remember that when you have a metric in the form ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²), the area element is usually sqrt(g) dx dy, but wait, no, actually, the area element in 2D when using this metric would be sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is just the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy². In this case, both coefficients are the same, 32/(4 - x² - y²), so the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². So the area element dA would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. The metric tensor g has components g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy = same. The cross terms g_xy and g_yx are zero. So the determinant is (g_xx * g_yy) - (g_xy² + ...), but in this case, the cross terms are zero, so det(g) = g_xx * g_yy = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². So the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy, which would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, no, sqrt(det(g)) is the square root of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] squared. So sqrt of that square would be 32/(4 - x² - y²). So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

So to find the total area, I need to integrate this over the region where the metric is defined. But what is the domain of x and y? The denominator is 4 - x² - y², and for the metric to make sense, the denominator can't be zero, so 4 - x² - y² ≠ 0. But also, the denominator must be positive because if it's negative,
