Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that metrics are used to describe the geometry of spacetime, right? And a pseudosphere is a type of solution to Einstein's equations, usually representing a universe with negative curvature.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Oh wait, wait, I think the pseudosphere, also known as the Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, has a specific metric form. Let me recall: the AdS metric in 2D (so a pseudosphere) is usually written in terms of Poincaré coordinates, something like ds² = (r² / (r² - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²) - (r² (x² + y²) / (r² - x² - y²)) dt² + something else for the time part. But this question's metric is only considering the spatial part, maybe?

Wait, looking at the given metric, it's for the spatial part because it's just dx and dy. So the metric for the spatial slices would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, because in the AdS metric, the coefficient is (r²)/(r² - x² - y²), right? So if we compare,
