Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that a density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, in this case, the matrix looks like a mixture of the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states, each with equal probability, right?

Wait, no, actually, the way it's written, it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. So each term is a projector onto the basis states, scaled by 1/2. So this is a classical mixture of the two states, which would make it a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

But wait, no, wait another thought. When you have a density matrix that's a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ with equal probabilities, each occurring with probability 1/2, it's a completely mixed state. But what does that mean geometrically?

I'm trying to remember how density matrices are represented in the Bloch sphere. Oh right, for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a vector in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z), and the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, so let's write
