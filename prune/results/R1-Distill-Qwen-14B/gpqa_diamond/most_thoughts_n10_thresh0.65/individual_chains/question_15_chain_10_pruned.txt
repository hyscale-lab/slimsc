Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. I'm a bit rusty on my exoplanet detection, but let's think this through.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii, but the star with Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. The researchers need to choose which to observe, and they want the one with the higher probability of transiting.

Hmm, transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. But there are other factors too. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is higher if the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But wait, since we already detected them via RV, which method detects planets through Doppler shifts, that tells us that their orbits are at some inclination. RV can detect planets with a range of inclinations, but it's more sensitive to planets whose orbits are edge-on because that's when the Doppler shift is maximum. So maybe the fact that they were detected via RV tells us something about their probabilities.

Wait, but both planets are confirmed via RV, so both have a non-zero inclination, but how does that affect their transit probability? Oh wait, RV doesn't require edge-on orbits, but the transit method does. The RV method can detect
