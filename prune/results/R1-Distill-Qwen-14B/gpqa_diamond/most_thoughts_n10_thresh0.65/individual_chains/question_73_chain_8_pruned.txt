Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics; you need special relativity. 

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options give different possibilities for the relative speed and the total energy.

Let me tackle each part step by step. First, the relative speed. Wait, I think relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as subtracting the two velocities. Oh right, you can't just do v = u - w because that would give something faster than light in some cases. So I remember the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), where u is the velocity of the second object from the first's frame. Wait, is it (u - v) or (v - u)? Let me think. Oh wait, the formula is (u + v)/(1 + (uv/c²)) when they're moving in the same direction, but wait no, actually, that's when adding velocities. Wait, no, wait. Oh no, wait, if the two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), but which one is u and which is v depends on the frame. 

Wait, in this problem, both are moving in the
