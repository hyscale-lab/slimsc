Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, it's about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are different molecular formulas, so I need to match the spectral data to the correct one.

Alright, let's break down each piece of information. First, the FTIR spectrum. The broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 probably indicates an O-H stretch, right? Because O-H like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. The very broad part suggests maybe it's an alcohol because a carboxylic acid O-H is usually broader and stronger, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, or could it be an -OH group in something else like a ketone? No, ketones don't have O-H. So, likely an alcohol or carboxylic acid.

Then, there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, carboxylic acid, or maybe an amide. The 1650 cm^-1 peak is a bit lower than 1700, so maybe that's another carbonyl or an aromatic ring. Wait, wait, what's that? Aromatic rings have C=C stretches around 1450-1600 cm^-1. So 1650 is maybe a conjugated carbonyl? Or perhaps an aromatic ring with substituents. Let me think. For example, a conjugated carbonyl like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone would have a lower wavenumber. Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl near conjugated double bonds.

Wait, the NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means the H's are attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has a double bond, maybe in an alkene or perhaps conjugated to a carbonyl.

Mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a familiar mass. Let me think. The molecular ion for C3H7O would be 45 (since 3*12 +7*1 +16=45). Alternatively, 45 could be a CH3CO+ fragment
