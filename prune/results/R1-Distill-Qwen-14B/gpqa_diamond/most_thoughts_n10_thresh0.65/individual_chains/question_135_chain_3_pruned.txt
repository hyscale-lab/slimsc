Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the decay of a boson X. The question gives me a Lagrangian term and some information about the boson's mass, and I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the Lagrangian is given as L = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh, perhaps it's L(y) = -λ f f-bar X(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y)? Hmm, maybe I'm misreading the indices. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Yukawa-like interaction term. Oh, right, Yukawa coupling typically looks like g ψ ψ X, where X is a scalar boson.

Wait, the given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. Oh, perhaps it's L = -λ f (ψ_f)^dagger ψ_f (v + X) ψ_f? Or maybe the term is actually a Yukawa coupling of the form λ f ψ ψ X, where ψ is a fermion field. Alternatively, maybe it's written as L = -λ f ψ_f X ψ_f where f is a Dirac field? Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the interaction terms: the boson X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs.

Wait, the interaction term would typically be something like λ X ψ ψ, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact form here. But regardless, the key point is that X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. So the decay X → f f-bar is possible if the mass of X is greater than or equal to twice the mass of the fermion f.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to find all fermions where the sum of their masses (each times 2, since you need a pair) is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but wait, in reality, the standard model fermion masses are:

Up-type quarks: top is about 173 GeV, charm is ~1.5
