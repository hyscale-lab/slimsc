Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. The density matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). The options are A to D, each giving a different vector r.

Hmm, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But when you have a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture, so the density matrix is a convex combination of projectors. 

Wait, this ρ looks like a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. Since each term is multiplied by 1/2, it's equally weighted. So ρ is a classical mixture of the two basis states. That means the qubit is in a completely mixed state. 

But how does this relate to the geometrical position? I think I need to remember how density matrices are represented in terms of Bloch vectors. Oh right, the Bloch sphere! For a single qubit, any state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written as:
ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,
where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector). The length of r determines how mixed the state is. A pure state has |r|=1, and a completely mixed state (like this one) has |r|=0.

Let me write out the Pauli matrices:
σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute each term. |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = (I)/2.

Wait, but the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So if ρ is equal to I/2, that means the r·σ term must be zero. Therefore, r must be the zero vector. Because if r is zero, then r·σ is zero, and ρ becomes I/2.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.

But wait, let me double-check. The density matrix for the completely mixed state is indeed I/2. So yes, its Bloch representation is at the origin. So the geometrical position is (0,0,0).


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a classical mixture of the two basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal weight of \(1/2\). This corresponds to a completely mixed state. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\) as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{r \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(r \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\) is the dot product of the Bloch vector \(r\) with the Pauli matrices. The length of the Bloch vector \(|r|\) determines the purity of the state: a pure state has \(|r| = 1\), while a completely mixed state has \(|r| = 0\).

For the given density matrix, it simplifies to:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

which implies that the term \(r \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\) must be zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector \(r\) is the zero vector, \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the completely mixed state being located at the origin in the Bloch sphere representation.

From the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).**

Answer: C
