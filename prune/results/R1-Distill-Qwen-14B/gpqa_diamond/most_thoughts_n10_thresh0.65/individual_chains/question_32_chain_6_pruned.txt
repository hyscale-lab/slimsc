Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so this nucleus must be pretty heavy. The nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. Oh right, lithium-6 maybe? Because Li usually has 3 protons and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. So the mass number is 6.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact composition. So, the nucleus is Li-6. So its atomic number is 3, mass number 6. So the number of protons is 3, neutrons 3. But wait, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So yeah, Li-6.

The speed is given as 0.96c, so I need to find the energy. I think this is a relativistic energy problem because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I should use the relativistic energy formulas.

The total energy E of a particle is given by gamma times m c squared, right? Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So first, I need to compute gamma for v = 0.96c.

Let me compute gamma. So v is 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96)^2 c², which is 0.9216 c². Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check that sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. 0.28 times 0.28 is 0.0784 yes, because 0.2^2 is 0.04, 0.08^2 is
