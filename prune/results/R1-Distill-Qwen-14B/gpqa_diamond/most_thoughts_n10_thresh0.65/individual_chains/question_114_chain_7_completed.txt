Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll give it a shot.

First, the problem has two parts. Let's look at each reaction separately.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is another name for methylacetone, right? Its structure is (CH3)2CO. So, when a ketone reacts with NaCN, what usually happens? I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition, especially with strong nucleophiles like CN-.

In the first step, the NaCN probably acts as a nucleophile. The ketone's carbonyl group would be attacked by the cyanide ion. But wait, what about the conditions? I think that when a ketone reacts with KCN or NaCN, it's under specific acidic conditions. Oh right, I've heard that the reaction of ketones with CN- typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So, for the first reaction, A must be a source of H+ ions. Looking at the options, the possible A's are H3O+ or NaHSO3, which can act as an acid. H3O+ is just a strong acid, providing H+ ions. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a weaker acid but can also donate H+.

So, reaction one is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, the structure of the product: butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CN, but the substituents here are a hydroxyl and methyl group. So, the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, maybe I should think about the structure. Let me see, butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile at the end. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, so numbering from the nitrile end, the second carbon has a hydroxyl and a methyl group. So the structure would be CH2(C(OH)(CH3))CN. So the ketone (butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO) reacts with CN- to add across the carbonyl, giving an alcohol after proton transfer. So the product makes sense.

So for the first reaction, the reagent A is an acid, probably H3O+ or something else that can provide H+. Looking at the options, A is H3O+ in options A and B, while in C and D it's NaHSO3.

Next, the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Hmm, I think this is a hydrolysis reaction of the nitrile group. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, it suggests that the hydrolysis is done under acidic conditions because carboxylic acids are more likely to form under acidic hydrolysis, while amides or other products form under basic.

Wait, the reagent B is H2O. So, the reaction is treating the nitrile with water, but under what conditions? For hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, the typical reagents are either strong acid (like H2SO4, HCl) and heat, or with a base followed by acid workup. Since in the product it's a carboxylic acid, the conditions were probably acidic. So reagent B in this case must be an acid, like HCl or something else.

Looking at the options, the possible B's are HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

So, putting it all together. For reaction one, A is an acid—either H3O+ or NaHSO3. For reaction two, B is an acid—HCl or maybe another acid like CH3COOH.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl. So reaction one uses H3O+ as a catalyst, which makes sense. Reaction two uses HCl as reagent B, which is an acid. So that fits.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH. Reaction one is same, and reaction two uses acetic acid as B. But wait, would H2O with CH3COOH be enough? Or does the hydrolysis require a stronger acid, like HCl?

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl. So reaction one uses a weaker acid. Does that work? I think NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+. Wait, but does the reaction of a ketone with NaCN require a strong acid catalyst?

I remember that the addition of NaCN to ketones is typically done in the presence of an acid. Like, in the case of acetone plus HCN, you use an acid catalyst. So, in this case, maybe H3O+ is more appropriate as the catalyst for the nucleophilic addition.

So for reaction one, A is H3O+.

For reaction two, the nitrile to acid hydrolysis. So the conditions are acidic: H2O with HCl as a catalyst. So option A's B is HCl, which would make sense.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+ (good for first reaction), B=HCl (good for second reaction).

Option D: A=NaHSO3, which is a weaker acid. Would that work? I'm not sure. I think the addition of cyanide to ketones requires a strong enough acid to protonate the carbonyl. So H3O+ (a strong acid) would be better.

So, the correct reagents would be A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

Looking at the options, that's option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another thought: sometimes, when you have NaCN and H3O+, it could lead to HCN gas being released. But in the reaction, you have butan-2-one plus NaCN with H3O+ as a catalyst. That should proceed smoothly.

Another point: the second reaction. Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid can be done under acidic conditions. So, if B is HCl, then adding HCl would provide the necessary acidic environment. But looking at the options, B is written as H2O, but perhaps with HCl as a catalyst. Or is B the reagent, which is HCl in this case?

Wait, the problem states that in the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O, but the options give B as either HCl or CH3COOH, etc. Wait, actually, no. Let me re-read the problem.

Wait the second reaction says: (compound) + B (H2O) → product. So the reagent B is H2O. So, perhaps B is an acid that is present in the aqueous solution. So, when they write B as HCl, it's the acid present in water. So for reaction two, the reagent is H2O, but with an acid (like HCl) as the catalyst.

So, the correct B would be HCl, which is option A. So overall, the correct option is A.


The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the suitable reagents for each step.

### Reaction 1:
The first reaction involves butan-2-one (a ketone) reacting with NaCN in the presence of reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. For this reaction to proceed efficiently, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl group more electrophilic. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most appropriate choice for reagent A, as it provides the necessary H⁺ ions. NaHSO₃, while acidic, is less suitable for this reaction.

### Reaction 2:
The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (in the presence of H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a hydrolysis reaction where the nitrile group is converted into a carboxylic acid. Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires acidic conditions. Among the options, HCl is the most appropriate choice for reagent B, as it provides the necessary acidic environment for the reaction to proceed efficiently. CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is less likely to be effective for this purpose.

### Conclusion:
For the first reaction, the suitable reagent is H₃O⁺, and for the second reaction, the suitable reagent is HCl. This corresponds to **Option A**.
