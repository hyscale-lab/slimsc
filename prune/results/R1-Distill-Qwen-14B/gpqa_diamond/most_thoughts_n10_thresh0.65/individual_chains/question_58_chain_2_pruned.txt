Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations, especially at high energies or short distances.

So the options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I think regularization is something that happens when you have loop diagrams in perturbation theory. These loops can lead to divergent integrals, which need to be handled. The way to handle them is by regularization methods like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, etc.

But wait, not all theories need regularization. Let me think about each option.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh right, that's the non-quantum version. In classical E&M, there are no infinities because it's a classical theory. You don't have things like renormalization because there's no concept of virtual particles or loops in the same way. So maybe classical electrodynamics doesn't require regularization? Because regularization is a quantum effect.

But wait, the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So if a theory doesn't have these divergences, it doesn't need regularization. So classical theories might not need it because they don't have the same issues as quantum theories. Because in QED, for example, you have issues like the electron having infinite charge due to self-energy loops, which require renormalization. So QED definitely requires regularization.

What about Q
