Okay, so I need to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me start by reading the question carefully. The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that this reaction is usually a substitution reaction, maybe a dehydrohalogenation or some kind of elimination, but wait, no, red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of an acid chloride, but wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Oh wait, red phosphorus and HI is often used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for removing carbonyl groups by converting them into methylene groups. Or maybe it's related to the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat to reduce ketones to alkanes. But wait, red phosphorus with HI is another way to reduce carbonyl groups, perhaps via the Heyns reduction? Hmm.

Wait, no. Another thought: when you have an acid chloride reacting with HI and red phosphorus, maybe it's a hydrolysis. Wait, I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI: I think in the presence of an acid chloride, it would hydrolyze to form a carboxylic acid. Because acid chlorides react with water to form carboxylic acids. But wait, HI is a strong acid. So maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution reaction elsewhere, but I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe the starting compound is an ester or a ketone or something else. Let's look at the spectral data to figure out what compound X is.

Starting with the IR data: the peaks are at
