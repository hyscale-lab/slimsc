Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to work through it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it talks about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. The particles have negligible mass, so I don't have to worry about their mass affecting anything else.

The problem says that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is about finding the minimum energy of the system, and they give options to choose from. I need to compute this energy and pick the correct option.

Wait, the system's energy. Since these are charged particles, I'm assuming we're dealing with electric potential energy here. Because in an isolated system, the energy is conserved, so the potential energy would be a key factor.

So, the setup is that there's a central charge fixed at point P, and the other twelve are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, each of these 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th charge at P.

Wait a minute, but each of the 12 is 2 meters from P, but what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? Oh, right, because they're all at the same distance from P, but assuming they can be arranged in a sphere or something, maybe their mutual distances are such that each is equidistant from the others. But wait, we might not need that for
