Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question in front of me about physical theories and regularization. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, right? But wait, I need to think about each option to see which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is different from standard quantum field theories because it's a theory of everything, incorporating gravity and all. Strings vibrate at different frequencies, and their interactions are calculated using perturbation theory. But wait, do they need regularization? I'm not too sure. I remember that in string theory, some issues like divergences are handled by the structure of the theory itself, perhaps through the concept of the string tension or higher-dimensional aspects. So maybe superstring theory doesn't need the same kind of regularization as QFTs do.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD calculations often involve dealing with things like the renormalization group because of the running coupling constant. At high energies, QCD becomes weakly coupled (asymptotic freedom), so perturbative methods work. But even so, when doing loop calculations, you might still get divergences. So QCD must require regularization techniques, like using lattice QCD or other methods to handle those infinities.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that QED has processes like electron-positron pair creation, and when you calculate loop diagrams (like the electron self-energy), you get divergent integrals. Renormalization is a big part of QED, which deals with these divergences by absorbing them into counterterms. So regularization is definitely needed here, whether it's through cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, or Pauli-Villars methods.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones. In classical electrodynamics, you don't deal with quantum divergences because it's a classical theory. For example, there's no issue with charges being point particles and the associated infinities because in classical theory, you can just treat them as point charges without needing renormalization. So this theory wouldn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory.

Wait, the question is about which theory "never requires regularization". So looking at the options, the
