Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The formula is distance = 1 / parallax (in parsecs, right?), so parallax p is 1/d. So as the parallax increases, the distance decreases. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So like, how does the count change as you go from higher to lower parallax? Or wait, lower parallax would mean farther away.

Let me think about the volume of space. The number of stars in a given volume depends on their density. If the density is uniform, then the number of stars should be proportional to the volume.

Wait, but how does volume relate to parallax? Let's imagine a spherical shell at a certain distance d. The thickness of this shell when considering parallax would be a small change in parallax, delta_p. Since p = 1/d, a small delta_p corresponds to a small delta_d. Let's see, if p changes by delta_p, then d changes by delta_d. Let me compute delta_d.

p = 1/d → d = 1/p. So delta_d = -1/p² * delta_p. The negative just shows that if p increases, d decreases, but the magnitude is 1/p² * delta_p.

The volume of a spherical shell with radius d and thickness delta_d is 4πd² delta_d. So substituting delta_d, that's 4πd² * (1/p²) delta_p. But d is 1/p, so substituting that in, it's 4π*(1/p)^2 * (1/p²) delta_p = 4π * (1/p^4) delta_p.

Wait, so the volume is proportional to 1/p^4. But wait, the number of stars in that shell would be the volume multiplied by the number density of stars. Assuming the density is uniform, which the question states, the number of stars per unit parallax interval (delta_p) would be proportional to the volume, which is 1/p^4 times delta_p.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So per delta_p, the count is proportional to 1/p^4 * delta_p. But if we're considering a per-unit change, like per delta_p = 1 (unit being whatever, say parsecs), then the number is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The number of stars in a thin shell between d and d + delta_d is 4πd² * (delta_d) * n, where n is the number density. But since d = 1/p, delta_d = - delta_p / p². So substituting, the number is 4π (1/p)^2 * (delta_p / p²) * n. So that's 4π n * delta_p / p^4.

So the number per unit delta_p is (4π n) / p^4. Which would mean that as p increases (closer stars), the number per unit parallax interval increases as 1/p^4.

So the number of stars per unit range of parallax (delta_p) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number N is ~ 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So the answer would be option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't get the exponents wrong. Because if p is in parsecs, then for a given p, the volume element would be 4πd² delta_d. With d =1/p, so d²=1/p². And delta_d is approximately delta_p / p², so the volume is 4π (1/p²) (delta_p / p²) )= 4π delta_p / p^4. So yeah, the number is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the correct answer is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely related to distance \( d \) as \( p = \frac{1}{d} \). The number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume and the number density of stars, which is assumed to be uniform in this scenario.

Consider a thin spherical shell at a distance \( d \) with thickness \( \delta_d \). The corresponding change in parallax is \( \delta_p \), and since \( p = \frac{1}{d} \), we have \( \delta_d = -\frac{\delta_p}{p^2} \). The volume of the shell is given by:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi d^2 \delta_d = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{\delta_p}{p^2}\right) = \frac{4\pi \delta_p}{p^4}.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the volume, so the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( \delta_p \)) is:

\[
\text{Number of stars per unit } \delta_p \propto \frac{1}{p^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). This corresponds to option A.
