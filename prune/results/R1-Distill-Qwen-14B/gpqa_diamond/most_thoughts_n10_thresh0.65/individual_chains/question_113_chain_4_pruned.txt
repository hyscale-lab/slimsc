Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula for an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in the IR around that region usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, could it be an alcohol or something else? Also, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong peak, which I think is indicative of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester or something like that. The 1650 might correspond to another carbonyl, perhaps an aromatic ring's C=O or maybe an amide, but the question doesn't mention any N, so probably not an amide. Alternatively, 1650 could be an aromatic C=C stretch or maybe another type of carbonyl like an ester or acid.

Then looking at the ¹H NMR, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond, maybe in an alkene group. So that suggests an alkene is present. Also, the presence of vinyl protons in the NMR indicates that the protons are adjacent to the double bond.

The Mass Spectrometry (MS) data shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, what fragments have a mass of 45? Let me think. Common fragments include CH3CO+ (which is 43, but if it's something like C2H5O2+, wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the ketene ion? Or perhaps it's a CH2O fragment? Wait, 45 is the m/z, so the mass is 45. Let me calculate the possible molecular formulas. The options given are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2.

Let me think about what a fragment of 45 could be. Maybe it's a CH2O group (formaldehyde, but that's 30). No, wait. Or perhaps a (CH3)2CO+ fragment? That would be
