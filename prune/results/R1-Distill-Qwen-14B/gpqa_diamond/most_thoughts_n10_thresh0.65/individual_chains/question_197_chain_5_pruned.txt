Okay, so I need to figure out what Compound X is and then determine the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let me start by analyzing the given spectroscopic data.

First, the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches, maybe from an alcohol or amine. But then there's 1720 cm-1, which I think is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids typically show a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm-1, not a sharp peak. The 1720 cm-1 might be an ester or maybe a ketone. Then there are other peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which might suggest aromatic rings, possibly substituted. Those are around the regions where C=C stretching occurs.

Now looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The peak at 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's a bit high. Broad singlet could suggest an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. But wait, if there's a carbonyl group at 1720, maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Or maybe that's a conjugated system. Alternatively, the 10.5 could be an aromatic proton in a very deshielded environment, but that's less common. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet.

Then there's a doublet at 8.0 ppm and another at 7.2 ppm, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The splitting is 2H each, so maybe it's a substituent in the para position, like a substituent that causes two doublets, such as a methyl group or another substituent that splits the ring protons.

Looking at the other peaks: 2.9 ppm as a multiplet (1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let me think about this. The triplet at 0.9 ppm with 3H is probably a methyl group attached to something, like a CH2CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet with 3H suggests a methyl attached to a CH, perhaps a branching point. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be a methylene group next to a CH or another group. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) might be a methine (CH) group, possibly adjacent to a carbonyl or another substituent.

Putting this together: the aromatic part suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. The substituent is probably something that has a carbonyl group. Wait, but in the IR, we have a carbonyl. So maybe it's a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl, like a methyl ester, or a ketone, or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the IR has 1720, which could be an ester (around 1740-1720) or a ketone (lower, like 1700-1680). If it's a ketone, then the 10.5 ppm peak might be something else. Alternatively, maybe the 1720 is an ester.

Wait, let me think about possible structures. Let's consider an aromatic ester. For example, something like methyl benzoate. But wait, in methyl benzoate, the ester group is OMe attached to the benzene and then the carbonyl. But the NMR doesn't show a singlet for a methyl ester, because the ester's OCH3 would show up around 3.9 ppm as a triplet (if adjacent to another CH3) or as a singlet. Hmm, but in the NMR data, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet
