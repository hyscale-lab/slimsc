Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Now, the problem is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes without spots compared to when it has spots. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Angstroms. And the photosphere is in LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies.

Hmm, I remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us how the population of different energy states changes with temperature. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, we're looking at the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. So, when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature is lower, 5500 K, compared to 6000 K without spots. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler regions, right? So, the presence of spots makes the overall observed temperature lower, but what about the individual regions?

Wait, the problem says that the effective temperature of the photosphere decreases when spots are present. So, the overall photospheric temperature drops. But how does that affect the ionization and excitation of the atoms?

The transition in question is for neutral Ti, Ti I. So, Ti is neutral, not ionized. That means we're looking at the excitation of electrons within the neutral atoms, not ionization. So, the process is about excitation, not ionization.

So, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (n_upper/n_lower) depends on the temperature. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1
