Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about the density matrix of a qubit. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubits space. The matrix provided is ρ = 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|). The options are A to D with different r vectors.

Wait, I remember that a density matrix describes the state of a quantum system. For a qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. So, the given ρ is a density matrix. I think the general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written in terms of Bloch vectors.

Oh right, the Bloch sphere represents the state of a qubit. Any state can be represented as a point on or inside the unit sphere in 3D space. The density matrix is related to the Bloch vector r. The formula is something like ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and I is the identity matrix.

Let me write down the Pauli matrices. Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], and I is [[1,0],[0,1]].

The given density matrix is ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute |0><0|. That's [[1,0],[0,0]]. And |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2.

Wait, but the general form is ρ = (I + r_x X + r_y Y + r_z Z)/2. If ρ is I/2, that means all the r components must be zero. Because I/2 = (I + 0 X + 0 Y + 0 Z)/2. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that's the answer.

But wait, another way to think about it: density matrices for mixed states have Tr(ρ²) < 1. Let's compute Tr(ρ²) for this ρ. ρ is I/2, so ρ squared is (I/2)^2 = I²/4 = I/4. The trace of I/4 is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2, which is less than 1. So this is a mixed state, which makes sense because it's a completely mixed state (maximally mixed state). The maximally mixed state would correspond to the center of the Bloch sphere, which is (0,0,0). So yeah, that's option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. For a qubit, the density matrix is related to the Bloch vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z}{2},
\]

where \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho = I/2\), it is clear that all components of the Bloch vector \(r\) must be zero (\(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), \(r_z = 0\)). This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Additionally, the trace of \(\rho^2\) is:

\[
\text{Tr}(\rho^2) = \text{Tr}\left(\left(\frac{I}{2}\right)^2\right) = \text{Tr}\left(\frac{I}{4}\right) = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Since \(\text{Tr}(\rho^2) < 1\), this confirms that the state is a mixed state, and it is maximally mixed, corresponding to the center of the Bloch sphere at \(r = (0,0,0)\).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
