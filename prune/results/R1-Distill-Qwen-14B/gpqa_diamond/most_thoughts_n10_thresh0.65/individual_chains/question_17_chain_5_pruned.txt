Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about complex ions and concentrations. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, wait. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand, like EDTA, the formation constant K is given. K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where the metal and ligand combine to form the complex. So, the higher the K, the more stable the complex.

In this case, the complex is Ca-EDTA. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-. I think the formation constant K is for this reaction. So K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, assuming that the complex is completely formed, or that it dissociates very little because K is large. Since K is 5x10^10, which is a very large number, the complex is very stable. So, I can probably assume that the dissociation is negligible. That means that the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] is approximately 0.02 M.

Wait, but EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, right? So, each EDTA^4- binds to one Ca²+ ion. So the stoichiometry is 1:1. That's good, so the formula I'm thinking of applies.

So the initial setup is that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution. Because the complex dissociates a bit, but as I said, it's a stable complex.

So, the dissociation would be:

CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant K = 5e10. But wait, for the dissociation, the K would be the inverse of K formation. Because the formation is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2- (K_form), and the reverse is K_dissociate = 1/K_form.

So K_dissociate = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Now, the expression for K_dissociate is [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-].

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M minus some x, but since K is so small, x will be negligible. So, [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 M.

Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as c. Then, [Ca²+] = c, and [EDTA^4-] = c as well. Because for every mole of Ca²+ released, a mole of EDTA^4- is released. So, each contributes c.

Putting into the K_dissociate expression:

K_d = (c * c) / 0.02 = 2e-11.

So, c² = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.

Taking square root, c = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 → sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. So 2e-6.5 is 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7, because 10^0.5 is about 3.16. So 2e-6.5
