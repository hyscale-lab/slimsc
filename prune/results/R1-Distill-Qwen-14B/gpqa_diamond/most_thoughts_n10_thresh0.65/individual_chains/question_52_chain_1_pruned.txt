Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When the spots aren't there, the effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels—level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find by what factor the ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Wait, so the ratio is n1/n2. When there are spots, this ratio is lower. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_spots. I think. Because the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so the factor is how many times bigger the ratio is without spots compared to with spots.

Alright, the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Oh, that's in the near-ultraviolet range, I think. And the photosphere is in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. So the Boltzmann equation is the way to go here.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between the levels. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but here, the problem is about the ratio when spots are present. So, when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature is lower. But wait, how does that affect the photospheric temperature where the Ti atoms are?

Hmm, I think that when spots are present, they are cooler regions on the star's surface. But the question says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. Wait, does that mean that the average T of the photosphere is lower? Or is the star's surface partially at a lower temperature (spots) and the rest at 6000 K? Hmm, the problem says that when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500
