Okay, so I need to figure out which of these theories doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I should think this through.

Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I recall that string theory is a theory of quantum gravity, right? It's supposed to combine general relativity with quantum mechanics. But wait, string theory is a candidate for a theory that doesn't have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories because it's background-independent and handles gravity. I think superstring theory doesn't require renormalization, which is related to regularization. So maybe it doesn't need regularization either. But I'm not entirely sure, so I'll come back to this.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, where quarks behave more freely at high energies. But wait, QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, which usually requires renormalization. However, at high energies, because of asymptotic freedom, the coupling becomes weak. So in practice, maybe QCD doesn't require regularization at high energies? Or does it? Or perhaps it's the opposite because when you go to low energies (like infrared), things get more complicated. Wait, regularization is needed when you have divergences, which can happen in loop calculations. QCD does have these issues, so it probably does require regularization. Hmm, not sure
