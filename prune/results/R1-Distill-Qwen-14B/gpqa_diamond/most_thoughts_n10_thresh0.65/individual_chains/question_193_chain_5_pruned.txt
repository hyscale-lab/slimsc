Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance.

Wait, the formula given is number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So that's like N ‚àù 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to (d)^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, like, how does N change as we move from r to r+dr or something?

Wait, wait. Let me think. If the number of stars in the region is proportional to d^5, then the change in number with distance would relate to the derivative. Because when you think about how much the number increases per unit distance, that's the derivative dN/dr. So if N = k d^5, then dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (the rate) would be proportional to d^4.

But wait, the question asks about the change in the number of stars with distance, per unit range. Oh, maybe it's the density or something else. Alternatively, perhaps they're considering the number
