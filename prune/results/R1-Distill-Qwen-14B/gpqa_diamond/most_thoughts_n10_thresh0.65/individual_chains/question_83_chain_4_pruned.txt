Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the pH at two different points during a titration. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, this solution is titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D, each with two pH values. The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when it's titrated with a strong base like NaOH, it forms its conjugate base, acetate. So the reaction should be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

First, I think I should calculate the initial concentration after dilution. Dilution is straightforward with the formula C1V1 = C2V2. So the initial volume is 20 cm³, initial concentration 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ water, the total volume is 40 cm³.

So the initial concentration after dilution would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Got that, the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating, the amount of NaOH added will determine how much of the acetic acid has been neutralized. At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. Wait, no, wait—wait, actually, in titration, the percentage is usually based on the volume of titrant added relative to the equivalence point volume. So, 25% titration would mean that 25% of the NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point has been added.

So I should first find the equivalence point volume. To find that, I need to calculate moles of acetic acid initially.

Moles of acetic acid = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So original solution is 0.05 M, 20 cm³. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:1 (acetic acid to NaOH), the moles of NaOH needed at equivalence point are also 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH. Therefore, 25% titration would mean 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. 

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, when you titrate, the volume of NaOH added is a factor, but in this case, the initial solution is 40 cm³. So when you add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total solution volume becomes 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³. Hmm, but when calculating concentrations, I need to consider the total volume.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the moles of NaOH added at 25% and then figure out how much of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

So at 25% titration, the volume of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³. Moles of NaOH added would be 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:1, this will neutralize 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 moles
