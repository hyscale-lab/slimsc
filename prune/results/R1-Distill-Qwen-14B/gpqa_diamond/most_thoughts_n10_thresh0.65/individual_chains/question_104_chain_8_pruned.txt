Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. When a planet orbits a star, the star moves a little bit in the opposite direction, and that causes the spectral lines to shift. The shift tells us about the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. So the planets have similar masses, but maybe different orbital periods.

The first planet causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and the second causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does the shift relate to the planet's orbital period?

Oh right, the Doppler shift (or radial velocity) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I think is something like the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i)/(M_star) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) or something like that. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude. Let me recall.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star) ) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(a)) )? Wait, no.

Alternatively, I remember the formula K = [ (2πG) / (c * P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

Since the two planets have similar masses to Neptune, which is much less than the Sun's mass, so M_p << M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So can approximate as M_star.

So K ≈ [ (2πG) / (c * P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / M_star^(2/3)

But since the stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, M_p sin i is approximately the same for both planets (assuming same inclination, but perhaps that's not given). Wait, but the question says the planets have masses similar to Neptune, but they could have different masses. Oh, wait no, it says each planet has a mass similar to Neptune, but not necessarily the same. Hmm.

Wait, the question states: "both with masses similar to that of Neptune." So their masses are about the same. So M_p1 ≈ M_p2. Therefore, sin i is same? Well, the problem doesn't specify inclinations, but if the shifts are different, perhaps the inclination affects it. But I think the question is assuming that the shifts are due to the same inclination, or that the radial velocities are observed, so perhaps we can ignore the sin i factor because it's the same for both (
