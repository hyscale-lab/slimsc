Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question gives a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get a sense of the structure. The formula is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. Let me compute that: (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. Five degrees of unsaturation. So that could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 4) and a double bond plus a ring would be too much, but perhaps a benzene and a double bond and a ring? Wait, no, wait. Benzene is three double bonds, so that's three degrees. Then each additional ring or double bond adds one. So if the molecule has a benzene ring (3), another double bond (1), and maybe an ester or amide group? Or maybe an aromatic ring and another ring, but wait, the formula has an N, so maybe it's an aromatic amine or something else.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) â€“ that's a strong deshielded proton. Maybe an aldehyde proton, or maybe a ketone? Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But this is a triplet, which is a bit unusual because aldehydes are typically split into doublets or singlets unless coupled with something else. Or maybe it's an aromatic proton adjacent to an electronegative group.

Wait, but another possibility: an enol form. Or perhaps the proton is next to an oxygen, like in a carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton in a para-substituted position, but wait, 9.72 is quite high. Could it be an aldehyde?

Looking at the other signals: 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). Those look like two sets of doublets, each integrating to two protons. That's characteristic of a
