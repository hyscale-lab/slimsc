Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully and think through the steps.

The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. The star's parameters change when spots are present, affecting the photospheric temperature. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. 

So, when the star doesn't have spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. But wait, what's the connection between the spots and the effective temperature?

Wait, when a star has spots, it's cooler in those regions. But the overall effective temperature is a measure related to the total luminosity. I think the effective temperature is calculated based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates luminosity (L) to radius (R) and temperature: L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. 

But when spots are present, the star's total luminosity decreases because those spots are cooler. The problem says that 40% of the surface is covered by spots. So, the star's overall luminosity is a mix of the spotted and unspotted regions.

Wait, but the question says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So, the effective temperature is an average based on the star's total radiation. Hmm, but how does that relate to the temperature in the photosphere when spots are present?

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying things by assuming that the effective temperature is the average of the spotted and unspotted regions. Alternatively, maybe the entire photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So, when spots are present, the photosphere's temperature is lower.

The question then focuses on the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the photosphere. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower.

The ratio in question is n1/n2, where n1 is the number in level 1 and n2 is the number in level 2. The Boltzmann equation says that n1/n2 = (g1
