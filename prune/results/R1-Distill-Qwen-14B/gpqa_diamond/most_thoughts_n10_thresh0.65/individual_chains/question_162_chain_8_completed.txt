Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the area of a pseudosphere using the given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me think through this step by step.

The metric provided is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I remember that the area of a surface in 2D can be found using the metric. The area element dA is usually the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy. But wait, since this is a 2-dimensional metric, the area element might be a bit different.

Wait, the metric is written in terms of dx and dy. So the metric tensor components would be g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and same for g_yy, right? And g_xy and g_yx would be zero because there's no cross term. So the metric is diagonal.

The determinant of the metric tensor, which is a 2x2 matrix here, would be (g_xx * g_yy) - (g_xy * g_yx). Since g_xy is zero, the determinant is just g_xx * g_yy. Both g_xx and g_yy are the same, so determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

The area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. So sqrt of [32/(4 - x² - y²)]² is 32/(4 - x² - y²), right?

So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm. I'm a bit confused about what a pseudosphere is in this context. I think a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, like a tractricoid. But in any case, the area calculation would depend on the metric provided.

Wait, maybe the metric given is for a pseudosphere. Let me think about the form. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which reminds me of the metric for the Poincaré disk model. Oh right, because in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is usually something like (4/(1 - x² - y²)^2) (dx² + dy²), but the coefficient here is 32/(4 - x² - y²) instead of 4/(1 - x² - y²)^2. Hmm, maybe it's a scaled version.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the given metric is conformally flat, meaning it can be written as e^{2φ} (dx² + dy²), where φ is some function. Here, the conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element is e^{2φ} dx dy.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck: the area element in 2D for a metric ds² = E dx² + G dy² (since cross terms are zero), with E=G, is E dx dy. Because the determinant is E*G, so sqrt is E, so dA = E dx dy. So in this case, since E = G = 32/(4 - x² - y²), the area element is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Now, the area of the pseudosphere would be the integral of dA over the entire surface. But wait, what's the domain of integration? The metric's denominator is (4 - x² - y²), so to avoid singularities, 4 - x² - y² must be positive. So x² + y² <4. So the domain is the interior of a circle with radius 2, because when x² + y² =4, the denominator becomes zero. So the coordinates (x,y) are defined within this circle.

But wait, the pseudosphere in the Poincaré model is usually mapped to the unit disk, but here the radius is 2. Wait, the question says radius r=2. So perhaps the area is computed over the region where x² + y² <4.

So the area would be the double integral over x and y (with x² + y² <4) of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, but integrating this function over the disk might give an infinite result. Let me see. Let me switch to polar coordinates because the integrand is radially symmetric.

In polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², and dx dy = r dr dθ. So the integral becomes:

Integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2.

Integral of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

We can separate the integrals because the integrand doesn't depend on θ.

So the area A is 32 * ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Compute the θ integral first: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

Now, the r integral: ∫0 to 2 [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me do substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-du/2) = r dr.

Wait, the integral becomes ∫ [r dr ]/(4 - r²) = ∫ ( (-du/2) ) / u = (-1/2) ∫ (du/u).

But when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the substitution should consider these limits.

Wait, let's compute the integral from r=0 to r=2:

∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (1/u) * (-1/2) du ]

Which is (-1/2) ∫ from 4 to 0 (1/u) du = (-1/2)[ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but when u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln u approaches negative infinity. Let's compute:

= (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ]

But ln(0) is negative infinity. So ln(0) - ln(4) is negative infinity. So the integral would be (-1/2)( -infty - ln4 ) = (-1/2)(-infty) = infty.

Wait, but that can't be right because the area shouldn't be infinite. Or maybe it is, depending on the model.

Wait, but in the Poincaré disk model, the area of the pseudosphere is finite despite appearing to cover an infinite space. But in this case, the metric is defined on a disk of radius 2, so maybe the area is finite.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution or limits. Let me double-check.

Wait, the integral ∫ [r dr]/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2. Let me compute without substitution.

Let me write it as ∫ r dr/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2.

Let me make substitution u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes:

∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) * (-du/2)

Which is ∫ (from 4 to 0) (-du/2u) → flipping the limits, it's ∫ (from 0 to4) (du/2u )

Which is (1/2) ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du = (1/2) [ ln u ] from 0 to4.

But as u approaches 0 from above, ln u approaches -infty. So the integral (1/2) [ ln4 - (-infty) ] → (1/2) (infty) → infty.

Wait, but that suggests the area is infinite. But that's not possible because the pseudosphere should have finite area. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the Poincaré disk model has finite area? Or is it that the hyperbolic plane has infinite area? Oh right, the hyperbolic plane has infinite area, but the pseudosphere is a finite area surface with constant negative curvature.

Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, but it's a finite area. Hmm, but the metric given here is defined on a disk of radius 2, so perhaps the area is finite.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4−x²−y²)] (dx² + dy²).

Wait, the Poincaré disk model has metric (4/(1 - x² - y²)^2) (dx² + dy²), but that's for the unit disk. Here, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²) which can be written as 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So perhaps it's a scaled version, scaled by a factor of 2, so the disk radius is 2 instead of 1.

So if in the unit disk model, the area is 4π (since the area of hyperbolic plane is infinite but the pseudosphere is finite), wait, no, the pseudosphere is a finite area. Wait, perhaps the area for the Poincaré disk model with radius R is 2π R² (but I'm not sure).

Wait, maybe I should compute the integral. Let me proceed.

The area is A = 32 * 2π * ∫ (from 0 to 2) [ r dr/(4 - r²) ]

Which is 64 π ∫ (from 0 to 2) [ r dr/(4 - r²) ]

Wait, but earlier I found that this integral is (1/2) ln u from 0 to4, which is infinite. So the area would be infinite, but that can't be right for a pseudosphere.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the setup. Let me think about the metric again.

The area element is (32/(4 - r²)) r dr dθ. Integrating this over the disk r from 0 to 2.

Wait, perhaps I should change variables to u = r². Let me try substitution.

Let me let u = r². Then du = 2 r dr → r dr = du/2.

So the integral ∫ [ r dr/(4 - r²) ] from 0 to 2 becomes ∫ [ (du/2) / (4 - u) ] from u=0 to u=4.

So that's (1/2) ∫ (du/(4 - u)) from 0 to4.

Which is (1/2) [ -ln |4 - u| ] from 0 to4.

At u=4, ln(0) is negative infinity. So the upper limit becomes -ln(0) = infinity. So the integral is (1/2)[ ( - (-infty) ) - ( -ln4 ) ) ] → (1/2)(infty + ln4 ) → infty.

So it's diverging, meaning the integral goes to infinity. So the area is infinite.

But that can't be right for a pseudosphere, can it? Or maybe I'm mixing up the models. Wait, the pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a finite area surface. So why is the integral giving infinite?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check the metric again.

Wait, maybe the metric is not defined on the entire disk, but only up to a certain point. Or perhaps I'm supposed to consider another approach, like the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.

The Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the integral of Gaussian curvature over a surface to its Euler characteristic. For a compact surface without boundary, it's 2π χ. For a pseudosphere, which has genus one (like a torus), χ is 0, but the pseudosphere is not compact. Wait, actually, the pseudosphere is a surface of infinite extent in some models, but finite area.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the given options.

The options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C) 4π(x² - y²)

D) +infty

Wait, the question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2.

Wait, but if the integral diverges, that would imply the area is infinite, which would correspond to option D. But I'm not sure because I thought the pseudosphere has finite area.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question, and the area is infinite.

Wait, when I calculated the area element, it's [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ. Integrating from r=0 to r=2, and θ=0 to 2π.

So the integral becomes:

∫ (θ=0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Which is 32 * 2π * ∫ (r=0 to2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

As we saw earlier, this integral diverges, so the area is infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, the pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a surface of finite area. So why is this integral giving an infinite area? Did I make a mistake in the metric?

Wait, perhaps the radius given in the question is r=2, but perhaps the metric corresponds to a different scaling. Let me think about the Poincaré disk model.

The standard Poincaré disk model has a metric (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate. The area element is (4/(1 - r²)^2) r dr dθ.

The area of the entire pseudosphere (tractricoid) is finite. For example, for the unit pseudosphere, the area is 4π, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the area is 2π, but I'm a bit hazy on the exact value.

Wait, maybe I should compute the integral correctly.

Wait, the integral we have is ∫ (r=0 to2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me compute this again. Let me make substitution u=4 - r². Then du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ [ r dr/(4 - r²) ] = ∫ ( (-du/2) ) / u = (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du.

The limits when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral is (-1/2) ∫ from u=4 to u=0 (1/u) du → which is (-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

Which is (-1/2)( ln 0 - ln4 ) → (-1/2)( -infty - ln4 ) → (-1/2)( -infty ) → positive infinity.

So the integral diverges, so the area is infinite.

So the correct answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, the pseudosphere is supposed to have finite area. Maybe the given metric isn't the standard one. Or perhaps in this setup, the area is infinite because the coordinates cover a finite region but with infinite area.

Alternatively, perhaps the radius is different. Maybe the radius is 1 instead of 2, but in this problem, it's given as 2.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but according to the math, the area is infinite, which would make option D the correct answer.


The problem involves calculating the area of a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) using the given metric:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right).
\]

### Key Steps and Analysis:

1. **Metric Tensor and Area Element**:  
   The metric is diagonal, with \( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \) and \( g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0 \). The determinant of the metric tensor is:

   \[
   \text{det}(g) = g_{xx} \cdot g_{yy} = \left( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \right)^2.
   \]

   The area element in 2D is given by \( dA = \sqrt{\text{det}(g)} \, dx \, dy \). Substituting the determinant, the area element becomes:

   \[
   dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
   \]

2. **Domain of Integration**:  
   The metric is defined for \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), which corresponds to the region \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). This is a disk of radius \( 2 \) centered at the origin in the \((x, y)\)-plane.

3. **Polar Coordinates**:  
   To compute the total area, switch to polar coordinates where \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \) and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \). The area becomes:

   \[
   A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

   Separate the angular and radial integrals:

   \[
   A = 32 \cdot \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \cdot \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
   \]

4. **Angular Integral**:  
   The angular integral is straightforward:

   \[
   \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
   \]

5. **Radial Integral**:  
   The radial integral is:

   \[
   \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
   \]

   Use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), so \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). The limits change as follows:
   - When \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \).
   - When \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \).

   Substituting, the integral becomes:

   \[
   \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
   \]

   The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges as \( u \to 0 \), leading to:

   \[
   \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \infty.
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:  
   Since the radial integral diverges, the total area is infinite. This implies that the area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is unbounded.

### Final Answer:
The area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.
