Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium relative to an observer in the lab. Hmm, I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes based on the medium's refractive index. But what happens when the medium itself is moving?

The setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, but the beam is also moving in the same direction as the glass. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving, but the beam is moving with the glass, I guess.

I think I need to consider how the speed of light is perceived in different frames of reference. Oh right, this relates to special relativity maybe? Because when objects are moving relative to each other, their measurements of physical quantities can differ. But wait, the speed of light in a medium isn't the same as in a vacuum, right? Oh wait, the problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1. So in the glass, the speed is c/n, where c is the speed in vacuum. But if the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, but this isn't a vacuum. The light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So the speed of light in the glass is normally c/n in the rest frame of the glass. But from the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, how does that change?

I remember
