Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry reactions, specifically the Michael addition. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, right? And it's a conjugate addition, so the nucleophile adds to the beta carbon. 

The question has three parts, each a different reaction. Let me try to break them down one by one.

First reaction (A): Itâ€™s between dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. Wait, NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base. So, the solvent is ethanol. I think in the Michael reaction, one of the reactants is the nucleophile (enolate) and the other is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the electrophile).

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. When you deprotonate it with a strong base like NaOEt, the malonate becomes an enolate. The enolate will attack the beta position of the other compound, which is the alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the compound is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, wait. The formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the p-tolyl is at the beta position. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, the substituent is on the acrylate. So, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but in this case, the substituent is at the 3-position, so maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2CH3? No, the substituent is the p-tolyl group attached to the acrylate. Wait, maybe the structure
