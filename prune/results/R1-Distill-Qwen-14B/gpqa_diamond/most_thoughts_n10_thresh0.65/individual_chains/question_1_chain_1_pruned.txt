Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The goal is to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A through D.

Hmm, okay, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that there's a fundamental limit to how precisely certain pairs of physical properties can be known. One of the key applications is the energy-time uncertainty relation. The formula I recall is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, but I think in many contexts, people use ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, ignoring the 1/2 factor because the exact value isn't critical for order-of-magnitude estimates. So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime (which is the time uncertainty). That makes sense because a shorter lifetime means a less precise measurement of energy.

So the idea here is that for each energy level, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. If the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties, then they can be distinguished. But if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the states might not be resolvable.

Let me think about each state. The first has a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds. Let's compute the uncertainty in energy for that. Similarly, the second has 10^-8 seconds.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between the two states. So, we need to ensure that the energy difference is larger than the combined uncertainties of both states? Or do we compare it to each individually?

No, wait, actually, each state's energy has its own uncertainty. The energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, or perhaps each state's uncertainty contributes. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think again.

Suppose E1 has a lifetime τ1, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. Similarly, E2 has τ2, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2. The energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1|. To resolve these two states, ΔE should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties: ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but let's think about it. The energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty to be distinguishable. Alternatively, it's the other way around: if the difference is smaller than the uncertainty, they might overlap.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this with the Heisenberg formula. Let's compute the uncertainty for each state.

But let me first get the value of ħ. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, I should convert this into eV·s. I remember that 1 eV is approximately 1.602×10^-19 joules. So:

ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s
1 eV = 1.602e-19 J
So 1 J = 1/(1.602e-19) eV = approx 6.242e18 eV.

So ħ in eV·s is 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ) = 1.0545718e-34 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s. So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So the uncertainty in energy for a state with lifetime τ is ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.

So for E1, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds.

ΔE1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV. So about 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly for E2, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds.

ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait, that's for each state's uncertainty. So to resolve E1 and E2, the energy difference between them should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or is it that each needs to be resolved relative to their own uncertainty?

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty of the measurement, which is perhaps based on the longer lifetime. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem is about distinguishing the two energy levels. So if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty of each, then the states can be separated.

Alternatively,
