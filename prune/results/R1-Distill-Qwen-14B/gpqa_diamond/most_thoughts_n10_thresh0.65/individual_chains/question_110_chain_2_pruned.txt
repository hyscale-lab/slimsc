Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two specific spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars are observable by both.

Let me start by understanding the question. The key point is that each spectrograph has a brightness limit. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning it can see stars up to 17 mag. Wait, wait, no—wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh wait, no! Wait, in astronomy, lower magnitude means brighter. So if a star is brighter than (has a lower apparent magnitude than) 17, ESPRESSO can detect it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, the star's apparent magnitude must be less than 16.

So for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than (brighter than) both 17 and 16. So the stricter condition is less than 16. Because if a star is brighter than 16, it's automatically brighter than 17. So the apparent magnitude must be ≤16 for both.

Wait, no. Let me think again. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17. So stars with V ≤17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V <16. So if a star's apparent V is less than 16, both can see it. But if it's between 16 and 17, only ESPRESSO can see it.

So the stars that both can detect are those with apparent V magnitude less than 16. But wait, wait: the question is which stars can be detected by both. So the star's apparent V must be ≤16 mag for HIRES and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. So to be detectable by both, the star's V must be ≤16 mag.

Wait, no, because if a star's V is 15, both can see it. But if a star's V is 16.5, then HIRES can't see it (since HIRES is limited to brighter than 16, which is V < 16), but ESPRESSO can see it (V <17). So the star needs
