Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The matrix representation of Ay is given, and we have to determine which statement is correct among the options A to D.

Alright, let's break it down. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. So, S is a matrix, and multiplying it by c gives us Ay.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are often involved in spin operators. The Pauli matrices, σx, σy, σz, have specific forms. Let me think: the σy matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh, so S is exactly the σy matrix. That makes sense because the spin operator S usually involves the Pauli matrices multiplied by some constants.

So, the operator Ay is c times σy. But wait, the spin operator for a spin-½ particle is usually given by S = (ħ/2)σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. But in this case, the operator is Ay = c * S, and c is h/(4π). Let's see what that makes. Let me compute c * S, where S is σy.

Wait, let me get the units right. Planck's constant h has units of J·s, and ħ is h/(2π). So, S for spin is (ħ/2)σ, which would be (h/(4π))σ. Oh wait, so in this problem, Ay = c * S, where c is h/(4π), so that's the same as (ħ/2)σy. So, Ay is exactly the spin component Sy multiplied by ħ/2? Wait, no: wait, no, because S is σy, so Sy would be (ħ/2) σy. But here, Ay is c times S, which is (h/(4π)) times the σy matrix. Let me compute: (h/(4π)) is the same as (ħ/2), because ħ is h/(2π), so  ħ/2 is h/(4π). So yes, Ay is (ħ/2)σy, which is exactly the Sy operator. So Ay is the y-component of the spin operator for a muon, which is a spin-½ particle.

So, the eigenvalues of Ay would be the eigenvalues of Sy. The eigenvalues of the spin operator Sy are ±ħ/2. Because for spin-½, the possible eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So, the eigenvalues a of Ay are ± (ħ/2) = ± h/(4π) * 2π/(2π) ??? Wait, no. Let me think correctly. Let me compute.

Wait, c is h/(4π). So Ay = c * S. But wait, what is S here? Earlier, I thought S is σy, which is the Pauli matrix. So, S is a pure matrix, but in the problem statement, the operator is Ay = c * S. So, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c multiplied by the eigen
