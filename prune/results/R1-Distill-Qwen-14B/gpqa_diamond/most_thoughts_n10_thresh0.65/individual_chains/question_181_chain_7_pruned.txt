Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me think this through.

Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. That's the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So, if the pp-III branch stops, the neutrinos from that reaction won't reach Earth anymore. But wait, neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, so if the reaction stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would have already been emitted and are on their way here. But wait, no. Because the neutrinos are produced in the core, which is where the pp chain is happening. If the pp-III stops, then new neutrinos from that process won't be made anymore. But the neutrinos already on their way would still reach us, but only for a while until the production stops.

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands. So, the flux is the number of neutrinos per cmÂ² per second. So, if pp-III stopped, what's the effect on the neutrino flux in those bands?

I remember that the pp chain produces neutrinos in certain energy ranges. The main neutrino species from the Sun are the electron neutrinos, and their production depends on the nuclear reactions in the Sun. The pp chain has several branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III, but I'm a bit confused about which produces which neutrinos.

Wait, right. The
