Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star move. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet, I think. But wait, the question says both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so maybe the mass isn't the varying factor here.

The stars are identical in mass, both similar to our Sun. So same mass for the host stars. Both planets are in circular orbits, which simplifies things because eccentricity might complicate the RV signal otherwise.

The problem gives the RV shifts for each planet. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 is 7 milliangstroms. I'm supposed to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, what's the relation between the RV shift and the orbital period? I think the RV method depends on the semi-amplitude K, which relates to the velocity. The semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ (1 - e²)) )

But since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so it simplifies. Also, since M_p is much smaller than M_star (because Neptune is much less massive than the Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula might simplify.

Wait, the formula I remember is K
