Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what it's asking.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by plx to the fifth power. So, like, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Hmm. And they're asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. So, like, how does N depend on r?

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (d) in parsecs is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (plx) in arcseconds. So d = 1 / plx. Oh right, that's the basic parallax formula.

So, if I have d = 1/plx, I can rearrange that to get plx equals 1 over d. So plx = 1/d. But in the question, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me substitute plx with 1/d. So N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5 ). Let's compute that.

Wait, (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. So 1 divided by (1/d^5) is d^5. So 1/(plx)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. 

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range, r. So the number per unit distance. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of density. Because if N is proportional to d^5, then if I want the number in a shell between d and d + dr, it would be the derivative of N with respect to d, times dr. So like, dN = (dN/dd) dr. So dN/dd is the change in number with distance.

Wait, let me go back. The number of stars in a given volume depends on distance. But I think the question is about the number of stars per unit distance, so like the rate at which stars are encountered as you move away from a point. So perhaps they're referring to the radial distribution function, like the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r.

So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a shell between r and r + dr would be
