Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that harmonic oscillators are systems that experience a restoring force proportional to their displacement. In the classical case, it's F = -kx, which is Hooke's law. But this is a relativistic version, so I need to think about how relativity changes things.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given, so I'll need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, in the classical case, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², right? So the kinetic energy at maximum speed would be (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². Solving for v_max, we get v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) = sqrt(k/m) A. But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. But the problem states it's relativistic, so I can't use that formula directly.

In relativity, the energy considerations change because the total energy includes rest mass energy. The total energy E of a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². For a harmonic oscillator, at maximum displacement (amplitude A), all the energy is potential, and at maximum speed, all energy is kinetic. But wait, no, the total energy would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, no. In the harmonic oscillator
