Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, what symmetries are those?

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. I need to figure out which of these are required.

First, let me think about each symmetry. Lorentz symmetryâ€”this is about how the laws of physics are the same for all observers regardless of their constant velocity or orientation. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it's built upon the principles of relativity, so Lorentz symmetry must definitely be maintained. That would mean operators in SMEFT should respect Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations? Like, the full symmetry group of special relativity includes both Lorentz transformations and translations in space and time. But in effective theories, especially when you have a cutoff scale, you might not have exact Poincare symmetry because of the presence of a scale (like a Planck scale or something). Or do the operators in SMEFT have to respect Poincare symmetry? I'm a bit confused here. SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's supposed to be valid up to some scale. But the operators are constructed respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Poincare. Wait, but when you add higher-dimensional operators, do they automatically respect Poincare?
