Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the setup is that there's a light beam propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking, what's the speed of light relative to the observer in the lab?

Wait, I remember that when a medium moves, it affects how light propagates through it. Oh right, this has to do with the Doppler effect or maybe something related to relative motion and the properties of the medium.

Wait, no, the Doppler effect usually deals with the change in frequency or wavelength of light due to the motion of the source or observer. But here, the medium (the glass) is moving. Hmm. So the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light.

The index of refraction n is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (c) to the speed of light in the medium (v_glass). Oh wait, in the medium's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n. But what happens when the medium itself is moving?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about how the speed of light is measured in different frames. I remember that in any inertial frame, the speed of light is always c in vacuum. But when the medium is moving, the situation is different because the light's speed depends on the medium's properties.

Wait,
