Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. I remember from my studies that when a medium is moving, it affects how light travels through it, especially when observed from another frame.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. I think this relates to the concept of relative velocity, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but when the medium is moving, do I just add velocities?

Wait, maybe I should consider the relativistic velocity addition formula? Because we're dealing with speeds that might be a significant fraction of the speed of light. But wait, the problem states that the glass is moving at velocity v, which is a constant velocity, so maybe it's non-relativistic? Or does it even matter? Hmm.

Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify that v is small compared to c, so I can't automatically assume non-relativistic speeds. So maybe I should use the relativistic approach.

But wait, the speed of light in the glass is c/n, right? So in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n. But when the glass is moving at v relative to the lab, how does that affect
