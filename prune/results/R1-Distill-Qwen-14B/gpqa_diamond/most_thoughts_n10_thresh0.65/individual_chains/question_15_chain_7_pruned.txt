Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, Planet 1 or Planet 2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability because they have limited time. Let me think about what factors influence the transit probability.

Transit probability depends on a few main things. First, the size of the planet compared to the star. A larger planet relative to the star makes a transit more likely to be noticeable. Also, the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight is crucial. But wait, since both planets have already been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, that gives us some information about their orbits, right? The RV method tells us about the mass and the orbital period, but not the inclination. But wait, for RV, you can only detect planets with an orbital inclination that allows the Doppler shift. So the minimum mass is known because the inclination isn't exactly known. However, for the transit method, the planet's orbit must be edge-on, which is a probability based on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, the probability of a planet transiting is given by R_star^2 / a^2, where R_star is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh right, more accurately, the probability is roughly (R_star / a) squared. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again.

The probability P that a planet transits its star is approximately (R_star / a)Â² multiplied by (
