Okay, so I've got this neutrino flux question about the Sun. Hmm, let me think. So the question is about what happens to the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands if the pp-III branch suddenly stops.

Wait, I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that produce energy. The pp-III branch is one part of that chain. Oh right, the pp chain is the proton-proton chain, and it has different branches. The main pp-I branch is the dominant one, and then there are others like pp-II and pp-III, which might be less significant or maybe contribute to different neutrino energies.

So the question says that the pp-III branch stops, but all other reactions remain. So only the pp-III branch is turned off. I need to figure out how this affects the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands.

Solar neutrinos are mainly produced by the pp chain and the CNO cycle. The pp chain produces neutrinos through the process where a boron-8 decays into carbon-8, emitting a neutrino. The energy of these neutrinos is around 1.4 MeV, but wait, the question is about lower energiesâ€”700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. Oh, wait, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, no. The neutrinos from the CNO cycle have lower energies, right? Or is it the other way around. Let me think. The dominant neutrino sources are the proton-proton chain, which produces about 1 MeV neutrinos, and the CNO cycle, which produces lower energy neutrinos, around 0.5 MeV or so. Or maybe I'm getting that backward. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the neutrino types. Solar neutrinos also come in different flavors, but the question says flavor changes don't matter here, so it's about the energy distribution.

Wait, let me get this straight. The standard solar neutrino spectrum has a peak around 1 MeV, which comes from the pp chain, specifically the decay of boron-8. So most of the neutrinos are in the ~1 MeV range, but there's a lower-energy tail from CNO cycle neutrinos, and perhaps some higher-energy ones too.

But wait, the question is about two bands: 700-800 keV (band1) and 800-900 keV (band2). So these are both below 1 MeV, which is 1000 keV. So they're in the lower end. So I think these are in the range of CNO cycle neutrinos.

But wait, in the pp chain, the neutrinos are higher energy. So if the pp-III branch is stopped, which part is affected?

Wait, the pp chain has different branches. The main branch, pp-I, produces boron-8, which decays into carbon-8 and emits a neutrino. Then, in the pp-II branch, another process occurs, perhaps involving helium-3. Or is that a different branch? Wait, I think the pp chain can have different sub-branches, like pp-I and pp-II, but maybe the exact details are a bit fuzzy for me.

In any case, the question is about the pp-III branch stopping. So what neutrinos does the pp-III branch produce? If pp-III is a part of the proton-proton chain
