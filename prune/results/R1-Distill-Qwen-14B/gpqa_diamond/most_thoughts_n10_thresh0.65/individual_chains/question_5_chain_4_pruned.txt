Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction. Oh right, operators for angular momentum are often considered along some direction. Since n is in the x-z plane, the direction is some angle in the x-z plane, so maybe the angle theta is measured from the z-axis or something like that.

But wait, the problem gives me the components of the operator P. P has X, Y, and Z components. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P itself would be a vector operator, I think. So P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, where σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices. So the operator along direction n is P · n, which would be P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

Wait, but the direction is given as arbitrary in x-z plane, so n must have components (n_x, 0, n_z). Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z). And since it's a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

So the operator along n would be P · n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z. Because the y-component n_y is zero.

Wait, but each of the components P_x, P_y, P_z are given as (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices. So P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is ħ/2 σ_x. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is ħ/2 σ_y. And P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is ħ/2 σ_z.

So the operator along n is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). Because the y-component of n is zero, so the P_y term drops out. So the operator is P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).
