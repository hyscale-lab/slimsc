Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, so the setup is about a star similar to the Sun. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, and one hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the area of the spots relative to the star's surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler since they have a temperature difference of 1000K. So the spots are at 5000K, right?

The problem says that when we observe this star, the brightness variations due to the spots rotating into and out of view look similar to those caused by an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is asking: what would be the radius of such an exoplanet relative to the star (Rpl/Rstar) to produce the same amplitude in the light curve?

Wait, so the amplitude here refers to the change in brightness when the planet transits the star, blocking some light. In the case of the spotted star, the dark spots cause a dip in brightness as they rotate into view. But without spots, the same amplitude would come from an exoplanet blocking a certain fraction of the star's light.

Hmm, but wait a second. Oh wait, no. The star without spots would have a certain brightness, and when a planet transits, it blocks some of that light, causing a dip. In the case of the spotted star, the spots make one hemisphere darker. When the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view, so the observed brightness decreases because some of the star's surface is darker. But when the other hemisphere (without spots) comes into view, the brightness increases again. So the overall variation in brightness is due to the spots, but when the spots are on the far side, the star appears brighter than usual.

Wait, but the problem states that the situation (the star with spots) can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the brightness variations are similar in amplitude to what you'd get with an exoplanet. But the question is, to get the same amplitude as this situation without the spots, what should be the planet's radius?

Wait, no. The question is phrased: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered
