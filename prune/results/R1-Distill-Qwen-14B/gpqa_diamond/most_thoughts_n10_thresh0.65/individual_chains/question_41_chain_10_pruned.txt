Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that a light beam is traveling through a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is, what's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Wait, let me parse this. The glass is moving towards the observer, but the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass. So, the beam's direction and the glass's motion are the same. But since the glass is moving towards the observer, that's like the glass is approaching the lab frame, while the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing.

I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially involving light, it's tricky because light's speed is constant in a vacuum according to Einstein's postulate. But here, the medium is moving, so it's about the speed of light in the medium, which is different.

The speed of light in the glass is c/n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. Wait, but if the glass is moving, does that affect the speed of the light beam as observed in the lab? Because in classical mechanics, velocities just add up, but relativity says it's more complicated.

Wait, I think this is a case where we can't just apply Galilean addition because we're dealing with light. Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light,
