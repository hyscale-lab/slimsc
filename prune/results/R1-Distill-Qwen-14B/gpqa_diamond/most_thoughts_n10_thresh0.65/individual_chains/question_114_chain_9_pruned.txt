Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two different reactions. Let me break it down.

First reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B and H2O to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving A and B as different reagents.

Hmm, okay. Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's a ketone. When a ketone reacts with NaCN, it's probably undergoing some kind of nucleophilic addition. Wait, but under what conditions? I remember that nitriles can be formed using amines, but wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So maybe it's a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group.

Wait, but for that, the carbonyl needs to be activated. Oh, right! I think when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with something like HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. But in this case, it's NaCN. Maybe it's a similar reaction. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin. So the product would have an -OH and a -CN group on the same carbon. That makes sense.

So the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. What are the conditions for that? I think for cyanohydrin formation, the ketone reacts with HCN. But in this case, it's NaCN. Hmm, but NaCN is a source of CN- in a solution, but without H+ maybe. So perhaps they need to protonate something.

Wait, but the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So A must be providing something. Maybe H+? Because HCN is HCN, but NaCN is CN-.

Wait, wait. The cyanohydrin formation typically uses HCN, but when using NaCN, perhaps under acidic conditions. Because in acidic conditions, the CN- can react with the carbonyl. So the reagent A might be an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A and B). Or maybe something else.

Wait, in the presence of acid, the CN- would be protonated to HCN, which is a stronger nucleophile. Because without acid, CN- is a weaker nucleophile. Or wait, wait, in a basic solution, the carbonyl oxygen is deprotonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. So for ketone carbonyl addition, maybe you need a basic condition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but for the formation of cyanohydrin, the usual conditions are HCN and acid. So maybe A is H3O+ or H2SO4 or something like that.

So for the first reaction, the reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl. 
Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH.
Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl.
Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH.

So for the first reaction, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is an acid, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2-.

Hmm. So if the first reaction uses H3O+ as A, that fits the idea of providing H+ to make the solution acidic, allowing the CN- to attack the carbonyl. So options A and B have A as H3O+.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction uses another reagent, like H2SO4 or H3O+ as the acid. So maybe A is H3O+.

So for the first part, I think A is H3O+, so options A or B.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. And it's treated with B and H2O to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So how does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? I think the typical reaction is nitrile → amide →
