Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The state is |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. And up and down are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. Then, I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of an operator whose matrix is A_ij. The matrix A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Then, find the average value of that operator.

Wait, wait. So the operator matrix is A. Let me think. The operator A is a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles (since up and down are the eigenstates of S_z). So the matrix would look like this:

A = [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2, and the diagonals are zero. Wait, no: wait, the question says A_ij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, else zero. So for a 2x2 matrix, it's:

Row 1: [0, hbar/2]
Row 2: [hbar/2, 0]

So that's the operator A. Hmm, okay. But what does this operator represent? It looks like it's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and if we multiply that by hbar/2, we get A. Oh right, because S_x is (hbar/2) σ_x. So perhaps A is the spin-x operator S_x. Because S_x has those off-diagonal terms.

So the operator in question is probably S_x, the spin x-component operator. So we need to find the probabilities of measuring the spin in the eigenstates of S_x, which are the eigenstates of A.

Wait, but I'm not sure. The question says "eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is Aij..." So regardless of what it represents, I need to find the eigenstates of A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed without assuming what A is, and just find the eigenstates of A. Let's do that.

The matrix A is:
