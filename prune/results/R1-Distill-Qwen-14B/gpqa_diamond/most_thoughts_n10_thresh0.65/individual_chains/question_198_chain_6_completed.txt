Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out. 

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's a bit confusing—since beta values usually increase with the order of the complex, right? So the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+, the second might be [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, and so on up to the fourth, which would have four SCN- ligands.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. Dithiocyanato means two SCN- ligands, so that's the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}.

I remember that to find the distribution of each complex species, we can use the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. The general approach involves calculating the fraction of each species using the formula for each complex based on the log of the stability constant and the concentrations of Co and SCN-.

The formula for the fraction (f_n) of each complex is given by:

f_n = (β_n [Co] [SCN]^n) / (Σ (β_k [Co] [SCN]^k) for k=1 to 4)

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the total cobalt is in all species, so each complex is a different species. The total concentration [Co_total] = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} + [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+} + [Co(SCN)_4]^{3+}.

But in this case, since [Co_total] is given, which is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M, I think we can model the distribution based on the beta values.

I think the general formula for each species is:

[Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN-]^n

But because [Co^2+] can be expressed in terms of the other complexes, it's better to normalize using the total cobalt concentration.

So the fraction f_n for each complex is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN-]^n) / (β_1 [SCN]^1 + β_2 [SCN]^2 + β_3 [SCN]^3 + β_4 [SCN]^4 )

But wait, that might not be accurate because [Co^2+] is a common factor. Let me think: The concentration of each complex is β_n [Co^2+][SCN-]^n. The total cobalt is the sum of all these plus the free Co^2+, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, since the total concentration is [Co_total] = [Co^2+] + sum of all complexes. But if the solution is such that most of the Co is in the complexes, maybe [Co^2+] is negligible. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let's proceed.

Alternatively, the problem might assume that the majority of the Co is tied up in complexes, so [Co^2+] is small compared to the complexes and can be neglected. But I'm not entirely certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this using the fraction of each species.

Wait, another approach is to consider the formation of each complex step by step. The first complex is [Co(SCN)]+, the second [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, etc.

The fraction of each species can be found using the formula:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (sum from k=0 to 4 of β_k [SCN]^k )

Wait, but beta_0 would be [Co^2+] itself, right? Because beta_0 is 1, I guess. So the sum would include the free ion. So each f_n is the fraction of the nth complex.

Wait, no, beta_0 would be the activity of the complex when n=0, which is just Co^2+. So the fraction for Co^2+ is f_0 = β_0 [Co][SCN]^0 / sum over all beta_k [SCN]^k.

But since β_0 is 1, that term is [Co]/sum. Hmm, but [Co] is the concentration of Co^2+.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again.

The problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the second one (n=2), so [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}.

Each species has a concentration given by:

[Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} = β_n [Co^2+][SCN-]^n

So the total cobalt is the sum of all species:

[Co_total] = [Co^2+] + β_1 [Co^2+][SCN-] + β_2 [Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β_3 [Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β_4 [Co^2+][SCN-]^4

Factor out [Co^2+]:

[Co_total] = [Co^2+] [ 1 + β_1 [SCN-] + β_2 [SCN-]^2 + β_3 [SCN-]^3 + β_4 [SCN-]^4 ]

So,

[Co^2+] = [Co_total] / (1 + β_1 [SCN-] + β_2 [SCN-]^2 + β_3 [SCN-]^3 + β_4 [SCN-]^4 )

Once we have [Co^2+], we can find the concentration of each complex.

But wait, we need [Co_total] which is given as 1e-2 M. [SCN-] is 0.1 M.

Plugging the numbers in:

Calculate the denominator D = 1 + β1 * [SCN] + β2 * [SCN]^2 + β3 * [SCN]^3 + β4 * [SCN]^4

So let's compute each term:

β1 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9
β2 [SCN]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4
β3 [SCN]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063
β4 [SCN]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

Adding them all together:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So D = 2.3646.

Thus, [Co^2+] = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 4.226e-3 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n

So for each n from 1 to 4, compute their concentrations.

We are interested in n=2, which is the dithiocyanato complex.

Compute [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}:

= β2 * [Co^2+] * (SCN)^2

= 40 * 4.226e-3 M * (0.1)^2

Calculate (0.1)^2 = 0.01.

40 * 4.226e-3 = 0.16904

0.16904 * 0.01 = 0.0016904 M.

Wait, but that's the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex.

Now, the total [Co_total] is 1e-2 M, which is 0.01 M.

But the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So the percentage is ( [Co(SCN)_2] / [Co_total] ) * 100.

So [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.0016904 M, and [Co_total] is 0.01 M.

0.0016904 / 0.01 = 0.16904, which is 16.904% approximately.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that would suggest that the correct answer is D.

But wait, wait a second. Let me cross-check. Did I calculate everything correctly?

Wait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because [Co^2+] is 1e-2 / D, where D is 2.3646. Let me compute that again.

1e-2 is 0.01. 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M. So [Co^2+] is approximately 0.004225 M.

Then, [Co(SCN)_2] is β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN]^2 = 40 * 0.004225 * (0.1)^2.

Compute that: 40 * 0.004225 = 0.169. Then multiply by 0.01 (since 0.1^2 is 0.01):

0.169 * 0.01 = 0.00169 M.

So [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.00169 M.

But [Co_total] is 0.01 M. So 0.00169 / 0.01 = 0.169, which is 16.9%. So option D is 16.9%, which would be the answer. But wait, wait another moment—hold on. The options include 38.1% as option C. Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering beta_4 and the higher complexes. Let me check the denominator again.

Wait, the denominator D is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, the given beta values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, so for β4, the term is 16*(0.1)^4 = 16*0.0001=0.0016. That's correct.

So D is 1 + 0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016= 2.3646. So that is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting 16.9% as the percentage for the second complex. But the options have a higher value, option C is 38.1%. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps the question isn't about the second complex but a different one. Wait, in the problem statement, it says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Hmm, wait, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} is the dithiocyanato complex. But sometimes, the color can vary based on the number of ligands. Wait, but the question specifies it's the blue one. So perhaps I'm correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering β4 as the dithiocyanato complex, but no, β2 is the second complex.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the fraction. Another approach is to compute the fraction of each complex, then sum the fractions for all complexes except the desired one.

Wait, another approach is to compute the ratio of each complex's concentration to each other, using the beta values and [SCN-].

The fraction of each species can be found using the formula:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (sum from k=0 to 4 of β_k [SCN]^k )

But wait, in this case, β_0 is 1, which corresponds to [Co^2+]. So f_0 is the fraction of free Co^2+, and f_1 is the fraction of [Co(SCN)]+, etc.

So the fraction for each complex is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / D, where D is sum from k=0 to 4 of β_k [SCN]^k.

Wait, but since β_0 is 1, D is sum from k=0 to 4 of β_k [SCN]^k = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.

So the fraction for the second complex (n=2) is f_2 = (40 * (0.1)^2) / 2.3646.

Compute numerator: 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

So f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1691, which is 16.91%. So same as before.

Hmm, that's 16.9%, matching option D.

But wait, the problem says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes", but perhaps the dithiocyanato refers to a different complex than the second one?

Wait, wait, another thought. In some cases, the first complex might have a different color. But the question states it's blue, which is a specific color. I think the dithiocyanato (two SCN) complex is the one we're focusing on, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, which is the second complex, n=2.

So with that, the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but why is option C 38.1%? That would be about twice as much. Did I make a mistake in the calculation steps?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that [Co_total] is 1e-2 M, but [Co^2+] is 4.226e-3 M, which is the free ion. Then, the concentration of each complex is:

For n=2:

[Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} = β2 [Co^2+] [SCN]^2 = 40 * 0.004226 * 0.01 = 0.0016904 M.

But [Co_total] is 0.01 M, so 0.0016904 / 0.01 = 0.169, which is 16.9%.

So I think the calculations are correct. So the correct answer should be D) 16.9%.

Wait, but let me think again about the denominator. If I used the correct [Co_total], which includes all complexes plus the free ions, perhaps there's another way.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the total. Let me try that again.

The fraction f_n is (β_n [SCN]^n) / D, where D includes all β_k [SCN]^k terms.

So f_2 = (40 * 0.01) / 2.3646 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%.

Yes, that seems consistent.

So, based on this, the answer should be D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants and the given concentrations of Co(II) and SCN⁻.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: $[\text{Co}_{\text{total}}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}$
- SCN⁻ concentration: $[\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}$
- Stability constants: $\beta_1 = 9$, $\beta_2 = 40$, $\beta_3 = 63$, $\beta_4 = 16$

The fraction of each cobalt species is determined using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k}
\]

Here, $\beta_0 = 1$ corresponds to the free Co²⁺ ion. The denominator is the sum of all terms:

\[
D = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the denominator
Substitute the given values:
\[
\beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9
\]
\[
\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4
\]
\[
\beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063
\]
\[
\beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016
\]

Summing these terms:
\[
D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}
The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{D} = \frac{40 \cdot (0.1)^2}{2.3646}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:
\[
40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4
\]

Now, divide by $D$:
\[
f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.1691
\]

Convert to percentage:
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.1691 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, among all cobalt-containing species is approximately **16.9%**.
