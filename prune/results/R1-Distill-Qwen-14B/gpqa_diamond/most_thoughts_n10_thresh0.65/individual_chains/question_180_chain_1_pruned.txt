Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the problem says there's an isolated system with 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, where e is the elementary charge, right? And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about that. 

Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, energy in an electrostatic system... I remember that the potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law. The formula is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

Since all the charges are identical, each has charge 2e. So each charge is 2 times the elementary charge. Let me note that e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So 2e would be about 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Wait, but in this setup, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters from P. So each of those 12 charges is 2 meters away from the fixed charge at P.

So the system's potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 moving charges and the fixed charge at P, plus the potential energies between each pair of the moving charges themselves.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. The problem says it's an isolated system. So all the interactions contribute to the potential energy. So I need to calculate the potential energy for all the pairs.

But wait, the system is the 13 charges. So the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

But wait, when you have multiple charges, you have to calculate each pair once. So for N charges, the number of pairs is N choose 2, which is N*(N-1)/2. But in this case, each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P, the 13th charge. And the 12 charges are each at the same distance from P, but what about the distance between them? Oh wait, the problem
