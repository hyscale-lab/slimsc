Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass is 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, their peak emission wavelengths are the same. Then, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s, respectively. The question is about the luminosity ratio, assuming they radiate as black bodies. The options are A to D, each a number around 2.2 or so.

Hmm, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh right, that's the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

The problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same. Oh wait, that's about black body radiation too. The peak wavelength λ_max is related to the temperature by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ1_max = λ2_max, then T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. Could there be any other factors, like Doppler shift due to their velocities? Oh right, because the stars are moving, their observed wavelengths might be shifted. Oh, right! The radial velocity could affect the observed wavelength.

Wait, but the problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So maybe that's the observed wavelength? Or is it the intrinsic (rest) wavelength? Hmm. Let me think.

If the stars are moving, the light we receive would be Doppler-shifted. So the observed wavelength when the star is moving towards us is shorter (blue shift) and longer when moving away (red shift). So, the peak wavelengths observed are the same for both stars. But since their velocities are different, their rest wavelengths would be different?

Wait, no. Because if Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s, the observed wavelengths would be different unless their intrinsic temperatures are different to compensate. But the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So, the observed λ_max is the same.

So, let's model this. Star_1 has no radial velocity (v1 = 0), so its observed wavelength is λ1 = λ_rest1 * (1 + v1/c). Since v1 is zero, λ1 = λ_rest1.

Star_2 has v2 = 700 km/s. Assuming it's moving away, so v is positive (but wait, if it's moving towards us, v would be negative, leading to a blue shift). Wait, the radial velocity could be either, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. Well, the problem states the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But is it moving away or towards us? Wait, radial velocity can be positive or negative. But the problem states they just found the velocities to be 0 and 700. Maybe it doesn't matter which direction, but let's think about it.

If Star_2 is moving away, then its observed wavelength λ2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c). Since it's moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. If Star_1 is at rest, its observed wavelength is the same as its rest. So, if λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, then λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c). Because λ_obs1 is λ_rest1 (since v1=0), and λ_obs2 is λ_rest2*(1 + v2/c).

But wait, according to Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T_rest. So if λ_rest1 = λ_obs2, then:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c)

But λ_rest1 = b / T1, and λ_rest2 = b / T2.

Thus, b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v2/c)

So T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c) → T1 = T2 * [1 / (1 + (v2/c))]

But wait, v2 is 700 km/s. Let me convert that to a fraction of the speed of light to see if it's significant. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 km/s is 700/(3e5) ≈ 0.002333 c. So v2 is small compared to c. So maybe we can approximate using the Doppler shift formula for non-relativistic speeds.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) , for receding.

Wait, but if the star is moving towards us, then v is negative, and λ_obs would be shorter. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed λ_obs is λ_rest*(1 - v/c). But in the problem, they are saying that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ would be shorter than its rest λ. So to have the same observed λ as Star_1, which is at rest, Star_1's λ_rest would have to be longer than Star_2's.

Wait, maybe that's the key here. Let me re-examine.

If Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, then its observed λ is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 - v2/c). Because when a source moves
