Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Wait, no, wait. It says "varies with parallax as 1/plx^5", so I think that means N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Or wait, maybe it's N ∝ 1/(plx)^5? Or wait, sometimes when they say varies as, it's the proportionality. So if it's 1 over plx to the fifth, that would be N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Now, the question is asking how the number of stars in that region changes with distance per unit range of distance. So they want to know dN/dr, I think, or maybe N as a function of r.

I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. So plx is inversely proportional to r.

So substituting plx in terms of r: plx = 1/r. So 1/plx is r. Let me see, so N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Substituting plx = 1/r, so 1/(plx) is r. So 1/(plx)^5 would be r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, wait, let me recheck that. If plx is 1/r, then plx^5 is (1/r)^5 = 1/(r^5). So 1/(plx^5) would be r^5. So N ∝ r^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of r. So in per unit range, like how much N changes as r changes, so the change in N with respect to r.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So the relation is N ∝ r^5, which means for each unit increase in r, N increases by r^5. But wait, the options don't have r^5 as the rate; they're giving how N changes with distance, perhaps as a differential. Or maybe the question is about the number per unit volume or something else.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars is given as a function of parallax. Parallax relates to distance. So perhaps the number of stars in a region decreases with distance because more distant stars are less numerous? Or increases? Wait, but according to the given, N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to r, 1/(plx) is r. So 1/(plx)^5 is r^5, so N ∝ r^5.

So as r increases, the number of stars increases with r^5. So for each unit of r, the number of stars increases by r^5. But wait, the options are suggesting different dependencies. Let me look at the options: option B is ~r^5, C is r^4, D is r^2, and A is r^3. So if the number of stars is proportional to r^5, then the answer would be option B.

Wait, but the question says "per unit range of distance, r". So it's the number of stars per unit distance. Hmm, wait. Let me think about this again. Because parallax is in inverse parsec, and the number of stars is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, which is (r)^5. So N increases as r^5. So for each unit increase in r, the number of stars increases as r^5. So the number per unit distance (dN/dr) would be d/dr (k * r^5) = 5k r^4. So that's proportional to r^4.

Wait, wait a minute. Oh! Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. But for each unit distance, how does N change?

Wait, let's model this. Let's say N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, 1/plx is r. So N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. But if the question is about the change in N per unit distance (like the slope, dN/dr), then dN/dr = 5 * r^4. So the rate of change of N with r is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars increases with distance as r^5, but the rate (per unit distance) is r^4.

Wait, but the question asks how does the number of stars change with distance, per unit range. So that would be dN/dr, which is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer would be option C, which is ~ r^4.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the number of stars is per unit volume, but I'm not sure. Let me think about this again.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume (number density) is what's given. Because parallax is 1/r, but if we're considering within a certain volume, the number of stars depends on r in a certain way.

Wait, but the given is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5 = (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, you have more stars. But when you think about per unit distance, that's the derivative. So how much does N change for a small change in r (dr), which would be approximately dN = 5 r^4 dr. So dN/dr = 5 r^4, which is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4, so the answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me think if I'm misapplying the concepts. Let me think about it in terms of flux or density. Wait, maybe I should model the number in the region as a function of r.

Suppose that for a given region, the number of stars is N = k / (plx)^5. And since plx = 1/r, then N = k r^5. So N increases as r^5. Now, when considering the change in N with distance, that's the derivative dN/dr, which is 5k r^4. So the rate of change is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer would be option C, which is ~ r^4.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into the given relationship, we find \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the number of stars increases as \( r^5 \) with distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, which corresponds to the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we get \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \). Therefore, the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
