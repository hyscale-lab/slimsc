Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I've heard about EDTA before, it's a chelating agent, right? So it binds metal ions like calcium.

The problem states that the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Wait, stochiometric means it's in a 1:1 ratio, I think. So each Ca²+ ion is bound by one EDTA^4- ion. The pH is ideal, so I don't need to worry about protonation or anything affecting the EDTA's ability to chelate, which probably means it's in its active form. The temperature is 25 degrees Celsius, which is standard.

The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. Oh, right, K is the formation constant, which tells us how strong the complex is. A high K like this means it's a very stable complex, so the ions are tightly bound.

So the main goal is to find [Ca²+] in the solution. I remember that when EDTA forms a complex with a metal ion, the concentration of the free metal ion is very low because it's mostly tied up in the complex. So the free [Ca²+] should be low.

I think the formation of the complex can be written as:
Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−

The formation constant K is given by:
K = [CaEDTA²−] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4−])

Wait, but in this case, the solution contains the complex, which is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. But wait, what about the EDTA? Because the EDTA is part of the complex, so the concentration of free EDTA might not be the same as the complex concentration. Hmm, but how?

Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So that implies that initially, we have some Ca²+ and EDTA in solution, but they form the complex. But the way the question is phrased, perhaps it's the only species present? Or maybe I should consider that the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA, so the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are not given, but the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, and the rest is dissociated into Ca²+ and EDTA. But since K is so large, the dissociation would be minimal, so [Ca²+] would be very low.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this using the formation constant. Let me define:

Let’s say the concentration of the complex is [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. The formation reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA²−; K = 5e10.

So the expression for K is K = [CaEDTA²−] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4−])

But wait, in this scenario, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are not given.
