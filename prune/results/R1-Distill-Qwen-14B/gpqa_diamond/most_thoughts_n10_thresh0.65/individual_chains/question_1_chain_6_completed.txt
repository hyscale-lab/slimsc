Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of an energy level is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ/2, maybe? So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, because that's the time it exists before decaying or something. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by (2 times the lifetime). But wait, since we have two different lifetimes, maybe each state has its own uncertainty.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think. So the energy levels have their own lifetimes. The energy difference must be sufficiently large so that the lines don't overlap when measured. How does the uncertainty in energy affect the ability to resolve them?

Oh, I think the idea is that if the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties in their energies, then we can distinguish them. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might blend together and we can't tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i = ħ/(2 τ_i), where τ is the lifetime. Let's compute that for both.

The lifetimes are τ1 = 1e-9 s and τ2 = 1e-8 s.

Hmm, Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π), which is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So for τ1, ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = (1.05e-34) / (2e-9) = approximately 5.25e-26 J.

Wait, but we need to convert this into eV because the options are in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So 5.25e-26 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV is about 3.28e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) = approx 5.25e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.25e-27 / 1.602e-19 = about 3.28e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have messed up the exponents. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1e-9 seconds is 1 nanosecond, and 1e-8 is 10 nanoseconds.

Wait, no, let me re-calculate the numbers.

For τ1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-9 = (1.0545718 / 2) * 1e-25 = approx 0.527e-25 J.

Convert to eV: 0.527e-25 J * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ) = 0.527e-25 / 1.602e-19 eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly for τ2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) = 1.05e-34 / (2e-8) = (1.05e-34) / (2e-8) = 5.25e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.25e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.28e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are about 3.29e-7 eV and 3.28e-8 eV for the two states.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. We need the energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1| to be such that it's larger than some value so that the two levels are resolvable. I think it's that the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of both states. Because if the difference is less than the combined uncertainty, the lines might overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be significantly larger than the individual uncertainties. Let me think: if the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1 and the uncertainty in E2 is ΔE2, then the uncertainty in the energy difference ΔE_diff = |ΔE1 - ΔE2|?

Wait, no. The energy difference is E2 - E1. So the uncertainty in E2 is ΔE2, and the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1. So the uncertainty in the difference would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), because they are independent. But wait, that depends on whether the two uncertainties are independent. Alternatively, perhaps the dominant uncertainty comes from the shorter lifetime because that's the larger uncertainty.

Wait, looking at the numbers, ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV and ΔE2 is 3.28e-8 eV. So ΔE1 is much bigger. So the main uncertainty is from E1, which is about 3.29e-7 eV.

So for the energy difference ΔE to be clearly resolved, it needs to be much larger than the uncertainty. So if the energy difference is much larger than the uncertainty, you can distinguish the two levels.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV. That's smaller than ΔE1 (which is ~3e-7). So that would be hard to resolve.

B) 1e-11 eV. Even smaller, so definitely can't be.

C) 1e-4 eV. That's 0.0001 eV. That's way larger than ΔE1 (3.29e-7 eV is about 0.000329 eV). Wait, wait, no: 3.29e-7 is 0.329e-6, which is 0.000329e-3, which is 3.29e-4 mili-eV. Hmm, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is bigger than 3.29e-7 eV (which is 0.000000329 eV). Wait, wait, 3.29e-7 is 0.000000329 eV, right? So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. So that's much larger than 3.29e-7 eV. So that would be easily resolvable.

Option D is 1e-8 eV. Which is 0.00000001 eV. That's smaller than 3.29e-7 eV, so the energy difference is 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than the uncertainty in E1. So you can't resolve it.

Wait, but wait, what determines the resolution? I think that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy measurement for each level. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties. But in this case, the sum would be approximately 3.29e-7 + 3.28e-8 ≈ 3.62e-7 eV. So if the energy difference is larger than that, it's resolvable.

Looking at the options:

C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So that would work.

But let me think again. So the energy difference is E2 - E1, and the uncertainty in E2 is ΔE2, and the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1.

The uncertainty in the energy difference would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), assuming independent uncertainties. So that's sqrt( (3.29e-7)^2 + (3.28e-8)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( 1.08e-13 + 1.08e-15 ) ≈ sqrt( 1.09e-13 ) ≈ ~1.04e-6 eV.

Wait, that's about 1e-6 eV. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than about 1e-6 eV for them to be clearly resolved.

Wait, but the options don't have that. The closest option is C) 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than 1e-6. So that would be resolvable.

But wait another thing. Alternatively, maybe the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. Let's see: 3.29e-7 + 3.28e-8 ≈ 3.6e-7 eV. So if the energy difference is greater than 3.6e-7, it can be resolved.

Looking again, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So that's good.

Options A is 1e-9 eV, which is 0.001 times 1e-7 eV, which is less than 3.6e-7. So it's not enough.

So the only option that's larger than the required is option C.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that can be clearly resolved, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately \( \hbar / 2 \), where \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \). For a quantum state with lifetime \( \tau \), the uncertainty in energy is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau}.
\]

The lifetimes of the two states are \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Using \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), we calculate the uncertainties in energy for both states:

1. For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.28 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be significantly larger than the combined uncertainty in the energy difference. The uncertainty in the energy difference is approximately the sum of the individual uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.28 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \), so the energy difference is too small to resolve the two levels.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \), so the energy difference is too small to resolve the two levels.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much larger than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \), so the energy difference is sufficient to resolve the two levels.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \), so the energy difference is too small to resolve the two levels.

The only option that satisfies the condition for clear resolution is **Option C**.
