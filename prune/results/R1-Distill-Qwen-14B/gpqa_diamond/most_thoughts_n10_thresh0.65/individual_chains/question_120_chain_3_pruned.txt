Okay, so I've got this question about stars' distribution and how the number of stars per unit of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The formula is distance (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So parallax is inversely proportional to distance. That means when parallax is small, the stars are far away, and when parallax is large, they're nearby.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, but wait, does that mean uniform in space or uniform in some other way? Oh, uniform distribution of stars usually means that their density is constant in space. So, more stars exist in regions that are farther because there's more volume. But wait, the distribution is uniform in space, so the number of stars in a spherical shell depends on the volume of that shell.

So, if the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume element would depend on the volume. Let me think about the volume and parallax relation.

Parallax plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So, a small plx means a large d. Now, if we consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume of that shell is approximately 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a spherical shell is 4πr² dr.

But wait, if we're looking at stars within a certain range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range? Since plx = 1/d, the distance when plx is p is d = 1/p. So, a small change in plx, dplx, would correspond to a change in distance.

Let me express the distance in terms of plx. So, d = 1/plx. The distance for plx is p: d = 1/p. For plx + dplx, it's d + dd = 1/(p + dplx) ≈ 1/p - (dplx)/p², using a Taylor expansion for small dplx.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to express the volume in terms of parallax. The volume between plx and plx + dplx is the volume between distances d and d + dd, where d = 1/plx, and dd = -d * dplx / (d^2) )? Wait, no, perhaps I should find dd in terms of dplx.

Alternatively, the
