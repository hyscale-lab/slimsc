Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same goes for their masses. But wait, mass might be a red herring here because luminosity is more about radius and temperature, right? I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius squared and its surface temperature to the fourth power. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius and T is temperature.

So, the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength. I remember Wien's law, which states that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature of the black body. So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, but wait, because λ_max is the same, that would imply T1 = T2. So their temperatures are equal. Hmm, that's interesting.

Wait, but I thought maybe mass plays a role here. But since both stars have the same mass ratio as their radii, and same temperatures, maybe it's a matter of just their sizes and temperatures determining luminosity.

So, given that L is proportional to R² T⁴. If T is the same for both, then L is proportional to R². So Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. Since T1=T2, that term is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. That would suggest option A is correct, which is ~2.25.

But wait, the problem states that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. How does that come into play? Oh, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight, which is used in the Doppler effect to determine shifts in spectral lines. But wait, I thought the problem said they used spectroscopy to find the wavelengths where the stars appeared brightest, which was the same. So
