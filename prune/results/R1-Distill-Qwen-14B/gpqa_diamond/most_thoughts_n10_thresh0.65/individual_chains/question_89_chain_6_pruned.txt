Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and then working through the products step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule, kind of like a cage structure. The 1,3-dibromo would mean there are bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions of the adamantane ring.

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, and when bromides are present, elimination reactions can happen. So probably an E2 mechanism here. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons (assuming 1 and 3 are adjacent; wait, actually, in adamantane, the positions might not be adjacent. Hmm. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid, so the structure is like four cyclohexane rings fused together. So positions 1 and 3 might not be directly adjacent. Maybe they're opposite each other? Or perhaps in a way that allows for elimination.

Wait, but elimination usually requires adjacent leaving groups. So if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, then KOH would deprotonate and cause elimination. Alternatively, maybe the structure allows for dehydrohalogenation. Let me think about the product. The product is a light yellow solid. The NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a high chemical shift, maybe an alcohol or an ether. Wait, KOH in an elimination would produce an alkene, but maybe it's elimination followed by something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, but heating with KOH and dibromide. Oh wait, if it's a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent bromines), then elimination would form an alkene. But in this case, the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, which might not be vicinal. So maybe the product isn't an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of a strong base like KOH, especially in a bulky situation, sometimes more elimination is favored. But if the di
