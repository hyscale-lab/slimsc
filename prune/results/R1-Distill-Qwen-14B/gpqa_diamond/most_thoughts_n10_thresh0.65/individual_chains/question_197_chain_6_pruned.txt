Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Sometimes these problems can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

Okay, the question is about Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of an acid anhydride, but wait, or is it another reaction? Oh right, I think when HI is used with red phosphorus, it's often in the context of cleaving certain functional groups. Wait, maybe it's more about the elimination or substitution reactions. Hmm, I might be getting a bit mixed up here.

Looking at the data given: IR and NMR spectra. Let me first analyze the IR. The IR peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably due to O-H or N-H stretching. But since there's also a peak at 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretches. So, putting that together, the compound might have a carbonyl group, like an ester or a ketone, and aromatic rings.

Now the NMR. The 1H NMR data is as follows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. A proton that's exchanging, maybe an -OH group, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit with the 1720 cm-1 peak. Because carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3000, but wait, the IR region given is 3400–2500, which is a broad band—so maybe an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But the 1720 is more like an ester or maybe a ketone. Wait, but in the options, some are acids. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options: options A and C are acids. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So if that's the case, the IR at 1720 would be a carbonyl, which fits a carboxylic acid's carbonyl. Wait, but carboxylic acids have lower wavenumber for the carbonyl, around 17
