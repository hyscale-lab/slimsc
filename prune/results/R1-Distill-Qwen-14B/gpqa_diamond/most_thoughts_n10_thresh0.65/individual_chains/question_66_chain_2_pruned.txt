Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think this through.

The question is asking which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these four.

Wait, I remember that in the Standard Model (SM), the gauge symmetry is SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), right? And SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all higher-dimensional operators respecting the SM gauge symmetry. So operators in SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the SM.

But what about other symmetries like Lorentz, Poincaré, CP, CPT? Let's break them down:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: The SM, and hence SMEFT, is Lorentz invariant. Operators in SMEFT must transform as Lorentz scalars. Because if they didn't, the theory would only make sense in a specific frame, which isn't how relativity works. So Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. Poincaré Symmetry: Poincaré includes Lorentz and translations. The SM is Poincaré invariant. SMEFT includes all operators that are Poincaré invariant, so each operator must be a Poincaré scalar. So both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries are required. Wait, but the question lists them as separate options. So I think here, option 2 is Poincaré which implies Lorentz as part of it. So does the question treat them separately?

Wait no. Lorentz symmetry is a part of the Poincaré group. So if an operator respects Poincaré, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So all operators must respect Poincaré, which includes Lorentz. So why is Lorentz a separate option?

Wait, maybe the question is considering them as separate symmetries. So both Lorentz and Poincaré are required. Or perhaps the question is focusing on which ones must be respected, like which are included.

Wait, but in the SMEFT framework, when we write operators, they are organized in terms of their Lorentz structure. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So 1 is correct. Poincaré includes translations too, but the SMEFT
