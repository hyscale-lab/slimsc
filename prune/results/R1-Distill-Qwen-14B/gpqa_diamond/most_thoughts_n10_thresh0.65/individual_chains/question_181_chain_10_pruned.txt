Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux ratios after a hypothetical scenario. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, like the proton-proton chain, right? And the pp-III branch stopping is the focus here.

Wait, the pp-III branch is a part of the proton-proton chain. I think the pp chain has different branches. Oh right, the main pp-I branch produces helium-4, and there are other branches like pp-II and pp-III, which I think involve beryllium or something. So, if the pp-III branch stops, what does that mean for neutrinos?

Neutrinos are produced in various steps of these processes. The main neutrinos are the electron neutrinos from the fusion reactions. So, the pp-III branch must contribute to the production of neutrinos, probably in a specific energy range.

The question is about the flux ratio of two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, if the pp-III branch stops, how does that affect these fluxes?

I remember that the pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher-energy neutrinos. Because when a boron-8 nucleus captures a proton to become carbon-15, which then decays, emitting a neutrino, that process emits a neutrino with higher energy. Oh wait, that's the process that produces the neutrinos around 15-20 MeV, but wait, the energy bands here are in hundreds of keV. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the details wrong.

Wait, no, the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are from the decay of carbon-15. Carbon-15 has a half-life of about 10^-12 seconds, so it decays quickly into nitrogen-15, emitting a neutrino. The energy of that neutrino is around 4.2 MeV, but that's still higher than 800 keV. Wait, but the energy bands are 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So 4.2 MeV is 4200 keV, which is above both. So maybe the pp-III branch contributes more to higher energy neutrinos than the lower ones.

Wait, but there are other sources of neutrinos. Like the main pp-I branch produces neutrinos through the other steps. Let me think:
