Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means that their number density is the same throughout space, right? But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, so let me think.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. So I need to figure out the relationship between the number of stars and the parallax. Parallax is inversely related to distance, right? Oh yeah, because parallax plx is equal to 1/distance in parsecs. So a larger parallax means a closer star, and a smaller parallax means a more distant star.

So if I'm looking at stars with a certain parallax range, like between plx and plx + dplx, how many stars would be in that range? Since the distribution is uniform, I guess the number density of stars is constant. Let me model this.

Let me think in terms of volume. The number of stars in a given volume is proportional to that volume. So if I can find the volume corresponding to a range of parallax, I can find how the number of stars depends on plx.

Wait, parallax plx is 1/d, where d is distance. So if plx increases, d decreases. So, for two distances d and d + dd, the corresponding parallax plx and plx + dplx would have a relationship. Let me express that.

plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So, the change in distance dd would be derivative of d with respect to plx. So dd/dplx = d(1/plx)/dplx = -1/(plx²). So dd = - dplx/(plx²) → dd = - d (dplx) because d=1/plx. Wait, maybe a better approach is to express the volume in terms of plx.

In 3D space, the density of stars is uniform, so the number of stars in a shell between distances r and r + dr would be proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4π r² dr. But wait, how does this relate to parallax?

Since plx = 1/r, the shell in terms of parallax would be from plx to plx + dplx. So, we need to express the volume element in terms of plx.

Let me think. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr. But we need to express this in terms of plx. Since r is 1/plx, let's substitute that.

So, r = 1/plx → dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, no, when plx increases, r decreases. So perhaps the limits are from plx to plx + dplx, which corresponds to r to r - dr?

Wait, maybe better to express dr in terms of dplx. Since plx = 1/r → r = 1/plx. So, taking derivative, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, dr = -dplx/(plx²). But when plx increases, r decreases. So, the shell in terms of r is from r to r - dr. But when plx increases by dplx, r decreases by dr = dplx/(plx²), because plx is positive and r is positive.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. For a given parallax plx, the
