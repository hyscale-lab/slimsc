Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is a more complex molecule, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, reacting with B (which is H2O) to form an acid.

Hmm, I think I should break this down into the individual reactions. Let's look at the first part first.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that in nucleophilic addition reactions, ketones can react with CN- under certain conditions. Wait, but wait, ketones usually don't react with HCN directly because they're not as reactive as aldehydes. Oh wait, but NaCN can act as a nucleophile. Oh wait, but the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Wait, maybe it's a hydroxy nitrile. So perhaps it's an addition of the cyanide ion to the ketone.

Wait, but when a ketone reacts with CN- in an acidic condition, what happens? I think sometimes it's called the Stephen reduction or something else. Or maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right! Cyanohydrin formation. That's when a ketone reacts with HCN (but here it's NaCN) in a basic or acidic condition to form a cyanohydrin, which has both an alcohol and a nitrile group.

The reaction for cyanohydrin formation is typically: ketone + HCN → cyanohydrin. But wait, HCN is a weak acid. So in the presence of an acid catalyst, perhaps. Or maybe under basic conditions. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the conditions.

Wait, the general reaction is ketone + HCN → cyanohydrin. But in the presence of an acid, like H3O+, perhaps. So, the reagent A in the first step is H3O+. Because the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which suggests that the CN- added to the carbonyl group and the hydroxyl group also got added.
