Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me think about each symmetry one by one.

First, I remember that the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory that incorporates all possible interactions consistent with the Standard Model symmetries. So, the operators in SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the SM.

Lorentz symmetry: The Standard Model definitely respects Lorentz symmetry. So all the SMEFT operators should preserve this. That makes sense because they're just higher-dimensional operators built from the SM fields, which are Lorentz invariant.

Poincare symmetry: Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. Since the SM respects Poincare, SMEFT should too. But wait, effective theories... do they always have to? I think in SMEFT, you're considering local interactions, so you must have translation invariance, which is part of Poincare. So yes, operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz and translation.

CP symmetry: The SM doesn't always respect CP. For example, the CKM matrix in QCD has CP violation. So, the SMEFT would allow operators that violate CP as well, right? Because the SM itself doesn't enforce CP conservation everywhere. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP. Wait, but wait. The problem is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the SM allows for CP violation
