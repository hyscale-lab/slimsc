Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix elements are given. The matrix A has elements Aij = ħ/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, I need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, I think I need to normalize the state |alpha>. The given state is proportional, so the actual state would be |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] divided by its norm.

The norm squared is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each coefficient. So, for the |up> term, the coefficient is (1+i), whose magnitude squared is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. For the |down> term, the coefficient is (2 - i), so the magnitude squared is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 + 1 =5. Adding these together gives 2+5=7. So the norm is sqrt(7), so |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, I need to understand the operator whose matrix is given. The matrix is 2x2 because the state is in a 2-level system (up and down). The matrix A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. So, the matrix looks like this:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0 ]

So, this is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 on the off-diagonal. Wait, that's a spin-x operator multiplied by ħ/2. Oh, right, because the Pauli matrices sigma_x has 0s on the diagonal and 1s and -1s on the off-diagonal, but wait, no, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, the given operator A is sigma_x multiplied by ħ/2. So A = (ħ/2) sigma_x.

But wait, the eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of A as well. So, to find the eigenstates of A, I can find the eigenstates of sigma_x, then those are the eigenstates of A with the same eigenvalues scaled by ħ/2.

The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1. So for A, the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)(1) = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)(-1) = -ħ/2.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. So, the eigenstates of A are the eigenvectors of sigma_x, which are |+x> and |-x>, perhaps.

So, the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, but we need to express it in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>, to find the probabilities.

So first, I need to find the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are the eigenstates of A.

The eigenstates of sigma_x can be found by solving (sigma_x - lambda I)|v> = 0.

sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, the characteristic equation is (0 - lambda)(0 - lambda) - (1)(1) = 0 → lambda^2 -1 =0 → lambda=1 and lambda=-1.

For lambda=1: (sigma_x - I)|v> = [[-1,1],[1,-1]] |v> =0. So the equations are -v1 + v2=0 → v1=v2. So the eigenvector is (1,1), but normalized. So |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for lambda=-1: (sigma_x + I)|v> = [[1,1],[1,1]] |v> =0 → v1 +v2=0 → v2 = -v1. So the eigenvector is (1, -1), normalized to (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, the eigenstates are:

|+x> = ( |up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2)
|-x> = ( |up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2)

Now, the given |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> all over sqrt(7). We can express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>

So, substituting the expressions for |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = c1 (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c2 (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) )

Grouping terms:

= [ (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

But |alpha> is also equal to [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So, equate the coefficients:

( c1 + c2 ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)  → equation 1
( c1 - c2 ) / sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7) → equation 2

Let me write:

Equation 1: (c1 + c2) = [ (1+i) / sqrt(7) ] * sqrt(2) → [ (1+i) sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)

Equation 2: (c1 - c2) = [ (2 -i) sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)

Now, I can solve for c1 and c2 by adding and subtracting equations.

Add equation 1 and equation 2:

2 c1 = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ) * sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)
→ [ (3) ) * sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)
→ 3 sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)

So c1 = (3 sqrt(2) ) / (2 sqrt(7) )

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

2 c2 = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ) * sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)
→ ( (1+i -2 +i ) ) sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)
→ ( (-1 + 2i ) sqrt(2) ) / sqrt(7)
→ c2 = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more carefully.

Wait, equation 1: (c1 + c2) = (1+i) sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)
equation 2: (c1 - c2) = (2 -i) sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)

Adding them:
2 c1 = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)
= (3) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)
So c1 = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:
2 c2 = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)
= ( (1 +i -2 +i ) ) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= ( (-1) + 2i ) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
c2 = ( (-1) + 2i ) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Now, the probability of measuring |+x> is |c1|^2, and the probability of measuring |-x> is |c2|^2.

So let's compute |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

First, compute c1:

c1 = [3 sqrt(2)] / (2 sqrt(7)) )

So |c1|^2 = (9 * 2) / (4 *7 ) ) = (18) / (28) ) = 9/14 ≈ 0.64286. Hmm, but looking at the options, the probabilities are in 0.64, 0.28, etc. But 9/14 is approximately 0.64286, which is about 0.64.

Wait, but 9/14 is 0.642857... which rounds to 0.643, which is close to 0.64.

Now, |c2|^2: c2 is [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

The magnitude squared is [ | -1 + 2i |^2 * (2) ) ] / (4 * 7 )

Wait, because |a + ib|^2 is a² + b², so | -1 + 2i |^2 = (1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5.

So |c2|^2 = (5 * 2) / (4 *7) = 10/(28) =5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357. Hmm, but when I add 9/14 and 5/14, I get 14/14=1, so that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first option (A) has 0.64 and 0.36. 9/14 is about 0.64286, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36. So the probabilities would be approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, let me compute 9/14 and 5/14 exactly.

9 ÷14 = 0.642857... which is approximately 0.643. 5 ÷14 is approximately 0.357.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36.

That seems to be matching.

But let me check the other parts. The average value of the operator A.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, the average is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x in state |alpha>.

The expectation value of sigma_x is given by <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>, the expectation value would be the sum of probabilities times the eigenvalues.

Wait, because sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |+x> and |-x>.

So, the expectation value <sigma_x> = |c1|^2 * (+1) + |c2|^2 * (-1).

Wait, no, because for an observable, the expectation is sum (p_i * λ_i), where p_i is the probability and λ_i is the eigenvalue.

So, for sigma_x, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1 for |+x> and |-x> respectively.

So, <sigma_x> = |c1|^2 * (+1) + |c2|^2 * (-1) = (9/14)(1) + (5/14)(-1) ) = (9 -5)/14 =4/14=2/7.

So, the expectation of A is (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

Wait, that's interesting. So the average value is ħ/7.

So looking back at the options, option A says the average is hbar/7. So the probabilities would be about 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7. So that's option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the probabilities. Since |alpha> is in terms of |+x> and |-x>, the probabilities are |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

Wait, earlier I thought |c1|^2 is 9/14, which is about 0.64286, and |c2|^2 is 5/14, about 0.357. So the options A says 0.64 and 0.36, which seems to match.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing c1 and c2. Let's re-express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> again.

Given:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Expressed as |alpha> = [ a |up> + b |down> ] / sqrt(7), where a=1+i, b=2-i.

We can write this as:

|alpha> = ( a |up> + b |down> ) / sqrt(7) 

Expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>

Substituting |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So,

|alpha> = c1 (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c2 (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)
= [ (c1 + c2) / sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c1 - c2) / sqrt(2) ] |down>

Set this equal to (a |up> + b |down> ) / sqrt(7)

So,

(c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) = a / sqrt(7)
(c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) = b / sqrt(7)

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2):

c1 + c2 = a sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)
c1 - c2 = b sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)

Adding the two equations:

2 c1 = (a + b) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So,

c1 = (a + b) sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7))

Similarly, subtracting:

2 c2 = (a - b) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
c2 = (a - b) sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7))

Wait, so a is (1+i), b is (2 -i). So a + b is (1+2) + (i -i) =3 +0i=3.

a -b is (1-2) + (i + i ) = (-1) + 2i.

So c1 = 3 * sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) → same as before.

c2 = ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) → same as before.

So |c1|^2 = (3)^2 * (2) / (4 *7) )= 9 *2/(4*7)=18/28=9/14≈0.64286.

|c2|^2= ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) * 2/(4*7) = (1+4)*2/(28) =5*2/(28)=10/28=5/14≈0.357.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average hbar/7. So that's the correct choice.

But wait, what about the other parts of the question? Oh, wait, the first part is to calculate the probabilities, and the second part is the average value.

So, the probabilities are about 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7, which matches option A.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Yes. So that would be the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The norm of the state is calculated as:

\[
\text{Norm}^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7, \quad \text{Norm} = \sqrt{7}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix, scaled by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. Therefore, the eigenstates of \( A \) are the same as those of \( \sigma_x \), with eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \).

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of \( A \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \). Substituting the expressions for \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \), we get:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_1 |+x\rangle + c_2 |-x\rangle,
\]

where:

\[
c_1 = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}\sqrt{2}}, \quad c_2 = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
c_1 = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}, \quad c_2 = \frac{(-1 + 2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are \( |c_1|^2 \) and \( |c_2|^2 \), respectively. Calculating these:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{(-1 + 2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \).

To find the average value of \( A \), we compute \( \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \). Since \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), the expectation value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]

The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) in \( |\alpha\rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = |c_1|^2 (1) + |c_2|^2 (-1) = \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} = \frac{4}{14} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing the results with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \hbar / 7 \).**
