Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, we need to use special relativity. But wait, the problem mentions the speed of light in a vacuum as c=1, so I think that implies we're working in units where c is 1. That might simplify some things.

Wait, but the glass is moving towards the observer. And the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is going in the same direction as the glass, which is towards the observer. Or is it the other way around? Let me re-read that. Oh, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, that's a bit conflicting. Wait, same direction as the beam, and moving toward the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well, same direction as the beam.

Wait no, maybe it's that the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. Since the glass is moving toward the observer, the beam is moving toward the observer too
