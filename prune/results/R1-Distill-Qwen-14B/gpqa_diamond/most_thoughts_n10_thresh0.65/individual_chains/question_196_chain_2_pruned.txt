Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that harmonic oscillators are systems that experience a restoring force proportional to their displacement. But wait, this is relativistic, so I can't ignore special relativity effects here.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let's think about the basics. In the non-relativistic case, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so that formula won't be correct because relativistic effects change the energy expressions.

In relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore; it's E_total - mc², which is (gamma - 1)mc².

But wait, the oscillator's potential energy in the relativistic case might not be the same as the non-relativistic one. Oh right, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², similar to the non-relativistic case, but the total energy is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let
