Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice physics question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that the question is about the excitation of iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars, star_1 and star_2. The key point is that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 in a specific energy level. Oh wait, and the energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The question is about finding the correct equation relating the temperatures T1 and T2, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Alright, so I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the Boltzmann factor describes the population of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference over (k*T), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, the exact formula is n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Oh right, because higher energy states are less populated unless the temperature is very high. 

In this problem, the energy levels are for the iron atoms. Let's say in star 1, the number of atoms in the excited state is twice that of star 2. Wait, no, the problem says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps, the ratio of the populations is 2:1. Alternatively, maybe it's the excitation relative to another level, but I think for the
