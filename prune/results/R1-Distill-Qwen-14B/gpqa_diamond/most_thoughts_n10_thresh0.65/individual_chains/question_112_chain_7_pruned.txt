Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says that there's an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The |up> and |down> states are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, S_z, I suppose. 

The question asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that's a bit confusing. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   0 ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says A_ij = hbar/2 if i is different from j. So for a 2x2 matrix, A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2, and A_11 and A_22 are zero. So yes, that's correct. That operator is probably the spin-x operator, maybe, since spin-x has a similar form.

Then, I need to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of this operator and also the average value of that operator.

The options are given, so I need to compute the probabilities and the average and pick the matching option.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, let's normalize the state |alpha>. Because it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, so I need to find the normalization constant.

The state given is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, but it's only proportional to that. So the actual state would be |alpha> = C * [(1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>], where C is the normalization constant.

To find C, I compute the norm squared of the state without C. The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

Calculating each term:

|1 + i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.

|2 - i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the total squared norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization constant C is 1/sqrt(7), because |C|^2 must be 1.

So |alpha> = (1 + i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the operator in question has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. So this matrix is:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   0 ]

Wait, no, wait. If A_ij is hbar/2 for i≠j, then the matrix is:

Row 1: [0, hbar/2]
Row 2: [hbar/2, 0]

So the operator is A = (hbar/2) ( |up><down| + |down><up| )

Alternatively, this can be written as (hbar/2)( |+><-| + |-><+| ), but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of eigenstates.

The eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of S_x, the spin-x operator. Because S_x has the same matrix form. Wait, S_x is (ħ/2)|+><-| + (ħ/2)|-><+|, so yes, exactly. So the operator A given here is (hbar/2) multiplied by the Pauli X matrix, which is the same as S_x. Wait, no, because S_x is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. But the operator given here is (ħ/2) * (X), so yes. So the eigenvalues would be ± ħ/2,
