Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's like a cage-like molecule. The 1,3-dibromo means there are bromine atoms on two opposite positions of the adamantane structure.

The first reaction is heating this with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides are treated with a base, they usually undergo an elimination reaction, like E2. Since there are two bromine atoms, probably both will leave, and the structure will lose two equivalents of HBr.

Wait, so if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH is used, the elimination would form an alkene. Because each elimination forms a double bond. Since both Br are on opposite positions, maybe the double bond forms across them, making a diene? Or maybe it's a more complex structure. Alternatively, since adamantane is a rigid structure, the elimination would form a bridge or a ring with a double bond.

Wait, another thought: when two vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) react with a base, they eliminate to form an alkene. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a diegeminal structure? No, wait, in adamantane, the positions are on adjacent bridges or something else. Wait, no, 1 and 3 positions are probably not adjacent. So, if KOH is used, maybe each Br leaves, and the two adjacent carbons (which were each attached to a Br) form a double bond. Oh, wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the carbons are not adjacent. Hmm, perhaps that's not possible for elimination... Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, because elimination generally occurs when adjacent (vicinal) halides eliminate to form a double bond. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the two Br are on non-adjacent carbons. So, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. Wait, adamantane has bridgehead carbons, which are known for being able to have double bonds because of their unique structure. So, when KOH is added, perhaps each Br on bridgehead carb
