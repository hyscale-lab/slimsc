Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Hmm, I need to figure out the criteria for each instrument and then check each star against them.

From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, no, actually, the question states that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17? Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star's apparent V mag is <=17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So apparent V mag <=16.

So the stars need to have apparent V magnitudes <=17 (for ESPRESSO) and <=16 (for HIRES). Wait, wait, wait a second. Wait, no. The question says, with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent magnitudes brighter than 17, which I think means apparent V mag <17. Same with HIRES: stars brighter than 16, so apparent V mag <16.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: higher magnitudes are dimmer. So a star with V mag 16 is brighter than a star with V mag 17. So if a spectrograph can detect stars brighter than 17, that would mean all stars with V <17. Similarly, for HIRES
