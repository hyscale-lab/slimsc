Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, okay, let's see. The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between those levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The stars are in LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies.

I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in different energy states is described by the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, in this question, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me think, 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh right! So, if the energy difference ΔE is equal to k*T, that would imply a certain temperature, but here the energy difference is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k for T=1 K because k*T = k*1 = 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So, if I rearrange the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of the populations would depend on the temperatures of the two stars.

In the question, the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So the ratio n1/n2 is 2. Wait no, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So the population in the excited state for star_1 is higher than star_2. I think the ratio is n1/n2 = 2, assuming the same energy level. Or wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me read again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for star_1, n1 is twice that of star_2's n2. So n1 = 2 n2.

Wait, but the Boltzmann equation is for the ratio of two levels
