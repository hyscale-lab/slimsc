Okay, so I've got this question here about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at the Paranal Observatory and HIRES at the Keck Observatory. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand the capabilities of each spectrograph. From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Oh right, the question says: ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag in V. Wait, no, wait: when it says "brighter than 17 mag", does that mean magnitude less than 17? Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. Oh right, yeah—so if a star has an apparent magnitude of 17, that's pretty faint. So ESPRESSO can detect stars with V mag <=17, because if a star is brighter (lower mag), it's easier to see.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So that's apparent V magnitudes less than or equal to 16. So a star that's 16 mag or brighter can be detected by HIRES.

So the goal is to find which stars are detectable by both. So a star must have an apparent V magnitude <=17 for ESPRESSO, and <=16 for HIRES. Wait, wait no—because for a star to be detected by both, it must be
