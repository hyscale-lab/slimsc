Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me start by breaking down the question and the information given. The question is about a reaction involving Substance X and Liquid Y, producing Gas W, Precipitate G, and eventually another substance B. I need to figure out what Substance X is, based on the clues, and then calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in it.

First, let me list out the given information:

1. Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.
2. X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons.
3. A precipitate G forms. When heated, G releases B, whose melting point is very close to 277 K.
4. The product of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms.
5. X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. The lightest and heaviest elements in X are to be considered for their atomic masses.

Hmm. Let's think step by step.

First, what's the melting point near 277 K? 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. So what substance has a melting point around there? Wait, maybe I should think about what B is. If G is the precipitate that releases B when heated, perhaps G is a salt that decomposes upon heating to give B. Let me think. If B has a melting point near 277 K, maybe B is a solid at room temperature but just a few degrees above 0. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like water, but water freezes at 273 K (which is 0°C). Wait, the melting point is close to 277 K, which is about 4°C. Hmm, maybe it's not water. Alternatively, maybe B is some other compound. But I'm not certain yet.

Next, the gas W. Its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule is made of atoms where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. Common gases are O2, N2, H2, CO2, etc. Let me see: for example, H2 has 1 proton and 1 neutron each atom, so the molecule would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Wait, but the question says the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So for a molecule like H2, each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's de
