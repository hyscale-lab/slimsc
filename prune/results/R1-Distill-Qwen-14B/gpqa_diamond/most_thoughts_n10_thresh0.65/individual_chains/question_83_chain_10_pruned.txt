Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So the reaction should be something like CH3COOH reacting with NaOH to form CH3COO^- Na+ and water.

First, the problem says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. I think I need to calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) /40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Oh wait, yeah, because 20+20 is 40.

So the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. At 25% titration, how much NaOH is added? Hmm, let me think. The volume of NaOH would be 25% of the equivalence point volume. Because at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized. So first I need to find the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence.

The acetic acid solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M. Moles of acetic acid = Molarity * Volume in liters. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Because acetic acid is CH3COOH, with molar mass around 60, but since it's in moles, I don't need the mass. For the equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH = 0.001. Since NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, the volume would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Oh wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. Right.

So at 25% titration, the NaOH added is 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³. Hmm, but wait, another approach is: the amount of NaOH added is 25% of the equivalence point. Alternatively, the moles of NaOH added at 25% would be 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

Wait, no. Let me think again. At equivalence, moles NaOH = moles acetic acid. So n_NaOH = n_acetic = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. So at
