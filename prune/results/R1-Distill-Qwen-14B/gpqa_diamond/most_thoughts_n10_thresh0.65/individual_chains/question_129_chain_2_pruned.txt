Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again.

The question describes a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through several steps to form compound E. I need to identify what E is, and the options are given from A to D.

First, let me outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:

Hint a: When compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hint b: The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

Alright, let's break this down.

Starting with the reactions:

1. A + HCN → B
   - HCN adds to a carbonyl group, probably. So A likely has a ketone or aldehyde group. The IR peak at 1750 cm^-1 supports this because that's typically for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. If A is a ketone, adding HCN would form an cyanohydrin (B). The product would have an alcohol (-OH) and a nitrile (-CN) group added to the original carbonyl.

2. B → C via H2 and Pd
   - H2 with Pd is hydrogenation. Since B has a nitrile group, hydrogenation could reduce the nitrile to an amine (-CH2NH2?), but wait, wait. Wait, when you hydrogenate a nitrile (R-CN) with H2 and Pd, it's typically reduced to an amine (R-CH2-NH2), but under certain conditions, like in presence of acid, maybe something else happens. Alternatively, another possibility is that if B has a ketone, and another functional group, but I think more likely the nitrile is being reduced.

Wait, another thought. If B is a cyanohydrin (from A being a ketone), then B has an -OH and -CN group adjacent. Then, in the presence of H2 and Pd, what happens? The nitrile group (-CN) is hydrogenated. So R-CN becomes R-CH2-NH2? Or does the Pd catalyst lead to a different product? Wait, no, I think more accurately, the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine. So for example, R-CN + H2 → R-CH2-NH2. Alternatively, sometimes with H2 and a catalyst, a nitrile can be reduced to a primary amine: R-CH2-NH2.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the hydrogenation is of a different group. Let's think again. If compound B comes from a ketone reacting with HCN, then structure of B would be something like (R)(R')C(OH)CN. Wait, no, more accurately, the cyanoh
