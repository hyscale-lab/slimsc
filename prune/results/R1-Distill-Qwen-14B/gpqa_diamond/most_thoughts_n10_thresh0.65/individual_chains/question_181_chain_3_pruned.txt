Okay, so I've got this neutrino flux question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. 

The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The pp-III branch, I remember, is one of the proton-proton chains that contribute to the Sun's fusion. Wait, no, wait. The main pp-I chain is the most common, right? Then there are other branches like pp-II and pp-III. Oh wait, I think I might have mixed up the details. So, the pp-I chain is the dominant one, producing helium-4 from two protons. The pp-II and pp-III are alternative branches, maybe producing different elements or isotopes.

But the question specifically mentions pp-III stopping. Hmm. So neutrinos are produced in different processes. The main pp chain produces neutrinos via the beta decay steps. But other branches might contribute as well. Oh wait, the pp-III branchâ€”I think it's involved in producing carbon-12 maybe, as part of the CNO cycle? No, wait, the CNO cycle is a different process altogether. The pp chains are all about fusing protons into helium.

Wait, the pp-III branch might involve boron or something. Let me think. Oh right, the pp-III branch produces a neutron, but wait, that's not possible because the Sun is mostly protons. Oh wait, maybe it's part of the proton-proton chain that leads to carbon. So, in the pp-III branch, three protons fuse in a way that produces a helium-3,
