Okay, I have this question about mitochondrial function and a drug's effect on it. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the question is about which experiment won't help determine the mitochondrial role of a new anti-diabetes drug. The experiments are options A to D. I'm a bit rusty on some of these techniques, but let me think.

The question mentions that the drug is tested on HEK293 cells, which are a common cell line. The experiments are meant to assess mitochondrial function or presence.

Let me break down each option:

Option A: Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by a Glucose Uptake Assay. Differential centrifugation is a standard method to isolate mitochondria. So, if the drug affects mitochondria, their ability to take up glucose (which they can't, wait, noâ€”mitochondria don't directly take up glucose because they rely on the TCA cycle intermediates, right? Wait, but wait, HEK cells are mammalian. Oh, but glucose uptake is usually in the cytosol. Hmm. Or maybe the assay measures something else. Alternatively, maybe it's looking at glycolysis. Wait, but the option says after extracting mitochondria. Oh, wait, differential centrifugation would pellet the mitochondria, so if you extract them, you're looking at mitochondrial function. But the assay is for glucose uptake. Wait, mitochondria themselves don't take up glucose. Glucose is processed in the cytosol, broken down into pyruvate, which then enters the mitochondria. So if you're looking at glucose uptake, maybe that's a
