Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. Let's see what I can figure out.

The problem says that Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, protons and neutrons in a molecule? Wait, no, each molecule. So each molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, for example, if a molecule has a certain number of atoms, each contributing their own protons and neutrons.

Wait, maybe I should think about the simplest case. Let's think about possible gases. A common gas that's a product of such reactions is H2 gas. Wait, but H2 has 1 proton each, so each molecule would have 2 protons (since each H atom contributes 1). But each H also has 0 neutrons (since protium has 0). So that doesn't fit because the number of neutrons and protons in the molecule would be different. Wait, maybe O2? No, oxygen-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. If it's O2, each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so the molecule would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Oh, wait, yeah, that fits because 16 each. So W would be O2? Or maybe another diatomic gas like O2 or N2?
