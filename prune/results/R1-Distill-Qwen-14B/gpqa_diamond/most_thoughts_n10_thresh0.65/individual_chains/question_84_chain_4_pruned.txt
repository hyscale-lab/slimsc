Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor that converts a sequential algorithm into a parallel one when approximating the matrix exponential function with a fractional approximation. Hmm.

Let me think. I remember that when solving PDEs like the heat equation, finite difference methods are commonly used. Higher order methods improve accuracy, but they can lead to large systems of equations. Solving these systems efficiently is crucial, especially in parallel computing environments.

The question mentions parallel splitting. I think that refers to methods like the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method, which splits the problem into simpler parts that can be solved sequentially but in a way that allows parallel computation. ADI is often used for higher-dimensional problems because it breaks the problem into lower-dimensional problems at each step.

Now, the matrix exponential comes into play when solving systems of linear differential equations. The solution can be expressed using the matrix exponential of the system's operator multiplied by time. But computing the matrix exponential directly is expensive, especially for large matrices. So approximations are used, and the question states it's a fractional approximation.

The key factor for converting a sequential algorithm to parallel: I'm trying to recall what makes a method parallel. For ADI, the splitting allows each split part to be solved independently, which can be done in parallel. So how does this connect to the matrix exponential?

Fractional approximation methods... I've heard about methods like Padé approximants, which approximate functions (like the matrix exponential) using rational functions. Padé approximants can be more efficient than Taylor series because they often provide better accuracy for a given order. But how does that relate to parallelism?

Wait, in the context of time discretization, maybe using a fractional approximation allows the time-stepping to be split into stages that can be computed in parallel. Alternatively, the approximation might allow the system to be rewritten in a way that each part can be handled by a different processor.

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: That's important for ensuring the numerical method works correctly, but I don't think it's the key factor in making it parallel.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal conditions might complicate the problem, but how does that tie into parallelism? Maybe not directly.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Fractional approximations could have rational functions with poles and zeros. If the roots are complex, perhaps that affects the stability or the form of the approximation, but I'm not sure how that leads to parallel algorithms.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Breaking the approximation into partial fractions might decompose the problem into parts that can be handled separately, allowing parallel computation. For example, partial fraction decomposition can split a complex rational function into simpler fractions, each corresponding to a different term that can be computed in parallel.

Alternatively, for the matrix exponential, if the approximation can be expressed as a sum of terms that each involve powers of matrices that can be computed independently, that might allow parallel computation.

Wait, another angle: Matrix exponentials can be split using the Kronecker product or tensor decomposition if the approximation can be factored. But maybe the partial fractions allow for such a decomposition.

So, if the fractional approximation can be linearly decomposed into partial fractions, each part can be computed separately and in parallel. That would make the sequential algorithm (which computes each step one after
