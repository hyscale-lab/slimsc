Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question involves a reaction where 3-methylpyrrolidine is treated with compound A in the presence of a catalyst B, along with heat and a solvent. The product formed is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to choose the right reagent A and catalyst B from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when amines react in certain conditions, they can form various products. Since the product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine, I'm thinking this might be some kind of alkylation or maybe an elimination reaction.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a secondary amine. If we're talking about an acid-catalyzed reaction, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of alkylation, like a Friedel-Crafts alkylation but wait, pyrrolidine isn't an aromatic ring. Oh wait, Friedel-Crafts is for aromatic rings. Maybe it's an alkylation via a carbocation.

Alternatively, I think about the possibility of forming an iminium ion. Oh, right, in the presence of an acid catalyst, amines can form iminium ions. This is often used in reactions like the Stork enamine synthesis. Enamines are formed by reacting an amine with a ketone or aldehyde, typically in two steps: first, the amine is protonated, then reacts with a carbonyl to form a hemiaminal, which upon elimination of water forms an iminium ion, and then the iminium reacts with another carbonyl or something else.

Wait, but the product here has a cyclohexylidene group attached. Let me think: cyclohexylidene implies a cyclohexane ring with a double bond. So maybe the reaction forms a ring by removing a proton and forming a double bond.

Wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. That structureâ€”so the pyrrolidine ring has a substituent at position 1, which is a cyclohexylidene methyl group. So the substituent is a methylene group attached to a cyclohexene ring, perhaps. So the substituent is a CH2 connected to a cyclohexene.
