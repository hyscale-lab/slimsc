Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about a star that's being observed. The star has the same radius as the Sun, so R_star = R_sun. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. These variations would look similar to those caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

The question is asking: to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if there were no spots), what would be the radius of an exoplanet relative to the star's radius? So, we need to find R_pl / R_star.

Hmm. Okay, I remember that the transit method for detecting exoplanets works because when a planet passes in front of the star, it blocks some of the star's light. The amount of light blocked depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. The change in brightness (the dip) is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is π R_pl² divided by π R_star², so the ratio squared.

But wait, in this case, the star's brightness variation isn't due to a planet, but due to spots. So the problem is about comparing the brightness variation caused by spots to that caused by a planet.

Let me think about how the spots affect the star's brightness. Spots are cooler than the rest of the star. So when a spot is facing us, it contributes less light than the surrounding area. As the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view, causing the total brightness to dip slightly each time.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and how much cooler they are. The key here is to calculate the fractional change in brightness (delta F) caused by the spots, and then find what planet radius would cause the same delta F.

Let me try to model this.

First, when the star is unspotted, its surface emits uniformly with a temperature T_eff. The flux from the star is F = σ T_eff^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since the star is only emitting from areas with different temperatures, the total flux will be a combination of the normal areas and the spotted areas.

Wait, but the star isn't entirely uniform. Let's break it down.

The star's surface has two regions: the unspotted areas and the spotted areas. The filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere, so let's say the hemisphere's area is A_hemisphere = 2π R^2 (since the surface area of a sphere is 4π R², a hemisphere is 2π R²). The spotted area is 20% of that, so 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So if the hemisphere has an area of 2π R², the spotted area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

So when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the total flux from the star would be:

Flux = (Area_unspotted * F_unspotted) + (Area_spotted * F_spotted)

F_unspotted is the flux from the normal star, which is σ T_eff^4.

F_spotted is σ (T_eff - ΔT)^4 = σ (6000 - 1000)^4 = σ (5000)^4.

So the flux without any spots is:

F0 = (Area_unspotted + Area_spotted) * F_unspotted
Wait, no, because when the hemisphere is spotty, the total area of the star visible is the same. But part of the hemisphere is cooler. So the total flux when the spotty side is visible is:

F = (Area_unspotted / A_hemisphere) * F_unspotted + (Area_spotted / A_hemisphere) * F_spotted.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again.

The star is a sphere. The hemisphere that is spotty is one side; the other hemisphere is unspotted. So when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the area we see is the spotty hemisphere. The other hemisphere (unspotted) is on the back and not visible.

Wait, no. Actually, when you observe a star, you see half of its surface (the hemisphere facing you). So if the star is such that the front hemisphere has spots covering 20% of its area, then when it's facing us, 20% of the area we see is cooler.

So the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is:

F_spotty = (0.8 * A_visible * F_unspotted) + (0.2 * A_visible * F_spotted)

Where A_visible is the area of the hemisphere, which is 2π R². But in terms of relative to the total flux when the star isn't spotty, perhaps we can model this.

Wait, the total flux when the star is not spotty is F0 = A_visible * F_unspotted.

When the star is spotty, the flux is F = (0.8 * A_visible) * F_unspotted + (0.2 * A_visible) * F_spotted.

So the difference in flux (the dip) would be F0 - F.

Wait, no. Wait, F0 is the flux when the star is not spotty. But in reality, the star is partially spotty. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower because some of the area is cooler. So F_dip = F0 * (1 - (0.2 * (F_spotted / F_unspotted))).

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's compute the ratio of the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible compared to when it's not.

Flux ratio = [ (0.8 * F_unspotted) + (0.2 * F_spotted) ] / F_unspotted.

So the fractional change in flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

delta_F = 1 - [ (0.8 * F_unspotted + 0.2 * F_spotted ) / F_unspotted ]

Which simplifies to:

delta_F = 1 - [ 0.8 + 0.2 * (F_spotted / F_unspotted) ]

Because F_unspotted is F0.

So,

delta_F = 1 - 0.8 - 0.2 * (F_spotted / F_unspotted)
= 0.2 - 0.2 * (F_spotted / F_unspotted)

Wait, but wait. F_spotted is less than F_unspotted, so F_spotted / F_unspotted is less than 1. So the term 0.2 * (F_spotted / F_unspotted) is subtracted from 0.8, but wait in the flux ratio, it's 0.8 + 0.2 * (F_spotted/F_unspotted).

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo it.

The flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F_spotty = 0.8 * F_unspotted + 0.2 * F_spotted.

The flux when no spots are visible (the other hemisphere is facing us) is F_unspotted = F0.

So the dip in flux is F0 - F_spotty = F0 - (0.8 F0 + 0.2 F_spotted ) = F0 (1 - 0.8) - 0.2 F_spotted.

= 0.2 F0 - 0.2 F_spotted = 0.2 (F0 - F_spotted).

So the fractional dip is (F0 - F_spotty)/F0 = 0.2 (F0 - F_spotted)/F0.

Which is 0.2 (1 - F_spotted/F0).

Hmm, alternatively, the fractional dip is (F0 - F_spotty)/F0.

So,

(F0 - F_spotty)/F0 = 1 - (F_spotty/F0)

But F_spotty = 0.8 F_unspotted + 0.2 F_spotted.

Since F_unspotted = F0, because F0 is the flux of the entire star, which is the same as the hemisphere's flux when it's unspotted. Wait, no, because F0 is the flux when you're seeing the entire star. But in our case, when the spotty hemisphere is visible, you're seeing a hemisphere with 20% spots. So perhaps F0 is the flux when the entire star is unspotted, but when the star is spotty, you're seeing a hemisphere with spots and another without.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me think differently. Let me model the star as a sphere where one hemisphere is spotted (20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots). So when that hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F1. When the other (unspotted) hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F2.

But wait, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The unspotted areas are at 6000 K, the spotted areas at 5000 K.

So, the flux from the spotty hemisphere (when it's the one we see) is:

F_spotty = (0.8 * A_hemi) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.2 * A_hemi) * σ (5000)^4.

But the total area of the hemisphere is A_hemi = 2π R².

So,

F_spotty = [0.8 * (2π R²) * σ (6000)^4 ] + [ 0.2 * (2π R²) * σ (5000)^4 ].

The flux from the unspotty hemisphere (when that's the one we see) is:

F_unspotty = (2π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

So, the flux when the spotty side is facing us is F_spotty, and when the other side is facing us, it's F_unspotty.

So the difference in flux is F_unspotty - F_spotty.

The fractional change in brightness is (F_unspotty - F_spotty) / F_unspotty.

Let me compute that.

Compute F_unspotty = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

F_spotty = 0.8 * 2π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 * 2π R² σ (5000)^4.

So,

F_unspotty - F_spotty = [ 2π R² σ (6000)^4 ] - [ 0.8 * 2π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 * 2π R² σ (5000)^4 ]

= 2π R² σ (6000)^4 (1 - 0.8) - 0.2 * 2π R² σ (5000)^4.

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000)^4 - 0.2 * 2π R² σ (5000)^4.

Factor out 0.2 * 2π R² σ:

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ [ (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 ].

Then, the fractional dip is [ (F_unspotty - F_spotty) ] / F_unspotty.

Which is [ 0.2 * 2π R² σ [ (6000^4 - 5000^4) ] ] / [ 2π R² σ (6000^4) ].

Simplify:

= 0.2 * [ (6000^4 -5000^4) / (6000^4) ) ].

= 0.2 * [ 1 - (5000/6000)^4 ].

Compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

So (5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.482253.

1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.103549.

So the fractional dip is approximately 0.1035, or about 10.35% dip.

Wait, but that's when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, and the other hemisphere is the unspotted one. So the maximum dip is about 10.35% of the star's flux.

Wait, but in reality, the star is a sphere. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see that. But when the other (unspotted) hemisphere is facing us, the flux is higher because all that area is at 6000 K. So the difference in flux between the two hemispheres would cause a periodic variation as the star rotates.

But the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty, which is lower than when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us (F_unspotty).

So the maximum dip in flux is F_unspotty - F_spotty, which we calculated as about 0.1035 F_unspotty.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots come into and out of view. So the brightness variation would alternate between F_spotty and F_unspotty, leading to a light curve that goes down to F_spotty, then back up to F_unspotty as the other hemisphere comes into view.

Wait no, when the star is viewed from Earth, as it rotates, the spotty and unspotted regions come into and out of view. So the maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us (F_unspotty). The minimum occurs when the spotty hemisphere is facing us (F_spotty). So the amplitude is the difference between F_unspotty and F_spotty, which is approximately 0.1035 F_unspotty.

Wait, but the problem states that the situation resembles an exoplanet transit. So when the exoplanet transits, the flux drops by (R_planet / R_star)^2, assuming the planet covers a small part of the star.

Wait, no. Wait, the transit method's dip is (Area_planet / Area_star), which is (π R_p²) / (π R_s²) = (R_p / R_s)^2.

So the dip is (R_p / R_s)^2, but that's under the assumption that the planet blocks a fraction of the star's light proportional to its area.

So in the problem, the star's brightness variation is due to the spots, which cause a dip of about 0.1035 F (so about 10% dip). The question is, what planet radius would cause the same dip if the star were not spotty.

Wait, wait. The question says, "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star."

So, the amplitude when the star is spotty is the dip when the spotty side is facing us. The amplitude when a planet transits is the dip caused by the planet blocking a part of the star. We need these two dips to be the same.

Wait, but the star's dip is 0.1035 F, and the planet's dip is (R_p / R_s)^2 F. So setting them equal:

(R_p / R_s)^2 F = 0.1035 F.

So, (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.1035.

Taking the square root: R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

But looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which is close to 0.3217.

Wait, but wait a minute. The dip caused by the spots is the fractional change, which we found to be approximately 0.1035. So the planet would need to cause a dip of 0.1035, which would require R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217 or about 32% of the star's radius. But that's a very large planet, larger than Jupiter (which is about 10% of the Sun's radius). This doesn't seem right because a planet the size of a star would be a brown dwarf or something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I confused the fractional dip when the star is spotty. Let me go back.

Wait, when the star is half spotted (one hemisphere), and the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the spotty hemisphere has 20% of its area in spots. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is F_spotty = 0.8 * F_unspotty_hemi + 0.2 * F_spotted_hemi.

Wait, but the entire star emits, so when you see the unspotted hemisphere, the flux is F_unspotty_hemi, but when you see the spotty hemisphere, the flux is F_spotty_hemi.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

The star's total surface area is 4π R². But when viewed from Earth, we only see a hemisphere, 2π R². So when the star isn't spotted, the flux is F0 = σ T_eff^4 * 2π R².

When the star is spotted, the hemisphere facing us is spotty. So the flux is F1 = (0.8 * F_unspotted) + (0.2 * F_spotted), where F_unspotted is σ (6000)^4 and F_spotted is σ (5000)^4.

So F1 = (0.8 * (σ 6000^4) + 0.2 * (σ 5000^4)) * 2π R².

The flux without any spots (if the star were unspotted) would be F0 = (σ 6000^4) * 2π R².

The dip when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is F0 - F1.

So the fractional dip is (F0 - F1) / F0.

Let me compute F0 and F1.

F0 = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

F1 = 2π R² [ 0.8 σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 σ (5000)^4 ].

So F0 - F1 = 2π R² σ [ (6000^4) - 0.8 (6000^4) - 0.2 (5000^4) ].

= 2π R² σ [ 0.2 (6000^4) - 0.2 (5000^4) ) ]

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4 )

So the fractional dip is:

( F0 - F1 ) / F0 = [ 0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4 ) ] / [ 2π R² σ (6000^4) ]

Simplify: 0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4) / 6000^4.

= 0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

As before, (5000/6000)=5/6≈0.8333.

(5/6)^4= (625)/(1296)=≈0.482253.

So 1-0.482253=0.517747.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 *0.517747 ≈0.103549.

So the fractional dip is approximately 0.1035 or about 10.35%.

So the amplitude (dip) is about 10.35% of the star's flux.

Now, for an exoplanet, the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

We need this dip to be equal to 0.1035.

So:

(R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.1035.

Take the square root:

R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

So approximately 0.32, which is option D.

But wait, that would mean the planet is about 32% the radius of the star, which is a very large planet. For instance, Jupiter's radius is about 11% of the Sun's radius. So 0.32 would be a planet larger than Jupiter, perhaps a sub-brown dwarf. But the question is about the hypothetical scenario, so it's acceptable.

Wait, but the options include option C as 0.11, which is about sqrt(0.0121) = 0.11. So that would be a dip of about 1.2%.

But our calculated dip is 10.35%, which would require a planet with R_p ≈ 0.32 R_s.

Looking back at the options, option D is ~0.32, which seems correct.

But wait, another thought: the star's radius is the same as the Sun, R_s = R_sun. So the planet would have R_p = 0.32 R_sun. But wait, that's a radius larger than Jupiter's, which is correct for a planet causing a dip of about 10%?

Wait, no, wait, let's compute (0.32 R_sun / R_sun)^2 = 0.1024, which is approximately 10.24% dip. Which matches our calculation.

So the correct answer would be option D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots and compare it to the dip caused by a transiting planet.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - Spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's brightness variation arises from the temperature difference between the spotted and unspotted regions. When the spotty hemisphere faces the observer, the total flux is reduced due to the cooler spots.
   - The fractional change in brightness (\( \Delta F \)) is calculated as:
     \[
     \Delta F = 1 - \left( 0.8 + 0.2 \cdot \frac{\sigma T_{\text{spots}}^4}{\sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4} \right),
     \]
     where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Simplifying:
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.2 \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spots}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right).
     \]
     Substituting \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \frac{T_{\text{spots}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} = \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.8333, \quad \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823.
     \]
     Thus:
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.4823) = 0.2 \cdot 0.5177 \approx 0.1035 \, \text{(or 10.35%)}.
     \]

3. **Exoplanet Comparison**:
   - The brightness dip caused by a transiting planet is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
     \]
   - To match the spotted star's brightness variation (\( \Delta F = 0.1035 \)):
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035.
     \]
     Taking the square root:
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \), which corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
