Okay, so I've got this question here about the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of atoms X and Y. Theyâ€™re in their fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause them to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, what's the fundamental state? Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state of the molecule. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to the next higher energy state. But wait, the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, I think that refers to the next higher energy state after the fundamental.

So the molecule is modeled using both rotation and vibration. Oh, right, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational states. But wait, usually, the rigid rotor model deals with rotation, and the quantum harmonic oscillator deals with vibration. But here it's the non-rigid rotor, which probably means that the bond length isn't fixed, so the rotational and vibrational energies are coupled or considered together.

Wait, maybe the molecule can change both its rotational and vibrational states when a photon is absorbed. But the question is asking for the momentum of the photon. Hmm.

Let me think about the energy changes involved. The photon's energy must match the energy difference between the two states. So the energy of the photon is equal to the energy difference between the initial and final states.

Wait, but the molecule is in its
