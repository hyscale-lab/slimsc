Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, it's about matrices and some properties related to them. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question gives me four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix. The task is to look at the options A to D and pick the correct statement based on these matrices.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and the time evolution operators are unitary matrices. So I should probably check the properties of these matrices to see if they fit these categories.

Let me go through each part of the question.

Option A says: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes. Wait, e^X is the matrix exponential. For the norm to change (i.e., the vector's length isn't preserved), e^X must not be unitary. So I need to check if X is Hermitian because the exponential of a Hermitian matrix is unitary. If X isn't Hermitian, then e^X wouldn't be unitary, and thus there exists a vector where the norm changes.

So what's X? Let's look at X:

X = [i, -1, 2i;
     1, 0, 1;
     2i, -1, -i]

Wait, to check if X is Hermitian, the matrix should equal its conjugate transpose. Let's compute the conjugate transpose.

The conjugate transpose (dagger) of X would have elements (X†)_{jk} = conjugate(X_{kj}).

Let me compute X†:

First row of X is [i, -1, 2i]. So first column of X† is conjugate of each element in first row of X.

Conjugate of i is -i. Conjugate of -1 is -1. Conjugate of 2i is -2i.

So X† first column is [-i, -1, -2i]?

Wait, no. Wait, let me think. The first row of X is the first column of X†, but each element is conjugated.

So if X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Then X† would be:

Column 1 of X becomes row 1 of X†, each conjugated.

So column 1 of X is [i, 1, 2i]^T. Conjugate: [-i, 1, -2i].

So X† row 1: [-i, -1, -2i]? Wait, no. Wait, row 1 of X† is the conjugate of column 1 of X.

Wait, perhaps I should write X† as:

[X†] = [ [i*, (-1)*, (2i)* ],
          [1*, 0*, 1* ],
          [ (2i)*, (-1)*, (-i)* ] ]

Which would be:

[ -i, -1, -2i,
  1, 0, 1,
  -2i, -1, i ]

Wait, but let me actually compute each element.

[X†]_{1,1} = conjugate(X_{1,1}) = conjugate(i) = -i.
[X†]_{1,2} = conjugate(X_{2,1}) = conjugate(1) = 1.
[X†]_{1,3} = conjugate(X_{3,1}) = conjugate(2i) = -2i.

[X†]_{2,1} = conjugate(X_{1,2}) = conjugate(-1) = -1.
[X†]_{2,2} = conjugate(X_{2,2}) = 0.
[X†]_{2,3} = conjugate(X_{3,2}) = conjugate(-1) = -1.

[X†]_{3,1} = conjugate(X_{
