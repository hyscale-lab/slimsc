Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator A_y is given as a 2x2 matrix represented by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S has specific entries. I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and determine which of the given statements is correct.

Wait, let me parse this again. The setup is that A_y is a matrix operator. The matrix S has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So S is a 2x2 matrix. Then c is h/(4π), so A_y = c * S.

I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0. So I should probably compute that.

First, let me write down S:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Then A_y = c * S, so the matrix is:

A_y = [[0, -i c],
       [i c, 0]]

Now, the eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix (A_y - λ I) is:

[[-λ, -i c],
 [i c, -λ]]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i c)(i c) = λ² - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Wait, let me compute that. The product (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) * c² = (-i^2) c². Since i^2 is -1, this becomes -(-1) c² = c². So the determinant is λ² - c² = 0. So the equation is λ² = c².

Taking square roots, λ = ±c. So the eigenvalues are +c and -c.

Wait, but what's c? c is h/(4π). So eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So for A_y, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). But wait, looking at the options, I don't see this directly. Let me check the options again.

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, real ±h/(4π). Wait, that can't be right because the eigenvalues we found are purely real (since c is real, and λ is ±c). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, so their imaginary parts are zero. Option A's eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts, which doesn't fit. So A is incorrect.

Option B: eigenvalues' imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Again, our eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts are zero, so B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az, the Z-component. Hmm. I remember that for angular momentum, the ladder operators Jx, Jy, Jz don't commute, but J² and Jz do. But wait, A is the intrinsic angular momentum, and it's an operator similar to angular momentum. So for angular momentum, the eigenfunctions of J² and Jz are the same. But what about Jx? The eigenfunctions of Jx and Jy are different. So if a state is an eigenfunction of Jx, it's not an eigenfunction of Jz, but it is an eigenfunction of J². Wait, no, because J² commutes with all components. So any eigenfunction of Jx is also an eigenfunction of J², because J² commutes with Jx. So, if φ is an eigenfunction of A_y, then it's also an eigenfunction of A². But what about Az? Az is another component, which doesn't commute with Ay. So φ can't be an eigenfunction of Az. So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That seems correct. So option C might be the correct answer.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, what does this mean? Basis functions would be the eigenvectors. But all operators have their own eigenbasis. So the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So any vector can be expressed in terms of these eigenvectors. But when the question says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, I'm not sure. Wait, the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors should form a basis for C^2. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. I think that's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. But I'm not entirely sure. So I need to evaluate each option.

Let me think again. The eigenvalues are real, so the statement in C is about eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A². Is that true? Because A² is the square of the angular momentum operator. For the spin-½ system, A² is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) times 3 I, because the eigenvalues for spin are s(s+1) ħ², but for s=1/2, this is (3/4) ħ². So A² is a multiple of the identity matrix.

In this problem, A is the intrinsic angular momentum, so A² is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) * 3 I, perhaps. Wait, but let's compute A². A is a 2x2 matrix, so A² would be a 2x2 matrix. Let me compute S².

S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let's compute S squared:

S^2 = S * S = 

First row, first element: (0)(0) + (-i)(i) = 0 + (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

First row, second element: (0)(-i) + (-i)(0) = 0.

Second row, first element: (i)(0) + (0)(i) = 0.

Second row, second element: (i)(-i) + (0)(0) = -i^2 = -(-1) =1.

So S^2 is the identity matrix. So S^2 = I.

Then A = c S, so A² = (c S)^2 = c² S² = c² I.

So A² is a multiple of the identity matrix. So any vector is an eigenvector of A², with eigenvalue c². So if φ is an eigenvector of A_y, then it's also an eigenvector of A². So statement C is correct.

But wait, statement C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So yes, because A² commutes with A_y, so their eigenfunctions can be the same. But Az is another component, which doesn't commute, so the eigenvectors of Ay are not eigenvectors of Az. So statement C is correct.

Now, looking at the options, only option C and D could be correct. Let me look at option D again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors (assuming they're distinct) form a basis. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. So statement D is correct. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because the matrix is 2x2, it's acting on a two-dimensional space. The eigenvectors are two, and they form a basis. So D's statement seems correct.

Wait, but in this case, the matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is a 2x2 matrix. Let's find its eigenvectors.

The eigenvalues are c and -c, as we found earlier.

For λ = c, we have (A_y - c I) = [[-c, -i c], [i c, -c]]. To find the eigenvectors, we solve (A_y - c I) φ =0.

The equations are:

-c φ₁ - i c φ₂ = 0 → φ₁ = -i φ₂.

So eigenvectors are proportional to (-i, 1). So φ = [ -i, 1 ]^T (up to a scalar multiple). Similarly, for λ = -c, the eigenvectors are [i, 1]^T.

These vectors are the basis vectors for the space. So the eigenfunctions are indeed the basis functions for the operator. So statement D is correct.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier thought on option C. So which is correct?

Wait, let me go back to the options. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

As we saw, A^2 is c² I, so any vector is an eigenfunction of A^2 with eigenvalue c². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A^2, which is correct. So C is correct.

Then, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That is also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, this suggests that both C and D could be correct. But looking back, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, let me check each option again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So the eigenfunctions form a basis. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors should form a basis (assuming they are two and linearly independent). So for a 2x2 matrix, if it has two distinct eigenvalues, the eigenvectors are linearly independent and form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but which one of the options is correct as per the problem. The options are to choose one correct statement.

Wait, perhaps both C and D are correct, but that can't be since it's multiple choice. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering option C. Let me think about A². If the operator Ay has eigenfunctions φ, then since A² is c² I, which is a multiple of the identity, then any vector is an eigenfunction of A². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A² as well. So statement C is correct.

But what about option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis, then D is correct. But wait, in the question, the operator is represented by the matrix with a specific form. The basis functions are the eigenvectors of the operator. So D is correct. But wait, the statements in the options might not both be correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that when you have an operator, the eigenvectors can form a basis, but only if they are complete and orthogonal. For a 2x2 matrix, if it's diagonalizable, which it is here because it has two distinct eigenvalues, then the eigenvectors form a basis.

So D's statement is correct.

Hmm, but the options are mutually exclusive, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

This is correct because A² is c² I; any vector is eigenfunction of A². But Az is another component; the eigenvectors of Ay are not eigenvectors of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay given.

This is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So the statements might be correct, but perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalues. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the matrix A is c times S. S is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So A is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]].

The characteristic equation is det(A - λ I) = 0.

Matrix is [[-λ, -i c], [i c, -λ]].

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i c)(i c) = λ² - (i c)(-i c). Wait, no: The (1,2) element is -i c, the (2,1) element is i c. So the product is (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c² = ( (-i)(i) ) c².

i * (-i) is -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. So (i)(-i) = 1. So ( -i c )*(i c ) = (-i)(i) c² = (1) c². So the determinant is λ² - (1) c² = 0 → λ = ± c.

So eigenvalues are c and -c, which are real numbers. Thus, the eigenfunctions are real? Wait, no, because the matrix is complex, the eigenvectors could have complex entries.

But the point here is that the eigenvalues are real, so Ay is a Hermitian operator? Wait, because S is a Hermitian matrix?

Wait, let me check if S is Hermitian. The conjugate transpose of S would be:

[[0, i],
 [-i, 0]]

Which is the same as S itself because S^† = S. So S is Hermitian. Therefore, c S is also Hermitian because c is a real constant. So the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator must be real, which matches our calculation.

So the eigenvalues are ±c, which is ±h/(4π).

Now, looking back at the options.

Option A: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, because eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts are zero. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. Also incorrect because eigenvalues are real.

So the possible correct options are C and D.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. As we saw, A² is c² I, so any vector is an eigenfunction. So C is correct.

Option D: Eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since the eigenvectors form a basis, D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D could be correct. But I must choose one option.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting option D. It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. So the basis functions are the eigenvectors, which form a basis. So D is correct.

But the eigenvectors are indeed the basis functions, so D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, which statements are correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is which statement is correct concerning the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Let me re-examine the options.

Option D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Yes, because the matrix operator is 2x2, and its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But earlier I thought that C is correct. So which one is the correct answer?

Wait, let me think again. The question is to choose the correct statement during the calculation.

I think statement C and D are both correct, but perhaps only one is among the options.

But looking at the options, options C and D are separate. So perhaps both are correct, but only one is an option.

Wait the options are:

A, B, C, D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. But for a matrix operator, any set of eigenvectors that form a basis would be the basis functions for that operator. So D is correct.

But let me think about each option again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

That's correct because A² is a multiple of identity, so any state is an eigenstate of A². Thus, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But they are not eigenfunctions of Az because Az is another component of angular momentum, which doesn't commute with Ay. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay given. That's also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both C and D seem correct, but perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the problem is that the question is presented as a multiple-choice question with only one correct answer. So I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate which statements are correct.

Let me look at each statement again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Yes, because A^2 is a multiple of identity, so any eigenfunction of Ay is an eigenfunction of A^2. So statement C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given.

Yes, because the operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both C and D are correct. But perhaps no, because the question is about the correct statement during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the question is about the process of finding eigenvalue and eigenvectors, and D is a statement about the nature of the eigenvectors, which is always true for any 2x2 matrix with distinct eigenvalues.

But the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, we have to find that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, which is something we'd conclude.

But among the options, perhaps only C is correct.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the physical meaning. The intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon (spin-½) has components Sx, Sy, Sz.

The Y-component's operator A_y is given as c * S, where S is the given matrix.

The eigenvalues of A_y are ±c = ±h/(4π).

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin operators have eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for each component. So for the Y-component, the eigenvalues should be ± ħ/2. Wait, but in this problem, c = h/(4π), so ħ = h/(2π). So c = ħ/2. Thus, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which matches the expected result for spin-½ systems.

So in terms of units, that's correct.

Now, looking at the options again.

Option B says eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Which is incorrect because the eigenvalues are real. So B is out.

Option C seems correct because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D is also correct, but perhaps the question is about which statement is correct. So looking back at the options.

The question is to choose which statement is correct during the calculation.

So during the calculation, when finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. This is correct because any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A^2 (since A² is a multiple of identity), but not of Az.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Which is also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2x2 space.

So perhaps both C and D are correct. But the options are given as four options, and only one is correct. So I must choose between C and D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

But in that case, why is D incorrect? Because the statement in D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct but not part of the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) ... (incorrect)

B) ... (incorrect)

C) ... (correct)

D) ... (correct).

So perhaps the correct answer is C and D are both correct, but the options are such that only one is correct.

Wait, the question states that during the calculation, which statement will I consider to be correct.

So perhaps D is correct because during the calculation, the eigenfunctions are found, which are the basis functions.

But no, the term 'basis functions' is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator.

Hmm. This is a bit confusing. But given the options, I think the correct answer is C and D are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is C.

Wait, the question is about the correct statement during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, I find that option C is correct.

Another approach: think about the possible answers.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A². Since A² is c² I, any vector is an eigenfunction of A², so yes. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the eigenvectors form a basis, D is correct.

But in the given options, both C and D could be correct, but perhaps the intended answer is C.

Wait, but if I'm to choose from the options, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the question is about the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and the correct statement is that the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A².

So, after all this thinking, I think the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon, represented by a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is given as:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the matrix \( A_y - \lambda I \) becomes:

\[
A_y - \lambda I = \begin{pmatrix} 
-\lambda & -i c \\ 
i c & -\lambda 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - \lambda I) = \lambda^2 - c^2 = 0.
\]

Solving this gives the eigenvalues \( \lambda = \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are real linear combinations of the eigenvectors.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), so their imaginary parts are zero.

2. **Option B**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) is a multiple of the identity matrix (\( A^2 = c^2 I \)), so any vector is an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

4. **Option D**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is also correct because the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the \( 2 \times 2 \) space.

### Conclusion:

Both options C and D are correct based on the analysis. However, the question asks for the correct statement during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Option C is more relevant to the process of understanding the eigenfunctions' properties, particularly their relationship with \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \). Therefore, the best answer is:

**Answer: C**
