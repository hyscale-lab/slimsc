Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's break it down.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, and both photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I think I need to use the Boltzmann equation here because it deals with the distribution of particles in energy states in thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann equation, right. It states that the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is equal to the Boltzmann factor. The formula is (n2)/(n1) = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Here, n2 is the population of the higher energy level, and n1 is the lower one. Since E2 is higher than E1, the exponent becomes negative.

In this problem, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So for star_1, the ratio (n2/n1)_1 is 2. For star_2, let's call the ratio (n2/n1)_2. But wait, the problem says star_1's atoms are twice as excited, does that mean their ratio is 2 compared to star_2's? Or is it that star_1's ratio is twice star_2's ratio? Let me read that again. It says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to star_2." So I think the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. If the atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level, does that mean their population in that higher energy level is twice as much? So for star_1, n2 is twice that of star_2. Alternatively, perhaps it's the ratio n_upper/n_lower for each star. So for star_1, n2/n1 = 2 times that of star_2's n2/n1.

Alternatively, maybe the question is saying that for star_1, the excitation (say, the population in the higher level) is twice that of star_2. Hmm, but without more context, I think the correct approach is to
