Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, the problem is about luminosity, so maybe mass isn't directly relevant here. Or is it?

They used spectroscopy to find the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest, and those are the same for both. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a blackbody is determined by its temperature. The formula I remember is Wien's Law: lambda_max * T = constant. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because lambda_max is proportional to 1/T. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, T is the same for both.

Wait, but the question says they have the same lambda where they appear brightest. So that would imply same temperature. Oh right, because if two blackbodies have the same temperature, their peak emission is at the same wavelength. So T1 = T2.

Now, the problem asks about the luminosity ratio between Star_1 and Star_2. Luminosity for a star (assuming a blackbody) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius and T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since both stars have the same temperature, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But since T1 = T2, that part is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

R1 is 1.5 times R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. Looking at the options, option A is ~2.25, and option D is ~2.23. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have missed something.

Wait, the problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh, radial velocity could affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But wait, the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So if they have the same observed lambda_max, but their actual temperatures might be different because of the Doppler shift.

Wait, this is a critical point. I think I made a mistake earlier. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its emitted wavelengths would be shifted. Let me think.

The peak wavelength observed would be different from the emitted peak if the star is moving. So the observed lambda_max would be affected by the Doppler effect. So, for example, if a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, so the observed lambda_max is shorter than the emitted. Conversely, if moving away, it's redshifted, longer lambda_max.

In the problem, both stars have the same observed lambda_max. So let's model this. Let’s denote:

For Star_1: radial velocity v1 = 0. So no Doppler shift. So observed lambda_max1 = emitted lambda_max1.

For Star_2: radial velocity v2 = 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away, so redshift. So observed lambda_max2 = emitted lambda_max2 * (1 + v2/c), where c is speed of light.

But according to the problem, lambda_max observed for both stars is the same. So lambda_max1 = lambda_max2_observed.

But lambda_max1 is emitted by Star_1, and lambda_max2_observed is the redshifted version of Star_2's emitted lambda_max2.

Let me write that:

lambda_max1 = lambda_max2 * (1 + v2/c)

Because Star_2 is moving away, so (1 + v2/c) is the Doppler factor for redshift. If Star_2 were moving towards us, it would be (1 - v2/c), but the radial velocity is given as 700 km/s. Wait, the radial velocity is given as 700 km/s for Star_2, but since Star_1's is zero, perhaps Star_2 is moving away. So that's the scenario.

So, lambda_max1 = lambda_max2 * (1 + v2/c)

But since both stars are blackbodies emitting, their emitted lambda_max is determined by their temperatures. So, using Wien's Law:

lambda_max_emitted = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

So for Star_1, lambda_max1_emitted = b / T1.

For Star_2, lambda_max2_emitted = b / T2.

So, combining the two:

lambda_max1_emitted = lambda_max2_emitted * (1 + v2/c)

Substituting from Wien's Law:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

The b's cancel out:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

So T1 = T2 * [1 / (1 + v2/c) ]

Wait, but this would mean T1 is lower than T2. Because (1 + v2/c) is greater than 1, so 1/(1 + v2/c) is less than 1.

Wait, but let's plug in the numbers. v2 is 700 km/s. The speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s. So v2/c is 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/300 ≈ 0.02333.

So (1 + v2/c) ≈ 1.02333.

So T1 = T2 * (1 / 1.02333) ≈ T2 * 0.977.

So T1 is approximately 0.977 T2.

Wait, but wait. If Star_2 is moving away, then its observed lambda_max is longer than its emitted lambda_max. So for the observed lambda_max to be the same as Star_1's, which isn't moving, Star_1's emitted lambda_max must be equal to Star_2's observed lambda_max. Which, in terms of temperature, would mean that Star_1's temperature is lower than Star_2's.

Wait, no. Because Star_1's emitted lambda_max is the same as its observed, since v1=0. So lambda_max1_observed = lambda_max1_emitted.

Star_2's lambda_max2_observed is longer than its emitted because it's moving away. So if both observed lambdas are same, lambda_max1_emitted = lambda_max2_observed.

So:

lambda_max1_emitted = lambda_max2_emitted * (1 + v2/c)

Which translates to:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Wait, no:

Wait, lambda_max1_emitted = b / T1.

lambda_max2_observed = lambda_max2_emitted * (1 + v2/c) = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Since lambda_max1_emitted = lambda_max2_observed,

b/T1 = (b/T2)(1 + v2/c)

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v2/c)

So T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c)

So T2 is higher than T1. Because (1 + v2/c) is about 1.02333. So T2 = T1 * 1.02333.

Wait, that makes sense. Because Star_2 is moving away, the observed peak is longer, implying that the actual emitted wavelength was shorter (higher temperature). So Star_2 is hotter.

So now, the luminosity formula comes into play. L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So the ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, and T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) ≈ T1 * 1.02333.

So let's compute T2 in terms of T1:

T2 = T1 * (1 + 700 / 3e5) = T1 * (1 + 7e2 / 3e5) = T1 * (1 + 7/300) ≈ T1 * 1.023333.

So T1 = T2 / 1.023333.

Wait, no, let me correct that. From earlier, we have T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). So T2 is larger than T1.

So, substituting T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) into L1/L2:

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * (T1 * (1 + v2/c))^4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (2.25 R2²) * T1^4

Denominator: R2² * T1^4 * (1 + v2/c)^4

So the ratio becomes:

[ 2.25 R2² T1^4 ] / [ R2² T1^4 (1 + v2/c)^4 ]

The R2² and T1^4 terms cancel out:

2.25 / ( (1 + v2/c)^4 )

So now compute (1 + v2/c)^4.

v2 = 700 km/s, c = 3e5 km/s. So v2/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7/300 ≈ 0.023333.

1 + 0.023333 ≈ 1.023333.

So (1.023333)^4 ≈ ?

Let me calculate that.

First, 1.02333^4.

Let me compute it step by step.

(1.02333)^2 = approx (1.02333 * 1.02333)

Hmm, 1.02333 squared:

1.02333 * 1.02333 = let's compute:

1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.02333 = 0.02333.

0.02333 * 1 = 0.02333.

0.02333 * 0.02333 ≈ 0.000544.

Adding all together:

1 + 0.02333 + 0.02333 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.0472.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute it as (1 + x)^2 where x=0.02333.

(1 + x)^2 = 1 + 2x + x².

x=0.02333, so 2x=0.04666, x²≈0.000544.

So 1 + 0.04666 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.0472.

So (1.02333)^2 ≈ 1.0472.

Then, (1.0472)^2 = ?

Again, using the same approach: (1 + 0.0472)^2.

Which is 1 + 2*(0.0472) + (0.0472)^2.

2*0.0472=0.0944.

(0.0472)^2 ≈ 0.002228.

Adding: 1 + 0.0944 = 1.0944, plus 0.002228 is 1.0966.

So (1.02333)^4 ≈ (1.02333^2)^2 ≈ (1.0472)^2 ≈ 1.0966.

So putting it all together:

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

2.25 divided by 1.0966.

Let me see: 1.0966 * 2 = 2.1932. 2.1932 is less than 2.25.

2.25 - 2.1932 = 0.0568.

So 0.0568 / 1.0966 ≈ 0.052.

So total is approximately 2.052.

Wait, but wait: 1.0966 * 2.05 = ?

Let me compute 1.0966 * 2 = 2.1932, 1.0966 * 0.05 = 0.05483.

So 2.05 would give 2.1932 + 0.05483 ≈ 2.248, which is close to 2.25.

So 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ approximately 2.05. So L1 is about 2.05 times L2.

Wait, but looking at the options, A is 2.25, B is ~2.32, C is ~2.35, D is ~2.23.

Hmm, that suggests that none of the options match 2.05. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of (1.02333)^4.

Let me compute it more accurately.

Let me compute (1.023333333)^4.

Compute the natural logarithm first: ln(1.023333333) ≈ 0.02304.

Then multiply by 4: 4 * 0.02304 = 0.09216.

Then exponentiate: e^0.09216 ≈ 1.0965.

So (1.023333)^4 ≈ 1.0965.

So 2.25 / 1.0965 = ?

Let me compute 2.25 ÷ 1.0965.

Well, 1.0965 * 2 = 2.193.

2.25 - 2.193 = 0.057.

So 0.057 / 1.0965 ≈ 0.052.

So total is 2.052.

Wait, but that's about 2.05. That would be approximately 2.05, but the options are all higher than 2.2. So I'm confused. Did I make a mistake in the approach?

Wait, perhaps I got the Doppler shift formula wrong. Let me double-check.

The Doppler effect for light when the source is moving away is given by:

lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * (1 + v/c)

If the source is moving towards the observer, it's (1 - v/c), but in this case, Star_2 is moving away, so v is positive.

So, my earlier approach was correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the luminosity formula. Let me re-derive it.

Luminosity L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4.

So L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 ) = (2.25 R2^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 ) ) = 2.25 * (T1 / T2 )^4.

Wait, so earlier I thought T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c), so T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c).

Wait, no, earlier conclusion was that T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

So (T1 / T2) = 1/(1 + v2/c) = 1/1.02333.

So, (T1 / T2)^4 = (1/1.02333)^4 ≈ 1/(1.0965) ≈ 0.912.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * (0.912) ≈ 2.25 * 0.912 ≈ 2.052.

So that's around 2.05, but none of the options are close. So perhaps I missed something else.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature?

Wait, the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted for Star_2, which implies that the observed temperature is lower. Because higher wavelength corresponds to lower temperature.

Ah, wait, but in the problem, the observed lambda_max is the same for both stars. So for Star_2, since it's moving away, its observed lambda_max is longer than its emitted. So the observed temperature for Star_2 would be lower than its actual temperature.

Wait, but this is confusing. Let me think.

The peak wavelength observed for Star_2 is lambda_max_observed = lambda_max_emitted * (1 + v2/c).

But the observed lambda_max is the same as Star_1's emitted lambda_max. So, lambda_max_observed for Star_1 is lambda_max1_emitted.

lambda_max_observed for Star_2 is lambda_max2_emitted * (1 + v2/c).

And these are equal: lambda_max1_emitted = lambda_max2_emitted * (1 + v2/c).

But lambda_max is b / T.

So, from that, we have T1 = T2 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, no:

Wait, lambda_max1_emitted = b / T1.

lambda_max2_emitted = b / T2.

So,

lambda_max1_emitted = lambda_max2_emitted * (1 + v2/c).

Substituting:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c).

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Which means T2 is larger than T1. So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c).

So, the temperature of Star_1 is lower than Star_2.

Okay, so what's the luminosity ratio?

L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4.

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

R1/R2 = 1.5, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

(T1/T2) = 1/(1 + v2/c) = 1/1.02333 ≈ 0.977.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = (0.977)^4 ≈ ?

0.977^2 ≈ 0.9545.

0.9545^2 ≈ 0.9109.

So, (0.977)^4 ≈ 0.9109.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9109 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9109 ≈ 2.050.

Hmm, around 2.05, but the options don't have this. So why are the options all higher than 2.2?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift calculation. Could it be that the formula for the Doppler shift is different when the velocities are significant compared to the speed of light?

Wait, the approximation used is for small velocities, v << c. The formula (1 + v/c) is an approximation. The exact relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

lambda_obs / lambda_emit = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) when the source is moving away.

But wait, no, that's for transverse Doppler effect. For longitudinal Doppler shift (source moving directly away), the formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) ?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The relativistic Doppler effect for a source moving directly away is:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) ?

Wait, no, wait. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

lambda_obs / lambda_emit = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) when the source is moving away.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the formula. The correct formula is:

When the source is moving away at velocity v, the observed wavelength is longer, and the formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me double-check. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

nu_obs = nu_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) )

Since lambda = c / nu, so lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

Yes, that's correct. So for a source moving away, lambda_obs is larger than lambda_emit.

So in this problem, the observed lambda_max for Star_2 is lambda_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But in the problem, both stars have the same observed lambda_max. So lambda_emit1 = lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Wait, no. Because Star_1's lambda_obs is its own lambda_emit. So:

lambda_emit1 = lambda_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Because lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) ), and lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit1.

So, lambda_emit1 = lambda_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Using Wien's law, lambda_emit = b / T. So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But wait, that's a more accurate formula, considering relativistic effects. Because earlier I used the non-relativistic approximation, which may not be precise enough.

So with this, let's calculate T2 in terms of T1.

v2 = 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s = 300,000 km/s.

v2/c = 700 / 300,000 = 0.0023333.

So, let's compute sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Compute numerator: 1 + 0.0023333 = 1.0023333.

Denominator: 1 - 0.0023333 = 0.9976667.

So,

(1.0023333)/(0.9976667) ≈ 1.00468.

Take the square root of that: sqrt(1.00468) ≈ 1.002336.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.002336.

Which is a slightly higher temperature compared to T1.

So now, back to the luminosity ratio.

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1 / T2)^4.

R1/R2 = 1.5, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1 / T2 = 1 / (1.002336) ≈ 0.997667.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.997667)^4 ≈ approx?

Let me compute 0.997667^4.

First, 0.997667 ≈ 1 - 0.002333.

So, (1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 - 4x + 6x² - 4x^3 + x^4. Where x =0.002333.

Compute each term:

x = 0.002333.

4x = 0.009332.

6x² = 6*(0.002333)^2 ≈ 6*(5.44e-6) ≈ 3.26e-5.

4x^3 ≈ 4*(0.002333)^3 ≈ 4*(1.29e-8) ≈ 5.16e-8.

x^4 ≈ (0.002333)^4 ≈ 3e-11.

So,

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 - 0.009332 + 0.0000326 - 0.0000000516 + 0.00000000003.

≈ 1 - 0.009332 + 0.0000326.

≈ 0.9907 + 0.0000326 ≈ 0.9907326.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Which is approximately 2.23. Hmm, option D is ~2.23. So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but earlier with the non-relativistic approach, I got 2.05, which doesn't match any option. But with the relativistic approach, using the exact Doppler shift formula, I get about 2.23, which matches option D.

So I think that's the correct approach. The initial mistake was using the non-relativistic Doppler shift (which assumes small v), but since v2 is 700 km/s and c is 3e5 km/s, the non-relativistic approach gives a small (1 + v/c) factor, but the relativistic approach gives a more accurate result.

So the luminosity ratio is approximately 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \) between the two stars, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radius Ratio**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
2. **Radial Velocities**: \( v_1 = 0 \), \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)
3. **Observed Wavelengths**: Both stars have the same observed peak wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \)).

### Step 1: Relating Temperatures Using Wien's Law
The observed peak wavelength is determined by the Doppler shift. For Star_2, moving away at \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), the observed wavelength is redshifted:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, obs}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emit}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

For Star_1, \( v_1 = 0 \), so \( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emit}} \). Since both stars have the same observed wavelength:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, emit, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emit, 2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \)):

\[
T_1 = T_2 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}
\]

### Step 2: Substituting Values
The speed of light \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \), so:

\[
v_2/c = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

\[
\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c} = \frac{1.002333}{0.997667} \approx 1.00468
\]

\[
\sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}} = \sqrt{1.00468} \approx 1.00234
\]

Thus:

\[
T_1 = T_2 \cdot 1.00234
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.99767
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

Substitute \( R_1 / R_2 = 1.5 \) and \( T_1 / T_2 \approx 0.99767 \):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.99767)^4
\]

\[
(1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

\[
(0.99767)^4 \approx 0.9907
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.23
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2.

**Answer: D**
