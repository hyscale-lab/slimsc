Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Hmm, let me read the question again.

Alright, we have an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity of radius r. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So the cavity isn't at the center—it's off to the side, right? The radius r is less than R, so the cavity is entirely within the conductor. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Both L and l are greater than R because P is outside. The angle between l and s is theta. 

I remember that when there's a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges rearrange. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. Oh, right! So when +q is placed inside, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have an induced charge opposite to the inner. 

Wait, no, wait. The conductor was neutral. So when +q is inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced -q charge to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then the outer surface must have +q because the total charge of the conductor is zero, right? Or wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor initially has zero charge. When you put +q inside the cavity, which is inside the conductor, the conductor's inner surface must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor, making the conductor's net charge zero again. But wait, then the conductor's outer surface must also have zero charge? Or does it have +q? I might be getting confused.

Wait, let's clarify. The conductor is uncharged, so the total charge is zero. The +q is inside the cavity, so the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel the field within the conductor material. Then, since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q. Because -q (inner) + outer charge = 0 → outer charge must be +q.

But wait, does the outer surface's charge distribution depend on external fields or other charges? I think in this case, since the only charge is
