Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I need to figure out which stars qualify for both.

First, I'll read the question again. The key info is that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16. So any star that has a V magnitude less than or equal to 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. The question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. So apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 means the apparent magnitude is less than 17. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So higher magnitude means fainter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, its V magnitude is less than 17.

So for ESPRESSO, detectable stars have V < 17. For HIRES, V < 16. So the star must have V mag less than 16 because both can observe it. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question is which stars can be detected with both. So they must be detected by both instruments. So for a star to be detected by both, it must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO (V < 17) and brighter than 16 for HIRES (V < 16). Wait, no. Because the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So, for a star to be observed by ESPRESSO, its apparent V must be brighter than 17, which is V < 17.

Wait, no. Wait, magnitude scale is inverse. So a magnitude of 17 is fainter than a magnitude of 16. So if a star is brighter than 17, that means its V is less than 17. So for ESPRESSO, the star must have V <17. For HIRES, it can observe stars with V <16. So to be detected by both, a star must have V <16. Because if a star's V is 15, it's detected by both. If a star's V is 16, ESPRESSO can
