Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. The question is about starspots and how they affect a star's brightness, and how that compares to the signal from an exoplanet. Hmm.

Alright, the problem says that the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So R_star = R_sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K, so their temperature is 5000 K. Because the spots are on one hemisphere, as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that could resemble a planet transiting the star.

The main question is: what's the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (R_pl) that would create the same brightness variation as these spots? So we need to find R_pl / R_star.

Wait, I remember that when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The change in brightness (the dip) depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula is delta_F = (R_pl / R_star)^2, because the area is proportional to the square of the radius.

But in this problem, it's not a planet causing the dip but star spots. How does that work? Well, when a spot is on the side of the star facing us, it reduces the brightness because the spot is darker. So the total brightness is the unspotted star minus the brightness from the spots that are currently visible.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots come into view and then go out of view as the star spins. When the spot is on the limb (edge), part of it is visible. The maximum dip occurs when the spot is directly facing us, and the minimum when it's on the opposite side.

But wait, the problem says that the star has a filling factor of 20% for the spots on one hemisphere. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots, right? So each hemisphere (the star is a sphere, so one hemisphere is 50% of the surface) has 20% spots. So the total spot coverage on the entire star is 0.5 (hemisphere) * 0.2 (filling factor) =
