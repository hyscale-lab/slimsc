Okay, I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, that's an unusual relationship. I remember that parallax is related to distance, so I need to connect this to how the number of stars changes with distance.

First, I should recall what parallax means. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula that relates parallax to distance is distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of parallax, right? So d = 1/plx. Oh wait, wait, I think that's correct. So if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away. And if the parallax decreases (like 0.5), the distance increases (2 parsecs).

Now the problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So, N ‚àù 1/(plx)^5. I need to express how the number of stars (N) changes with distance (r). Wait, I think r here is used as distance, probably in parsecs or similar units.

Since d = 1/plx, then plx = 1/d. Let's substitute that into the equation. N is proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that: 1/(1/d
