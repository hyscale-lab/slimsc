Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. 

First, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let's see, the molecular formula could suggest a structure with a benzene ring because the molecular formula has a lot of carbons, and the presence of N and O might indicate an amide or something like that. 

The NMR data is provided, so I need to analyze that to figure out the structure. The 1H-NMR peaks are as follows:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Let me break this down. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's a high chemical shift, so probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehydes are typically deshielded and have a singlet because the adjacent carbon is sp2 or something. Hmm, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Or perhaps there's something else going on. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha proton adjacent to a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde. But wait, the triplet would mean it's coupled with two protons. So maybe the aldehyde is next to a CH2 group? That doesn't make sense because the aldehyde is at the end. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aromatic proton. Wait, 9.72 is high for an aromatic, but some aromatic protons can be that high, especially if they're in an ortho position to an electron-withdrawing group. Or maybe it's a vinylogous proton? Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like an alpha proton adjacent to a carbonyl. Wait, another thought: in some cases, the proton adjacent to a carbonyl (like in a ketone) can show up around 2-3 ppm, but maybe if it's conjugated or something else. Hmm, getting a bit stuck here.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets, each integrating for 2H. These look like aromatic protons. The 6.98 is probably more deshielded than 6.51, so maybe para substitution on a benzene ring. Because in para-substituted benzene, the two protons are equivalent and show up as a doublet. So that suggests maybe two benzene rings or a single benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, but the integration is 2H for each of these, which could mean two separate doublets. So perhaps two different aromatic rings. For example, each ring has two protons in a doublet. So maybe each ring is para-substituted. Alternatively, maybe it's an ortho coupling. Wait, but in para substitution, each of the two protons would be equivalent, giving a singlet if they are equivalent, but here it's a doublet. Wait, no, for a para-substituted benzene, each of the two protons would be
