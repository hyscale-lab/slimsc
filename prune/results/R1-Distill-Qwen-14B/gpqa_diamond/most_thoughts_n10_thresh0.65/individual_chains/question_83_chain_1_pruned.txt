Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it through carefully. Hmm, we're dealing with titration of acetic acid with NaOH. The problem says we diluted 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I think I should figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Because when you add water, the concentration changes. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. 

So the initial concentration after dilution would be (volume1 * concentration1) / total volume. So (20 * 0.05) / (40) = (1) / 40? Wait, wait, 20 times 0.05 is 1 mmol. Oh wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. Then total volume is 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume V is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, but wait, the problem said 25% titration, so that's a quarter of the equivalence point volume. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, but I might be getting ahead
