Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of them. Hmm, I need to think about what each symmetry means and whether the SMEFT necessarily enforces them.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries. But wait, effective theories can include higher-dimensional operators that violate some symmetries, right?

Wait, but wait. Effective field theories usually respect the symmetries of the original theory because they're built from it. The Standard Model has certain symmetries, like gauge symmetries, Lorentz symmetry, and possibly others. So in SMEFT, operators are constructed in a way that maintains these symmetries.

Let me go through each point:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: SMEFT should respect Lorentz symmetry because it's part of the Standard Model's framework. Operators would have to transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. So all operators must respect this.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. Well, in the Standard Model and thus SMEFT, the theory is Poincare invariant. But wait, when you go to an effective theory, you're working in a certain energy scale. How does that affect Poincare symmetry? Hmm, I think in SMEFT, the operators are written in a way that respects Poincare symmetry because they're part of a Lorentcovariant theory.
