Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics, and I'm a bit new to this. Let's try to break it down. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X, given its mass and an interaction Lagrangian. Hmm.

First, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh right, the interaction term is probably something like λ times some fermion fields interacting with X. So the interaction term would be something like λ fψ X ψ, where fψ is the fermion field. So X is a boson that couples to fermions, right?

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So I need to find which fermions it can decay into. The possible decays would be into fermion-antifermion pairs, I think. So X can split into a pair like f and f-bar. But what's the condition for that?

Well, for a particle to decay into two particles, the combined mass of those two must be less than the mass of the parent. So for X → f f-bar, the mass of X must be greater than 2 times the mass of f. Because each fermion has some mass, so 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So I need to list all the fermions where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. Let's think about the masses of the known fermions. Wait, but wait, I should remember that in the Standard Model, fermions have different masses. But wait, in this interaction, which fermions are involved? The Lagrangian has ψ_f, which I think refers to some specific fermion type. Oh wait, the interaction is probably with ψ_f, which could be any fermion. So X can decay into any fermion pair as long as the mass condition is satisfied.

But wait, the interaction term is probably like X ψ ψ, so X couples to the fermion ψ. So the fermions that X can decay into are those that it can couple to. So I need to know which fermions are in the loop or which are present in the theory.

Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify which fermions are present. Wait, perhaps the interaction term allows for coupling to any fermion. Because the Lagrangian is written as involving ψ_f, which might be
