Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is about finding the energy of the collider such that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is given as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li-6 maybe? Because Li has atomic number 3, so if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number would be 3 +3=6. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6.

I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with energies and speeds, especially at relativistic speeds, we need to use the relativistic equations. The speed here is 0.96c, which is pretty high, so relativistic effects are definitely important.

The energy in such cases usually refers to the kinetic energy. But wait, sometimes it's the total energy, which includes rest mass energy. I need to clarify that. The problem states "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." I think RHIC accelerates ions to a certain kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, in high-energy physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, it's often the kinetic energy per particle, but sometimes it's the total energy. Hmm, I'll need to think about that.

The problem is asking for the energy E that the nucleus has when its speed is 0.96c. So I think we're looking for the total energy, which is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Or maybe it's just the kinetic energy. I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So if we can find gamma, multiply by the rest mass energy, that should give the total energy.

But wait, the options are all in GeV, which is a unit of energy. So the question is, what is the energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. So I think they are asking for the total energy, which includes both rest mass and kinetic. Because the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * m c².

So first, let's compute gamma. Given v = 0.96c.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Plugging in v=0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Square root of 0.0784: let me think. 0.0784 is 784e-4, which is 28² * 1e-4, so sqrt is 0.28? Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784.

So gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, 1/0.28 is approximately 3.57142857. Let me calculate that more accurately. 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28*3.5 is 0.98, so 3.5 is 0.98. 3.5714 * 0.28 is 1, because 0.28 * 3.5714 ≈ 1. So yeah, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So the total energy E is gamma * m * c².

But I need to find m, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a lithium-6 nucleus is approximately... wait, I don't remember exact values, but I can compute it using the atomic mass.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01219 u, where u is the atomic mass unit. But the mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the atomic mass because electrons are separate. But for heavy ions, the electrons' mass is negligible compared to the nucleus. So maybe we can approximate m = m_atomic * u_to_kg.

Wait, the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus: the molar mass is 6.01219 g/mol (but wait, no, the molar mass is 6.01219 * u * Avogadro's number. Wait, actually, the atomic mass unit (u) is 1 g/mol divided by Avogadro's number. So, maybe I should get the mass in kilograms.

Alternatively, I can find the rest mass energy of Li-6 in GeV. Because 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So for m (mass) in GeV/c², m = (mass in u) * 931.5 MeV/u * (1 GeV/1000 MeV) ) / c². But since E=mc², the rest energy is m c² = (mass in u) * 931.5 MeV.

Wait, maybe I should compute the rest mass energy of Li-6 in GeV.

Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.0160293 u (wait, different sources might have slightly different values, but let's say around 6.012 u for Li-6). Let's double-check that.

Wait, I think the exact value is about 6.01605 u for Li-6. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. The standard value for the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is about 6.01605 atomic mass units (u). So m = 6.
