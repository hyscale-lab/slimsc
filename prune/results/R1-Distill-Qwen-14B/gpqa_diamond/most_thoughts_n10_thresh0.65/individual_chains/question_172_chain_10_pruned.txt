Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember that in stars, the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature. The higher the temperature, the more excited the atoms are. So star_1 must be hotter than star_2 because their iron atoms are more excited, right?

But wait, the question mentions that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38 x 10^-23 J. That's a specific value, but I'm not sure if I need to use it directly here because the options don't have any numbers. Maybe the key is in the relationship between the temperatures and the excitation levels.

Oh, right! The Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given, so E_i - E_j is known. And since the problem says it's in LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), I can apply the Boltzmann equation here.

The problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Let me clarify that. Wait, I think it's the ratio of the number of excited atoms in the higher energy level to the lower one. So for star_1, the ratio is twice that of star_2. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the excitation in star_1 compared to star_2. Let me re-read the question.

It says: iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So, maybe the ratio of the populations is different. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation potential is the same, but the temperature affects how much they are excited.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this using the ratio of the excitation. Let's denote the ratio of the populations of the excited state to the ground state as n1 and n2 for the two stars
