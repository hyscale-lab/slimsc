Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax is related to distance somehow. I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, plx = 1/distance, but I think it's actually in some unit like parsecs. So if the parallax is small, the distance is large.

The problem is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance. So, per unit range of distance r, how does the number change? The options are different powers of r, like r squared, r cubed, etc.

Let me think about the relation between number of stars (N) and parallax (plx). The given relation is N ‚àù 1/(plx)^5. So I can write that as N = k / plx^5, where k is some constant.

But since plx is inversely proportional to distance (d), plx = 1/d. So substituting that into the equation: N = k / ( (1/d) )^5 ) = k * d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance in a per unit range sense. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the number of stars per unit volume, or something like that. Because that would make sense when considering a range of distances.

Wait, the number of stars in a certain region depends on the volume, right? Because as you go further, the volume increases,
