Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. But wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution, which I think means the concentrations of EDTA and calcium are in the exact molar ratio of the complex. So for every mole of Ca-EDTA complex, there's one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA involved, right?

Wait, no. Wait, the complex is Ca-EDTA, so the formula might be Ca(EDTA)²⁻? Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so when it complexes with Ca²+, the formula would be Ca(EDTA)^2−. So the complex is [CaEDTA]^2−. But I'm not sure if that's important right now.

The problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in solution. But wait, if all the Ca is in the complex form, then the free Ca²+ concentration would be really low because K is a large number, which suggests a stable complex.

Alternatively, wait, maybe the solution has some free EDTA and some free calcium ions. Or perhaps the complex is dissociating. But given that
