Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Hmm, I remember that decay properties of particles are related to their lifetimes through the uncertainty principle. The mean lifetime τ is connected to the width Γ. Oh right! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but when dealing with particle lifetimes, it's often approximated as τ ≈ ħ/(Γ), because the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about the width Γ.

Wait, wait. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime τ by τ = ħ / Γ. Because the width is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So if Γ is larger, the lifetime is shorter, and the particle decays more quickly.

But wait, I think the formula is τ = ħ/(Γ) multiplied by a factor depending on the units. Because Γ has units of energy, and ħ is in units of energy times time, so when you divide ħ by Γ (which is energy), you get time. Right.

So first, I need to compute the lifetime τ. Once I have that, the mean decay distance is the speed multiplied by the lifetime. Because the particle travels at some speed v, and the distance is v * τ.

But wait, since the particle is a meson, which is a boson, but more importantly, it's a composite particle made of quarks. The production energy is given as 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. Hmm, I'm not sure how that plays into this. Oh, perhaps the energy relates to the kinetic energy, but I think for calculating the decay length, we might only need the velocity from the mass and energy.

Wait, the production energy is the total energy. So the particle's total energy is E = 8 GeV. The rest mass is m = 1.2 GeV. So the kinetic energy is E - m. But since the mass is in GeV, I should convert everything into appropriate units.

But maybe the velocity can be found from the energy
