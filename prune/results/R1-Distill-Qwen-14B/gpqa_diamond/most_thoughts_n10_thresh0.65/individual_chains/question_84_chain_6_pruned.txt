Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, focusing on the matrix exponential function being approximated by a fractional approximation.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with heat equations, especially in higher dimensions, the problem often involves solving systems of linear equations. These systems can be represented using matrices, and the solution might involve matrix exponentials because the heat equation is a parabolic partial differential equation. Matrix exponentials are used when dealing with systems that can be expressed in the form u' = Au, where A is a matrix.

But wait, the question mentions higher-order finite differences and parallel splitting. Parallel splitting methods are techniques used to break down the problem into smaller parts that can be solved simultaneously, which is essential for parallel computing. One approach I recall is the use of the exponential time integration method, which involves decomposing the matrix exponential into more manageable parts.

So the key here is about how the matrix exponential is approximated. The question states that it's done through a fractional approximation. Fractional approximation methods are used to approximate matrix functions, especially when dealing with large matrices. They can be more efficient and scalable for parallel computations.

Now, the question asks what's the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. I'm thinking about the properties of the approximation method. Stability analysis (Option A) is important in ensuring that the numerical method doesn't blow up or become inaccurate, but is it the key factor for parallelism?

Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions (Option B) sounds more like a condition required for the problem setup rather than something related to the algorithm's parallelizability.

Complex roots of fractional approximation (Option C) and linear partial fraction of fractional approximation (Option D) seem related to the mathematical formulation of the approximation itself. I remember that methods like the Padé approximation or other rational approximations are used, which involve decomposing the matrix exponential into simpler fractions. These decompositions can be evaluated in parallel because each term can be computed independently.

Wait, fractional approximation methods often involve breaking the exponential into a sum of terms, each involving different powers of the matrix. For example, something like e^A ≈ sum_{k} c_k (A^k), where c_k are coefficients. But when you have a fractional approximation, perhaps it's expressed as a sum of terms with different fractional exponents, which might be easier to compute in parallel.

Alternatively, the method might involve partial
