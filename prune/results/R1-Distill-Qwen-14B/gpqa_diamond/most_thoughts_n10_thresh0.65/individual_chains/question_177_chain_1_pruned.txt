Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm supposed to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. The question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, wait, the peak wavelength for a black body is determined by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if T is same, then λ_max is same. Right.

So both stars have the same temperature. Now, astronomers calculated the luminosities. The question is, by what factor is Star_1's luminosity greater than Star_2's. The options are A to D.

Wait, but wait—luminosity of a star depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power, right? The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So since both have same T, but different R, the luminosity should be proportional to R squared. 

Wait, but wait again. Star_1 has R = 1.5 R₂. So L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)^4. Since T₁ = T₂, the (T) part is 1. So L₁/L₂ = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the factor is 2.25. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, the question mentions radial velocities. Oh, but the question says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity doesn't affect luminosity. Luminosity is intrinsic brightness, not how it appears. Radial velocity affects the observed brightness if considering Doppler shift, but in this case, the problem says they computed the luminosity assuming black body radiation. So I think the radial velocity is a red herring here. So it doesn't affect the calculation of luminosity, which is based on their actual radius and temperature.

So yeah, the factor should be (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. So A is exactly 2.25. So why are the other options close? Did I miss something?

Wait, maybe I should consider that the stars have the same apparent brightness, but the question says they computed luminosity. Wait, no, the luminosity is intrinsic. Apparent brightness depends on distance as well. But the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosities based on black body radiation. So the radial velocities probably relate to something else, but not luminosity. So perhaps I'm correct.

Wait another thought: is there any other factor? Like, are the stars moving towards or away from us, which might affect the observed wavelength? But the problem says the astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. That would imply that the observed wavelengths are
