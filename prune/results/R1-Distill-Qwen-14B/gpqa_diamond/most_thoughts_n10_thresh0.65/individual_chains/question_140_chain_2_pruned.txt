Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it says. Hmm, it's about a reaction involving Substance X, liquid Y, and some products. I need to figure out what X is based on the clues given.

The question mentions that X reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh, wait, same number of neutrons and protons in a molecule? So, that would mean the molecule is either H2O or something else where the sum of protons and neutrons in each atom is the same. Wait, no, each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Oh wait, no, the molecule as a whole has the same number of protons and neutrons. Or maybe each atom in the molecule has equal protons and neutrons? Like, for example, if each atom is something like O-16 (8 protons, 8 neutrons), or maybe it's something else.

Wait, wait, another thought: the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, for example, if W is H2O, the molecule has 2+1=3 protons (since H has 1 each, O has 8). But neutrons would be 8 (from O) plus 2*0 from H (since H is 1^1, so no neutrons). So total protons: 2*1 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: 8. Not equal. So that doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO2? Let's see: CO2 has one C and two O. C has 6 protons, O has 8. So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: C is usually 6 (since C-12 is common), O is 8. So total neutrons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Oh, that fits! Because 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So W is CO2.

But wait, CO2 is a gas. Does that fit with the reaction? Let's think: X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce CO2. What could X and Y be?

Alternatively, maybe it's another molecule. Let's think of other possibilities. Another common gas is CH4, but that would have 4+ (C has 6, H has 1 each. So 6 +4=10 protons, and for neutrons, C might have 6 (so 6) and H has 0. So total neutrons: 6. 10 vs 6, not equal. Doesn't fit.

Another possibility: NH3. Protons: 3 H (1 each) + 7 (N) = 10. Neutrons: N has 7, H has 0. So 7. So 10 vs 7, nope. Doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: maybe the molecule is something like C2H6O, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like N2O. Let me check: N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (in N-14). O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So for N2O: 2 N atoms (each 7p,7n) and 1 O (8p,8n). Total protons: 2*7 +8=22. Neutrons: 2*7 +8 =22. Oh, same numbers. So W could be N2O. But I'm not sure if that's a common product in such reactions.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2S? Let's see: H2S has 2 H (1p each) and 1 S (16p). Total protons: 2+16=18. Neutrons: H has 0, S is 16 (for S-32, which is common). So 16. 18 vs 16, not equal. Not matching.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me go back to the reaction.

Substance X reacts with liquid Y, producing gas W, precipitate G, and releasing B when heated. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, which is just above 0. Wait, what substance has a melting point around there? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or perhaps another inorganic salt.

Wait, another idea: 277 K is about 4°C. Maybe B is water? No, water's melting point is 273 K (0°C). So B is something that melts at around 277 K. Hmm, maybe sodium nitrate? No, that's higher. Or perhaps something like glucose? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is a basic oxide or something. Wait, but the question says B is released when G is heated. So when G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into B and CO2. Or maybe something else.

Wait, going back to the
