Okay, so I need to figure out the products of three different Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through each part step by step.

First, let's recall what the Michael reaction is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile (like an enolate) attacking a beta-carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. This is a conjugate addition, so the nucleophile adds to the beta position, creating a new carbon-carbon bond.

The question has three parts: reactions leading to products A, B, and C. I'll tackle each one one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). The conditions suggest a base, which usually deprotonates to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. Its structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it should form an enolate. The enolate can attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acrylate).

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, actually it's more like CH2-CO-OCH3 attached to a p-tolyl group. Wait, maybe it's CH2=C(CH2-p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Or perhaps it's CH2=CH- with the substituents. No, wait, the correct structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with the substituent on the beta carbon. Wait, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the substituent is on the gamma position. Hmm, maybe it's better to think of it as the acrylate being the enone part. So, the structure is CH2=CH-(CO-OCH3) with a p-tolyl group on the beta carbon. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify: the structure is probably CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, that can't be right because in the E configuration, the substituents
