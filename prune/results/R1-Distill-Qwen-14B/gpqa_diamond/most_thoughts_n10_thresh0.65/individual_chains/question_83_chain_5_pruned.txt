Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titration of acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, first I'll read the problem again. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. We need the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, let me outline the steps. First, calculate the initial concentration after dilution. Then, find out how much NaOH is added at 25% titration and at equivalence. Then, determine the pH in each case.

So, starting with the initial acetic acid solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution is (20 cm³ * 0.05 M) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that.

20 * 0.05 is 1, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it will partially dissociate.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. Let me compute the initial moles of acetic acid.

Initial moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters) = 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 moles. Because 20 cm³ is 0.020 liters. Wait, but wait, after dilution, it's 40 cm³, so the moles of acetic acid in 40 cm³ are 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Oh right, because 20cm³ of 0.05 M is 0.001 moles.

So equivalence point is when moles of NaOH = 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume of NaOH at equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but wait. When the problem says 25% titration, does that mean 25% of the equivalence volume is added? So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but another way to think about it: 25% of the acetic acid has reacted. So moles of NaOH added would be 25% of 0.001 moles, which is 0.00025 moles
