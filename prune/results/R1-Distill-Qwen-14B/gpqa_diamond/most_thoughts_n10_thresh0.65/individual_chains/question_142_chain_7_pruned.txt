Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But I'm a bit rusty on the details, so let me think this through.

The question gives me the density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space, and the options are points in 3D space with coordinates like (1,1,0) or (0,0,1), etc.

Wait, qubits are two-level systems, so the Hilbert space is two-dimensional. But the options are three-dimensional points. Oh, right, the Bloch sphere! That's the geometrical representation for a single qubit state. But wait, this is a density matrix, not a pure state. So how does that work?

Wait, pure states on the Bloch sphere are represented as points on the surface, while mixed states are inside. The density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but this is a mixed state because it's a combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩ with equal weights (since each term is multiplied by 1/2).

So the given density matrix ρ is a statistical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. How does that translate into the Bloch sphere coordinates?

The Bloch vector for a general qubit state is given by r = (x, y, z), where each component is related to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. For a density matrix ρ, the components of the Bloch vector are ⟨σ_x⟩, ⟨σ_y⟩, and ⟨σ_z⟩ scaled by factors involving 2, perhaps. Alternatively, the Bloch vector is r = (⟨σ_x⟩, ⟨σ_y⟩, ⟨σ_z⟩), but wait, I think it's actually 2 times the expectation of the Pauli matrices. Or maybe just directly the expectation values.

Wait, the formula I remember is that for any density matrix ρ, the Bloch vector components are:

x = Tr(ρ σ_x)
y = Tr(ρ σ_y)
z = Tr(ρ σ_z)

But wait, no, I think it's more precise to say that the Bloch vector r is such that ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices. So if I can express
