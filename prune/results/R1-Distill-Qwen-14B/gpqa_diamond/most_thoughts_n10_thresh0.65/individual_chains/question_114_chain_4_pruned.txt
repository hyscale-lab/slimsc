Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question has two parts. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (in the presence of water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. We have to choose the correct reagents A and B from the given options.

First, I'll focus on the first reaction. Butan-2-one is another name for methylacetone, which has the structure (CH3)2CO. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. NaCN is a source of cyanide ions, which are good nucleophiles. So, when a ketone reacts with CN-, it probably adds across the carbonyl group.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. That would be (CH3)2C(OH)CNCH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, butanenitrile is four carbons, so 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)2C(OH)CNCH2? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)-CN, but I think I might need to look more at the reaction.

The reaction is butan-2-one (CH3)2CO reacting with NaCN. I think this is a nucleophilic addition. The cyanide ion would attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin. The general reaction for a ketone plus CN- is R2CO + CN- â†’ R2C(OH)CN. So yes, that forms a cyanohydrin.

But wait, how are the reagents involved here? The cyanide comes from NaCN, which is a strong base. But in the reaction, would the conditions be acidic or basic? I remember that the formation of a cyanohydrin typically occurs under acidic or basic conditions. Sometimes, when using a weak base, you need an acid catalyst.

Wait,
