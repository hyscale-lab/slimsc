Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the radial velocity method. They have the same mass, but different orbital periods and host stars.

Hmm, so the key here is understanding the probability of a planet transiting its host star. From what I remember, the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Wait, but since both planets have circular orbits, maybe alignment isn't a factor here beyond what's already considered.

Wait, but actually, the probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula P = R_p^2 / (R_s^2 * (a_p / R_s)^2) ??? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Let me think again.

Oh right, the transit probability is actually the ratio of the area of the planet's orbit that the star occupies, which is roughly (R_star / a_planet)^2. But wait, no. Wait, the probability is more about the alignment. The formula for the probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_star / a_planet)². Because the planet's orbit is edge-on, so the chance is proportional to the area that the star covers relative to the planet's orbit. So the probability is (R_*/ a_p)^2, where R_* is the star's radius and a_p is the semi-major axis (since the orbit is circular, that's the distance).

But wait, I think that's not exactly right. Let me recall. The transit probability P is the ratio of the area of the star as seen from Earth to the area of the planet's orbit. So P = π R_*² / π a_p² = (R_* / a_p)^2. But wait, no, the area of the orbit is π a_p², but the area that would cause a transit is when the planet's path passes in front of the star. So the probability is the ratio of the star's cross-sectional area to the planet's orbital area. So P ≈ (R_*)² / (a_p)^2. That makes sense because if the star is much smaller than the orbit, the chance of alignment is lower.

So both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods and host stars differ. We need to find their a_p (semi-major axis) because a_p is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/G(M_* + M
