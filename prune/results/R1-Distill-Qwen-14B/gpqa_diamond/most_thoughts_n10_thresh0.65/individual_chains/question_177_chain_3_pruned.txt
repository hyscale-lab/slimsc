Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it carefully.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured their radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. We're supposed to assume that the stars radiate as black bodies and compute the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2.

Hmm, so I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the luminosity is proportional to R squared times temperature to the fourth power.

But wait, in this question, the stars' spectral types are the same because the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, but wait a second. Oh no, wait, no. Because the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So if they have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2?

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think again. So the peak wavelength λ_max is given by Wien's law as λ_max = (hc)/(5k_B T), approximately. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2. So if T is same for both, then the luminosity ratio is just based on the radius squared. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴. If T is same, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Wait, but wait, wait. The question says the stars radiate as black bodies. So the peak wavelength is determined by their temperature. So if both have same λ_max, same T. So their temperatures are the same.

But wait, wait! The radial velocities are given as 0
