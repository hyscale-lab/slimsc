Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Hmm, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the structure of both the starting material and the target. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group attached. The ethynyl group is like a triple bond between two carbons; so CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane. Now, the target molecule is a bit more complex. It has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group, which is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl (CHO) group attached. Additionally, there's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So, the structure seems to have two cyclohexane rings connected in a specific way with hydroxymethyl and formyl groups.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The substituent at position 1 is a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group. So, that substituent is -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl. So the molecule looks like a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group in one position and a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group in the adjacent position (since it's 1-position). Or perhaps I should think of the main ring as having two substituents: one is the formyl, and the other is the (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group.

Wait, maybe the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group at a certain position. Then, at position 1 (maybe adjacent), there's a substituent that's a CH(OH) connected to another cyclohexane ring. So the structure is:

Cyclohexane ring (A) with a -CHO group at position 1. Then, another substituent at position 1 as well? Or maybe position 2? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexane where one carbon is connected to both the formyl group and the hydroxymethyl cyclohexyl group. Maybe the substituents are on adjacent carbons.

But perhaps I should think about the synthesis steps first. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane, which is CH2-C≡CH attached to a cyclohexane. So maybe I can think of it as the starting material having a triple bond between two carbons, one of which is attached to the cyclohexane.

I need to get to a structure that has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to cyclohexane. Also, there's a cyclohexyl group connected via that hydroxymethyl.

Let me think about what reactions are possible. The reagents in the options involve things like NaNH2, methyl chloride, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, HgSO4, O3, NH4OH, Li in liquid NH3, etc.

Wait, the process probably involves several steps, maybe adding groups and then modifying them.

Let me think about what each reagent does.

NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation, maybe to form alkynes or alkenes via elimination. Methyl chloride would be a methylating agent, perhaps in an SN2 reaction.

H2 with a catalyst like Pd would hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds. So, ethynylcyclohexane reacting with H2 and Pd would become ethylcyclohexane. Alternatively, if using a poisoned catalyst, maybe it stops at the cis double bond. Wait, but in the options, sometimes it's H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which I think is a Lindlar catalyst, which would hydrogenate triple bonds to cis alkenes.

Wait, another thought: using NaNH2 and a methyl chloride would likely perform an alkyne alkylation. Because NaNH2 is a strong base, and in the presence of an alkyl halide, it can deprotonate an alkyne to form an alkyllithium or similar, then add the methyl group. Or wait, perhaps it's a method to form alkylidene cyclohexane rings.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane plus NaNH2 and methyl chloride: maybe it's a method to add a methyl group to the triple bond, making a propargyl group. Or perhaps it's a method to perform a C-H insertion. Alternatively, maybe it's a method to form a new carbon-carbon bond.

Wait, another possibility: the NaNH2 and methyl chloride could be for forming a Grignard reagent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, NaNH2 is used in the formation of alkyne carbanions. For alkyne alkylation, you deprotonate the alkyne to form a carbanion, which then attacks an alkyl halide. So, for example, if you have an internal alkyne, you can deprotonate it with a strong base like NaNH2, then treat with an alkyl halide to add a group.

So ethynylcyclohexane has a terminal alkyne (since it's CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane). Deprotonating with NaNH2 would give a cyclohexylidene acetylide: the cyclohexane attached to the acetylide ion (-C≡C^-). Then, adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide, adding a methyl group. So this would produce (cyclohexyl)-C≡C-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait: ethynyl is -C≡C-CH2- attached to cyclohexane. If I deprotonate it, it's [cyclohexyl-C≡C-]-, then alkylate with CH3Cl, I get cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2-CH3? No, wait: the alkyne is CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonate to [CH2-C≡C-]^- Na^+. Then adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) via SN2 would give CH2-C≡C-CH2-CH3, so the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. So the molecule becomes cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane attached to CH2-C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. If I deprotonate the terminal H (the H on the C≡CH), I get (cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C^-), then add CH3Cl, which would give (cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3)? Hmm, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the structure. Maybe it's more like cyclohexane attached to a propargyl group. Wait, perhaps the starting material is cyclohexane with a propargyl group, CH2-C≡CH. So when we deprotonate and add methyl chloride, would that add a methyl group to the triple bond?

Alternatively, perhaps this step is for forming a new ring. Like, the Grignard reaction or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with both a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So perhaps the process involves forming a diol, then oxidizing to a formyl group.

Wait, maybe the synthesis involves:

1. Starting with ethynylcyclohexane.

2. Perform some reaction to add a methyl group or another substituent.

3. Hydrogenate the triple bond.

4. Perform some oxidation or addition to form the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated first. Let's think about each step.

Option C has steps: NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; then O3/(CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2.

Hmm. Let's go through each step in option C.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. As discussed, this would deprotonate the alkyne and add a methyl group, making a longer alkyne.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonating would give cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C^- (the terminal H is removed), then methyl chloride would add CH3 to the triple bond, making cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. Wait, that would make the alkyne longer. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Wait, but after that, step 2 is H2 with Pd-calcium carbonate (which is a Lindlar catalyst, hydrogenating the triple bond to cis double bond). So the triple bond becomes cis double bond. So now, ethynylcyclohexane becomes 1-cyclohexylethylene? But wait, after step 1, the alkyne is longer, so after hydrogenation, it would have a cis double bond.

So after step 2, the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but wait, no: wait, the alkyne becomes a cis double bond. So, if the alkyne was CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3, hydrogenating would give CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but that's not possible because hydrogenation of triple bonds to double bonds would give a double bond. So, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, the alkyne is CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. Hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, giving a cis double bond in between. So the structure becomes CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond in the middle? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the alkyne is CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. Upon hydrogenation with Lindlar catalyst, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 but as a cis double bond in the middle? No, wait, that doesn't make sense because CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 is a four-carbon chain. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. So the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. When hydrogenated, it becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 but with a double bond. Wait, no, hydrogenation of the triple bond would add two hydrogens across it, turning the triple into a single bond. Wait, no, that's only if using a different catalyst. Lindlar catalyst would hydrogenate a triple bond to a cis double bond, so from CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3, after hydrogenation, it would become CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a cis double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 becomes CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3 in a cis configuration? No, wait, that's not possible because the triple bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So, the structure would be:

cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 → after hydrogenation → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 but with a double bond. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the starting alkyne after step 1 is CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 attached to cyclohexane. Hydrogenating the triple bond would make it a single bond, but with Pd/BaSO4 (which is Lindlar catalyst) would stop at cis double bond. So the alkyne becomes a cis-alkene: CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond between the first two carbons. Wait, no, the original structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. So hydrogenating the triple bond would give cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, that's only if adding two Hs across the triple bond. Wait, no, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Lindlar catalyst would yield a cis double bond. So, the triple bond (≡) becomes a double bond (CH2-CH2-) but with a cis configuration. So the structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH=CH2CH3, but wait, that would be five carbons in a row. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene, but I'm not sure. Another possibility: after step 2, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so the alkyne is fully hydrogenated to a single bond, making it an alkane. Wait, no, Lindlar's catalyst is for hydrogenating alkynes to cis alkenes. So if the alkyne is CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3, after hydrogenation, it would become CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a cis double bond in the middle. So CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 but with a double bond between the middle two carbons. Wait, that's cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the next step.

After hydrogenation, step 3 in option C is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So if step 2 leaves a double bond, ozonolysis would break it. Ozonolysis of a double bond typically forms carbonyl groups. So, if after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but in our target molecule, after the reactions, we have a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached. So perhaps the ozonolysis step is to create a carbonyl group.

Wait, let me think about the steps again.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → this adds a methyl group to the alkyne, making it longer.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenates the alkyne to a cis-alkene.

Step 3: O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis of the cis-alkene, which would break the double bond and form carbonyl groups.

Step 4: Ba(OH)2 → perhaps a hydroxide workup, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and another substituent. So perhaps the ozonolysis is to form the formyl group from the alkene.

Wait, for example, suppose after step 2, the molecule is a cis-alkene. Ozonolysis of a cis-alkene would break it into two carbonyls. So, if the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two fragments.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure after step 2. Let's imagine the alkyne has been hydrogenated to a cis-alkene. So the structure would be something like cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond between the CH2 groups. So, the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 → after hydrogenation, it's cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 but with a double bond between the first two CH2 groups. Wait, no, another approach: perhaps the starting material after step 1 is cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, hydrogenation with Lindlar would make it cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a cis double bond between the two middle carbons. So, the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 → but where is the double bond? It's between the CH2 and CH2CH3 groups? So, the structure would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond between the second and third carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, the molecule is a cis-alkene with the structure cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with a double bond between the two middle carbons. So, the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 → but that's a five-carbon chain. Hmm.

Then, ozonolysis of a cis-alkene would break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups. For example, if the alkene is between carbons 2 and 3, then ozonolysis would cleave into two fragments, each with a carbonyl group.

Wait, but in the target molecule, I have a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group connected to another cyclohexane.

So, perhaps the ozonolysis step is cutting the molecule into two parts: one part with CHO, and the other part with a CHOH group.

Wait, perhaps after ozonolysis, each fragment has a carbonyl group. Then, the Ba(OH)2 step in option C is step 4. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, often used for elimination or for forming epoxides, but more commonly, in the presence of carbonyl groups, maybe for something else.

Alternatively, maybe the Ba(OH)2 is for the hydroxide workup after ozonolysis. Oh wait, ozonolysis is usually followed by reductive workup, like with dimethyl sulfide or Zn, which can lead to aldehydes or ketones. So, after ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved into two carbonyl compounds.

Wait, let me think: if the alkene after step 2 is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond between the CH2 groups, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two aldehyde groups. So, each fragment would have a CHO group.

Wait, but the starting molecule is a longer chain. For example, the alkene is between CH2 and CH2CH3. So, ozonolysis would give two carbonyl compounds: one would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CHO, and the other would be HCHO (formaldehyde) from the CH2CH3 end. But that doesn't fit the target structure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong. Maybe the initial steps form a diol, which is then oxidized.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. So perhaps the formyl group comes from an oxidation of a primary alcohol, and the hydroxymethyl comes from a diol that's been modified.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's think about a possible dihydroxylation reaction. But that would require an alkene, not an alkyne. So perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a trans-alkene via hydrogenation, then subjected to dihydroxylation.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me consider the reagents in the options again.

Looking at option B: steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li in liquid NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would add an ethyl group to the alkyne, making it longer. Then Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination. Ozone would cleave any double bonds, and NH4OH is a mild acid workup.

Option D: steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li in liquid NH3; then O3/(CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the possible steps.

The target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-ethyl group with a triple bond).

Perhaps, the plan is:

1. Alkyne alkylation to form a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis of the alkene to form carbonyl groups.

4. Further reactions to form the hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, which is then oxidized.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. To form the target, which has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group, perhaps one approach is to:

- Add a methyl group to the alkyne, making it a propargyl group attached to cyclohexane.

- Hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond.

- Then perform some dihydroxylation to form a diol.

- Then, perform an oxidation to form a carbonyl group (like formyl).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the steps in option D.

Option D: step 1 is NaNH2, methanol. So, perhaps deprotonating the alkyne and then methylating. But methanol is a methylating agent, but how? Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, so it can deprotonate the alkyne, forming an acetylide. Then, perhaps quenching with methanol would add a methyl group. Hmm, but methanol is a poor electrophile. Alternatively, maybe it's a method to form a Grignard-like compound. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is to form a propargyl alcohol. Wait, how? If you have ethynylcyclohexane and treat it with NaNH2 and methanol, maybe it's a method to insert a hydroxymethyl group. Or perhaps it's a propargyl alcohol formation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 and methyl chloride would add a methyl group to the alkyne, making it cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenate the triple bond to form a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the target structure again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane with a carbaldehyde group (CHO) and a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl (CH(OH)-cyclohexyl) group attached.

So, perhaps the process is:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne to make a propargyl group.

2. Convert the propargyl group into a diol via some dihydroxylation.

3. Oxidize the diol to form a carbonyl group (the formyl group) and a hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not sure about the exact steps and reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a trans-alkene via hydrogenation (using a different catalyst) and then undergoes dihydroxylation to form a vicinal diol. Then, the diol can be oxidized and rearranged.

Wait, another approach: considering the reagents, H2 with Pd could hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making an ethyl group. Then, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for some kind of elimination, but I'm not certain.

Looking at option A: steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd; Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Hmm. Let's see:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkyne alkylation, adding methyl group.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate alkyne to cis-alkene.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → perhaps a Hofmann elimination or other base-induced elimination.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → this is a condition for oxidation, perhaps the Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but maybe in this case, it's for oxidizing an alcohol to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has a formyl group, so perhaps oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. Wait, but Jones oxidation (CrO3 in H2SO4) typically oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, not aldehydes. To get an aldehyde, you might need a milder oxidizing agent, like pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), or maybe using a different condition.

But in option A, step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like the Jones reagent, which would oxidize a primary alcohol to a carboxylic acid. But the target has an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, so maybe this option isn't correct.

Option C's steps: after ozonolysis, Ba(OH)2 is used. So, perhaps the ozonolysis breaks the molecule into two aldehydes, and then the Ba(OH)2 is for some kind of elimination or forming a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence involves making a diol, then performing an oxidation to form the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, another thought: ethynylcyclohexane can be converted into a cyclohexene via hydrogenation, then undergo dihydroxylation to form a vicinal diol. Then, the diol can be oxidized to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the target has two substituents on the cyclohexane: CHO and CH(OH)-cyclohexyl. So perhaps one of the substituents comes from the original cyclohexane, and the other from the added groups.

Wait, perhaps the initial step is to add a methyl group to the alkyne, making a longer chain. Then, hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that into two carbonyl groups. One part would be the cyclohexane with a formyl group, and the other part would be a CHOH group attached to another cyclohexane.

So, for example, after ozonolysis, the molecule breaks into two parts. One part is cyclohexyl-CHO, and the other is CHOH-cyclohexane.

Wait, but ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if the alkene is between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would form two aldehydes. So, for a molecule like R-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-R', the ozonolysis would break into R-CHO and R'-CHO.

But the target has a hydroxymethyl group, not another aldehyde. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis and workup, one of the carbonyl groups is further modified. For instance, if one of the aldehydes is reduced to a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the reagents again.

Looking at option C:

Step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, leading to aldehydes. Then step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination or forming epoxides. But if after ozonolysis, we have two aldehydes, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used to form a hemiacetal or something else. I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group connected via a hydroxymethyl group to the main cyclohexane ring, which also has a formyl group. So, perhaps the hydroxymethyl group comes from an epoxide ring-opening.

Hmm, perhaps after ozonolysis, one of the carbonyl groups is converted into a diol, which then forms an epoxide, which is then opened by a base to form a hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation → longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate to cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form two aldehydes.

4. Then, perform some reaction to form the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, but I'm not getting it. Let me think of another approach.

What if the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, is converted into a cyclohexylidene group via elimination? Then, the triple bond is converted into a double bond, perhaps via deprotonation and elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a vinylic alcohol (allyl alcohol) via some addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group, making a propargyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis of the cis-alkene to form two aldehydes.

4. Perform a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation to form ketones, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is for epoxidation, but that typically uses peracids.

Wait, perhaps I should look at each option and try to see which sequence makes sense.

Let's consider option C again:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes longer.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate to cis-alkene.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → cleave the double bond into two aldehydes.

Step 4: Ba(OH)2 → ?

But the target has a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps one of the aldehyde groups is reduced to a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a hydroxymethyl group. But Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe not for reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination, but I'm not sure.

Let me think of another approach. The target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring. So perhaps the formyl comes from oxidation of a primary alcohol, and the hydroxymethyl comes from a diol that's been converted.

Wait, perhaps after step 3 in option C, one of the aldehyde groups is further reacted. For example, if one aldehyde is from the main ring and the other is from the substituent, which is then converted into a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should try to imagine each step.

In option C:

After step 1, the alkyne is longer. Step 2, hydrogenate to cis-alkene. Step 3: ozonolysis breaks the double bond into two aldehydes. So, the main ring would have a formyl group, and the substituent would have another formyl group. But the target has a hydroxymethyl group, not another aldehyde. So perhaps the substituent's aldehyde is further modified.

Wait, perhaps after ozonolysis, one of the aldehyde groups is reduced to a primary alcohol. But in option C, the next step is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Not sure.

Alternatively, in option B, after ozonolysis (step 3), the workup is with NH4OH, which is a mild acid. Maybe that would lead to the formation of a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, let me think about option B:

Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkyne becomes longer (adds ethyl).

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 → a strong base, perhaps for elimination to form an alkyne again, or maybe for some deprotonation.

Step 3: O3/H2O → ozonolysis, followed by workup with H2O, which could lead to ketones or other carbonyl compounds.

Step 4: NH4OH → maybe a mild acid workup.

Hmm. Not sure.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol → perhaps forms a propargyl alcohol.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 → maybe for elimination, forming a triple bond again.

Step 3: O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond if any, forming carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → workup.

Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about oxidation states. The target has a formyl group, which is a higher oxidation state than the starting alkyne.

So, oxidation steps would be involved.

Another possible reaction sequence:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkyne alkylation with methyl chloride to form a propargyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis of the cis-alkene to form two aldehydes.

4. One of the aldehydes is on the main ring, the other is on a substituent. The substituent's aldehyde is then converted into a hydroxymethyl group.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the substituent's aldehyde is treated with a reducing agent to form a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl group, but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's aldehyde is protected, and then a hydroxymethyl group is added.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a sequence where after ozonolysis, a carbonyl is formed, and then perhaps a Grignard addition forms the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So perhaps after ozonolysis, one of the carbonyl groups is converted into a hydroxymethyl group via a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group → propargyl group.

2. Hydrogenate alkyne to cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to cleave into two aldehydes.

4. One aldehyde is oxidized to a carboxylic acid, but that doesn't fit the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is reduced to a primary alcohol, which is then converted to a hydroxymethyl group via some reaction.

Wait, but in option C, after ozonolysis (step 3), step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination. Alternatively, it's used in the presence of carbonyl groups for some kind of condensation, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the initial step is to add a methyl group to the alkyne, making it longer. Then, hydrogenate to a cis-alkene. Then, ozonolysis breaks the double bond into two aldehydes. Then, treatment with Ba(OH)2 would perform a Cannizzaro reaction on one of the aldehydes, forming a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. But the target has a hydroxymethyl group, so maybe that's it.

Wait, the Cannizzaro reaction occurs when an aldehyde without alpha hydrogens is treated with a strong base. It disproportionates into a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. So, if one of the aldehydes after ozonolysis doesn't have alpha hydrogens, Ba(OH)2 could cause that.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the Ba(OH)2 is for a different reaction.

Wait, in the target, the hydroxymethyl group is attached to the cyclohexane. So perhaps one of the aldehydes after ozonolysis is on a CH2 group, which when treated with Ba(OH)2 (a strong base) would form a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps in option C, after ozonolysis, the main ring has a formyl group and the substituent has another formyl group. Then, treatment with Ba(OH)2 could cause elimination, forming a double bond, but that doesn't directly give a hydroxymethyl group.

I'm really stuck. Let me consider another angle. The correct answer is likely option C. Let me think why.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne alkylation, adding methyl group.

2. H2 with Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate to cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → cleave into two aldehydes.

4. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps for forming the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps after ozonolysis, one of the aldehydes is on a CH2 group. Then, Ba(OH)2 could cause a reduction or some elimination. Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used in a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's for ketones.

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, one of the aldehydes is on a cyclohexane ring, and the other is on a chain that can be converted into a hydroxymethyl group via some reaction.

Wait, perhaps the substituent's aldehyde is treated with a Grignard reagent to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone. But that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, one of the aldehydes is on a CH2 group attached to the main ring. Then, Ba(OH)2 could cause a hydration, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct sequence likely involves adding a methyl group, hydrogenating the alkyne to a cis-alkene, ozonolysis to form aldehydes, and then some reaction to form the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, another possibility: after ozonolysis, one of the aldehydes is further reduced to a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to form a hydroxymethyl group. But how? Because the target has a hydroxymethyl group, which is a secondary alcohol attached to a cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the primary alcohol is then converted into a hydroxymethyl group via some protection and ring-opening. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is used to form an epoxide from an alkene, but in this case, the alkene was already cleaved by ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → add methyl group to make a propargyl group.

2. Hydrogenate to cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form two aldehydes.

4. One aldehyde is oxidized to a carboxylic acid (but target doesn't have that), so maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps one aldehyde is left as is (formyl group), and the other is converted into a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent's aldehyde is treated with a reducing agent like NaBH4 to form a primary alcohol, which is then protected as a tosylate and used in a nucleophilic substitution to form a hydroxymethyl group. But I don't see such reagents in the options.

Wait, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 in step 4 is used to perform an elimination, forming a double bond, which is then hydrogenated or something else. Not sure.

At this point, I think I should make an educated guess. The correct answer is likely option C, as it involves ozonolysis followed by Ba(OH)2. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, option D might be correct.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. So, maybe one of the carbonyl groups from ozonolysis is oxidized further, and the other is reduced.

But I'm not making progress. I think I'll go with option C.


The problem involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH(OH)-) attached to another cyclohexane ring. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: This step likely alkylates the terminal alkyne, adding a methyl group to form a longer alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd**: This step hydrogenates the alkyne to a cis-alkene using Lindlar's catalyst.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: This strong base could induce elimination or form epoxides, but its role here is unclear.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: These are Jones oxidation conditions, which typically oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids. However, the target molecule contains a formyl group (-CHO), not a carboxylic acid, making this sequence inconsistent with the target.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: This step alkylates the terminal alkyne, adding an ethyl group to form a longer alkyne.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: This strong base could induce elimination or deprotonation, but its exact role is unclear.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl compounds. However, the workup with H₂O might not directly lead to the desired hydroxymethyl group.
4. **NH₄OH**: This mild acid workup could hydrolyze ozonolysis products, but the sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxymethyl group is formed.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: This step alkylates the terminal alkyne, adding a methyl group to form a longer alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Lindlar's catalyst hydrogenates the alkyne to a cis-alkene.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the cis-alkene to form two aldehydes. One aldehyde remains on the main cyclohexane ring, while the other is attached to a substituent.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: This strong base could facilitate the formation of the hydroxymethyl group from one of the aldehydes, aligning with the target structure.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: This step might form a propargyl alcohol, but the mechanism is unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: This strong base could induce elimination or deprotonation, but its role is ambiguous.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl compounds.
4. **NH₄OH**: This mild acid workup could hydrolyze ozonolysis products, but the sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxymethyl group is formed.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the most plausible sequence. The alkyne is alkylated to form a longer alkyne, hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, ozonolyzed to form two aldehydes, and finally treated with Ba(OH)₂ to form the hydroxymethyl group, consistent with the target molecule.
