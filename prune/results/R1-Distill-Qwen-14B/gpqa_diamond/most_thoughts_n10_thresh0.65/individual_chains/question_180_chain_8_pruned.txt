Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, okay. So all the particles are identical and have a charge of 2e. Since the 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. So they are all at the same distance from the fixed charge.

I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Because when you have multiple charges in a system, their potential energy contributes to the total energy of the system.

Wait, the question is about the minimum energy. So I need to find the configuration where the potential energy is minimized. Since potential energy is related to the electric potential between charges, and since like charges repel, maybe arranging them in a way that minimizes repulsion would give the minimum energy.

But wait, all the 12 charges are at the same distance from P. So each of them is fixed at 2 meters from P. So the fixed charge is at P, and the others are arranged in a sphere around it, each at 2 meters distance.

Wait, but the problem says "12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P." So it's like a spherical arrangement? Or maybe they're all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P, where the 13th charge is fixed.

So the system consists of one charge at the center (P) and 12 around it, each 2 meters away. So, how do I calculate the potential energy of this system?

I think the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But since all the 12 charges are identical and each is at the same distance from the central charge, each pair contributes the same amount.

Wait, but wait. The system's total potential energy is the sum of all the potential energies between each pair of charges. So that includes the energy between the central charge and each of the 12, and also the potential energies between each of the 12 charges themselves.

Ah, right. So the total potential energy U_total is the sum of U between the central charge and each of the 12, plus the potential energies between each pair of the 12 charges.

But wait, the central charge is fixed, so can the other 12 move relative to each other? Or are they fixed in space as well? Hmm, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So they can't change their distance from P, but can they move around each other, changing the distance between themselves? Or are they fixed in a particular configuration?

Wait, the problem probably assumes that the 12 charges are placed symmetrically around the central charge. That would minimize the potential energy between them, but wait, like charges repel, so if we can arrange them in a way that their mutual repulsion is minimized, that would affect the potential energy
