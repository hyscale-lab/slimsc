Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Like, if one object is moving at 0.6c and another at 0.5c, you can't just say their relative speed is 0.1c because that's what classical mechanics would say. Instead, I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Wait, but which one is moving faster? The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the second, how fast is the first moving? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the problem is asking for the relative speed. So I think the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Since both are moving in the same direction, subtracting their speeds gives the relative speed. Let me plug in the numbers.

v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c². Let's compute that. 0.6*0.5 is 0.3, times c²/c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So that's approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, that's either C or D.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic kinetic energy plus their rest mass energy. But wait, wait. The total energy would be the sum of their energies in the rest frame of which observer?

Wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system." Hmm. So in which frame are we considering the system's total energy? Since both are moving, perhaps the center of mass frame? Or maybe the problem is asking for the sum of their energies as measured in one of the frames, perhaps the rest frame of one astronaut.

Wait, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. But I think in such questions, when you're given two objects moving in the same direction, the total energy is the sum of their energies in the same frame. But wait, the frame is not specified. Oh, wait, in the lab frame. Or maybe the problem is considering each astronaut's rest frame. Hmm, perhaps I should think about it differently.

Wait a minute, each astronaut is moving at a certain speed, so their energies are their relativistic energies. The total energy would be the sum of their individual energies. Let me think.

But wait, the problem states "the total energy of the system." So it's probably the sum of their energies in the same frame. Let me calculate each astronaut's energy in the lab frame, assuming that the lab is the frame where, say, the Earth is at rest. But wait, the problem doesn't specify any particular frame for the system's energy. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the center of momentum frame, and the total energy would be the sum of their energies in that frame. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options, the energy options are 4.96 mc², 5.96 mc², 5 mc², and 1 mc². 5 mc² is just the sum of their rest energies, but since they are moving, their energies are higher.

Wait, each astronaut's total energy is gamma * mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

The second astronaut has mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2 ) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So his energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding these together: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 mc². So that's about 5.96 mc². Which corresponds to option C: E=5.96 mc², and v_rel=0.14c.

Wait, but wait a minute. Am I adding the energies correctly? Because the question says "the total energy of the system." If both are moving in the same direction in a particular frame, say the lab frame, then their energies are added as I did. But perhaps the problem is considering the rest frame of the system, which would be the center of momentum frame. Then the total energy would be the sum as calculated, but the velocities would be different.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the relative speed and the total energy. So the relative speed would be the speed of one as seen from the other, which we calculated as 0.14c. The total energy is the sum in the same frame as the relative speed is measured. So if the relative speed is calculated in the frame of one astronaut, then the total energy would be the energy from that frame's perspective.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the steps.

1. Find the relative speed between the two astronauts. Use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/c² )

v1 = 0.6c, v2 =0.5c.

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c² )

So v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. So options C and D have this.

2. Total energy: either each in their own frame, or in the lab frame. Hmm. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the intended approach is to compute the sum of their energies in the same frame where the relative speed is measured. But wait, the relative speed is the speed of one as seen from the other. So when considering the energy of the system, are we in the rest frame of one astronaut?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each astronaut's energy is considered in the lab frame (assuming that the lab is a frame where both are moving as given). So let me proceed under that assumption.

So astronaut 1 (mass 2m) has v=0.6c. His gamma is 1.25. So his energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Astronaut 2 (mass 3m) has v=0.5c. Gamma is 1.1547. So his energy is 1.1547 *3m c² = approx 3.464 mc².

Total energy is 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc², which is about 5.96 mc². So that's option C: E=5.96 mc², v_rel=0.14c.

So the correct answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass = \(2m\), velocity = \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy = \(\gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2\)

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass = \(3m\), velocity = \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy = \(\gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2\)

Adding these energies:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
