Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this.

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just use classical mechanics because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I'll need to use Einstein's theory of relativity here.

First, the question is about the relative speed. Wait, since both are moving in the same direction, I think the relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds divided by something, right? Oh wait, no. Because in relativity, velocities don't add like that. But wait, the problem is asking for the relative speed as observed from one astronaut's frame of reference. Or wait, maybe it's from the perspective of one astronaut to the other?

Wait, no. Wait, the question says "relative speed and the total energy of the system." So perhaps the relative speed is how fast one astronaut sees the other moving. Because if both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference in their speeds, but relativistically.

Wait, but in relativity, the velocities don't just subtract. So how do you find the relative velocity between two objects moving at high speeds in the same direction?

Oh right, for relative velocity in relativity, you use the velocity addition formula. The formula is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/cÂ²), but wait
