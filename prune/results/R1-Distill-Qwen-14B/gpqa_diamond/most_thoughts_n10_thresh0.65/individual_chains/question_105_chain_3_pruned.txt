Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the observed brightness variations, which could mimic an exoplanet. Interesting.

So, the star has the same radius as the Sun, right? And one hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, so that means 20% of that hemisphere is covered. Wait, but wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots, right? So if it's 20%, that's 0.2 in decimal.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, I suppose, since they're dark spots. Oh, wait, the temperature difference is 1000 K. So the spots are either 5000 K or 7000 K? Hmm, but I think starspots are usually cooler, so they're 5000 K.

The problem says that because of the spots, when the star rotates, the brightness variation looks like an exoplanet transit. So we're to find the radius of such an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness change.

Wait, when a planet transits a star, it blocks some light. The change in brightness (the dip) depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. So the formula is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because area scales with radius squared.

But wait, the star has spots, so when it's not covered by spots, how does that affect the brightness variation? Because when the spot is facing us, it's a cooler area, so the star's overall brightness is a bit lower. But when the spot is on the other side, it's not visible, so the brightness is higher.

Wait, no. The problem says that the star's brightness varies because of the spots. But if the star wasn't spotted, what exoplanet radius would cause the same amplitude change in brightness as this spotted star does.

Wait, the question is a bit tricky. Let me restate it: For a star with spots, when it rotates, the observed brightness changes because the spots come in and out of view. This change is similar to the change caused by a planet transiting the star. So we need to find the planet radius that would cause the same dip as the spot-induced variation.

So, I need to calculate the brightness variation caused by
