Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and it's also 1.5 times more massive. But wait, the mass might not matter here because the question is about luminosity. I remember that luminosity relates more to radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says Luminosity L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius and T is temperature. So mass might not be directly involved, unless mass affects temperature somehow, but I'll assume that temperature is given or can be found from the data.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (their peak wavelengths) are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength from blackbody radiation, which is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but both stars have the same temperature? Because their λ_max are the same. Then, I can proceed to calculate their luminosities based on their radii.

So for Star_1, R1 = 1.5 R2. Since L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is the same for both, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1/R2)². Because T is the same, T⁴ cancels out, so it's (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor would be 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, the question mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Does that affect the calculation?

Hmm. Radial velocity is the speed along the line of sight. But when we observe the star's spectrum, the Doppler effect shifts the wavelengths. But in this problem, the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So maybe their rest wavelengths are different, but because of their velocities, the observed wavelengths are same.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused
