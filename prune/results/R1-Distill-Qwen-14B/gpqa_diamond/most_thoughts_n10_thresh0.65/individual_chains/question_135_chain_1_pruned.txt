Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the decay of a boson X. I remember that bosons can decay into fermions based on certain rules, like conservation laws and the mass of the boson compared to the fermion masses.

The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, so this looks like an interaction term where the boson X is interacting with some fermion field ψf. The λ is probably the coupling constant, but I don't think that affects the decay possibilities directly.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, the total energy available is 6 GeV. I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the combined mass of the fermion and its anti-particle must be less than the mass of the boson. Because energy and momentum conservation require that the rest mass energy of the decay products is less than the mass of the decaying particle.

So, first, I need to list all possible fermion types that can be produced. The fermions are quarks and leptons. Let me think about their masses. Wait, but wait—does the mass of the fermions affect the decay? Oh right, because in the rest frame of the boson, the fermion and anti-fermion would each have some kinetic energy, so their rest mass must be less than half the boson's mass. Because each would have to have at least their rest mass energy. So the condition is 2m_fermion ≤ m_X. So m_fermion ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the standard model fermion masses are way below that. Let me recall the masses:

Leptons:
- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV (0.5 MeV)
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~2 MeV
- Down (d): ~4 MeV
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV (wait, that's almost 5 GeV)
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV

So, the fermions on the market for X decay would be those with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let's see:

Leptons:
e, mu, tau. Tau is ~1.78 GeV, so 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the rest mass of the tau is about 1.78 GeV. So 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau can be produced because 3.56 <6. So tau+ tau- is allowed.

Wait, but the question is about the mass of X being 6 GeV. So each fermion pair would need 2m_ferm
