Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, and then determining the product after a series of reactions. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let me break that down. Carbon 8, hydrogen 9, nitrogen 1, oxygen 1. 

The NMR data is given as:
9.72 (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

So, looking at the NMR, the first peak is at Î´9.72, which is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton? Or perhaps an aromatic proton in a specific environment. Wait, aldehyde protons are typically around 9-10 ppm, so that's a possibility. 

Looking at the other signals, the 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each integrating for 2H. These might be part of an aromatic ring. The 6.27 is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad signals can sometimes be from protons that are exchanging, like -OH groups. But wait, if it's a singlet, maybe it's a conjugated diene or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents, but not sure yet.

The 3.66 is a doublet integrating for 2H. That seems like it's a CH2 group, maybe next to an electronegative atom. Like an OCH2 group? Or perhaps a CH2 attached to something else, like a carbonyl.

The molecular formula C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Hmm, substituting: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Wait, wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, X=0 maybe, because O is included as O. So it's (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a ring plus double bonds. For example, a benzene ring (three double bonds and a ring, so four degrees) plus another double bond, like an aldehyde or an enal.

So putting this together, maybe the compound has a benzene ring and an aldehyde group, and possibly some substituents.

Looking at the NMR, the triplet at 9.72 is 1H. If that's an aldehyde, then it's probably a terminal aldehyde. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually a singlet, but in some cases, like conjugated systems, they can be split. Oh, a triplet suggests that it's coupled with two neighboring protons. So maybe the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system, like an enal.

Wait, but the aldehyde in an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde (
