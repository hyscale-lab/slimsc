Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but let's try to think it through. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Wait, okay, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

Wait, the formula is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. So distance r is inversely proportional to plx. So, plx = 1/r, meaning r = 1/plx. So r is proportional to 1/plx.

The problem states N ‚àù 1/(plx)^5. So substituting r into that equation, since plx is 1/r, plx^5 would be (1/r)^5, which is 1/r^5. So 1/(plx)^5 is the same as 1/(1/r^5) which is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5?

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. And plx is 1/r. So plx = 1/r, so plx^5 = (1/r)^5 = 1/r^5. So 1/(plx)^5 is 1/(1/r^5) = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as the distance increases, the
