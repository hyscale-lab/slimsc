Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me break it down.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. Wait, butan-2-one is methyl isopropyl ketone, I think. Its structure is (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts with sodium cyanide, which is NaCN, and some reagent A, it forms this other compound.

I remember that when ketones react with HCN (or its sources like NaCN), it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism is that the ketone's carbonyl gets attacked by the cyanide ion. But wait, that would give a cyanohydrin, right? So the product would have an alcohol and a nitrile group on the same carbon as the original carbonyl. Let me check the product: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Its structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That makes sense because the ketone (butan-2-one) would add the cyanide, with the H from where? Oh, right, the addition of HCN gives the cyanohydrin.

Wait, but how is this done? I think HCN is usually added in acidic conditions because it's a weak acid. Or maybe in the presence of an acid catalyst. Because NaCN is a source of CN- but in
