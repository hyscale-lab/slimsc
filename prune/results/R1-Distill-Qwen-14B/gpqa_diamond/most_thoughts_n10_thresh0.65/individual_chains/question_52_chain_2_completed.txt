Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and think about what's being asked.

So, the question is about a star with certain parameters. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. Interesting, so the spots are making the star appear cooler overall.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Titanium (Ti) in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The task is to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. And we're assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) holds in the stellar photosphere.

Hmm, so I'm thinking this involves the Boltzmann equation for the distribution of particles in energy states. The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy levels. The ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1 (or vice versa) depends on the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but sometimes it's expressed as the ratio of level 1 to level 2. Let me make sure. Oh right, the equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if I'm looking at (n1/n2), that's (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Or wait, perhaps it's better to write it as (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

In this case, the ratio (n1/n2) would be (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) ), because if I invert the ratio, I get (n1/n2) = 1/(n2/n1) = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T) ).

But in the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So, when the star is spotted, T_eff is lower, which affects the ratio.

Wait, but the overall photospheric temperature is lower when spots are present. So the spots cause the average T_eff to drop. But wait, wait, the star's surface isn't uniformly at 5500 K when spots are present. Because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. Oh, but wait the question says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Hmm, perhaps the model here is that the star is a composite of two regions: the spotted area and the unspotted area. But the problem says the overall effective temp is 5500 K, but I'm not sure if that's the same as the photospheric temperature in each region.

Wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But perhaps I'm to assume that the photosphere without spots is at 6000 K, and with spots, the effective temperature averaged over the entire surface is 5500 K. But wait, that may complicate things because the star's surface isn't at a uniform temperature. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, which might not be the case. Hmm, but the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So maybe the entire photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K when spots are present. But that might not be physically accurate because the spotted regions are cooler and the rest are at 6000 K. But perhaps, for the sake of this problem, the average is 5500 K.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the effective temperature of the entire star. The effective temperature is what we observe, based on the total luminosity. So when spots cover 40% of the surface, the star's luminosity decreases because the spots are cooler. But the problem states that the overall Teff is 5500 K in that case.

Wait, but the luminosity of a star is given by L = 4π R² σ Teff^4. So when the star has a lower Teff, its luminosity is lower. But the details of how the spots contribute to the overall luminosity would involve the area and temperature of the spots. However, perhaps that's not directly needed for this problem.

The question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. So the key here is that the ratio is temperature-dependent. The ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to exp(Delta E/(k T)), where Delta E is E2 - E1. When the temperature decreases, this exponent becomes smaller, so the ratio decreases. Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio is lower than when T is higher (6000 K). So the factor by which the ratio changes is (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots) = (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

So, let's compute the ratio.

But first, the energy levels are related to the wavelength via the relation E = hc/λ. The transition is at 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range. So the energy difference ΔE is hc/λ, where λ is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1448e-10 meters.

Wait, but to compute the exponent, we can also use the relation in terms of temperature. Let me recall that the transition energy can be written as ΔE = k * T_ion or something, but perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of the ratio of the exponentials.

Wait, let's think about the ratio of the ratios. The ratio when not spotted (T1 = 6000 K) is (n1/n2)_1 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T1)).

When spotted (T2 = 5500 K), it's (n1/n2)_2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T2)).

So the factor is (n1/n2)_1 / (n1/n2)_2 = exp( [ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2)] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) [1/T1 - 1/T2] ) ).

Hmm, so that's the factor by which the ratio increases when the temperature goes from T2 to T1. Because when T goes up, the exponent increases, so the ratio increases.

Wait, but wait. ΔE is E2 - E1, so it's a positive number. So when T increases, the exponent ΔE/(k T) becomes larger, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases. Hence, (n1/n2) increases with temperature. So when the star has spots (lower T), (n1/n2) is lower. So the ratio (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2 is greater than 1.

So the factor we're looking for is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500. Let me compute this factor.

But to compute this, I need to calculate the exponent [ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2)] = ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2).

Let me compute that. So, I can calculate (1/T1 - 1/T2) in units of 1/K, multiply by ΔE/(k), which will give me a dimensionless number for the exponent.

But perhaps it's easier to work in terms of the ratio of the exponents. Wait, another approach: the exponent can be written as (ΔE/k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (ΔE/k) [ (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) ].

Alternatively, since ΔE = hc/λ, we can write it as hc/(λ k) [1/T1 - 1/T2].

Wait, let's compute the numerical value.

Given:

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters.

h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J s

c = speed of light = 3e8 m/s

k = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38e-23 J/K

T1 = 6000 K

T2 = 5500 K

Compute ΔE/(k) = (h c)/(λ k) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 )

Wait, let me compute that.

First, compute numerator: h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator: λ k = 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = Let me compute 1448e-10 = 1.448e-7 meters.

So denominator: 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 2.00e-30 J m / K.

Wait, no: 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = (1.448 * 1.38) * 1e-7-23 = approx 2.00 * 1e-30.

So numerator is 1.9878e-25 J m.

So ΔE/(k) = numerator / denominator = (1.9878e-25) / (2.00e-30) ) ≈ 1.9878e5.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that again.

Wait, wait, 1e-25 / 1e-30 is 1e5. So 1.9878e-25 /2e-30 = (1.9878/2)*1e5 = approx 0.9939 * 1e5 = ~9.939e4.

So approximately 9.94e4 K.

Wait, no, wait, because when I compute (h c)/(λ k), the units should be in terms of K. Because h c / (λ k) is (J m) / (J/K * m) ) = K. So yeah, that's why the result is in K.

Wait, so ΔE/(k) = 9.94e4 K. That makes sense because for typical atomic transitions, the energy is on the order of eV, and when you divide by k (which is about 8.6e-5 eV/K), you get a temperature in the thousands of K.

Wait, no. Wait, 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so k = 8.6e-5 eV/K. So for an energy difference of about 4 eV (since 1448 Å is in the UV, which corresponds to higher energy photons), let's see: E = hc/λ. Let me compute that.

h c = 12400 eV·Å (since 12400 eV·Å is a commonly used value for hc). So E = 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.56 eV. So ΔE is about 8.56 eV.

So, ΔE/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.6e-5 eV/K) ≈ 1e5 K. So the 9.94e4 K is about 1e5 K, which matches.

So, ΔE/(k) ≈ 9.94e4 K.

Then, [1/T1 - 1/T2] = (1/6000 - 1/5500) K^-1.

Compute 1/6000 = 0.00016667, 1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818.

So 0.00016667 - 0.0001818 ≈ -0.00001513.

Wait, wait, wait. That can't be right. Because 1/6000 is smaller than 1/5500, so 1/6000 - 1/5500 is negative. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, actually, 1/6000 is 0.000166667, 1/5500 is approximately 0.000181818. So 0.000166667 minus 0.000181818 is negative, about -0.000015151.

Wait, but when I take (1/T1 - 1/T2), it's (1/6000 -1/5500) ≈ -0.00001515 K^-1.

But when multiplied by ΔE/(k), which is positive, the overall term becomes negative.

So the exponent is [ΔE/(k)] (1/T1 - 1/T2 ) = 9.94e4 K * (-0.00001515 K^-1) ≈ -1.506.

So the exponent is approximately -1.506.

So the factor is exp( -1.506 ) ≈ e^(-1.506) ≈ 0.221.

Wait, but wait, because the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) ) = exp(-1.506) ≈ 0.221. So the ratio with no spots is 0.221 times the ratio with spots. Or wait, no, because when T increases, (n1/n2) increases.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

When T increases, (n1/n2) increases because the exponent ΔE/(k T) increases, making exp(ΔE/(k T)) larger. So when the star has spots, T is lower, (n1/n2) is lower. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. Therefore, (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = exp( [ΔE/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) ].

Wait, that makes the exponent negative, so the factor is ~0.221. So this would mean that the ratio without spots is 0.221 times the ratio with spots. Which would imply that the ratio decreases, which is what the problem says. So the factor by which the ratio changes is 1/0.221 ≈ 4.52. Oh wait, no. Wait, because the question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_without_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Which is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = exp( [ΔE/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) ] = exp(-1.506) ≈ 0.221.

Wait, that would imply that the ratio without spots is 0.221 times the ratio with spots. So the ratio decreases by a factor of about 4.52, because 1/0.221 ≈ 4.52. So the factor is about 4.5. So the answer would be option C) ~4.5.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation, because I might have a mistake somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio (n1/n2) at T1 and T2 and take their ratio.

Let me compute the ratio as follows:

(n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T))

So the ratio at T1 is A = exp(ΔE/(k T1)).

At T2 it's B = exp(ΔE/(k T2)).

The factor is A/B = exp(ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2)) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) )

Which is the same as before.

So with ΔE/(k) ≈ 9.94e4 K,

(1/6000 -1/5500) = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(3.3e7) ) = -500/(3.3e7) = -1.515e-5 K^-1.

Multiply by ΔE/(k) =9.94e4 K: 9.94e4 * (-1.515e-5) ≈ -1.506.

So the exponent is -1.506, so exp(-1.506) ≈ 0.221.

So the factor is 0.221. So the ratio without spots is 0.221 times the ratio with spots. Therefore, the ratio decreases by a factor of 1/0.221 ≈ 4.52. So the factor by which the ratio changes (without spots compared to with spots) is ~4.5. So the answer should be option C) ~4.5.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\Delta E / k \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \Delta E / k \)
The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is related to the wavelength of the transition by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{h c}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength. Substituting the given wavelength \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.366 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

To convert \( \Delta E \) into units of \( k \), we divide by \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \approx \frac{1.366 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.9 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the temperature difference term
The temperatures are \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (no spots) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (with spots). The term \( \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) \) is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}.
\]

Converting to decimal form:

\[
\frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001667, \quad \frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001818.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \approx 0.0001667 - 0.0001818 = -0.0000151 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the factor
Substituting into the factor formula:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right).
\]

Using \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \approx 9.9 \times 10^4 \, \text{K} \) and \( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \approx -0.0000151 \, \text{K}^{-1} \):

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(9.9 \times 10^4 \cdot (-0.0000151)\right) = \exp(-1.505).
\]

The exponential term is:

\[
\exp(-1.505) \approx 0.221.
\]

### Step 4: Interpret the result
The factor by which the ratio \( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \) changes is approximately \( 0.221 \). This means the ratio decreases by a factor of:

\[
\frac{1}{0.221} \approx 4.52.
\]

Thus, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately **4.5** when the star has spots compared to when it does not.

**Answer: C**
