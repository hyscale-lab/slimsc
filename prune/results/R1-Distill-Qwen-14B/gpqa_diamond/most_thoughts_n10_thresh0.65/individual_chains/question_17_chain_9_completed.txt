Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

Alright, the problem says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of the complex itself is 0.02 M. And they give the formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Wait, what's a formation constant again? Oh right, it's the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. So, the reaction is probably Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, and K would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but wait, because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, right? So the formation of the complex is a bit different. So the actual reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- with K equal to 5e10. Or maybe it's a different stoichiometry? Well, the problem says "stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex," which probably means it's a 1:1 ratio, so one Ca²+ to one EDTA^4-.

But wait, EDTA is usually in the Y^4- form when it's deprotonated. So, under the right pH, which the problem says is ideal, so we can assume that EDTA is mostly in the Y^4- form. That's good because otherwise, the free EDTA concentration would be a bit tricky to find.

So, the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let's denote the complex as CaY²−, where Y is EDTA. So, the initial concentration of CaY²− is 0.02 M.

Now, in solution, this complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and Y^4−. The dissociation reaction is CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4−. The formation constant K is given as 5e10, so the dissociation constant K_d (which is the inverse of K) would be 1/(5e10). Because K for formation is [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]) =5e10. So Kd = [Ca²+][Y^4−]/[CaY²−] = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, K for the formation is K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]). So in the dissociation, the reverse reaction, which is Kd = 1/K. So yes, Kd is 2e-11.

But wait, the problem gives K_ca-edta as 5e10. So, Kd is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. So, the dissociation will be very little because Kd is very small, meaning the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much. So the concentrations of Ca²+ and Y^4− are going to be very low compared to the complex.

So, let's set up the equilibrium expression. Let’s let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate from the complex. So, at equilibrium:

[CaY²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (because x is going to be very small due to the high K and small Kd)

[Ca²+] = x
[Y^4−] = x

Because for each mole of CaY²− that dissociates, one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of Y^4− are produced. So their concentrations are equal and both are x.

So putting into the Kd expression:

Kd = [Ca²+][Y^4−] / [CaY²−] = (x)(x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02 = 2e-11.

Solving for x:

x² = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately. sqrt(4e-13)=sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13)=2*(1e-6.5)=2*(3.1623e-7)=6.3246e-7 M. So approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches.

Wait, but wait, wait a minute. Did I get the Kd right? The K for the formation is 5e10, so Kd is 1/(5e10)=2e-11. So yes, that's correct.

So [Ca²+] is x≈6.3e-7 M. So the concentration is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

Wait, but what about the total EDTA concentration? Because in solution, EDTA can also be in different protonated forms, but the problem says pH is ideal, so we can assume that EDTA is mostly Y^4−. So the total EDTA (free + complexed) is 0.02 M. Because the complex is 0.02, and a tiny amount is dissociated. So that holds.

Wait, but another thought: if the solution is 0.02 M CaY²−, and the dissociation is x, then the total EDTA is [Y^4−] + [CaY²−] = x + 0.02, but because x is so small, it's approximately 0.02. So that's okay.

So, I think the correct answer is C, 6.3e-7 M.


To calculate the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻), we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

At equilibrium, the concentrations of Ca²⁺ and Y⁴⁻ are equal and denoted as \( x \), while the concentration of the complex \([ \text{CaY}^{2-} ]\) is approximately 0.02 M (since dissociation is minimal due to the small \( K_d \)).

The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is \( [ \text{Ca}^{2+} ] = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
