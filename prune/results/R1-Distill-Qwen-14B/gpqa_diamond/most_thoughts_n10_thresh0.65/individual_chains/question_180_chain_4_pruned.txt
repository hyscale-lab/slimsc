Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says: We've got an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything related to motion. 

Out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and the options are given as A, B, C, D.

Wait, wait. So the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So point P is where the 13th charge is located. So the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2 meters from P.

Hmm, the system's energy. Since all the charges are identical and likely repelling each other, the potential energy of the system would be determined by the configuration of these charges.

But I'm a bit confused. So the fixed charge is at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters from P. So each of these 12 is a distance r = 2m from P. But what about the distance between the 12 charges themselves?

Wait, because if the 12 are all at 2m from P, their mutual distances might not be zero. But if they're constrained to stay at 2m from P, perhaps they are arranged in a sphere around P, but their exact arrangement might affect the potential energy. But wait, the problem says "minimum energy"â€”so I probably need to find the configuration where the potential energy is minimized, which would be the most stable configuration.

Wait, wait, no. The potential energy between positive charges is positive because they repel each other. So the more they are spread out, the lower the potential energy. But wait, actually, in the case of repulsive forces, the potential energy is minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible. But in this case, they're constrained to stay at a distance of 2m from P. So their positions relative to each other might not be variable. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify their arrangement. That complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem only mentions the distance from P for the 12 charges. Maybe the other interactions between the 12 charges are negligible,
