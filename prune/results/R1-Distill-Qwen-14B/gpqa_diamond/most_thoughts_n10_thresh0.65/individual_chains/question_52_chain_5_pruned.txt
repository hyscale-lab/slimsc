Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and see what's going on.

So the question is about a star with certain characteristics and how spots on its surface affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. Alright, let's break this down.

The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, why does the Teff decrease when there are spots? Oh, right, because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so they emit less radiation. So the star's total luminosity decreases, and hence the effective temperature goes down.

But the key part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The problem states that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots.

So, the ratio N1/N2 decreases when there are spots. So without spots, N1/N2 is higher than when spots are present. We're to find the factor by which it changes, which would be (N1/N2)_no_spots divided by (N1/N2)_with_spots.

Wait, no, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, N1/N2 is lower. So the ratio without spots is higher. So the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots, which would be greater than 1.

The problem gives that the transition between these two levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Angstroms, which is in the far ultraviolet, I think. But the star emits in that wavelength? Hmm, but the star's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. Let me think about blackbody radiation. The peak wavelength for a star's emission is given by Wien's law: lambda_max ≈ 3000 K * Angstrom. So for 5500 K, lambda_max ≈ 3000 * 5500 / 10^6 = 3000 * 0.0055 = 1.65 microns, which is 16500 Angstroms. Hmm, but that's just the peak; the star emits a range of wavelengths around that.

But back to the problem. The relevant part is about the population of energy levels in the photosphere. The problem states that the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so we can use the Boltzmann equation to find the ratio of populations.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels, E1 and E2 are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but we’re considering the same star in two different temperature states (with and without spots). So the T here would be the effective temperature of the photosphere in each case.

Wait, but the spots are cooler. Wait, but the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So without spots, T_eff is 6000 K, and with spots, it's 5500 K. So the photosphere as a whole is at a lower temperature when spots are present.

But wait, the star's surface isn't uniformly at T_eff. Oh, right, the effective temperature is an average. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, which are cooler, and the remaining 60% is at 6000 K. But wait, the problem says that when the star's surface isn't covered by spots,
