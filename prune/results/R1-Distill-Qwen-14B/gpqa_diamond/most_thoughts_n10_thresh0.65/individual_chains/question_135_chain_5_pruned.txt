Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question gives the Lagrangian for the interaction between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I might have misread that. Oh right, it's probably L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So, the interaction term is proportional to (v + X) times the fermion fields.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermion pairs X can decay into.

First, I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because energy and momentum must be conserved, the rest mass is a key factor here.

Wait, but wait. The fermions in the interaction are probably the ones that are part of the Yukawa interaction. The Lagrangian given is similar to the Yukawa coupling form. So, the fermion ψ_f would couple to the boson X. 

So, the possible decay products of X would be any fermion-antifermion pairs where the sum of their masses is less than or equal to the mass of X. Since X is 6 GeV, each fermion in the pair must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Because each fermion gets at least half the mass from the decay (since they are a pair), right?

Wait, no. Wait, the mass of the fermion would be m_f. So each fermion would have mass m_f, and for a pair, the total would be 2m_f. So the condition is 2m_f ≤ m_X. So m_f ≤ m_X / 2. So m_X is 6 GeV, so m_f has to be ≤ 3 GeV.

So, I should list all the known fermions (quarks and leptons) and their masses to see which ones are below 3 GeV.

Let me think about the masses. Let's list the fermions and their approximate masses:

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV

Quarks:
- Up (u): about 2.2 MeV (so 0.0022 GeV)
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.275 GeV (wait, is it around 1.3? Or maybe higher? Let me think. I remember charm is around 1.5 GeV, but maybe 1.275 is correct.)
- Bottom (b): about 4.7 GeV
- Top (t): way heavier, around 173 GeV

Wait, no, perhaps I should double-check the masses. The masses might be a bit different, but for the purposes of this problem, I think it's okay to go with approximate values.

So, let's list each fermion:

Electron: 0.0005 GeV → 2m_e ≈ 0.001 GeV. So definitely less than 3 GeV. So e+ e- is allowed.

Muon: ~0.105 GeV → 2m_μ ≈ 0.21 GeV → allowed.

Tau: ~1.777 GeV → 2m_τ ≈ 3.554 GeV. Wait, 3.554 is bigger than 6/2=3 GeV. So 2m_tau is about 3.55 GeV, which is larger than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into tau pairs because 3.55 > 3. So tau is out.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2m_tau is about 3.55, which is larger than 3 GeV. So 3.55>3, so X can't decay into tau pairs. So tau is not allowed.

Wait, but wait, the mass of tau is about 1.777 GeV, so 2 times that is about 3.554 GeV. So X has mass 6 GeV. 3.554 is less than 6, but wait, no, the condition is whether 2m_f ≤ m_X.

Wait, 2m_f should be ≤ m_X. So m_f ≤ m_X/2. So m_X is 6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Tau mass is 1.777 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So 1.777 <3 → yes, so 2m_tau = 3.554 GeV. Wait, that's more than 3 GeV. Wait, but m_f is 1.777, which is less than 3, so 2m_f is 3.554, which is greater than 3. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, the condition is 2m_f ≤ m_X → m_f ≤ m_X/2. Because 2m_f must be ≤ m_X, because the sum of the two fermion masses (each m_f) must be ≤ the mass of X.

So for X to decay into f f
