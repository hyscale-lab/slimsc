Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas, all C6H followed by some combination of H and O.

First, let me look at the given data.

FTIR spectrum: A very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, wait—carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹. If it's a broad peak around 3000, it could be an -OH group, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1700 is a region for carbonyl groups (C=O). Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. But wait, the 1650 is a bit lower than typical for a ketone, which is usually higher, around 1700. 1650 might be an aromatic ring or conjugated carbonyl groups. Oh, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or an ester. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with some substituents, like an aromatic carbonyl.

The NMR part says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond, probably in a vinyl group. So maybe the structure has an alkene and a carbonyl group.

Mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z 45. I'm trying to remember what fragments correspond to m/z 45. 45 is the molecular weight of CH3OCH2CH3? Or maybe it's something else. Wait, 45 could be the fragment for (CH3)2O, which is 45. Or maybe it's the CH2O group. Alternatively, the fragment could be from a smaller molecule. For example, acetone is (propan-2-one), which has a molecular weight of 58.
