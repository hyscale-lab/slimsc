Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I'm supposed to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using some formula from crystallography. Let me think.

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral, which I think is a type of hexagonal crystal system, but maybe it's one of the cubic variants. Oh wait, no, rhombohedral is a subclass of cubic where all the edges are equal and the angles are all the same, but not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh, wait, but in a rhombohedral unit cell, all edges a, b, c are equal. So a = b = c. Got it.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, wait a second. The interatomic distance in a crystal often refers to the distance between neighboring atoms along the lattice parameter. So in a cubic system, if a is the lattice parameter, then the interatomic distance is a, assuming it's a simple cubic structure. But rhombohedral is more complicated because of the angles.

But wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps in this case, each a, b, c is 10 Angstrom. Or maybe the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest atoms, which, in a rhombohedral structure, could be determined by the lattice vectors.

So I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111)
