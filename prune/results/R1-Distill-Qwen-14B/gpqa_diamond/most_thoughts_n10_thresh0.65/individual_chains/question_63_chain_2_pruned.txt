Okay, so I've got this problem here about a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The question is about what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. Hmm, I remember that in such models, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational components.

Wait, the molecule is currently in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So that's the state with the lowest vibrational and rotational energy. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact specifics here. Let me think.

I think for the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. The total energy is usually the sum of the vibrational and rotational contributions. The fundamental state would be the first vibrational level (v=0) and the ground rotational state (which for a diatomic is usually the lowest rotational state, like J=0 or maybe J=1? Wait, no, for a rigid rotor, the ground state is J=0. But wait, this is the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is also called the rotational-vibrational coupling model, maybe like the Morse potential for vibrations.

Wait, no, the non-rigid rotor model is more about the rotation part being treated as a non-rigid rotor, perhaps with bond length not fixed. But the fundamental state is the state of lowest energy, which is v=0, J=0 for the rotational part. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next possible state with the lowest energy. So what's the next state? Probably the next allowed state, which I think would be the first excited vibrational state (v=1) and J maybe being the next rotational state, but wait, in the vibration-rotation model, when you absorb a photon, you can go from v=0, J to v=1, J+1, or something like that? Because the selection rules for vibrational transitions usually allow Δv=±1 and ΔJ=±1, I think. Or maybe for the vibrational transition, the rotational part can change by ±1.

Wait, the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, and wants to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the next higher energy state. Let's think about the energy levels. The energy is quantized in both vibration and rotation. The vibrational energy is quantized as (v
