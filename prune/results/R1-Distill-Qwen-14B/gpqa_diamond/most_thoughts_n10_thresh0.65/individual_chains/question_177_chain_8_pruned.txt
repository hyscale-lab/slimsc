Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see what it's asking.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Then, the radial velocities are given: Star_1 is at 0 km/s and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. We're told to assume the stars radiate as blackbodies and compute the luminosity factor of Star_1 compared to Star_2.

Hmm, okay. So starting with what I know. Blackbody radiation... the peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law, right? Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength λ_max is proportional to 1/(T), where T is the temperature. The formula is λ_max * T = b, where b is Wien's constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures must be the same as well. Because if λ_max is the same, then T is the same. Wait, unless there's something about the velocities affecting the observed wavelength. Oh, because Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So the observed wavelength might be different due to Doppler shift, but the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So maybe the rest wavelengths are the same, implying their temperatures are same. Or perhaps the observed wavelengths are same, so their temperatures might be same if they have same velocities? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think. If the stars are moving towards or away from us, their emitted wavelengths would be shifted. But the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest (the λ_max) are the same. So, for each star, the observed λ_max would be the same. So, the rest λ_max (λ0) for each star must be the same, because the Doppler shift would adjust their emitted wavelengths. Or perhaps the Doppler shift is considered in their observed brightness. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe the peak emission is due to the star's temperature. So, if Star_1 and Star_2 have the same λ_max, then their temperatures are the same because Wien's law says λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2. That makes sense.

Wait, but wait: the Doppler effect comes into play here. Because the radial velocity affects the observed wavelength. But the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, does that mean the observed λ_max is the same? So, the emitted λ_max would be different if their temperatures are different, but if the observed λ_max is same, then their rest λ_max (emitted) must be adjusted by their velocities.

Wait, this is tricky. Let me break it down. The star's own temperature determines its emitted peak wavelength. But due to Doppler shift, the observed wavelength is different. So, the observed λ_max is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity in terms of the speed of light, but here the velocities are given in km/s, which might be non-relativistic.

Wait, but the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So, does that mean that their observed λ_max is the same? So, for each star, λ_obs is same. So, their emitted λ_emit would be different. Because λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ). Wait, but for Star_1, radial velocity is 0, so λ_obs1 = λ_emit1. For Star_2, v_r is 700 km/s, so λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + 700/c) / (1 - 700/c) ) ), and since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we can relate λ_emit1 and λ_emit2.

But wait, if the observed λ_max is the same for both
