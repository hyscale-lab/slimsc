Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is, right? The higher the β, the more stable the complex. 

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. Let me think, the complexes formed here would be Co(SCN)_n^(2-n) where n is 0 to 4, maybe? Or wait, the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Oh wait, βn usually refers to the formation of the n-th complex. So β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 is for Co(SCN)2, and so on up to β4 for Co(SCN)4.

Wait, no, wait. Stability constants are generally for each successive ion pair. Like, the formation of the first complex, then the second, etc. So β1 is the formation constant for Co(SCN)_1, but wait, maybe the overall β for each step. So, the overall formation of Co(SCN)_n^m+ would be the product of the stepwise βs up to n.

Wait, let me clarify. For a metal ion M and ligand L, the stability constants are given for each step. So, for M(L)_1, β1 = [ML]/[M][L]. For M(L)_2, β2 is [ML2]/[ML][L], and
