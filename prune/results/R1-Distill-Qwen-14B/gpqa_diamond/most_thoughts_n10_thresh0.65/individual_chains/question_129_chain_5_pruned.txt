Okay, so I need to figure out what compound E is based on this reaction scheme. Let me start by breaking down each step and the information given.

First, let's look at the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B. HCN is a nucleophile, so I'm thinking maybe A is a ketone or aldehyde because those would react with HCN. When ketones react with HCN, they form cyanohydrins. So, compound B would be a cyanohydrin of A.

2. Then, compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C. Pd usually is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So, the reduction of a cyanohydrin (which has a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group) would probably reduce the nitrile to an amine. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the cyanohydrin has a structure like R-C(OH)-CN. When you hydrogenate that, the nitrile (CN) group would become CH2NH2? Or wait, no. When you hydrogenate a nitrile, it typically becomes an amine. But wait, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd? Or maybe it's a different catalyst. Oh, wait, Pd is often used for hydrogenation of triple bonds to single bonds, like for alkynes to alkanes. But nitriles (which are C≡N) can be hydrogenated to amines. But alternatively, maybe if the conditions are different, perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine. But wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the cyanohydrin has a double bond somewhere else.

Wait, actually, the cyanohydrin is R2C(OH)CN, but that's when the starting material is a ketone. For example, a ketone R2CO reacting with HCN gives R2C(OH)CN. Now, when you hydrogenate that, what happens? The CN is C≡N; adding H2 would reduce the triple bond. So, the nitrile group (CN) would become CH2NH2? Or maybe it becomes CH2NH2 if it's a primary amine. Wait, no. Wait, nitriles (RCN) upon hydrogenation (with H2 and a catalyst like Ni or Pd) typically become primary amines (RCH2NH
