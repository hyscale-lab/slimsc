Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's the same and under the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When measuring the position, none were found at x <1 or x>3, meaning all are between 1 and 3. We need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, right. So the wave function is a complex function, but the imaginary part is just a constant (-0.5i). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. Oh wait, but wait, the wave function ψ(x) is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

But wait, for the probability density, it's |ψ|² = ψ*ψ*, which is (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2. Because if ψ = A + iB, then |ψ|² = A² + B². So here, A is a/sqrt(1+x), B is -0.5, so |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition, right? The integral of |ψ|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because the probability of finding the particle somewhere in the allowed region must be 100% (since none were found outside, so all are between 1 and 3).

So, let's write that integral: ∫ from 1 to 3 [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

I can split this integral into two parts: ∫ (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 plus ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to3.

Let me compute each part.

First part: a² ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So first part is a² * ln(2).

Second part: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to3. The integral is (3-1)*0.25 = 2 * 0.25 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So solving for a²:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is the square root of that. Let me calculate the square root of 0.7213.

Hmm, sqrt(0.7225) is 0.85, because 0.85² is 0.7225. So 0.7213 is a bit less than that. Let me compute sqrt(0.7213).

Well, 0.85^2 = 0.7225, so 0.7213 is a little less. Let me see:

0.849^2 = ?

0.84^2 is 0.7056.

0.85^2 = 0.7225.

Wait, 0.85^2 = 0.7225, which is about 0.7225. So 0.7213 is just a bit less, so the square root would be just a bit less than 0.85.

Wait, but the options are A)1.1, B)0.85, C)0.35, D)0.6.

So 0.85 is option B. But wait, wait, our calculation gives a^2 =0.7213, so a is approximately 0.849, which is very close to 0.85, so the answer is option B.

Wait, but wait a minute, I think I made a mistake here. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when calculating |ψ|^2, it's (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2. So yes, that part is correct.

Wait, but another thought: the wave function must be normalized. So the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. So yes, that's what I set up.

So the calculations proceed as:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 =1 → a²= 0.5/ln(2) ≈ 0.7213 → a≈0.849, which is about 0.85, option B.

So I think the answer is B) 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is proportional to \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), which is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The wave function must be normalized, meaning the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the region \( x \in [1, 3] \) must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx \)
2. \( 0.25 \int_1^3 dx \)

### First Part:
The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from 1 to 3:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

### Second Part:
The integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( [1, 3] \) is:

\[
0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

### Combining Both Parts:
The total normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is very close to 0.85. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6**

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: B
