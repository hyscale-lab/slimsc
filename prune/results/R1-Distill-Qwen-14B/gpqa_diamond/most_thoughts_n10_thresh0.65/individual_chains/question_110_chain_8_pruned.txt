Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars are observable by both. Let me go through each star and see their conditions.

First, I'll recap what I know. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitude brighter than 17. So, V <17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so V <16. Wait, wait. Oh no, wait: the question says stars brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO, so V_mag <17. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16, so V_mag <16. So a star must have V_mag less than 16 to be detected by HIRES, and less than 17 for ESPRESSO. So for a star to be detected by both, its V magnitude must be less than 16, because that's the stricter condition.

Wait, no, wait. Let me read again: "brighter than 17 mag" can be observed with ESPRESSO. So, brighter means lower magnitude. So, if the V magnitude is 17 or lower, it's too faint? Or wait, no: stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So if a star's apparent V is 16, it's brighter than 17, so detectable. So for a star to be detected by ESPRESSO, V_apparent <17. For HIRES, V_apparent <16. So a star must have V <16 to be detected by both.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The question says: "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So, stars with V < 17 are brighter than 17, so they can be observed. Similarly, for HIRES, stars with V <16 can be observed. So, to be detected by both, the star must have V <16. Because if it's between 16 and 17, it's detectable by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES. So the star must be brighter than 16 mag in V.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased might be confusing. Let me check the exact wording: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent
