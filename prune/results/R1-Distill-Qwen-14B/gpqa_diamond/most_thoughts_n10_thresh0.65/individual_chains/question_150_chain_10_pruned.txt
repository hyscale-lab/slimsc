Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. The molecular formula gives me some clues about the structure. Let me break it down. C8H9NO... So, 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen.

The NMR data is given. Let me look at that. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). I remember that NMR signals can tell me about the structure by looking at the integration, multiplicity, and chemical shifts.

So, starting with the peak at 9.72 ppm. That's a triplet (t) integrating for 1H. High ppm like that makes me think of an aldehyde proton because aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet or sometimes a triplet if coupled with neighboring protons. Wait, but why a triplet here? Maybe it's coupled to two equivalent protons. Hmm, not sure yet.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each integrating for 2H. Those look like aromatic protons, probably from a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in a para substitution, you get two doublets each integrating for two H, as the protons are split into two sets. So maybe two benzene rings attached? Or perhaps one benzene ring with substituents.

The peak at 6.27 is a broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad singlet could mean either an aromatic ring with some substituents that cause the protons to be a bit split, but more likely, it's something else. Maybe an enol proton or a conjugated diene? Or maybe some vinyl protons. Alternatively, it could be an -OH group, but that's usually a broad peak, but as a singlet for two H? Wait, no, -OH is usually a broad peak, but they might not show up if they're exchanging and not split. Hmm, not sure.

The last peak is at 3.66 ppm as a doublet, 2H. That's probably a methylene group adjacent to something electronegative like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group. So, like maybe an ether or an ester, or perhaps an aldehyde attached to something.

Wait, putting this together. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, X is 0, so it's (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. That's (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees: could be a ring and some double bonds, maybe.

Looking at the NMR again, the 9.72 peak suggests an aldehyde group. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde and an aromatic ring. Let me think about the structure.

So, the aldehyde is at the end, perhaps. The peak at 3.66 ppm as a doublet for 2Hâ€”maybe a CH2 group next to the aldehyde. Wait, but the aldehyde is at the end. Hmm, perhaps it's a CH2 group attached to something else, like an oxygen.

Wait, the 3.66 is a d for 2H. That suggests it's connected to another CH2. Like maybe a -OCH2CH2- group? Or perhaps it's adjacent to an oxygen like an ether.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows aromatic protons. The 6.98 and 6.51 are each d for 2H. That's typical for a para-substituted benzene. So, perhaps there are two aromatic rings, each with substituents. Or maybe one benzene ring with two substituents.

The 6.27 (bs, 2H) might be a vinyl group, maybe a conjugated diene or a substituted alkene. Alternatively, it could be a para-substituted benzene with an adjacent substituent that's causing the split, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the reagents. The compound is reacted with NaNO2 and HCl. Then H2O, then aqueous KOH and heat.

NaNO2 and HCl are typically used for diazotization, especially of aromatic amines. So, the first step is probably forming a diazonium salt. But wait, the molecular formula has one N. So maybe the starting compound has an aromatic amine group, which is then converted to a diazonium salt.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any obvious amine protons. Oh, unless the amine is part of an aromatic ring, like an aniline derivative. So, maybe the compound has an aniline group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see, aniline is C6H5NH2. So our compound has more carbons. Maybe a side chain attached to the aniline.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents.

Wait, let's try to figure out the structure. Let me think of possible structures.

The NMR has an aldehyde proton. So maybe the structure has an aldehyde group attached to something else. Also, two aromatic rings. Or perhaps one aromatic ring with substituents.

Wait, let's piece together the NMR. The 9.72 ppm (t, 1H) is the aldehyde. Then, the 3.66 (d, 2H) could be a CH2 group
