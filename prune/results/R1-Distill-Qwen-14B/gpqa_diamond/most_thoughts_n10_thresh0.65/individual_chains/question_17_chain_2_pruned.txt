Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what it says. The question is asking about a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. 

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium. So the complex here is Ca-EDTA, probably in a 1:1 ratio. The problem says it's stoichiometric, so that makes sense. 

The key here is probably the formation constant, K. I think the formation constant (Kf) is given, which tells us how much the complex forms. The formula I remember is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). 

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I think the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Now, when it dissociates, it should release Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- ions. But because K is so large (5e10), the complex doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca^2+ should be really low.

Let me set up an ICE table. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ that dissociates. So, the initial concentrations would be: [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M, [Ca^2+] = 0, [EDTA] = 0. 

Change: CaEDTA dissociates, so [CaEDTA] decreases by x, [Ca^2+] increases by x, and [EDTA] increases by x. So at equilibrium, [CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x, [Ca^2+] = x, [EDTA] = x.

But wait, K is 5e10, which is a huge number, so x should be really small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So the equation becomes K ≈ (0.02) / (x^2) = 5e10.

Wait, wait—no, the K expression is [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]). Because Kf is [complex]/([M][L]). So
