Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, right? The molecule is in its fundamental state, and it absorbs a photon to move to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, the molecule is diatomic, so it's made of two atoms, X and Y. The masses are given: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms. The angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

So, the molecule can rotate and vibrate. The model they're using is the rotation-vibration model, which I think is a combination of the rigid rotor model for rotation and the quantum harmonic oscillator for vibration. But wait, the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model. Oh, right, maybe that's a different thing. Or perhaps the model here includes both rotation and vibration, so it's a coupled problem.

The fundamental state is the lowest energy state for the system. When it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next lowest state. I'm trying to remember what the possible transitions are in such a model. For a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration. The total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies.

In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is related to the moment of inertia I. I is the moment of inertia, which for a diatomic is I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The fundamental state is v=0. So the lowest energy state is when both rotation and vibration are in their lowest states.

Now, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0), I think. So when it absorbs a photon, it can transition to the next higher state. But what's the next higher? It could be a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). Or maybe a combination.

Wait, but in the quantum rotation
