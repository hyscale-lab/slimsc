Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see, the question is about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal's (111) plane. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. Hmm, right.

Wait, I remember that in crystals, the interplanar distance d is calculated using the formula d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² + 2lm cos α + 2ln cos β + 2mn cos γ), where a is the lattice parameter, and l, m, n are the Miller indices of the plane. Or is that the formula? Or maybe I'm mixing it up with something else.

Wait, no, I think the formula is actually d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α)) )... Oh wait, different notation, sometimes h, k, l are used as the Miller indices. But here the problem uses (111), so h=k=l=1.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal with lattice parameter a and angles α, β, γ is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos γ + 2 hl cos β + 2 kl cos α )

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused. Because
