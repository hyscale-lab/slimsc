Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what it says. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given a certain relation involving parallax.

Hmm, the problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the formula would be N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Wait, so if plx is 1/d, then d is 1/plx. So, substituting that into the equation for N, let's see. N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which is the same as (plx)^-5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in would give N ∝ (1/d)^-5. Which simplifies to N ∝ d^5. Because (1/d)^-5 equals d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, right, so it's the number density or the number per unit distance. Let me think. If N is proportional to d^5, then how does this change as d increases by a small amount?

Wait, maybe I should relate it to the differential. So, if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell between d and
