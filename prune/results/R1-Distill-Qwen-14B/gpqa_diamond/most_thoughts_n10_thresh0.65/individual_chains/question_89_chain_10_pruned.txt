Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to piece it all together.

The first part says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR spectrum of product 1 shows some specific peaks: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which I remember is indicative of a carbonyl group, probably an ester or ketone.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane heating with KOH. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking about elimination reactions. When vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halides) react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal; the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. So it's a dihalide but not adjacent. Hmm, maybe it's a dihalide that can form a conjugated diene upon elimination? Or perhaps it's more about ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on positions 1 and 3. When KOH is added, which is a strong base, perhaps dehydrohalogenation occurs, but since the bromines are not adjacent, maybe it's a double elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's more about forming an epoxide? No, wait, that's when you have two adjacent halides, like vicinal dihalide, which then forms an epoxide with a base. But 1,3 isn't adjacent.

Wait, another possibility: when two bromides are not adjacent, could it undergo a double elimination to form a ring? Because the starting material is a highly strained structure (adamantane is actually quite rigid, but with the dihalide, maybe).

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double E2 elimination. So each Br leaves, and two H's are abstracted, leading to the formation of two double bonds. But wait, that would give a diene. Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination to form a carbene or something, but that doesn't make much sense.

But considering the NMR and IR data, let's think about product 1. The IR has 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is an ester or a ketone.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the KOH is causing an elimination to form an alkene, and then oxidation. Hmm, but KOH isn't typically an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe the base induces elimination, forming a diene, and then some kind of reaction occurs. Wait, but the IR suggests a carbonyl group, so maybe it's a ketone or ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But with two bromines, that might not be the case. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo elimination to form an allene (conjug
