Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass, each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detects them. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull, making the star wobble.

The question gives me the shift in spectral lines for each star. Planet #1's star has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's star has a shift of 7 milliangstroms. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the key here is the relationship between the Doppler shift and the orbital period. So, the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula I remember is something like velocity (v) equals 2π times the semi-major axis (a) divided by the orbital period (P). Oh wait, but since the orbits are circular, the semi-major axis is just the radius.

But wait, more accurately, the star's velocity due to the planet is given by v = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 year) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) )... Hmm, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, considering that M_p is much smaller than M_star, perhaps we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so the formula simplifies.

Wait, another approach: the RV method's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3))) ) ... Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps think in terms of Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law says that P² is proportional to (a³)/(M_star), where M_star is the mass of the star. But how does that tie into the Doppler shift?

The Doppler shift relates to the star's velocity. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) )) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, the term (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) is approximately 1. So, K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about that. Alternatively, another formula I've come across is K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3
