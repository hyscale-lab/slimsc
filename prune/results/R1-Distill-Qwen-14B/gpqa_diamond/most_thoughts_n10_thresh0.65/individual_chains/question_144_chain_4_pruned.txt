Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is something like the mean decay length L = gamma * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but wait. First, let's get all the given data straight. E_X is the production energy, which is the total energy of the meson when it's produced, right? The mass m_X is given as 1.2 GeV, so that's the rest mass. The width Γ is 320 MeV, which I think is the total decay width. 

I remember that the mean lifetime tau is related to the width by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. Here, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy ΔE. So, tau is approximately ħ / (Γ). But wait, actually, I think the relation is tau = ħ / (Γ), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact factor. Oh right, because Γ is the total decay width, so the uncertainty in energy is Γ, and the uncertainty in time is the mean lifetime. So, Γ * tau ≈ ħ. So tau ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I should check the units. Let me think: ħ has units of GeV·s. Gamma is in GeV (320 MeV is 0.32 GeV). So, ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, tau would be ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = approx 2.056e-24 seconds. Wait, but wait, I think the formula is tau = ħ * (something) / Γ. Because sometimes they include factors like 2 or pi, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, I think the proper formula is tau = ħ / Γ, because Γ is the decay rate, which is the inverse of lifetime in natural units. Oh wait, wait. In particle physics, the mean lifetime tau is given by tau = ħ / Γ, because Γ has units of energy, and tau is time. So yes, using ħ in GeV·s and Γ in GeV, tau comes out in seconds.

Once I have tau, I need to find the velocity of the meson. The energy E is the total energy, so E = gamma * m c^2. Wait, but since we're working in natural units (where c=1 and ħ=1, etc.), perhaps it's easier to calculate gamma as E / m.

E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV.
