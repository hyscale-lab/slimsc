Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound E is. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the problem states that compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to give C. Next, C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and then D loses an inert gas to become E. The options are four different ketones, which suggests that E is a cyclic ketone. Also, there are two hints given.

First, let's consider the reaction steps:

1. Compound A + HCN → Compound B.
   - HCN is a nucleophile. So, A must have a carbonyl group because that's where nucleophilic addition typically happens. So A is probably a ketone or aldehyde. But wait, from the IR data in hint b, A's IR has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, so A is a ketone. So A is a cyclic ketone, maybe?

2. Compound B → Compound C via hydrogenation with H2 and Pd.
   - Hydrogenation usually reduces double bonds. But if B is a cyanohydrin (from the addition of HCN to a ketone), then B would have a CH2CN group attached. Wait, but H2 and Pd typically catalyze the reduction of nitriles to amines, but maybe I'm mixing that up. Wait, no, Pd is more about catalytic hydrogenation. Alternatively, maybe B has an alpha, beta-unsaturated nitrile or something that can be hydrogenated. Hmm, perhaps I should think about what comes after.

3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 → Compound D.
   - HNO2 is nitrous acid, which is commonly used in the oxidation of alcohols. Wait, but it's also used in the formation of diazonium salts from amines. Alternatively, if C has a primary amine, HNO2 would lead to a diazonium salt which then breaks down. But wait, another possibility is that C is a secondary alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step in order.

First, A is a cyclic ketone. When it
