Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Right, because those carbonyls are good at attracting nucleophiles.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each with different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the products for each and match them with the options provided.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate under NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). NaOEt is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates something to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOEt)2. When it forms an enolate, the negative charge is on the central carbon. The (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, with a p-tolyl group on carbon 3. The structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt.

In a Michael addition, the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl in the acrylate. Wait, no, the acrylate is the Michael acceptor here, right? So the enolate from the malonate (the nucleophile) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. The acrylate is the enolether, so when the enolate from malonate attacks, it'll add to the beta carbon of the acrylate. Let me draw this out mentally.

The acrylate is CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOEt. Wait, no, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-p-tolyl connected to COOEt. Wait, no, wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OEt but with a p-tolyl group on the CH2? No, wait: 3-(p
