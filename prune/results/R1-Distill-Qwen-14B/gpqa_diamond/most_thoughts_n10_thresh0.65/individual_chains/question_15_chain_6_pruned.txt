Okay, so I have this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited time and want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. Both planets were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's. Both stars have the same radius, which is interesting. The question is, which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should choose to observe that one.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Wait, but in this case, since both planets are Earth-like, but their host stars have different properties. Also, the orbital period affects the size of the orbit, which might influence the chance of transiting.

Wait, the transit probability formula—right, the probability P is roughly proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by the (semi-major axis a) times (something else?), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

I think the probability of a transit is given by the formula: P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a (1 - e²)^(1/2))). But wait, e is the eccentricity, and since both orbits are circular, e=0, so that term simplifies to 1. So P = (R_p / R_s)^2 / a. Or is that correct? Or maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Another thought: the transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital size and the star's size. The more edge-on the orbit, the higher the chance. But the actual probability is higher when the star's size is larger relative to the planet's orbit.

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for the transit probability. I think the probability is approximately (R_p / R_*)² / (a (1 - (R_* / a))²), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach: the probability
