Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, the question is about the mean decay distance of a meson X. Oh right, particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay distance is how far they travel before they break apart.

The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in terms of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, so the answer is going to involve some calculations with these values.

I think the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Right, because if a particle lives longer or moves faster, it can travel further before decaying. The formula I remember is something like distance L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I find tau? Oh, right! The width Γ is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle says that Γ ≈ ħ / tau. So tau ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, units can be tricky here. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units of GeV·s or something similar. So I need to make sure the units match.

Let me write down the steps:

1. Calculate the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is E/(m c²), but since we're working in units where c=1 (like in particle physics), gamma would just be E/m. So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. Gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

2. Find the velocity beta. For a relativistic particle, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Let me compute that. Gamma is about 6.6667, so gamma squared is around (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444. So 1/gamma² is about 0.0225. Then 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is approximately sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887.

3. Calculate the lifetime tau. Tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is in MeV. I think ħc is a useful constant here. Wait, ħ in GeV·s is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, and ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s. 

But wait, the width Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let's calculate that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So tau ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. I think I made a mistake here. Because the relation is Γ = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, the units here: Γ is in GeV, ħ is in GeV·s, so when you divide, GeV cancels, leaving seconds. So that's correct.

So tau = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.
