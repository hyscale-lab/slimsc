Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at the Paranal Observatory and HIRES at the Keck Observatory. The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various properties, and I need to determine which of them are observable by both instruments.

First, I'll read through the problem statement again to make sure I understand the constraints. The key points are:

- ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 17.
- HIRES can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag. So, apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16.

Wait, wait, no. Wait. The question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, if a star's apparent magnitude is less than or equal to 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, for HIRES, apparent V mag ≤16.

So, the star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES) to be detected by both. Wait no, because the question is asking which stars can be detected with both. So the star must be observable by both. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 to be seen by ESPRESSO, and ≤16 to be seen by HIRES. So combined, the star's apparent V must be ≤16. Because if it's brighter than 16, ESPRESSO can see it (since 16 is less than 17), but HIRES can't unless it's ≤16. So the maximum apparent magnitude that the star can have is 16.

But wait, the question is which stars can be detected with both. So the star must be observable by both. So the apparent V mag must be ≤16 for HIRES and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. So the stricter condition is apparent V ≤16, because if it's 17, HIRES can't see it. So the star's apparent V must be ≤16.

Wait, but let me think again. Because HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, meaning apparent V magnitude ≤16. ESPRESSO can observe up to 17
