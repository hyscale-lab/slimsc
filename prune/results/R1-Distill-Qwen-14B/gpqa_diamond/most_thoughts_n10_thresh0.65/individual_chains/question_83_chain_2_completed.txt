Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read it again. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D. 

Hmm. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so when it reacts with NaOH, a strong base, it will form acetate ions. The reaction should be something like CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. 

First, I think I need to find the initial concentrations after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ and concentration 0.05 M. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration of acetic acid is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Wait, yes, because concentration = moles / volume. Moles of acetic acid initially are 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, volume is 0.04 L, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Got that right.

Now, when we start titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the volume needed. Moles of acetic acid: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH needed: same as acetic acid, 0.001 mol. Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH added.

The question asks for pH at 25% titration. 25% of what? I think 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at that point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, no. Wait, the titration is in terms of how much of the analyte is reacted. So when they say 25% titration, it means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of NaOH added would be 25% of 0.001 mol, which is 0.00025 mol. So volume of NaOH would be 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³. So that's correct.

So at 25% titration, we have a solution that's a buffer of acetic acid and its conjugate base acetate. Because some of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate. To find the pH, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). 

What are the concentrations of [A-] and [HA] at 25% titration?

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. Adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH will neutralize 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate.

So moles of HA (CH3COOH) remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.
Moles of A- (CH3COO^-): 0.00025 mol.

The total volume of the solution at this point? The original solution was 40 cm³, and we added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total is 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = let's compute that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = (7.5e-4)/(4.25e-2) = approximately 0.017647 M.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

So pH = pKa + log(0.3333). 

pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. Let's compute pKa: log(1.85e-5) is about 4.736 (since log(1.85)=0.267, so 5 - 0.267=4.733). So pKa is around 4.733.

Log(1/3) is log(0.333) ≈ -0.477. So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Let's say approximately 4.26. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26, but the equivalence point is 8.52, which seems high. Wait, but I thought the equivalence point for acetic acid would be higher than 7, but maybe not 8.52. Hmm.

Wait, alternative approach for equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water, which will hydrolyze to produce a basic solution.

So moles of acetate: 0.001 mol. Volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced. So:

5.405e-10 ≈ (x^2) / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈0.02.

So x^2 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11.

x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) → approximately 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is 3.29e-6, pOH is -log(3.29e-6). Let's calculate that. Log(3.29) is about 0.517, so log(3.29e-6) is 5.517 → pOH is about 5.517. So pH = 14 - 5.517 = 8.483. Rounding to two decimal places, about 8.48. The option A says 8.52, which is close. So for equivalence point, option A gives 8.52.

But wait, wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, Kb is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

Set up the equation: Kb = x² / (0.02) → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → 1.081e-11.

Square root is approx 3.29e-6. So [OH-] =3.29e-6 → pOH is around 5.48 → pH =14-5.48=8.52. Oh, exactly the option A's second value, 8.52.

So at equivalence point, pH is about 8.52, and at 25% titration, pH is approx 4.26. So option A is 4.26;8.52.

But let me check the other options. So the options are A, B, C, D. Let me see if any other option matches.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation for the equivalence point. Alternatively, sometimes acetate's hydrolysis uses the formula pH = ½ (pKa + pKw). Because when [HA] = [A-], but no, that's for the half-equivalence point. Wait, no, at equivalence point, all HA is converted to A-. So the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of A-.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base. The pH can be calculated as:

pH = pKa + (½) pK_a + something? Wait, no, perhaps another approach.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the concentration of acetate and then use the Kb.

Wait, but I think my earlier calculation is correct. So equivalence point pH is around 8.52.

So for the first part, the 25% titration, pH is around 4.26, and equivalence point pH is 8.52, so option A.

But wait, looking at the given options, option D is 4.57;6.92. So why isn't that the correct one?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the buffer calculation. Let me go back.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted. So, moles of acetic acid initially were 0.001 mol. 25% of that is 0.00025 mol reacted. So moles of HA left: 0.00075 mol. Moles of A-: 0.00025 mol.

The concentration ratio is [A-]/[HA] = 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3, which is 0.333.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log(0.333) → 4.733 - 0.477 ≈4.256 → approx 4.26. So that matches option A's first value.

So the two values are 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: After adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 40 + 2.5=42.5 cm³. Moles of HA: 0.00075, A-: 0.00025. Then, [HA]=0.00075 / 0.0425 L = 0.017647 M, [A-]=0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M. Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.333. So same as before.

So the pH is 4.26. So option A's first part matches.

But why is option D an option? Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps the initial dilution is different. Let me recheck.

Initial volume of acetic acid:20 cm³, 0.05 M. Moles: 0.02 L *0.05 =0.001 mol. Diluted with 20 cm³ water, so total 40 cm³. So new concentration is 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.

At 25% titration, NaOH added:25% of 0.001 mol is 0.00025 mol. So yes, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH gives 0.25 mmol.

So the buffer is correct. So the pH is 4.26.

Wait, but what about the equivalence point? Maybe I made a mistake there.

Wait, the solution at equivalence point is 0.001 mol of acetate in 50 cm³. So 0.02 M.

The Kb is 5.405e-10. So the hydrolysis equation:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Let [OH^-] = x.

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² /0.02 =5.405e-10 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 =1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 3.29e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52, so option A is correct.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 4.57;6.92. That's a different set.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about the equivalence point. Because when you mix 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, you get 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. Then, when you titrate with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid:0.025 M *0.04 L= 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH needed:0.001 mol.

Volume of NaOH needed: 0.001 /0.1 =0.01 L=10 cm³.

So at equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added, making total volume 40+10=50 cm³.

So [acetate] is 0.001 /0.05 =0.02 M.

Wait, yes.

So the calculations at equivalence point are correct. So why does option A have 8.52, which seems high, but I think it's correct.

Hmm, but why is option D's equivalence point at 6.92? That would suggest that perhaps the calculation used the pH of a buffer at the midpoint or something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the pH at 25% of the way to the equivalence point, but maybe the question is phrased differently. Wait, the question says '25% titration'—I think that means 25% of the acid has been neutralized. So 25% of the way to the equivalence point.

But perhaps another way, sometimes 25% refers to the volume added, but in this case, the equivalence point is 10 cm³, so 25% of that would be 2.5 cm³, which is the same as what I calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial calculations were wrong. Let me see.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the initial solution after dilution isn't 0.025 M. Let me recalculate.

Original volume:20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles: 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Adding 20 cm³ water → 40 cm³. Concentration: 0.001 /0.04=0.025 M. Correct.

So the initial concentration is right.

At 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added are 0.25 *0.001=0.00025 mol. So that's correct.

So the pH at 25% is 4.26, equivalence point is 8.52. So option A is correct.

Looking at the options:

Option A:4.26;8.52.

Other options:

B:3.17;6.73 → doesn't match.

C:4.73;7.00 → 4.73 is the pKa, so that's the pH at the initial point if it's undiluted, perhaps? Or maybe half-equivalence point.

D:4.57;6.92 → where do these numbers come from?

Wait, perhaps the initial solution's pH is 4.73. Because when you have 0.025 M acetic acid, the pH would be around 4.73, which is the pKa. Because at 0.025 M, the pH would be close to pKa since it's a weak acid, but not necessarily exactly. Wait, but for a weak acid, pH is determined by sqrt(Ka * C). So for 0.025 M, Ka=1.85e-5.

So sqrt(1.85e-5 * 0.025) → sqrt(4.625e-7) ≈ 0.00068 → pH=3.17? Wait, wait, no. Wait, pH is -log[H+]. So [H+]=sqrt(Ka * C) → sqrt( (1.85e-5)(0.025) ) = sqrt(4.625e-7) → approx 6.8e-4. So pH is -log(6.8e-4)= about 3.17.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait:

Wait, [H+] = sqrt( (Ka * C) ), so for a weak acid, the approximation is valid when Ka << C. Here Ka is 1.85e-5, C is 0.025=2.5e-2. So Ka/C = 1.85e-5 / 2.5e-2= 7.4e-4. Since it's not negligible, maybe the exact solution is better.

The expression: Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA] → [H+] = sqrt( Ka * C ), assuming [H+] << C. But when C is not much larger than Ka, this may not hold. Alternatively, the exact formula:

Ka = [H+²]/(C - [H+]) → [H+]² = Ka (C - [H+]) → [H+]² + Ka [H+] - Ka C =0.

Solving quadratic: [H+] = [-Ka ± sqrt(Ka² +4 Ka C)] / 2.

Taking the positive root: [H+] = [ -Ka + sqrt(Ka² +4 Ka C) ]/(2).

Plugging in Ka=1.85e-5, C=0.025:

sqrt( (1.85e-5)^2 +4 *1.85e-5 *0.025 )= sqrt(3.4225e-10 + 1.85e-6 )= sqrt(1.85e-6 + ...) since 3.4e-10 is negligible. So sqrt(1.85e-6)≈ 1.36e-3.

So [H+] ≈ ( -1.85e-5 + 1.36e-3 ) /2 → approximately (1.3415e-3)/2 → 0.67e-3 → 6.7e-4. So pH = -log(6.7e-4) → around 3.17. So the initial solution's pH is 3.17, which is option B's first value.

But wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point. So the initial pH is 3.17, but after 25% titration, it's 4.26, and at equivalence, 8.52.

So option A is correct.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH) with 20.00 cm³ of water, followed by titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The goal is to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

### Step 1: Initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution
The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of CH₃COOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 2: Equivalence point calculation
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH to form acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻). The moles of NaOH required are equal to the moles of acetic acid:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume of NaOH required is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm³}.
\]

At the equivalence point, the solution contains 0.001 mol of CH₃COO⁻ in a total volume of 50.00 cm³ (40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³). The concentration of acetate is:

\[
\text{Concentration of CH₃COO⁻} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.05 \, \text{L}} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion undergoes hydrolysis in water:

\[
\text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻}.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \( K_b \), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} = 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation for weak bases, the concentration of OH⁻ is:

\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH₃COO⁻}]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02)} = 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log{(3.29 \times 10^{-6})} \approx 5.48,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Step 3: pH at 25% titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This neutralizes 0.00025 mol of CH₃COOH, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and forms:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COO⁻} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.50 \, \text{cm³} = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH₃COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log{\left(\frac{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]} \right)},
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log{(1.85 \times 10^{-5})} \approx 4.73 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log{\left(\frac{0.0059}{0.0176}\right)} = 4.73 + \log{(0.333)} \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
