Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember from my studies that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. In the classical case, it's F = -kx. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so I need to think about how relativity affects the equations of motion.

The question asks for the maximum speed of the mass. In the classical case, the maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. Oh right, for a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², so the maximum speed would be found by setting that equal to (1/2)mv², giving v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's the classical non-relativistic case. Here, the options include terms with c, the speed of light, so relativity must play a role.

Relativity comes into play when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I need to consider the relativistic corrections to the equations. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. At maximum displacement (amplitude A), all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So in the relativistic case, the maximum speed will be when the kinetic energy is at its maximum.

Wait, but how does this translate into equations? Let me think. The total energy E of the oscillator is given by E = (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, when the mass is moving, its relativistic mass increases. So the total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the potential energy is (1/2)kx² in the harmonic oscillator, but in relativity, the potential could be different? Or perhaps the system is treated such that the total energy is considered.

Another approach: For a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the equation of motion is different. The restoring force is still F = -kx, but the mass is relativistic, so the expression for momentum is p = gamma m v. So the equation of motion becomes d(p)/dt = -kx.

But I'm not sure how to solve that differential equation. Maybe another approach is to find the expression
