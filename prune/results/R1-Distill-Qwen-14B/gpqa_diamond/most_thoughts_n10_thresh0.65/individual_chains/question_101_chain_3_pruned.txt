Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to select the suitable reagent A and catalyst B from the given options.

Hmm. Okay, let's think about this. The reaction involves an acid catalyst, so I'm guessing it's some kind of acid-catalyzed addition or maybe a ring expansion or something like that.

3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic amine. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. The 3-methyl substitution means there's a methyl group on the third carbon. Now, when this reacts with compound A, the product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached. Wait, cyclohexylidenemethylâ€” that sounds like a cyclohexane ring with a double bond (since 'idene' indicates a double bond) connected to a methyl group. So the product has a ring structure attached via a CH2 group, perhaps?

Wait, 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl) would mean the cyclohexylidene (which is cyclohexene) is connected via a methyl group. Or maybe it's like a cyclohexene's substituent connected to another carbon, which is attached to the pyrrolidine.

So what reaction would add a cyclohexene group to the pyrrolidine ring?

Oh wait! Maybe this is a ring-enlargement reaction. Like, perhaps a Beckmann rearrangement or something else? Or perhaps a Claisen or aldol condensation?

Wait, another approach. The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine. So the pyrrolidine ring must have undergone some kind of addition or ring expansion.

Alternatively, could this be a Diels-Alder reaction? But that usually involves dienes and dienophiles. Hmm, but Diels-Alder reactions are typically under different conditions, maybe not acid-catalyzed.

Wait, what about the formation of a cyclic ketone or aldehyde? Because acid catalysis often involves the formation of carbocation intermediates or the activation of carbonyl groups.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a secondary amine. Maybe it's undergoing some kind of alkylation
