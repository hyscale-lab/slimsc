Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm trying to find the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P is broken into its components Px, Py, and Pz, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is probably the angular momentum operator, right? Because in quantum mechanics, the components of angular momentum (like Lx, Ly, Lz) are similar. And for spin-½ particles like muons, the spin operators are proportional to the Pauli matrices.

So, the operator P is probably the spin operator, and the eigenvectors are spin-up or spin-down states along the direction n. Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, we're looking for the spin-up state along n.

The direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. That means the direction can be represented as having angles θ and φ, but since it's in the x-z plane, the φ is zero or something? Wait, no, the x-z plane means that the direction vector has components (x, 0, z), so the angle from the z-axis is θ, and the azimuthal angle φ is zero or 180 degrees? Wait, no, wait. Usually, the spherical coordinates have φ as the angle in the xy-plane from the x-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, the projection onto the xy-plane is along the x-axis. So φ would be 0 or π, depending on the direction.

But for this problem, maybe φ isn't needed because the eigenvector's expression might not depend on it, or perhaps n is given in a way that the eigenvector can be written in terms of θ and φ.

Wait, the problem says that the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n has components like (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, no, wait. Let me think about spherical coordinates. The direction vector can be written as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So that means sinθ sinφ must be zero. So either sinθ is zero (which would make it along z) or sinφ is zero, which implies
