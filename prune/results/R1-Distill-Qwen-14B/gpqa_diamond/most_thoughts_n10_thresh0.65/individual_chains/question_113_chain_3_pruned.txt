Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let's see, the options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. Hmm, let's break down the information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption at 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So that suggests the compound has an -OH group, like an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, there's also strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 is a bit lower, maybe an conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring or something else.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound likely has a double bond. That makes me think of something like an ester or a ketone with a double bond nearby, or perhaps an aromatic ring since they have conjugated double bonds. But wait, the IR had a broad peak at 3000, so maybe it's an alcohol. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad and strong, but the 1700 might then be the carboxylic acid carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, where the carbonyl is around 1700. An ester would have an O-H only if it's a hemiacetal or something, but I don't think so. Wait, but the broad peak could also be an alcohol's O-H. But wait, if it's a ketone or ester, the O-H would be from an alcohol or maybe another group.

Wait, another possibility for the 1650 peak: maybe it's an aromatic ring. For example, in benzene rings, the C=C stretching is around 1600 cm^-1. But 1650 is a bit higher, which might suggest conjugation or maybe a carbonyl adjacent to the ring.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m
