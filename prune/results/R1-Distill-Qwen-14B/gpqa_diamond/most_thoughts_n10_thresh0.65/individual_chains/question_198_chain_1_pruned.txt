Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution, and we need to find the percentage of a specific complex among all cobalt-containing species. Hmm.

Alright, let me read the question again. The solution has Co(II) ions and SCN- ions. The concentrations are given: total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta values) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that seems a bit odd because the beta values usually increase with the number of ligands, but here β4 is lower than β3. Maybe that's a typo or maybe it's correct. I'll proceed with what's given.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, right? So that would be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is the second complex in the series. So the species we're interested in is the one with two SCN- ions attached. The stability constant β2 is 40.

Wait, but wait a second. Stability constants can sometimes be a bit tricky. The stability constant, β, for a complex like Co(SCN)_n^(2−n) is defined as [Co(SCN
