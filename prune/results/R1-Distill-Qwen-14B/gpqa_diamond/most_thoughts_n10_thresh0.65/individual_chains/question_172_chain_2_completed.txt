Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let's try to think through this.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which I think means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So the usual blackbody radiation stuff applies here.

Hmm, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere is related to the temperature. The Boltzmann distribution comes into play here. Right, the Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the populations of two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k*T) )

Here, n_upper and n_lower are the number of atoms in the upper and lower energy levels. g's are the statistical weights, but the problem doesn't mention them, so maybe they are the same for both stars? Or perhaps the ratio g_upper/g_lower is the same for both stars, so it cancels out when taking the ratio between the two stars.

Wait, the problem says that the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So for star_1, the number of atoms in that specific excited state is twice that of star_2. Let's denote the ratio as (n1/n2) = 2.

But wait, the specific energy level difference is the same for both stars, right? Because it's a specific energy level, so E_upper - E_lower is the same for both. Let's call this delta_E = 1.38e-23 J.

So each star's photosphere has delta_E, but T is different. So for each star, we can write the Boltzmann factor.

For star_1: (n1_upper) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - delta_E/(k T_1) ) * n_total
Wait, maybe I should write the ratio between the two stars.

The ratio (n1/n2) = [ exp( - delta_E/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( - delta_E/(k T2) ) ]

Because the g factors would be the same for both stars (since it's the same element), they'd cancel out when taking the ratio.

So that ratio n1/n2 = exp( (delta_E/(k T2) - delta_E/(k T1)) )

Wait, that comes from the ratio of the two exponential terms. Let me re-derive it.

n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( - delta_E/(k T) )

So for star 1: (n_upper1) = (g) exp( - delta_E/(k T1) ) * n_total?
Wait, perhaps I should write the ratio of n_upper to n_lower for each star:

n_upper1 / n_lower1 = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( - delta_E/(k T1) )

Similarly, n_upper2 / n_lower2 = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( - delta_E/(k T2) )

If I take the ratio of these two, (n_upper1/n_lower1)/(n_upper2/n_lower2) = [exp( - delta_E/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( - delta_E/(k T2) ) ]

But wait, the problem says that the excitation is twice as high in star_1. How is that measured? Is n_upper the excited state, and the question implies n_upper1 = 2 *n_upper2?

Wait, the question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So I think that (n_upper1) = 2*(n_upper2)

So, (n_upper1)/(n_upper2) = 2.

But wait, if I take the ratio (n_upper1)/(n_upper2), I can express it as:

(n_upper1)/(n_upper2) = [ (g_upper/g_lower) exp( - delta_E/(k T1) ) *n_lower1 ) ] / [ (g_upper/g_lower) exp( - delta_E/(k T2) ) *n_lower2 ) ]

Wait, but that's getting confusing. Maybe I should instead look at the ratio of (n_upper/n_lower) for each star and then relate them.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write the ratio of the excitation as (n_upper1 / n_total1) / (n_upper2 / n_total2) ) = 2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each star's photosphere has a certain number of atoms in the excited state compared to the ground state.

Wait, the question states that the atoms are "twice as excited", which I think refers to the ratio of the number in the excited state to the number in the lower state. So n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2 )

Wait, no, actually, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited..." So perhaps the excitation level is the ratio n_upper / n_lower, so for star_1, that ratio is twice that of star_2.

So, (n_upper1/n_lower1) = 2 * (n_upper2/n_lower2 )

But using the Boltzmann equation, each ratio can be written as:

n_upper /n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( - delta_E/(k T) )

Assuming that the statistical weights (g) are the same for both stars, because it's the same element and energy levels.

So, delta_E is the same for both. Let me denote that as E.

So for star 1: (n_upper1/n_lower1) = exp( - E/(k T1) )

For star 2: (n_upper2/n_lower2) = exp( - E/(k T2) )

And according to the problem, (n_upper1/n_lower1) = 2 * (n_upper2/n_lower2 )

So,

exp( - E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - E/(k T2) )

Take the natural log of both sides:

- E/(k T1) = ln(2) + (- E/(k T2) )

Multiply the equation through:

- E/(k T1) = ln(2) - E/(k T2 )

Let me rearrange the terms:

E/(k T2) - E/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor E/(k):

E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Hmm, so that's E/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

So,

(E/k) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, let me check my algebra. So moving terms around:

E/(k T2) - E/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor E/(k):

E/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Which is E/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

So,

ln(2) = [ E/(k) ) * (T1 - T2) ] / ( T1 T2 )

Wait, but E is given as 1.38e-23 J. And k is Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's the same as the energy given. So E = k * something.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

E = 1.38e-23 J

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

So E = k * (1 K)

Wait, that's interesting. So E/(k) = (k * 1 K) ) / k ) = 1 K.

So E/(k) is 1 K.

So substituting back into the equation:

ln(2) = [ (1 K) * (T1 - T2) ) ] / ( T1 T2 )

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, option D says ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 )

So yes, that's the equation we arrived at.

Wait, but wait a second: in the problem, the excitation in star_1 is higher. So if star_1 has higher excitation, that would imply higher temperature, right?

Because higher temperatures make the atoms more excited, so higher n_upper.

So in our equation, (T1 - T2) must be positive because ln(2) is positive.

So if T1 > T2, T1 - T2 is positive, so that makes the equation hold.

So that's correct.

Looking back at the options:

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which matches what we have.


The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. The problem states that the excitation level of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

Using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. Since the statistical weights are assumed to be the same for both stars, they cancel out when taking the ratio of the excitation levels between the two stars.

Let \( n_{\text{upper,1}} / n_{\text{lower,1}} \) and \( n_{\text{upper,2}} / n_{\text{lower,2}} \) represent the excitation levels for star_1 and star_2, respectively. The problem states that \( n_{\text{upper,1}} / n_{\text{lower,1}} = 2 \cdot (n_{\text{upper,2}} / n_{\text{lower,2}}) \). Substituting the Boltzmann equation for each star, we get:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \). Thus:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the equation given in option D. Therefore, the correct relationship between the effective temperatures of the stars is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
