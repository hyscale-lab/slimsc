Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about meson resonance and the mean decay distance. I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? So the question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, and the options are given in meters, so I'll have to convert everything properly.

Wait, mean decay distance. Oh right, when a particle decays, the distance it travels before decaying depends on its lifetime and velocity. The formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma factor multiplied by the velocity. Or wait, maybe it's the mean lifetime times the velocity times the speed of light. Let me recall the exact formula.

I remember that the mean decay distance L is given by L = c * τ * β, where τ is the mean lifetime, β is the velocity of the particle divided by the speed of light, and c is the speed of light. Right, so I need to find τ first. How do I find τ?

Oh, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that Γ is inversely proportional to τ. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, I should make sure about the units here. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units of GeV·s or something? Let me think.

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So if Γ is in GeV, then τ = ħ / Γ. So I need to convert Γ from MeV to GeV. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) → τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, wait, that calculation: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s. That's 2.056875e-24 seconds. That makes sense.

Next, I need to find the velocity β. Beta is v/c. To find v, I can use the energy and mass relation. The particle's total energy E is the relativistic energy, which is gamma * m c². So gamma is E/(m c²). Wait, but in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but when converting to real units, I need to be careful.

Wait, the energy E_X is given as 8 GeV. The mass m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². So the gamma factor γ is E/(m c²). But wait, in units where c=1, E (in GeV) equals γ m (in GeV/c²) c². So E = γ m c², so gamma is E/(m c²). But since in GeV and GeV/c², when c=1, E = gamma * m, so gamma is E/m. So gamma here is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma is 6.6667.

Now, how do I find beta from gamma? The relation between gamma and beta is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). So I can solve for beta.

Let me compute beta. Let me rearrange the equation: gamma² = 1/(1 - beta²) → 1 - beta² = 1/gamma² → beta² = 1 - 1/gamma². So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

Gamma is 6.6667, so 1/gamma² is 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute that. What's sqrt(0.9775) approximately? Well, sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887. Wait, let me compute it more accurately: 0.9887 squared is about 0.9776, which is very close. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So now, the mean decay distance L is c * τ * beta. Let's compute each part.

First, c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So L = c * τ * beta.

We have τ = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So plug in the numbers: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s * 0.9887.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875 * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Then multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.103e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s equals 3 * 2.056875 * (1e8 *1e-24) = 6.170625 * 1e-16 meters. So 6.170625e-16 m.

Then multiply by beta (0.9887):

6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ let's compute 6.170625 * 0.9887.

6 * 0.9887 is about 5.9322. 0.170625 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.1689. So total is about 5.9322 + 0.1689 = 6.1011e-16. So approximately 6.1011e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are roughly around 4e-15 to 5e-16.

Wait, but my calculation gives about 6e-16. Hmm, but that's not matching any options. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s is correct: 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.170625 * 1e-16 meters, which is 6.170625e-16 m. Then multiply by beta ≈0.9887, giving 6.170625 * 0.9887 ≈6.101e-16 m.

But the options are A) 5.02e-16, C)5.02e-15, etc. So I'm getting 6.1e-16, which isn't one of the options. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the lifetime τ. Let me double-check that.

τ = ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25) / 0.32.

Compute 6.582 / 0.32: 6.582 ÷ 0.32. Let me do this division. 0.32 × 20 =6.4. So 20 × 0.32 is 6.4. Remaining is 0.182 ÷ 0.32 = 0.56875. So 20.56875. So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the gamma calculation is wrong. Let me recheck that.

E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma is E/(m c^2). But in units where c=1, E = gamma m, so gamma = E/m = 8 /1.2 ≈6.6667. Correct.

Beta calculation: sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/(44.4444))= sqrt(0.9775)= ~0.9887. Correct.

So where is the discrepancy? Hmm. Let me think about the formula again. Wait, the mean decay length is L = c * τ * beta. But wait, I also need to consider whether the units of Γ are correct. Because sometimes, the width is given in energy units, but perhaps I should check if I've used the right units for ħ.

Another thought: perhaps the relation between Γ and τ is different. Wait, the uncertainty principle says Γ = ħ / τ, but I've used that. Alternatively, sometimes Γ is given as the total decay width, which is the width in the Breit-Wigner distribution. So Γ is the total decay width, which is correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the beta is calculated incorrectly. Let me recalculate beta.

Gamma = 8 /1.2 = 6.6666667.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)

Thus, 1 - beta^2 = 1 / gamma^2 = (1.2/8)^2 = (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So, beta^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775 → beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of 3e8 * 2e-24 * 0.9887.

Wait, 3e8 is 3 *10^8 m/s.

τ is 2.056875e-24 s.

So 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875 * 1e8 * 1e-24 = (3*2.056875) * 1e-16.

3 *2.056875 is about 6.170625, so 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by beta (0.9887): 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈6.101e-16 m.

Hmm, but none of the options match this. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 5.0223 *10^-16 m

B)4.0655 *10^-15 m

C)5.0223 *10^-15 m

D)4.0655 *10^-16 m

Wait, my result is approximately 6.1e-16, which is closest to option A (5.02e-16) but not exactly. Hmm. Perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma or beta.

Wait, perhaps the energy and mass units are off. Because E is given in GeV, but m is in GeV/c². So when I calculate gamma = E/(m c²), I need to make sure about the units. Wait, let me re-express gamma correctly.

E is the total energy, which is gamma m c². So gamma is E/(m c²). But in natural units where c=1, this simplifies to E/(m). So that part was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate beta using the formula beta = (p c)/E, where p is the momentum.

So let me try another approach. Calculate p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c².

Wait, E = gamma m c².

So, p = gamma m v, and since v = beta c, p = gamma m beta c. But another way is p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c²)^2).

Alternatively, p = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / (c^2) * c, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

In terms of E, m, and c, the momentum p is given by p = sqrt( (E/c²)^2 - m² ) * c. Wait, perhaps it's better to write the relation as p^2 c^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2. So p c = sqrt(E^2 - m² c^4).

Wait, but everything is in GeV and c=1, so perhaps we can write:

p² c^2 = (E)^2 - (m c^2)^2.

Wait, no, more accurately, E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2).

So, p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c.

But in this case, E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV.

So, E² = (8)^2 =64 (GeV)^2.

m c² is 1.2 GeV, so (m c²)^2 is 1.44 GeV².

So, (E^2 - (m c^2)^2) =64 -1.44 =62.56 GeV².

So, p c = sqrt(62.56) GeV = 7.91 GeV.

So p = 7.91 GeV / c.

Then, beta is (p c^2)/E. Wait, wait, (p c)/E = beta.

Because p c = gamma m beta c², so p c = gamma m beta c² → p c = (gamma m c²) beta → beta = (p c) / (gamma m c²). But gamma m c² is E. So beta = (p c) / E.

Since p c is 7.91 GeV, beta = 7.91 GeV /8 GeV = 0.98875. Which is the same as before. So beta is still approximately 0.98875.

Hmm, so same result. So back to calculating L.

L = c τ beta.

Now, c is 3e8 m/s.

τ is 6.582e-25 GeV s / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25 /0.32 ) s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s * 0.98875.

Calculate step by step:

3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875e-16 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 0.98875: 6.170625e-16 * 0.98875 ≈ 6.101e-16 m.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay width.

Wait, wait, is Γ in MeV or GeV? The problem states Γ_X=320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, so that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for L is different. Let me think. Another approach: the mean decay length is given by L = c * gamma * (beta) * tau.

Wait, but tau is the mean lifetime, which is τ = ħ / (Γ). So perhaps, L = c * beta * gamma * tau.

Wait, no, because gamma is already part of the velocity and lifetime. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation that for a particle, the lifetime as measured in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. Oh wait, but the mean lifetime τ is the same as the proper lifetime, because τ is calculated from the width, which is a property of the particle in its rest frame. Wait, no, perhaps the mean lifetime is the particle's lifetime in its rest frame, but the observed lifetime is gamma multiplied by that. So when calculating the decay distance, the lifetime we use is gamma * tau.

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify:

The mean lifetime (proper time) tau is related to the width by tau = ħ/(Γ). But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation, so the observed lifetime is gamma * tau.

Wait, that's correct. So the decay length is L = velocity * lifetime.

Velocity is beta c.

Lifetime is gamma tau.

So L = beta c * gamma tau.

Wait, that's different from what I did earlier. Earlier I had L = c * tau * beta, but perhaps I forgot to include gamma in tau.

Ah, this must be the mistake. Because, the mean lifetime in the rest frame is tau = ħ / Γ. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by a factor of gamma, so the observed lifetime is gamma tau. So the decay distance L is beta c multiplied by the lab frame lifetime, which is gamma tau.

So L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, that changes everything. So let me recompute.

So L = beta * c * gamma * tau.

So let's compute each part again.

Gamma is 6.6667.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Beta is 0.98875.

So:

L = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute this step by step.

First, compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then multiply by gamma (6.6667): 6.170625e-16 *6.6667 ≈ approx 4.11375e-15 m.

Then multiply by beta (0.98875): 4.11375e-15 * 0.98875 ≈4.075e-15 m.

Wait, that's about 4.075e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15. So the closest is option B.

Wait, but let me do a more precise calculation.

Compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 1e8 * 2.056875 *1e-24 = (3 *2.056875) *1e-16 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then multiply by gamma (6.6666667):

6.170625e-16 * (20/3) = 6.170625e-16 * 6.6666667 ≈ (6.170625 *6.6666667) e-16.

6.170625 *6.6666667: let's compute 6 *6.6666667 is 40. So 6.170625 is 6 +0.170625.

6 *6.6666667=40.

0.170625 *6.6666667= approximately 1.13875.

So total is 40 +1.13875 =41.13875.

So 41.13875e-16 m.

Wait, no, 6.170625 *6.6666667 is 41.13875 → so 41.13875e-16 m.

Wait, wait, 6.170625e-16 *6.6666667= (6.170625 *6.6666667) *1e-16 → 41.13875 *1e-16 =4.113875e-15 m.

Then multiply by beta (0.98875):

4.113875e-15 * 0.98875.

Compute 4.113875e-15 *0.98875.

First, 4.113875 *0.98875 ≈ let me compute:

0.98875 is approximately 0.9888.

4.113875 *0.9888 ≈ 4 *0.9888=3.9552; 0.113875 *0.9888≈0.1124.

Total ≈ 3.9552 +0.1124=4.0676.

So 4.0676e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.0676e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So the correct answer must be option B.

Wait, but why did I get a different answer earlier when I forgot to include gamma in the lifetime? Because I correct that mistake, the L is about 4.067e-15, which is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \cdot c \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the mean lifetime, with \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
The mean lifetime \( \tau \) is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

Substituting \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is:

\[
L = \beta \cdot c \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \beta = 0.9887 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \gamma = 6.6667 \),
- \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot 6.6667 \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( c \cdot \tau \):

\[
c \cdot \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

Next, multiply by \( \gamma \):

\[
c \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \cdot 6.6667 = 4.113875 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

Finally, multiply by \( \beta \):

\[
L = 4.113875 \times 10^{-15} \cdot 0.9887 \approx 4.0676 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with options
The calculated value \( L \approx 4.0676 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

ANSWER: B
