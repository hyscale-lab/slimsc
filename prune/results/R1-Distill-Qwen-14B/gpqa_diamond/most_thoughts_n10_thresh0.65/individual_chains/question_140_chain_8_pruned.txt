Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down. 

First, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B under normal conditions is very close to 277 K. 

Hmm, I remember that melting points around 277 K are around 4°C, which makes me think of water. So B could be water. Because water freezes at 273 K (0°C) and boils at 373 K (100°C). But 277 is just a bit above, so maybe B is not water. Wait, wait, another thought: the melting point of ice is 273 K. So if B is a solid at 277 K, but the melting point is close, perhaps B is another substance with a similar melting point. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about B.

Looking at the reaction, gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule must be something like H2O or CO2, but wait, H2O has 1 proton and 1 neutron in each H, but O has 8 protons and maybe 8 neutrons. Wait, but the molecule as a whole—does it have equal number of protons and neutrons? Or each atom?

Wait, the statement says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the
