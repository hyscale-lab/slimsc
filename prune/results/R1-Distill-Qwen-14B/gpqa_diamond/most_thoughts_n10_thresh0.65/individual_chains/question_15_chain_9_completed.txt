Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance.

Wait, the question says that both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_1 has a shorter period, that means it's closer to its star, right? Because orbital period is related to distance via Kepler's third law. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since M is much larger than m, it's approximately P² proportional to a³/(M). So with a higher mass star, the same period would mean a smaller orbit, but here Planet_1's period is shorter. Let me think.

Wait, Planet_1’s host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. So let me think about their semi-major axes. Using Kepler's third law, P² is proportional to a³/(M). So for Planet_1:

P1 = (1/3) * P2 (since P1 is three times shorter). So P1² = (1/9) P2². 

So a1³ / M1 = ( (P1²) ) = (1/9 P2² ) 

And for Planet_2, a2³ / M2 = (P2²) 

But M1 is twice M2, so M1 = 2 M2.

Wait, maybe it's easier to express a1 and a2 in terms of each other. Let me write:

For Planet_1: a1³ = (G(M1 + m) P1²)/(4π²) ≈ (G M1 P1²)/(4π²) 

Similarly for Planet_2: a2³ = (G M2 P2²)/(4π²) 

But since m << M, we can ignore m. So:

a1³ / a2³ = (M1 / M2) * (P1² / P2²) 

Given M1=2 M2, and P1 = P2 / 3, so P1² = P2² /9.

So a1³/a2³ = (2) * (1/9) = 2/9.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3). Let me calculate (2/9)^(1/3). 2/9 is about 0.222. The cube root of that is approximately 0.6 something. Let me see, 0.6³ is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 ≈ 0.6 * a2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, which is twice as massive as Planet_2's star.

Now, the probability of a transit is given by the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, right? Wait, no, I think the probability is actually proportional to (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis. Because for the planet to transit, the orbital plane must be aligned edge-on, and the probability is the ratio of the star's size to the orbital distance. So the transit probability P is approximately (R*/a), where R* is the star's radius. But wait, no, I think more accurately, the probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the orbital distance, but wait, no, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the probability that a randomly oriented orbit will cause a transit is given by (R*/a) * (something). Oh wait, I think the formula is P ≈ (R_*/a)², but no, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is (R_*)/(a) × 1/(something else). Wait, let me recall. The transit probability depends on the relative sizes of the planet and the star, but more importantly, the inclination. The probability is approximately (R_*/a), where a is the semi-major axis, because the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the distance. So, for a given star and planet, the probability P is roughly (R_* / a). Because if the planet's orbital distance (a) is much larger than the star's radius (R_*), the chance of alignment is small.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more precise. The probability is (R_*/a) × (something else). Wait, another approach: the transit occurs only if the planet's orbital plane is within an angle of R*/(a) of our line of sight. So the solid angle where this occurs is related to that. The total possible solid angle is 2π (since the planet's orbit can be in any orientation). The area where transit occurs is a circle with radius R_* (I think it's a cap), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the probability is (R_*/a) because it's the ratio of the star's size to the distance, which gives a measure of how likely the planet's path will cross our line of sight.

So, given that, the transit probability P is proportional to R_*/a.

Now, in the question, both host stars have the same radius. Because the question states that both host stars have the same radii. So R1 = R2.

So P1 = (R1 / a1), P2 = (R2 / a2). Since R1 = R2, P1/P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2/a1.

Because a1 = 0.6 a2, so a2/a1 = 1/0.6 ≈ 1.6667.

So P1 is higher than P2 by a factor of about 1.6667, so approximately 1.65 times. So the probability of transit for Planet_1 is higher.

Wait, but wait a second. The probability is (R_*/a), but wait, looking for the transit probability, another factor comes into play: the star's radius compared to the planet's orbit. So, if Planet_1 is closer to its star (a1 is smaller than a2), then R_*/a1 is larger than R_*/a2. So indeed, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

Wait, let me recheck. For Planet_1: a1 is smaller, so R_*/a1 is larger. So P1 = R_*/a1, P2 = R_*/a2. Since a1 < a2, P1 > P2. So P1/P2 = a2/a1. From earlier, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3). Let me compute (2/9)^(1/3). 2 is 8^(1/3) is 2, 9 is 729^(1/3) is 9. Wait, no, wait, 2/9 is 0.222... So cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6. Let me compute it more accurately. 0.6^3 = 0.216, which is very close to 0.222. So a1 ≈0.6 a2. So a2/a1 = 1/0.6 ≈ 1.6667, which is about 1.6667, or 1.666 or ~1.67 times.

So P1 is about 1.67 times higher than P2.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. That's close to 1.67, so probably the correct choice.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. The planets have the same mass, but they're Earth-like, so same radius? Well, the question says the RV method has detected them, which depends on mass and period, but for the transit probability, it's the planet's radius relative to the star's size. But since the question says both host stars have the same radii, and the planets have the same mass, but their radii may not be the same? Wait, no, the question says 'Earth-like planets', which would have similar radii. But the question doesn't mention their radii, so perhaps we can ignore that, because the radius of the planet affects the depth of the transit, not the probability of transit. The probability is determined by the orbital distance and alignment, not the planet's size.

So the transit probability only depends on R_*/a, and since R_* is same for both stars, P1 = R_*/a1, P2 = R_*/a2.

So if a1 is smaller, then P1 is higher.

So with a1 being about 0.6 a2, P1 is about 1.666 times P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, so the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. That's the closest, because 1.666 is about 1.67, which is ~1.65, perhaps approximated.

Option D says ~2.7 times higher, which is much larger. So probably not.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. The question states that both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), so the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period and \( M \) is the mass of the host star, we can relate the semi-major axes of the two planets. For Planet_1 and Planet_2, we have:

- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (since Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).
- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (the host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as that of Planet_2).

Substituting into the proportionality \( a^3 \propto P^2 M \), we find:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}.
\]

Taking the cube root, we get:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \). Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67.
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.67 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Among the options provided, the closest match is **Option C**, which states that Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.
