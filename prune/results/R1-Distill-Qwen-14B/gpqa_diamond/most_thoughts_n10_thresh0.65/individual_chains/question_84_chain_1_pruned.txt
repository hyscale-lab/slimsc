Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, specifically related to the matrix exponential approximation using fractional methods. Hmm.

Let me think. Matrix exponential functions are often used in solving systems of linear differential equations, right? In the context of heat equations, which are PDEs, the finite difference method converts them into a system of equations that can be represented as a matrix. The solution at each time step involves multiplying the initial condition vector by the matrix exponential of the system matrix times the time step.

But in parallel algorithms, you can't just compute this matrix exponential directly because it's a dense matrix and doing it sequentially would take a lot of time. So, how do you make this parallel? I remember that one approach is to split the matrix into smaller blocks that can be processed independently. This is called parallel splitting or using splitting techniques like the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method for higher dimensions.

Wait, the question mentions higher order finite differences and parallel splitting. So the method must allow for breaking down the problem into parts that can be computed in parallel. The key here might be how the matrix exponential is approximated. If you're using a fractional approximation, perhaps it's about the stability and efficiency of that approximation when split.

Looking at the options: 

A) Stability analysis: That's important in numerical methods to ensure that the errors don't grow unbounded, but is it the key factor for converting to parallel? Maybe, but I'm not sure. It's a necessary condition but maybe not the key for parallelism.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal conditions are those where the boundary depends on values inside the domain, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to parallel algorithms. Maybe it's more about the problem setup rather than the algorithm's parallelism.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Fractional approximations often involve models with memory or distributed effects, which can have complex roots. If the approximation's roots are complex, perhaps they don't allow for straightforward parallel splitting. Or maybe the presence of complex roots complicates the splitting. I'm not certain.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Partial fractions are a way to decompose expressions into simpler parts. If the approximation can be broken down into linear components, maybe each part can be handled independently in parallel. That sounds promising because each fraction could be computed on different processors or cores.

Wait, in the context of matrix exponentials, if the approximation can be written as a sum of simpler exponentials, each corresponding to a part of the matrix, then each part can be computed in parallel. So the linear partial fraction decomposition would allow this splitting. For instance, in ADI methods, each spatial direction is handled in a way that allows time stepping in parallel for each direction.

So D) might be the key factor. Linear partial fractions enable the approximation to be split into parts that can be processed concurrently, thus transforming the sequential algorithm into a parallel one.

Another angle: When using fractional approximation for the matrix exponential, if the approximation can be expressed as a sum of exponentials with different matrices, each of those can be computed in parallel. So the ability to perform a partial fraction decomposition is crucial. That aligns with option D.

So, putting it all together, the key factor is the linear partial fraction of the fractional
