Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the photosphere is the layer of the star where photosynthesis happens? Wait, no, that's plants. Oh wait, no, the photosphere in stars is the outer layer where light is emitted, right. And LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which I think means that each small region of the star behaves like a blackbody in equilibrium at a certain temperature.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, that's probably the energy difference ΔE for the specific transition we're looking at.

So the problem is about the excitation of iron atoms in each star's photosphere. The excitation being twice as much in star_1. I'm thinking this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states at thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann factor says that the number of particles in a higher energy state compared to a lower one is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature.

So for a given transition, the ratio of the populations (like N_upper / N_lower) is equal to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

In the problem, star_1 has twice the excitation level of star_2. Hmm. Wait, so maybe the
