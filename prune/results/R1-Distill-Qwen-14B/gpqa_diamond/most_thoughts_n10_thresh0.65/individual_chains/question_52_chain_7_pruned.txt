Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the question is about a star that has some dark spots on its surface. When the spots aren't there, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and its radius is 1.5 solar radii, mass is 1.1 solar masses. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric temperature drops to 5500 K. 

So the main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—without spots vs. with spots.

Wait, okay, so the ratio is n1/n2 when there are no spots compared to when there are spots. So the ratio decreases when there are spots, meaning that when the star is cooler (with spots), the ratio is lower than when it's hotter (without spots). So the factor would be the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots, which is a value greater than 1.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Angstroms. Oh, that's in the near-ultraviolet range, I think. And we're assuming LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium holds, which means we can use the Boltzmann equation for the population of these energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g are the statistical weights, E are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

Wait, but since the problem is about the ratio when the star has spots, which is lower overall temperature, let's think about how that affects the ratio. Let me denote T1 as the original temperature (6000 K) and T2 as the lower temperature (5500 K). 

The ratio n1/n2 would be [ (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ) ].

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. So when the temperature decreases, the exponential factor decreases because T is in the denominator. So n2/n1 would decrease, meaning that n1/n2 would increase? Wait, wait. Let me make sure.

Wait, if T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller. So n2/n1 would be lower than before. So if the star is cooler, the higher energy level (n2) is less populated relative to n1. So the ratio n1/n2 would increase when T decreases, right? Because n2/n1 is lower, so flipping it, n1/n2 is higher.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. That's confusing. Wait, let me read the question again. "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)
