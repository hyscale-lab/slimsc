Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I'll draw the target structure to visualize it. The main chain seems to be a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (the aldehyde) attached. Then there's a substituent at position 1, which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that substituent is a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexane ring. So, the substituent is like CH(OH)(cyclohexyl).

Now, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond attached to two ethyl groups, wait no, ethynyl is C≡C- attached directly to the ring). Wait, ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached, right? Because ethynyl is the substituent where one carbon is attached to the ring and the other is a triple bond to H. So structure like cyclohexane-C≡CH.

So, the plan is to go from ethynylcyclohexane to the target. Let's think about the possible reactions and reagents.

Let me consider the steps needed. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group, which also has a hydroxyl group. Additionally, there's an aldehyde group on the cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps we need to form a ring expansion or some kind of addition.

Wait, looking again: the substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, that's like a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is then attached to the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group could undergo some kind of addition. I remember that alkynes can be used in various additions, like hydrob
