Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework that includes the Standard Model (SM) as a low-energy limit and incorporates higher-dimensional operators to account for beyond the SM physics.

The question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options given are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Let me recall what each of these means.

Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. This is fundamental because the SM is a relativistic theory. SMEFT should respect this because it's built upon the SM's principles.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, so it's a bigger symmetry group. Poincare symmetry implies momentum conservation and includes the concept of energy-momentum. Since the SM respects Poincare, SMEFT should too. But wait, I'm not sure if SMEFT necessarily includes all aspects of Poincare symmetry. Or does it inherit it from the SM? Because SMEFT is an effective theory built on SM fields, so I think it does respect Poincare.

CP symmetry is about the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) symmetry. It's not automatically respected by the SM, though; for example, CP violation is observed in certain processes like kaon and B-meson systems. So do SMEFT operators need to respect CP? I don't think so. SMEFT allows for operators that can violate CP, as they are effective operators that can account for new physics which might break CP.

CPT symmetry is the combination of charge, parity, and time reversal. The SM respects CPT symmetry, and I believe this must hold in any valid quantum field theory. So SMEFT operators must respect CPT. Because if they didn't, that would imply some serious issues with the theory's consistency, like violating causality or unitarity.

Wait, but why is that? So, in quantum field theories, CPT symmetry is crucial. Any operator that's part of a renormalizable theory (like SMEFT, which is a non-renormalizable effective theory but still built with renormalizable operators) must respect CPT. Because if you have an operator that doesn't, that could lead to a violation of unitarity or causality, which are fundamental to QFT. So yes, SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry.

Now looking back at the options. The question is which of these symmetries must be respected by all operators. So looking at each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Must be respected. So this is correct.

2. Poincare symmetry: Hmm, I think SMEFT respects it because SM does, and SMEFT is built on SM fields and interactions. So yes, but wait, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. Do SMEFT operators have to respect translations? Well, the operators are local, so they should respect translation symmetry. So 2 is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by "all operators". So if an operator doesn't respect Poincare, that would be a problem. But I think SMEFT is constructed in a way that all its terms are Poincare invariant. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

But wait, perhaps Poincare is a bigger symmetry than Lorentz. So if operators are built respecting Lorentz, they might not necessarily respect Poincare unless they also involve translation invariance. But in SMEFT, the operators are local, so they should respect translation as well. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are observed.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So for all operators in SMEFT, they must be invariant under Lorentz and Poincare. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

But earlier, I thought that Poincare is correct. So the first two symmetries must be respected.

CP symmetry: Not necessarily. SMEFT can have operators that violate CP, so 3 is incorrect.

CPT symmetry: Must be respected because it's a fundamental symmetry of QFT. So 4 is correct.

So the symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. Wait, but wait, the options don't have all three. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 1,2 → So Lorentz and Poincare. But CPT is 4, which must be respected. So this can't be the correct option.

Wait, because the question says "must be respected by all operators", so which of the four must be true?

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, Poincare symmetry is about the combination of Lorentz transformations and translations. So if an operator is Lorentz-invariant, does it automatically mean it's Poincare-invariant? Or do we need to separately enforce translation invariance?

In SMEFT, operators are local, so they are automatically translation-invariant. Because translation invariance is part of the framework. So if an operator is written in a Lorentz-invariant way, it's also Poincare-invariant.

So all operators in SMEFT respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So 1 and 2 are correct.

CP: Not necessarily. So operators can violate CP.

CPT: All operators must respect CPT, because otherwise the theory would have issues. So 4 is correct.

Wait, but wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) are both required, and CPT (4) is required.

But looking at the options:

Option C) 1,2,4 → So that would mean all three are correct. But wait, the options don't have 3 and 4 as correct. Or do they? Let's see the options.

Options:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C) 1,2,4

D) 1,3,4

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. So the option C is 1,2,4. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that SMEFT operators must respect all four: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, CPT? No, because CP is not necessarily. So the correct musts are 1,2,4.

But wait, another approach: SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, which must respect all the symmetries of the SM. The SM respects Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So SMEFT operators must also respect these. But CP is not a symmetry of the SM (since there's CP violation), so SMEFT operators can violate CP, meaning not all operators in SMEFT need to respect CP.

So the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but the question is about which of the options (1-4) must be respected by all operators. So 1,2,4 must be respected by all operators.

So looking at the options, option C says 1,2,4 are correct. So the correct answer is C. But wait, looking back at the options, option C is 1,2,4.

So the correct answer is option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) as a low-energy limit and includes higher-dimensional operators to describe beyond-SM physics. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry, which applies to invariance under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts), is fundamental to relativistic quantum field theories. Since SMEFT is built upon the SM, which respects Lorentz symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect this symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT operators are local and constructed in a manner consistent with the SM, they must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The SM does not respect CP symmetry (e.g., CP violation is observed in certain processes). SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry, as they can account for CP-violating effects associated with new physics.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry combines charge, parity, and time reversal. This symmetry is fundamental to quantum field theory, as its violation would lead to inconsistencies such as the breakdown of unitarity or causality. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz symmetry (1)**, **Poincaré symmetry (2)**, and **CPT symmetry (4)**. The option that correctly reflects this is:

**C) 1, 2, 4**

Answer: C
