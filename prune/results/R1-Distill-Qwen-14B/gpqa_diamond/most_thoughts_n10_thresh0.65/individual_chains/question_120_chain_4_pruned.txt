Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me see. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax value. The options are various inverse powers of parallax.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. So a higher parallax means a closer star.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. I think that means the same number density throughout space. So if we imagine space filled with stars at all distances, but the number per unit volume is constant.

Wait, but when it comes to counting stars we observe, how does it depend on their distance? Let's think about it in terms of volume. The number of stars in a shell between distance d and d+dd would be proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πd² dd. So as d increases, the volume increases with d squared.

But wait, parallax is plx = 1/d. So if I want to express this in terms of parallax, I need to relate d to plx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So substituting, the volume element would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d d). But d d is the change in distance, which in terms of parallax is d d = - (1/plx^2) d plx. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of plx instead of d.
