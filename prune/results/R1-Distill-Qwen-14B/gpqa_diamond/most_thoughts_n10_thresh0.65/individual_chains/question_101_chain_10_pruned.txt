Okay, so I’ve got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction using 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A. The product obtained is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to choose the correct reagent A and catalyst B from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic amine. The product seems to have a cyclohexylidene group attached. Wait, cyclohexylidene is like a cyclohexene ring, right? Oh, wait, no. The name cyclohexylidenemethyl... Let me think. The "idene" part usually indicates a double bond. So cyclohexylidenemethyl would be a cyclohexyl group with a double bond, so maybe it's a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group?

Wait, the product's structure is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the pyrrolidine ring has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl group. So, it's like a cyclohexene ring connected via a CH₂ group to the pyrrolidine. So the substituent is CH₂-Cyclohexene.

Wait, but how was that formed? The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. So the reaction
