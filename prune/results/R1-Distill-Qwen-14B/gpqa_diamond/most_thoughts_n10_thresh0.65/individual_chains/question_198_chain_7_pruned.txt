Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. Hmm, I remember something about stability constants and complexation reactions. 

So, the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN^- ligands attached, right? So that's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. The blue color probably comes from that complex.

So, the problem is about finding the fraction of Co that's in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ among all possible cobalt species.

I think I need to consider the formation of different complexes. The possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^4-, with their respective stability constants β1 to β4.

Wait, but wait. The stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=
