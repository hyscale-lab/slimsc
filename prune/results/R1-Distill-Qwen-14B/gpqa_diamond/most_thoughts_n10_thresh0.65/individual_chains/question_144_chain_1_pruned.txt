Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), but then I think the velocity also comes into play because if the particle is moving fast, it travels further before decaying. So the decay length L is approximately v * τ.

Wait, but how do I find τ? Oh, right, the lifetime is related to the width Γ via the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So the lifetime τ is approximately ħ / Γ. Oh wait, but I should be careful with the units here.

Let me write the steps down:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Find the velocity v of the meson.
3. Multiply c (speed of light) by τ and by v to get the decay length L.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. Because Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the inverse of the lifetime. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, let
