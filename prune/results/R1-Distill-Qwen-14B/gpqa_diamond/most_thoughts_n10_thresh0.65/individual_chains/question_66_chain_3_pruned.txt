Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these, and I need to pick the correct combination.

Wait, what do I remember about SMEFT? So, SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) as a subset and includes higher-dimensional operators to account for beyond-SM physics. These operators have to obey certain symmetries.

I think SMEFT is constructed in such a way that the operators are classified by their dimension, and each operator must respect the symmetries of the SM. Oh right, the SM has certain symmetries, and SMEFT has to preserve those unless they're explicitly broken by the new physics.

So which symmetries are part of the SM? The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, which is the combination of rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations, right? So if the SM has Poincare symmetry, then SMEFT must also respect that, because it's an effective theory built on top.

Wait, but wait a second. Effective field theories typically require Lorentz symmetry because they're formulated in a relativistic framework. So all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars. That makes senseâ€”so Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.

What about Poincare symmetry (2)? Since Poincare includes translations, momentum conservation, etc. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but does it have to respect Poincare? Well, the effective theory is built in a way that the S-matrix elements are consistent with Lorentz and Poincare, but I'm not entirely sure if all operators must individually respect Poincare. Or maybe Poincare is automatically satisfied if the theory is Lorentz-invariant and renormalizable? Hmm, perhaps Poincare is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz and translation. So if the theory is Lorentz-symmetric, then it's also Poincare-symmetric in a certain way, but maybe the SMEFT operators don't need to separately respect Poincare. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe Poincare symmetry is automatically respected because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So operators are built as Lorent
