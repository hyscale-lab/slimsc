Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the possible decays of a boson X. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem gives me the interaction Lagrangian as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Hmm, wait—so the interaction term between the boson X and the fermions is proportional to X(y) times some fermion fields. I think this means that X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs because in the Lagrangian, when you expand it, you get terms like X ψ ψ, which would mediate the production or decay of X into fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So for it to decay into a pair of fermions, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, the condition for a particle to decay into two particles is that the combined rest mass of the products is less than or equal to the mass of the parent particle.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit fuzzy on whether it's the rest mass or the invariant mass. No, wait, no—in any frame, the decay products must have a combined invariant mass less than or equal to the mass of X. Oh, but since X is at rest when it decays, the invariant mass is the same as the sum of the rest masses, right? Because in that frame, the decay products' energies would be such that their rest masses add up. So yeah, for each fermion species, like quarks or leptons, I need to check if twice the mass (since they come in pairs) is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, actually, the rest mass is for each particle. So for a fermion-antifermion pair, each has mass m, so the total is 2m. So 2m ≤ 6 GeV. So m ≤ 3 GeV.

So I need to list all the known fermions with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let's list them out.

Fermions include quarks and leptons. Let's start with quarks. The known quarks have the following approximate masses (in GeV/c²):

- Up (u): about 2.2 MeV → 0.0022 GeV.
- Down (d): similar, around 4.7 MeV → ~0.0047 GeV.
- Strange (s): around 95 MeV → 0.095 GeV.
- Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV.
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV.
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV.
- For leptons:
   - Electron (e): 0.000511 GeV.
   - Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV.
   - Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV.
   - Neutrinos: very light, but for this problem, perhaps they can be considered massless. But since the interaction term is with ψ_f, which includes all fermions, but neutrinos are leptons too.

Wait, but the interaction term given is with ψ_f, which I think refers to all the fermions, maybe the charged ones, because the term is f ψ_f̄ (y) ... ψ_f (y). Let me think: the term has ψ_f, which would be all the fermion species. But perhaps neutrinos don't interact via this term because they are neutral and perhaps the interaction is via some other force. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify. So perhaps the interaction is only with charged fermions, but I'm not sure. The given Lagrangian is written as involving ψ_f, which is a Dirac spinor, so maybe it includes all, but perhaps the X boson only couples to charged fermions. Alternatively, maybe it can couple to neutral fermions as well, but that's unclear. But for this problem, perhaps it's assumed that the X couples to all the fermions included in the ψ_f term.

Wait, the problem states that X is a bosonic field interacting with fermions, so perhaps all fermions are allowed. But let's think about the possible decay products.

So, each possible decay would be X → f f̄, where f is a fermion. The condition is that the sum of the rest masses of f and f̄ is ≤ 6 GeV. Since f and f̄ each have mass m, 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV.

So looking at the fermions:

Quarks:

- u: ~0.002 GeV → can decay into uū, but wait, but wait. Wait, the mass of u is about 2-5 MeV, so 0.002-0.005 GeV
