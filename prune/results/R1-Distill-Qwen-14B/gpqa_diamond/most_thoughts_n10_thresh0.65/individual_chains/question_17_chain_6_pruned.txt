Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read through it again. The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, EDTA is a chelating agent, right? So it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The problem gives the formation constant, K, which is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA combine to form the complex. So the reaction should be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The formation constant K is given as 5e10. K is pretty large, which means the complex is very stable, and the reaction favors the formation of the complex.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. I'm assuming that the solution is in a state where the complex is at equilibrium. So, the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. But because the problem is about the concentration of free calcium ions, I need to find [Ca²+] in solution.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I think that means that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, I can model this using the formation constant expression.

The formation constant K is defined as:

K = [CaEDTA²-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

But I need to find [Ca²+], so I'll rearrange this equation. Wait, but what about the concentration of free EDTA?

Wait, another thought: in a solution with a chelating agent like EDTA, the total EDTA concentration is equal to the sum of the free EDTA (in different protonated forms) and the EDTA that's bound to Ca²+. But wait, if the problem says that the solution has 0.02 M CaEDTA, maybe we're assuming that all the EDTA is in the form of the complex? Or is the initial concentration of the complex 0.02 M, and we need to find the free Ca²+?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the dissociation of the complex
