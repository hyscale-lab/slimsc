Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Alright, let's break this down. I remember that when you dilute a weak acid like acetic acid, the concentration decreases, which affects its pH. Then, when you titrate it with NaOH, which is a strong base, things change further. So first, I need to find out the concentration of the diluted acetic acid.

So, the initial volume is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40.00 cm³ or 0.04 L. The dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So the new concentration M2 is (M1 * V1) / V2.

Calculating that: M2 = (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L. Let me compute that in my head. 0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001, divided by 0.04 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we dilute it, the degree of dissociation increases, which might lower the pH. Hmm, but wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you dilute it, the pH actually increases, because the dissociation is more. Wait no, wait, maybe I should think again. Let me recall: for a weak acid, when you dilute it, the concentration of H+ ions doesn't decrease as much as it would for a strong acid. But the pH is determined by the [H+], so if the solution is more diluted, the H+ concentration will be lower, but not as much as in the strong acid case. Wait, but I think for a weak acid, when you dilute it, the pH increases because the dissociation becomes more significant, but the pH doesn't go up as much as it would for a strong acid. Wait, maybe I should just compute it.

But wait, the problem isn't directly asking for the pH of the diluted solution. It's asking for the pH during the titration at 25% and equivalence point.

Right. So, for the titration: the initial solution is 0.025 M acetic acid (since diluted). We are titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's think about how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point.

The equivalence point volume can be found using the formula: M1V1 = M
