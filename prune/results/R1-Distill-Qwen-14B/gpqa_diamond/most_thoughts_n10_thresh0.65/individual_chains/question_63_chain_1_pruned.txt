Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules are made of two atoms, right? In this case, the atoms are X and Y. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, sometimes called the non-rigid rotor model. I think that model considers both the rotation and vibration of the molecule on a quantum level.

The problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. Oh wait, wait, the next possible state with the lowest energy. So, I'm thinking about energy transitions here.

I need to recall what the fundamental state is. For a diatomic molecule, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the first vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (I think that's J=0). So, when it absorbs a photon, it must transition to the next higher energy state. But wait, what's the next state? Since energy levels are quantized, the next state would involve an increase in either vibrational or rotational quantum numbers. However, the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Because sometimes the energy levels from rotation and vibration can interleave.

Wait, the question asks for the photon's momentum. So the photon's energy is what's absorbed, and that energy must match the energy difference between the two states. But wait, the molecule can change either vibrationally or rotationally. The next possible state could be either the next vibrational level (
