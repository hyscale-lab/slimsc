Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about how the number of stars changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So, that probably means that the number of stars isn't dependent on their brightness or anything like that; it's just spread out evenly. But wait, how does uniform distribution work in three dimensions? Oh right, in a uniform distribution, the number of stars you see in a certain volume depends on the size of that volume.

Parallax is a measure of distance. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So, plx = 1/distance. That means a larger parallax means the star is closer. So, as plx increases, distance decreases.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, for a given change in parallax (like from plx to plx + dplx), how many stars are there?

Wait, but parallax is a function of distance. So maybe I should think in terms of distance. Let me recall the formula for number density in space. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a small volume dV is proportional to dV. So, n = N * dV, where N is the total number density.

But how does this relate to parallax? Let's think about the volume element in terms of parallax. Parallax plx is in arcseconds, and distance d is in parsecs, with d = 1/plx.

In three-dimensional space, the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd would be 4πd² dd. So, the number of stars in this shell would be proportional to 4πd² dd.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about per unit range of parallax. So we need to express the volume in terms of parallax.

Since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But when considering the number of stars, the sign doesn't matter, so we can ignore it.

So the volume element dV is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx² dplx ). Wait, but since we're taking the magnitude, perhaps it's 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx² ). Wait, no, because dd is (d d)/d plx. Let me think
