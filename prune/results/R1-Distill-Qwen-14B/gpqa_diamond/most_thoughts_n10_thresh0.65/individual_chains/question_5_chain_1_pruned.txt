Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. They've provided the components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. I need to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Hmm, so first, I remember that for a spin-1/2 particle, like a muon, the spin operator components are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, each multiplied by ħ/2 to give the components of the spin operator. So the operator P here is probably the spin operator. Wait, but the question mentions a muon, which is a lepton with spin-1/2. So yeah, P is the spin operator.

The eigenvector we're looking for corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P in the direction of an arbitrary unit vector n in the x-z plane. So n is in the x-z plane, which means its direction can be described by an angle θ from the z-axis and φ=0, I think. Wait, no, wait: if it's in the x-z plane, then φ is 0 or π, because in spherical coordinates, φ is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. So if the vector is in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π. But I'm not sure if that matters here.

Wait, but the eigenvectors for spin in an arbitrary direction can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of the z-component. So the general approach is to construct the spin operator along direction n and then find its eigenvectors.

The operator P along n is given by the vector product: P = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y must be zero. So n = (n_x, 0, n_z). But since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. Alternatively, it can be written in terms of an angle θ: n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.
