Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here with four matrices W, X, Y, Z. And I need to figure out which statement among options A to D is correct. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices represent operators. Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues (which represent possible measurement outcomes) are real. The evolution operator, on the other hand, is unitary. So maybe I need to check if the matrices are Hermitian or unitary.

Let me go through each matrix.

Starting with matrix W:
W is a 3x3 matrix:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0
Hmm, I think this is a permutation matrix. To check if it's Hermitian, W should equal its conjugate transpose. Since all the entries are real, W's conjugate transpose is its transpose. So what's W transpose? It would swap the off-diagonal elements. Looking at W, the (1,3) entry is 1, and (3,1) is 1. The (1,2) and (2,1) are 0. The diagonal is the same. So W is symmetric, which means it's Hermitian. So W is an observable.

Next, matrix X:
X is:
i   -1   2i
1    0    1
2i  -1   -i

Wait, for X to be Hermitian, X must equal X†. Let's compute X†.

X† would be the conjugate transpose. So:
First row of X: i, -1, 2i → conjugate is -i, -1, -2i.
Then, transpose these rows into columns. So X† would have first column as -i, 1, -2i; second column as -1, 0, -1; third column as -2i,1, -i.

Wait, let me write out X† explicitly:

Row 1 of X†: [ -i, 1, 2i ] → Wait, no, wait. Let me think: X has first row [i, -1, 2i], so the conjugate is [-i, -1, -2i], and then the transpose. So the first column of X† is the conjugate of the first row of X: [-i, 1, 2i]?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The conjugate transpose is formed by taking the transpose and then taking the complex conjugate of each element.

So X's transpose would swap (1,3) with (3,1), etc. Let me write X's transpose:

Original X:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Transposing X would make the columns into rows. So the first column becomes [i, 1, 2i], the second [-1, 0, -1], the third [2i, 1, -i].

Now take the complex conjugate of each element. So the conjugate of first column becomes [-i, 1, -2i], the second column becomes [1, 0, 1], because the elements were -1, 0, -1, which conjugate to -1, 0, -1, but wait no, wait, the transpose is [i,1,2i] becomes [i,1,2i] as first row. Wait, perhaps I should construct X† properly.

Wait, X† is the conjugate of X's transpose. So X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So, first, transpose X:

Columns become rows.

Column 1: i,1,2i → row 1 of X^T: [i, 1, 2i]
Column 2: -1,0,-
