Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. 

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And they're both in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles among energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So I think that refers to the population ratio. Let's say in star_1, the population of the excited state is twice that of star_2. Or wait, no—the problem says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the ratio of excited to ground state in star_1 is twice that of star_2? Or perhaps the excitation is higher in star_1. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this with the Boltzmann equation. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and for star_2 as R2. 

So R1 = (n_upper1 / n_lower1) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))
Similarly, R2 = (n_upper2 / n_lower2) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

The problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So I'm not entirely sure if that translates to R1 = 2 R2 or R1 = 2. Wait, maybe the excitation is the ratio of the populations. So perhaps R1 is twice R2. No, wait, wait. Let me think again. If in star_1, the excited state is more populated relative to the lower state than in star_2, that would mean higher excitation. So, R1 is higher than R2.

Alternatively, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in
