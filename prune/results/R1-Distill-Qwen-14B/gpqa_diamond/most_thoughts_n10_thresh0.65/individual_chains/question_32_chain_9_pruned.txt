Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC accelerates heavy ions to high speeds, so this must be a relativistic problem.

Wait, the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. Let me think, lithium has an atomic number of 3. So, natural lithium has isotopes. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because Li has 3 protons, so 3 + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6.

So I need to find the energy of the ion. Since it's a heavy ion, relativistic effects are important. The energy in particle physics is usually given as the total energy, which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. But wait, sometimes people use the term 'energy' to mean kinetic energy, but in high-energy physics, it's often the total energy. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. The question says 'the energy of the RHIC', so I think that refers to the total energy of the nucleus.

The speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high. So I think I should use the relativistic equations for energy. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy.

Gamma, the Lorentz factor, is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. So v is 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96)^2 c². Let me calculate (0.96)^2. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. Then 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. Yes, so gamma is 1/0.28. Let's compute that: 1 divided by 0.28. 0.28 is like 28/100, which is 7/25. So 1/(7/25) is 25/7, which is approximately 3.57142857. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus X. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is needed. Let's think: the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². Since Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), the rest mass energy E_0 would be approximately 6 * 938 MeV. Let me compute that: 6 * 938 = 5,628 MeV. Converting that to GeV, since 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, that's 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but wait—I should double-check this. The actual mass of Li-6 might be slightly different due to binding energy and other factors. Oh wait, but in high-energy physics, when calculating the rest mass of a nucleus, we often approximate it as A * m_nucleon, where A is the mass number. So I think it's acceptable to use 6 * 938 MeV.

So the rest mass energy E_0 is 5.628 GeV.

The total energy E is gamma multiplied by E_0. So E = gamma * E_0 = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that. Let me calculate 3.5714 * 5.628.

Hmm
