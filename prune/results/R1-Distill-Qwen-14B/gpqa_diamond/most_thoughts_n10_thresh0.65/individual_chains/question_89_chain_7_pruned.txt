Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent bromines) react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. So, this first step probably produces an adamantane derivative with a double bond.

The product 1 has an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, IR peaks around 1700 usually indicate a carbonyl group (C=O). But wait, elimination would form an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong here. Oh wait, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination but something else. Wait, wait, another thought: maybe KOH isn't just eliminating the bromides. If it's heated, another possibility is that each Br leaves, and the compound undergoes some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement. But I'm not too sure.

Looking back, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons. Heating with KOH, which is a strong base, likely leads to dehydrohalogenation. So two eliminations would form a double bond between the two carbons where the Brs were. So the product would have a double bond, making it an adamantyl compound with an alkene.

Wait, but the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. Did I make a mistake? Oh! Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. If there's a possibility of forming a ketone. But how? Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH... Another possibility is that it's an SN2 reaction on each Br, but with vicinal dihalides, that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of an epoxide? No, that's when you have a diol or something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Products with carbonyl groups could be ketones. But wait, if it's KOH and elimination, perhaps the two Brs are eliminated as HBr, and a double bond is formed
