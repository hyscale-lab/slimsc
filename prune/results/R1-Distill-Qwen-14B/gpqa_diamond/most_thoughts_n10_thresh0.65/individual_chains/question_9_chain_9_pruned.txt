Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about molecular symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules is important for things like determining chirality or maybe even how they interact in reactions. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3H symmetry.

Wait, wait, what's C3H symmetry again? Oh right, C3H is a type of molecular symmetry called a hindered rotation. It's when a molecule can rotate around a certain axis, but only in 120-degree increments, making three equivalent positions. So it's not a free rotation like C3, but hindered. Or wait, does C3H denote a higher symmetry? Maybe I should think about it in terms of point groups. Oh wait, no, C3H isn't a point group, it's more of a type of hindered rotation in a molecule with a certain point group.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe C3H refers to the molecule having a three-fold axis of rotation, but with some hindrance. Or perhaps it's about whether the molecule has a three-fold rotation but can't rotate freely because of bulky groups. So, looking at the options, I need to find which molecule has a three-fold rotational symmetry but with some hindrance that doesn't allow free rotation.

The options are triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and tripheny
