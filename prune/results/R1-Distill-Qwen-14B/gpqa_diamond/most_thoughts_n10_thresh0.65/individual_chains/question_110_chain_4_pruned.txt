Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should probably understand the basics. I know that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. But each has different capabilities, especially concerning the brightness of the stars they can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can see stars with V magnitudes up to 17, while HIRES goes up to 16. So any star that's brighter than 17 mag can't be observed by ESPRESSO, but HIRES can't handle anything brighter than 16. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO", and similarly for HIRES. Wait, that's a bit confusing because magnitude scales are a bit counterintuitive. Oh, right! Lower magnitudes are brighter. So, for example, a magnitude of 5 is brighter than 10.

So, let me clarify: ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes (apparent) up to 17 mag. So any star with V < 17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars up to 16 mag. So any star with V < 16 can be observed by HIRES.

Wait, no, wait. The question says, "brighter than 17 mag
