Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first reaction is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows specific peaks: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). There's also a strong IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethyl sulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum, excluding those that exchange.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, I need to figure out what each product is.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH (a strong base) probably leads to an elimination reaction. Since it's dibromide, maybe it dehydrohalogenates to form an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so maybe it forms a ring-opening or a bridge structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. Also, the IR has a peak at 1720, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester.

Wait, but wait. If heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH leads to elimination, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution. But the IR suggests a carbonyl, which is more likely from a substitution. Let me think: KOH is a strong base but also a nucleophile. So, maybe each Br is replaced by hydroxide. But that would form a diol. But wait, if it's an elimination, then two Brs would be removed, and we'd get a double bond.

Wait, but the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is a ketone. That makes sense. So maybe the reaction is a double elimination, forming an epoxide? No, wait. Alternatively, each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl, but that would be a diol, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't substitution but elimination. If two adjacent Brs are present, elimination would form a double bond. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lead to a diene perhaps? Or maybe not adjacent. Wait, the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent carbons, perhaps on the same bridge. So when heated with KOH, it might undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene.

Alternatively, if KOH is a strong base, elimination is more likely. So 1,3-dibromoad
