Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. RHIC collides heavy ions, right? So the energy here would relate to the kinetic energy of those ions. The problem gives me that nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So the isotope would be Li-6, because Li typically has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would mean a mass number of 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I remember that the energy of a relativistic particle isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy, which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic. But wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So I think that refers to the total energy each nucleus has when it's accelerated to that speed.

So, the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma first.

Let me compute gamma. Plugging in v=0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c².

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)
Let me compute 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right. So yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass number is 6, so the mass is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Wait
