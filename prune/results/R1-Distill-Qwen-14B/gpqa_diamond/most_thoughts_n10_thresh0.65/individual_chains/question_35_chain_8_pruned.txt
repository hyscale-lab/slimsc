Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it step by step.

The problem says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). So I guess I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix A_y.

Wait, but wait. What's c·S exactly? Oh right, matrix multiplication. So c is a scalar, so it multiplies each element of the matrix S.

So first, let me write down the matrix S. The first row is 0, -i. Second row is i, 0. So S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Then, c is h/(4π). So when I multiply c by S, each element gets multiplied by c. So the matrix A_y becomes:

[ 0   -i * (h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0 ]

So the matrix is:

0       (-i h)/(4π)
(i h)/(4π)    0

Now, to find the eigenvalues of A_y, I should calculate the trace and determinant. The eigenvalues λ satisfy the equation λ² - trace(A_y) λ + determinant(A_y) = 0.

Wait, but for a 2x2 matrix, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. Here, trace(A_y) is 0 + 0 = 0. The determinant is (0)(0) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ].

Let me compute the determinant. The (1,2) element is (-i h)/(4π), and the (2,1) element is (i h)/(4π). So the product is [ (-i)(i) ] * (h^2)/(16 π²). 

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. Because i squared is -1, so negative of that is 1. So the product is (1)*(h^2)/(16 π²) = h²/(16 π²).

Then the determinant is 0 - [ ( (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ] = - (h²/(16 π²)) * (-i^2) ? Wait, no. Wait, the determinant is (0)(0) - (top right)(bottom left). So determinant is - ( (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) = - [ ( (-i)(i) ) (h²/(4π)^2) ) ].

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is (1) because i² is -1, so negative of that is 1. So (-i)(i) = (-i²) = 1.

So the determinant is - [ (1) * (h²/(16 π²)) ) ] = - (h²/(16 π²)).

Wait
