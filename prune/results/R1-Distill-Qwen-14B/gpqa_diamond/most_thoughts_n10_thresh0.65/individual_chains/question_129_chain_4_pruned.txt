Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are four steps: reaction with HCN, then hydrogenation, followed by reaction with HNO2, and finally elimination to form E. Also, there are some hints provided, so I'll need to use them.

First, let's look at the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

Hmm, each step likely involves a specific type of reaction. Let's think about what these reactions could be.

Starting with step 1: A + HCN → B.
HCN is a nucleophile, often used in reactions with carbonyl groups. Maybe A is a ketone or aldehyde. When a carbonyl reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So B would be a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an ester, but I'm not sure. Wait, looking at the IR hints: A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, likely a ketone or maybe an ester.

Moving to step 2: B is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd to form C. Hydrogenation of what? If B is a cyanohydrin (which has a C≡N group), hydrogenation would probably reduce the nitrile group. Wait, nitriles (C≡N) upon hydrogenation (with H2 and catalyst like Pd) typically get reduced to amines (CH2NH2?), but I think in some cases, they can become alkanes. Alternatively, maybe the catalyst used is different. Wait, no, I think the hydrogenation of a nitrile (RCN) with H2 and Pd would reduce the triple bond to a single bond, giving RCH2NH2. But I'm not too confident. Alternatively, perhaps the cyanide group is converted to an amine group.

Wait, but let me think again. If B is a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol
