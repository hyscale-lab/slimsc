Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Let's see...

First, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using the formula d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ). Wait, wait, no, maybe I'm mixing something up. Oh right, actually, for a cubic crystal system, the formula is simpler because all angles are 90 degrees, but here the crystal is rhombohedral, so the angles aren't 90. So the formula for d in a rhombohedral system is a bit more complex.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos γ) )).

But wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, all the angles are equal, right? So α = β = γ. The problem states each is 30 degrees. So the formula should simplify a bit because cos α is the same for each term.

So the formula becomes d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2 cos α [ hk + hl + kl ] )

Wait, no, let's see. Let me re-examine the
