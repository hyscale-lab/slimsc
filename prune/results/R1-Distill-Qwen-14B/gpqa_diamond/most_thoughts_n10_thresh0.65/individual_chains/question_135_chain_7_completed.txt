Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I think the key point here is more about particle physics concepts rather than the specific Lagrangian, unless the Lagrangian tells me something else.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, that looks a bit like a Yukawa interaction. The Yukawa interaction usually couples a scalar field (like the Higgs) to fermions. So in this case, the boson X is interacting with fermions, similar to how the Higgs does. The Yukawa coupling would mean that the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. 

Now, the mass of the boson is 6 GeV. So, for X to decay into particles, the combined mass of the fermion pair must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in decay processes, the rest mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle.

So, I need to list all possible fermion pairs that can be produced where the sum of their masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Let me think about the masses of the known fermions.

The up quark (u) is the lightest, around 2 MeV or so. The down quark (d) is similar, maybe 4-5 MeV. The strange quark (s) is heavier, about 100 MeV. The charm quark (c) is around 1.5 GeV. The bottom quark (b) is about 4.5 GeV. The top quark (t) is way too heavy, around 173 GeV, so that's way above 6 GeV. So, any decay into top quarks is impossible because 2m_t would be way more than 6 GeV.

What about leptons? The electron (e) is about 0.5 MeV, muon (μ) is around 0.1 GeV (105 MeV), tau (τ) is about 1.77 GeV. So, for each lepton pair, 2m_lepton needs to be <= 6 GeV.

So let's list the possible fermion pairs:

Quarks (since they're produced as quark-antiquark pairs):

u and ū: 2m_u ≈ 4 MeV << 6 GeV. So yes.

d and d̄: same, 2m_d is about 8-10 MeV. Also yes.

s and s̄: 2m_s is about 200 MeV. Yes.

c and c̄: 2m_c is about 3 GeV. 3 GeV is less than 6 GeV, so yes.

b and b̄: 2m_b is about 9 GeV. Oh wait because m_b is around 4.5 GeV, so 9 GeV. That's more than 6 GeV. So b quarks can't be produced because 2m_b =9 GeV >6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄.

Wait, but wait! What about if the coupling is such that the mass term is (v + X), but perhaps the v is the vacuum expectation value, which could be significant? Wait, the Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. So the interaction is proportional to (v + X). So when X is at rest, the interaction term is (v + X). Hmm, but the mass comes from the Yukawa coupling, so the fermion mass is λ v / something? Or does the v contribute to the mass, and X is a fluctuation? I'm a bit confused, but perhaps this is just the interaction term, and the mass is generated elsewhere. Maybe the mass comes from the v term, and the X is a separate scalar.

Wait, maybe the boson X is neutral, so it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. So the decay X → f f̄ is allowed if 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So, for each fermion f, check if 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

Let me list the fermion masses:

Up quark (u): ~2 MeV → 2m_u =4 MeV → yes.

Down quark (d): ~5 MeV → 10 MeV → yes.

Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV → 200 MeV → yes.

Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV → 3 GeV → yes.

Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV → 9 GeV → no.

Top quark (t): way too big → no.

Leptons:

Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV → 1 MeV → yes.

Muon (μ): ~105 MeV → 210 MeV → yes.

Tau (τ): ~1.77 GeV → 3.54 GeV → yes.

So the possible fermion pairs are u, d, s, c, e, μ, and τ. Also, what about their antiquarks? Well, when you decay into a quark-antiquark pair, you can have any of these.

So, the possible decay channels are:

uū, dđ, sī, cċ, e+ e−, μ+ μ−, τ+ τ−.

Wait, but wait about the quarks—since they are confined, but in high-energy processes, they can be produced as virtual particles. So in the decay, the X boson can annihilate into any of these quark pairs as long as the mass is sufficient.

But the boson X is 6 GeV. So which quarks are allowed?

c is 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 GeV ≤6 GeV. So yes.

So, what about the options:

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b̄, sī, ūu, dđ, τ+τ−, e+ e−.

But wait, no b b̄ because 2m_b is 9 GeV>6 GeV. So option A is wrong.

Option B: X→c c̄, sī, ūu, dđ, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+ e−. So this includes c, which is okay. Does it include μ? Yes. So B includes all the possible except b and t, which are too heavy.

Wait, but what about d and s? They are included. So in the options, option B includes c, s, u, d, τ, mu, e. That seems correct.

Wait, but wait, the option B says "c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−". So all these are allowed.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, etc. But t is too heavy, so C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, which is too heavy, so D is incorrect.

So the correct options are those that include c, s, u, d, and the leptons (e, μ, τ), but exclude b and t.

So that's option B.

Wait, but wait the options—what about the X boson mass? Oh, in the Lagrangian, the interaction is given. So perhaps the boson X couples to all these fermions. So the possible decay products are all fermion pairs where 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So, the allowed decays are any of c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So looking back at the options, option B is the one that includes all these except for the bottom and top quarks.

Wait, option B is "c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-}". So that's correct.

Option A includes b, which is not allowed.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian suggests that \( X \) couples to fermions through a Yukawa-like interaction, allowing decays into fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay \( X \to f\bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the combined mass of the fermion pair \( 2m_f \) must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

The masses of the known fermions are approximately:

- \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_d \approx 5 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV}, \, m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_e \approx 0.5 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_\mu \approx 105 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_\tau \approx 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \).

Using these masses, the following fermion pairs are allowed:

- \( u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c}, e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^- \),
- \( b\bar{b} \) and \( t\bar{t} \) are excluded because \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \), both exceeding \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \).

Answer: B
