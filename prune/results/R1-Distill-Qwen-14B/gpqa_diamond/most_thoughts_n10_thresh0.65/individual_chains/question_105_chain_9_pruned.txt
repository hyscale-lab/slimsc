Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again carefully to understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, which have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the spots move into and out of our line of sight, causing brightness variations that look like those from an exoplanet transit. The question is asking, if the star didn't have these spots, what radius would a hypothetical exoplanet need to have to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve?

Hmm. So, the problem is comparing two scenarios: one where the brightness variation is due to star spots and another due to a planet transiting in front of the star. We need to find the planet's radius relative to the star's radius so that the light curve amplitude (the change in brightness) is the same in both cases.

Wait, I remember that when a planet transits a star, the brightness decrease is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula is (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius. So the amplitude of the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 multiplied by some factor, but I think that's the main term.

But in this case, the star has spots. The spots are cooler, so when they're on the side facing us, they make the star appear dimmer. When the star rotates, the spots come into view and then move away, causing the brightness to dip periodically.

So, the brightness variation due to the spots is a combination of the spot area and their temperature difference relative to the rest of the star. I think the change in brightness is calculated based on the difference in flux from the spotted area versus the unspotted area.

The filling factor is 20%, which I believe is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. But wait, the star's surface is a sphere, so the hemisphere's area is half the total surface area. So the total spotted area would be 0.2 * (4πRstar²)/2 = 0.2 * 2πRstar² = 0.4πRstar². Wait, no, maybe I should think differently. The filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. But the observation is that only one hemisphere is spotty. So maybe the total spotted area is 0.2 times the area of that hemisphere. So hemisphere area is 2πR², so spots are 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². But the star's total surface area is 4πR². So the fraction of the total surface covered by spots is (0.4πR²)/(4πR²) = 0.1, or 10%. Wait, but the problem says that one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So perhaps the area of the spots is 20% of a hemisphere's area.

So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So when the spots are on the far
