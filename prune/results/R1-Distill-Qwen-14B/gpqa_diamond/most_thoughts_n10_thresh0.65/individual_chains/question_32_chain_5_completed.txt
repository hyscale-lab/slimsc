Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li normally has 3 protons, right? So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that's like Li-6 because the atomic number is 3, and mass number is 3 + 3 =6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

The problem gives me multiple-choice options, and I need to calculate the correct energy. I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the gamma factor. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Since the speed is 0.96c, that's pretty close to the speed of light. So gamma should be significant.

First, I need to find gamma. Let's compute v/c: 0.96. So v squared over c squared is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 minus that is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So 1 divided by 0.28 equals approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, the energy of the particle is given by gamma times m c squared. Wait, but wait, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 ion. The mass number is 6, so the mass should be approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). But wait, I should get the exact mass in kilograms or in terms of energy using the conversion factors.

Wait, the atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So 6 u would be 6 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 9.9632e-27 kg. But wait, I think I remember that for these kinds of calculations, people often use the rest energy in MeV or GeV. Because 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 u would be 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

So the rest energy is 5.589 GeV. Then the total energy is gamma times that. Gamma is approximately 3.5714. So 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV = ?

Let me calculate that. 3.5 * 5.589 is about 19.56 GeV. Then 0.0714 *5.589 is approximately 0.400 GeV. So total is around 19.96 GeV. Hmm, but wait, let me do it more accurately.

Alternatively, let me compute 3.5714 * 5.589:

3 *5.589 =16.767
0.5714 *5.589: Let's compute that. 0.5 *5.589 is 2.7945, and 0.0714 *5.589 is approximately 0.400. So total 2.7945 +0.4=3.1945. So 16.767 +3.1945=19.9615 GeV. So about 19.96 GeV.

But wait, the options given don't have 19.96. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 18.475 GeV
B) 23.069 GeV
C) 20.132 GeV
D) 21.419 GeV

Hmm, none of them match 19.96. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. My initial calculation for gamma was 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) which is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784). Wait, 0.0784 is 784/10000, which is (28^2)/(100^2), so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.571428571... So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is not exactly 6 u. Let me think. Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.013 u. Oh, right! Because in reality, the mass isn't exactly 6 u. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

The atomic weight of Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but since it's a nuclide, Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.013 u. Oh wait, actually, the exact value is 6.013 u. So that's more precise.

So the rest mass m is 6.013 u. So the rest energy is 6.013 * 931.5 MeV. Let me compute that.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV, 0.013 *931.5 ≈12.11 MeV. So total is 5589 +12.11=5601.11 MeV, which is 5.60111 GeV.

Now, multiply by gamma: 3.571428 *5.60111 GeV.

Calculating 3.571428 *5.60111.

Let me compute step by step:

3 *5.60111 =16.80333

0.571428 *5.60111.

0.5 *5.60111=2.800555

0.071428 *5.60111 ≈0.400.

Adding them: 2.800555 +0.400=3.200555

So total is 16.80333 +3.200555 =20.003885 GeV.

So approximately 20.004 GeV. Now looking at the options, option C is 20.132, which is close but a bit higher. Hmm. Wait, maybe I need to compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, let me compute gamma again. Gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).

(0.96)^2 = 0.9216

1 - 0.9216=0.0784

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So 1/0.28=3.5714285714.

But perhaps I should use more precise calculations for the rest mass energy. Let me get the exact value of Li-6's mass.

Looking up the exact mass of Li-6: I think it's approximately 6.0131529 u.

So m = 6.0131529 u.

Rest energy E_rest = m c² = 6.0131529 u * 931.494 MeV/u.

Calculating that: 6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV, 0.0131529 *931.494 ≈12.23 MeV.

Total E_rest = 5588.964 +12.23 =5601.194 MeV =5.601194 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714285714.

So E_total = gamma * E_rest.

3.5714285714 *5.601194 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.5714285714 × 5.601194:

Break it down:

3 ×5.601194 =16.803582

0.5714285714 ×5.601194.

Compute 0.5 ×5.601194 =2.800597

0.0714285714 ×5.601194:

0.0714285714 is approximately 1/14. So 5.601194 /14 = approx 0.400085.

So 2.800597 +0.400085 =3.200682.

Total E_total =16.803582 +3.200682 =20.004264 GeV.

So approximately 20.004 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 20.132 GeV. But that's about 0.13 GeV higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for gamma. Let me compute 0.96^2 precisely.

0.96 * 0.96 = (96/100)^2 = 9216/10000 = 0.9216 exactly. So 1 -0.9216=0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714.

Wait, maybe the exact gamma is 3.571428571428571... but perhaps I should use more decimal places for gamma and the rest mass to get a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the approximation for gamma when v is 0.96c, so gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact calculation with more precise gamma. Alternatively, maybe I should compute gamma accurately.

Hmm, maybe I should compute gamma using more precise calculation. Let me compute 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).

Compute (0.96)^2: 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714... So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass. Maybe Li-6 is 6.013 u, but perhaps I should use a more precise value. Let me double-check.

The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.0131529 u. So the rest energy is 6.0131529 * 931.494 MeV.

Calculating that:

6 *931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.0131529 *931.494 = Let's compute that more accurately.

0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.0031529 *931.494 = let's compute 0.003 *931.494=2.794482; 0.0001529*931.494≈0.14226.

So total is 9.31494 +2.794482 +0.14226≈12.251682 MeV.

So E_rest =5588.964 +12.251682 =5601.215682 MeV =5.601215682 GeV.

Now, multiply by gamma: 3.5714285714 * 5.601215682.

Let me do this multiplication precisely.

3.5714285714 ×5.601215682.

Breaking it down:

3 ×5.601215682 =16.803647046

0.5714285714 ×5.601215682.

Compute 0.5 ×5.601215682 =2.800607841.

0.0714285714 ×5.601215682.

Compute 5.601215682 ×0.0714285714.

0.0714285714 is 1/14, so 5.601215682 ÷14 ≈0.400086834.

So 2.800607841 +0.400086834 =3.200694675.

Adding to the previous part:16.803647046 +3.200694675 =20.004341721 GeV.

So approximately 20.00434 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV. But I'm getting 20.004, which is not among the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in computation. Alternatively, perhaps the nucleus is different.

Wait, the problem says the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has 3 protons, so 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider the mass as the atomic mass, which includes electrons. Wait, no, because in heavy ion colliders, they typically use bare nuclei, so the electrons are not included. So the mass of Li-6 nucleus is 6.013 u as I used.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about protons or something else. No, the problem states it's a nucleus X, which is Li with 3 neutrons, so it's Li-6.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of the rest mass. Let me compute the rest mass accurately.

Wait, 6.0131529 u × 931.494 MeV/u.

Let me compute this precisely.

Compute 6.0131529 ×931.494.

6 ×931.494 =5588.964.

0.0131529 ×931.494 = Let's compute it exactly.

0.0131529 =131529e-7.

But perhaps a better approach is:

0.0131529 *931.494.

Compute 0.01 *931.494=9.31494.

0.0031529 *931.494.

Compute 0.003 *931.494=2.794482.

0.0001529 *931.494=0.14226.

So sum is 9.31494 +2.794482=12.109422, plus 0.14226 gives 12.251682 MeV.

So total E_rest=5588.964 +12.251682=5601.215682 MeV=5.601215682 GeV.

Now, 3.5714285714 ×5.601215682.

Let me compute this step by step.

3.5714285714 ×5.601215682 = ?

Using a calculator approach:

3.5714285714 ×5.601215682.

= (3 + 0.5714285714) ×5.601215682.

= 3×5.601215682 + 0.5714285714×5.601215682.

3 ×5.601215682 =16.803647046.

0.5714285714 ×5.601215682.

Let me compute 0.5 ×5.601215682 =2.800607841.

0.0714285714 ×5.601215682.

Which is 5.601215682 × (1/14) = approx 0.400086834.

So 2.800607841 + 0.400086834 =3.200694675.

Adding that to 16.803647046 gives 16.803647046 +3.200694675=20.004341721 GeV.

So approximately 20.0043 GeV.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV. Hmm, so where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using a more precise value. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, v = 0.96c.

So beta = v/c =0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the exact mass of 6.0131529 u.

Wait, 6.0131529 u ×931.494 MeV/u = let me compute it with more precision.

6.0131529 ×931.494.

Compute 6 ×931.494=5588.964.

0.0131529 ×931.494= Let's compute 0.01 ×931.494=9.31494.

0.0031529 ×931.494:

Compute 0.003 ×931.494=2.794482.

0.0001529 ×931.494= approx 0.14226.

So 0.0031529 ×931.494=2.794482 +0.14226=2.936742.

So 0.0131529 ×931.494=9.31494 +2.936742=12.251682 MeV.

So E_rest=5588.964 +12.251682=5601.215682 MeV=5.601215682 GeV.

Now, E_total = gamma × E_rest =3.5714285714 ×5.601215682.

Let me compute this multiplication precisely.

3.5714285714 ×5.601215682.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.601215682.

0.6 ×3.5714285714=2.142857143.

0.001215682 ×3.5714285714 ≈0.004333333.

So 2.142857143 +0.004333333=2.147190476.

So total E_total=17.857142857 +2.147190476=20.004333333 GeV.

Hmm, still around 20.004 GeV.

Wait, none of the options match. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Hmm. 20.004 is closest to option C:20.132, but there's a difference of about 0.128 GeV. That seems significant. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Maybe the question is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy? Oh wait, the problem says "energy of the nucleus", which is usually the total energy, including rest mass. But perhaps it's the kinetic energy.

Let me think: Kinetic energy K is (gamma-1) m c².

So if I compute K, it would be (3.5714285714 -1) *5.601215682 GeV.

Gamma minus 1 is 2.5714285714.

2.5714285714 *5.601215682 GeV.

2.5714285714 ×5 =12.857142857.

2.5714285714 ×0.601215682:

0.6 ×2.5714285714=1.542857143.

0.001215682 ×2.5714285714≈0.003125.

So 1.542857143 +0.003125≈1.545982.

So K≈12.857142857 +1.545982≈14.403125 GeV.

Then the total energy would be rest energy plus kinetic energy:5.601215682 +14.403125≈20.004 GeV. So same as before.

But that's not one of the options. Unless I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma using more precise method. Let me compute gamma again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the exact formula for gamma when v=0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.5714285714.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise calculation of gamma. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of beta=0.96, so perhaps gamma is higher. Wait, let me compute it using more precise steps.

Wait, 0.96^2 =0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

Wait, maybe the rest mass is in a different unit, like considering the nucleus as a proton plus neutrons? No, the problem says it's a Li-6 nucleus, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so mass is 6 u.

Wait, maybe the actual mass is 6.0131529 u, which is what I used. So that seems correct.

Hmmm. I'm getting approximately 20.004 GeV, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.128 GeV higher than my calculation. Could I have made an error in the rest mass? Let me see. Maybe the rest mass is 6.0131529 u, which is correct, but perhaps I should calculate with more precise gamma.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects using the relativistic energy formula E = gamma m c², but using more precise values.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the speed is given as 0.96c, but the nucleus is moving in the lab frame, and the energy is the total energy. So I think my approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately using more decimal places.

Let me compute gamma using the exact formula.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

No error there. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the rest energy calculation.

Wait, 6.0131529 u ×931.494 MeV/u.

Compute 6.0131529 ×931.494.

Let me compute this using a calculator-like approach.

6.0131529 *931.494.

Compute 6 ×931.494=5588.964.

0.0131529 ×931.494.

Compute:

0.01 ×931.494=9.31494.

0.0031529 ×931.494 = ?

Compute 0.003 ×931.494=2.794482.

0.0001529 ×931.494= 0.14226.

So 0.0031529 ×931.494=2.794482 + 0.14226=2.936742.

So 0.0131529 ×931.494=9.31494 +2.936742=12.251682 MeV.

So E_rest=5588.964 +12.251682=5601.215682 MeV=5.601215682 GeV.

Then, E_total=3.5714285714 ×5.601215682.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more precisely.

3.5714285714 ×5.601215682 ≈ ?

Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×5.601215682 using precise multiplication.

3.5714285714 ×5.601215682.

Using a calculator:

= (3 + 0.5714285714) ×5.601215682

= 3×5.601215682 + 0.5714285714×5.601215682

3×5.601215682 =16.803647046.

0.5714285714 ×5.601215682.

Compute 0.5×5.601215682=2.800607841.

0.0714285714 ×5.601215682.

Compute 5.601215682 ×0.0714285714.

0.0714285714 is approximately 5/70.

Wait, 5.601215682 × (5/70) =5.601215682 ×0.0714285714≈0.400086834.

So 0.5714285714 ×5.601215682=2.800607841 +0.400086834≈3.200694675.

So total E_total=16.803647046 +3.200694675=20.004341721 GeV.

Hmm, same result. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation without considering the exact mass.

Wait, let me try using m=6 u, so E_rest=5.589 GeV.

Gamma=3.5714285714.

So E_total=3.5714285714 ×5.589 GeV.

3 ×5.589=16.767.

0.5714285714 ×5.589.

0.5 ×5.589=2.7945.

0.0714285714 ×5.589≈0.400 GeV.

So 2.7945 +0.400=3.1945.

Total E_total=16.767 +3.1945=20.0015 GeV.

Still around 20 GeV. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the rest mass is 6.0131529 u, but when calculating, I should carry more decimal points.

Wait, maybe I should do the multiplication precisely.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×5.601215682 GeV.

3.5714285714 ×5.601215682 = ?

Let me use a calculator approach, perhaps using the exact steps.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×5.601215682.

3.5714285714 ×5 = 17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.601215682.

Compute 3.5714285714 ×0.6 =2.142857143.

3.5714285714 ×0.001215682.

Compute 3.5714285714 ×0.001 =0.0035714285714.

3.5714285714 ×0.000215682=approx 0.0007714285714.

So total is 0.0035714285714 + 0.0007714285714=0.004342857143.

So 3.5714285714 ×0.601215682=2.142857143 +0.004342857143=2.147200000 GeV.

So total E_total=17.857142857 +2.147200000=20.004342857 GeV.

Hmm, same result. So I'm confident that the correct energy is approximately 20.004 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using a different value for the speed or another factor.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy, not the total energy. But I've already computed the kinetic energy as about 14.4 GeV, which would make the total energy around 20 GeV, which is the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options once more.

Wait, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.128 GeV higher than my calculation. Could it be that I made a mistake in the gamma calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should recompute gamma with more precise calculation.

gamma =1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).

Let me compute 0.96^2 =0.9216.

1 -0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mass is in atomic mass units, but I should use the exact value in kilograms. Let me try that.

The mass of Li-6 is 6.0131529 u. 1 u =1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m=6.0131529 ×1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Compute that:

6.0131529 ×1.66053906660e-27 = ?

6 ×1.66053906660e-27 =9.9632344e-27 kg.

0.0131529 ×1.66053906660e-27 = approx 2.186e-29 kg.

So m ≈9.9632344e-27 +2.186e-29 =approx 9.985094e-27 kg.

Now, E_rest= m c².

c=3e8 m/s.

c²=9e16 m²/s².

E_rest=9.985094e-27 kg ×9e16 m²/s² =8.9865846e-10 J.

Now, converting Joules to GeV.

1 eV=1.60218e-19 J.

1 GeV=1e9 eV=1.60218e-10 J.

So E_rest=8.9865846e-10 J / 1.60218e-10 J/GeV = approx 5.602 GeV.

So same as before.

So, E_total=3.5714285714 ×5.602 GeV≈20.004 GeV.

Hmm, same result.

Perhaps the intended answer is option C:20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the computation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.5714285714 ×5.601215682 more accurately.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×5.601215682:

= (3 + 0.5714285714) ×5.601215682

= 3 ×5.601215682 + 0.5714285714 ×5.601215682

3 ×5.601215682 =16.803647046.

0.5714285714 ×5.601215682 = ?

Let me compute this precisely:

0.5714285714 ×5.601215682 = ?

0.5 ×5.601215682 =2.800607841.

0.0714285714 ×5.601215682 = ?

Compute 5.601215682 × 0.0714285714.

Let me compute this as:

5.601215682 × (1/14) = ?

5.601215682 ÷14 = approximately 0.400086834.

So 0.5714285714 ×5.601215682 = 2.800607841 +0.400086834 =3.200694675.

Adding to 16.803647046: 16.803647046 +3.200694675 =20.004341721 GeV.

Same result.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 20.004 GeV, but none of the options match. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nucleus is not Li-6, but another isotope. Wait, the problem says Li with 3 neutrons. Li normally has 3 protons. So 3 protons +3 neutrons is Li-6. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem uses the rest mass of a proton and neutron separately. Let me think: a Li-6 nucleus consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u.

So mass of Li-6 would be 3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008665) =3*(1.007276+1.008665) =3*(2.015941)=6.047823 u.

Wait, wait! That's different from what I previously thought. Earlier, I thought Li-6's mass is about 6.013 u, but if I compute it as 3 protons and 3 neutrons, I get 6.047823 u.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the actual mass of Li-6 is less than 6 u. So perhaps this approach is incorrect. Because in reality, the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to binding energy.

Ah, right, that's the case. The actual mass is less than the sum of protons and neutrons because of mass defect (binding energy). So using the sum of individual masses would give a higher value. So my initial approach was correct to use the exact mass of Li-6 as 6.0131529 u.

So that's correct.

So I'm confident that the correct answer should be around 20 GeV, but the options don't have it. So perhaps the intended answer is option C:20.132 GeV, perhaps considering more precise values.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation gives a slightly higher value. Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×5.601215682 GeV with more precise steps.

3.5714285714 ×5.601215682.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×5.601215682.

Let me use the exact multiplication:

3.5714285714 ×5.601215682

= (3 + 0.5 + 0.07 + 0.0014285714) ×5.601215682.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to break it down into more parts.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that my calculation is correct and that the intended answer is option C, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects the use of the relativistic kinetic energy formula, which is K = (gamma -1)mc². But in any case, the earlier approach should give the correct total energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise decimal places.

Wait, let me compute 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)) using a calculator.

I can compute 1 -0.96^2=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma=3.5714285714.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the conversion from u to GeV. Let me compute 6.0131529 u ×931.494 MeV/u again.

6.0131529 ×931.494 = ?

Compute 6 ×931.494=5588.964.

0.0131529 ×931.494.

Compute 0.01 ×931.494=9.31494.

0.0031529 ×931.494= ?

0.003×931.494=2.794482.

0.0001529×931.494=0.14226.

So 0.0031529 ×931.494=2.794482 +0.14226=2.936742.

So 0.0131529 ×931.494=9.31494 +2.936742=12.251682 MeV.

So E_rest=5588.964 +12.251682=5601.215682 MeV=5.601215682 GeV.

Same as before.

So I'm confident that the correct answer is approximately 20.004 GeV, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4", so perhaps the answer should be 20.132 GeV, which is option C, but why?

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.98c instead of 0.96c, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately. Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise square roots.

Wait, perhaps the sqrt(0.0784) is not exactly 0.28. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

Wait, 0.0784 is 784/10000.

sqrt(784)=28, sqrt(10000)=100. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So no error there.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Since my calculation leads me to approximately 20.004 GeV, and the options don't have that, perhaps I should consider that option C is the closest, but that would be a guess. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the problem uses the rest mass in a different way.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the nucleus is moving relativistically, and the energy is given per nucleon. No, the problem states the energy of the nucleus, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the exact value of gamma.

Wait, another way to compute gamma: gamma = (1 - beta²)^-0.5.

With beta=0.96.

(1 - 0.96²) =0.0784.

So gamma=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.5714285714.

No error there.

I think I've done everything possible. Given the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV. But according to my calculations, the correct answer isn't listed. However, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rest mass using 6.0131529 u, and then compute gamma as 3.5714285714, leading to 20.004 GeV. But since this isn't an option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass of a single nucleon, not the entire nucleus. No, that can't be because the nucleus is Li-6, which has a larger mass.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe the problem is using the rest mass of a proton multiplied by the number of nucleons.

Wait, the mass of Li-6 is 6.0131529 u. So the rest energy is 6.0131529 ×931.494 MeV=5.601215 GeV.

Multiply by gamma=3.5714285714: 3.5714285714 ×5.601215=20.004 GeV.

So I think I'm confident that the correct answer should be around 20 GeV, but the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option C:20.132 GeV, considering a slight miscalculation or rounding in the problem setup.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the speed is given as 0.96c, but the calculation is done using v = 0.96c, but perhaps I should calculate using beta = 0.96.

No, that's the same as what I did.

Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options, but since I have to choose from the given options, and my calculation is 20.004 GeV, which is closest to option C:20.132 GeV. But the difference is about 0.128 GeV, which is a significant difference. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the gamma calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using the exact formula with more precise beta.

Wait, beta=0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216.

Then, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.5714285714.

No error there.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects using gamma as (1 - beta^2)^(-1/2) but with more precise values beyond 0.96.

Wait, perhaps beta is 0.96, but the calculation of gamma is done more precisely.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28=3.5714285714. So no error.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the options, I'll have to choose the closest one, which is option C:20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy equations. The nucleus in question is Li-6, which has a mass of approximately 6.0131529 atomic mass units (u). The rest energy of the nucleus is calculated as:

\[
E_{\text{rest}} = m c^2 = 6.0131529 \, \text{u} \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV/u} = 5.601215682 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\)) is determined using the relativistic formula:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]

Given \(v = 0.96c\), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.0784, \quad \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} = 3.5714285714.
\]

The total energy of the nucleus is then:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma E_{\text{rest}} = 3.5714285714 \times 5.601215682 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Breaking this calculation into steps:

\[
3.5714285714 \times 5.601215682 = 20.004341721 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus, the total energy is approximately \(20.004 \, \text{GeV}\). However, none of the provided options exactly match this value. The closest option is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which is slightly higher than the calculated value. Given the precision requirement of \(1 \times 10^{-4}\), the discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

After verifying the calculations and ensuring no errors in the relativistic energy formula or rest mass conversion, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: C**
