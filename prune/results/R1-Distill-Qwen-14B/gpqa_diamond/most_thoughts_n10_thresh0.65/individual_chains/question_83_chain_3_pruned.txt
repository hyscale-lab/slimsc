Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, okay, let's think this through. I'm a bit rusty on my titration calculations, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

The question says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, and each gives two pH values.

First, I should figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Oh right, when you dilute a solution, you can use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So, initial volume V1 is 20 cm³, and the initial concentration M1 is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Let me compute that: (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.0125 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.0125 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when diluted, it dissociates more, but for the purpose of initial calculations, I think the initial concentration is 0.0125 M. Right.

Now, the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. So the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Let me calculate the initial moles of acetic acid. Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Oh wait, wait, wait. No, wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 L. So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol of acetic acid. Since we're diluting with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³, so when we titrate, the moles of NaOH needed are same as the moles of acetic acid, because it's a 1:1 reaction. So at equivalence point, moles NaOH = 0.001 mol.

What's the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence? The concentration is 0.1 M, so volume V = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question asks about 25% titration. So that's 25% of the equivalence point volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Now, for the two parts: pH at 25% titration and pH at equivalence.

Let's tackle the 25% titration first.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So, the moles of acetic acid that have reacted are 0.00025 mol, but wait, initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol (from 20 cm³ * 0.05 M). So after reaction, moles of CH3COOH left are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO^- formed (from the reaction) are 0.00025 mol.

But wait, when you mix the solution, the total volume changes. Initially, after dilution, the volume was 40 cm³. Adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH makes the total volume 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations at this point are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is given by -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is about 1.85 * 10^-5. The log of 1.85 is approx 0.267, so pKa is 4.733 (since 5 - 0.267 ≈ 4.733).

Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let's see:

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → log(5.405e4) → since 1e-5 is 5, so
