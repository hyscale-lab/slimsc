Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what I can do. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI... Oh wait, I think that's related to the hydrolysis of a nitrile or maybe some kind of substitution reaction. Or wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or elimination? Or perhaps it's a reaction involving a carbonyl group. I'm a bit confused, but let's take it step by step.

First, let's look at the spectral data to figure out what Compound X is. The IR and NMR will give me clues about the functional groups and structure.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are in the ranges 3400–2500 cm-¹, which is the region for O-H and N-H stretches. The 1720 cm-¹ peak is probably a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester). The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-¹ suggest aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound likely has a benzene ring.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR signals:
- 10.5 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 1H. That's a strong signal. Could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Or maybe it's an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm. The broad singlet suggests it's exchanging, like a -OH group, but in this case, it's a 1H. Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde with a broad peak? Or perhaps an acidic proton like a phenolic OH? But wait, the integration is 1H. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would make sense because the -COOH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm and broad. But wait, the next peak is at 8.0 ppm, which is typical for aromatic protons, maybe in a para-substituted benzene. Let me think.

The 8.0 ppm is a doublet (d) integrating for 2H. Then 7.2 ppm is also a doublet (d, 2H). So in the aromatic region, two doublets each integrating to 2H would suggest a para-substituted benzene. So perhaps it's a para-disubstituted benzene, like with two substituents opposite each other.

Looking at the 2.9 ppm multiplet (m, 1H). That's probably a CH group adjacent to something, maybe a CH₂ or CH₃. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (m, 2H) could be another CH₂ group. The 1.4 ppm doublet (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH, like in an ethyl group or isopropyl or something. The 0.9 ppm triplet (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, maybe in an ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with substituents. Let's think about the substituents. The IR has a 1720 cm-¹ peak, which could be a carbonyl. If it's a benzene ring with a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone or an ester. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm peak is a bit high for an aldehyde. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. But then, where is the carbonyl in the NMR? Carboxylic acids have broad peaks because of hydrogen bonding, but in the IR, the 1720 would be the carbonyl. Wait, but wait, in the NMR, if it's a carboxylic acid, the -COOH proton would be broad around 10-12 ppm, which matches the 10.5 ppm peak.

So perhaps the structure is a para-substituted benzene with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent. Let's see. The aromatic protons: two doublets suggest that the substituents are in the para positions. Wait, no, actually, in para substitution, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, you might have two sets of doublets. Wait, but in this case, there are two substituents: the carboxylic acid and another group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to the benzene, such as a benzaldehyde. But then the 10.5 ppm would be the aldehyde proton. But I thought that's a higher shift than typical. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. But wait, ketones
