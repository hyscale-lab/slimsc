Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem gives some parameters: their radii, masses, wavelengths at which they appear brightest, and their radial velocities.

Wait, the first thing I remember is that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, if we can find the temperatures, we can find the luminosity ratio.

The problem says that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Oh, that must relate to their temperatures. I think the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ is inversely proportional to T. So, λ_1 = λ_2 implies T_1 = T_2.

Wait, but wait. In the question, it's the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest. So both are at the same λ_max, so same T. So temperature is the same for both stars.

So, since T is the same, the luminosity depends only on radius squared. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴. If T is same, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

The problem states R1 is 1.5 times R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5. Then, (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have that as the answer. Wait, the options are A) ~2.25, which would be that. But wait, the problem says that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. So 2.25 would be the factor.

But wait, I must have missed something. Let me read the problem again.

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Oh right, radial velocity could affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Wait, but if the stars are moving, their observed wavelengths
