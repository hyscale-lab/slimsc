Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities of two Earth-like planets. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says that researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. They're using the transit method, which means they're looking for when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness.

Both planets have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we already know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But both have the same mass, so that's not a differentiating factor. 

The orbital period is key here. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2 takes, say, 100 days to orbit, Planet_1 takes about 33 days. Shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because closer planets orbit faster due to stronger gravity.

Now, the host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, same radius but different masses. That probably means Planet_1's star is more massive but hasn't expanded into a giant yet, whereas Planet_2's star is slightly evolved but same size. Hmm, I'm not sure how that affects the transit probability directly, but maybe it's important for other factors.

Transit probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the alignment of the orbit. Since both are Earth-like, their sizes are similar, so the main factors are the star's size and the orbital inclination. But we're assuming we're looking for maximum probability, so perhaps the alignment is best for one over the other.

Wait, but what determines the probability of a transit? I think it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but I'm not quite sure. Or maybe it's about whether the planet's orbit is edge-on enough. 

Wait, transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our viewpoint. The probability is higher if the star is larger relative to the planet's orbit. Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think deeper.

The transit probability is calculated as (R_star / a_planet) * (1/(sqrt(1-e²))) ), but since both have circular orbits, e=0, so it simplifies. So the probability is (R_star / a_planet). Because for a circular orbit, the probability is (R_s / a_p), where R_s is star's radius and a_p is semi-major axis (which is the orbital radius for a circular orbit).

Wait, no, wait. The transit probability formula I remember is (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, we can approximate it as R_star / a_planet. So the probability is proportional to R_star / a.

Wait, but a_planet is the semi-major axis. The semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. Kepler's law says that (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(M_star + M_planet))/(4π²). Since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, M_star ≈ M. So a^3 is proportional to M * P². So a = [M * P²]^(1/3). 

So, a_planet_1 = [
