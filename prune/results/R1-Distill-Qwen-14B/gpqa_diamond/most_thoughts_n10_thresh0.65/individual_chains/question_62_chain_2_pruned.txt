Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target molecule. The name suggests a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which I think is a cyclohexyl group attached to a methylene group, which in turn is attached to a hydroxyl group. And then there's a carbaldehyde group on the cyclohexane. Wait, maybe I should draw it out.

Wait, wait. 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main cyclohexane has a carbaldehyde group (CHO) at position 1. Also, at position 1, there's a substituent which is a methyl group. This methyl is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent that's a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl and also a CHO group.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the numbering is different. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH group, but that's attached to the cyclohexane ring which also has a CHO group at the same carbon? No, that might not make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula part might help. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the parent chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which suggests a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group attached. The substituent at position 1 is the (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So position 1 of the cyclohexane has both the CHO and the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH) group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl), but attached where?

Alternatively, maybe it
