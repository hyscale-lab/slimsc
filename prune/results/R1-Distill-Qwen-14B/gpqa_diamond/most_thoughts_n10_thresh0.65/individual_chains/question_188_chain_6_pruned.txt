Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal system is one of the seven crystal systems. It's kind of like a cube that's been stretched or compressed along the body diagonal. The structure has all sides equal, but the angles between them are not 90 degrees, right?

The question gives me some parameters: the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. Wait, no, actually, the angles are each 30 degrees. So all three angles are 30 degrees. And they're asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

I remember that the interplanar distance d_hkl is calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the lattice parameter and the Miller indices. Oh wait, but this is a rhombohedral system, which is a special case. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system depends on the type of lattice.

Wait, rhombohedral is a type of Bravais lattice. For a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a, b, c, but in this case, since it's rhombohedral, I think a = b = c. Because in a rhombohedral system, all edges are equal, and the angles are same, except maybe in some cases.

Wait, no, actually, wait. In a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is defined by a, b, c all equal, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all the
