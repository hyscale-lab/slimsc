Okay, so I have this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the question is about a star whose surface temperature changes when spots are present. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question deals with the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When there are no spots, the ratio is something, and when there are spots, it decreases. They want the factor by which this ratio changes.

Wait, so when there are spots, the overall effective temperature is lower. But in the photosphere, which is where the light is emitted, the spots probably are cooler regions. So the star's surface isn't all at 5500 K; some parts are cooler (spots) and others are at 6000 K. But the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% is covered. Hmm, but how does that affect the photosphere's temperature structure? Or maybe the effective temperature is just the average.

But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The equation is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Here, n is the number of atoms in each level, g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy), E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The question says that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, the ratio is lower. So without spots, the ratio is higher. We need to find the ratio of the ratio (n2/n1) when there's no spot (T=6000 K) to when there is spot (T=5500 K). 

Wait, but wait. The star's Teff is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. But the photosphere itself—does each region (spot and non-spot) have its own T? Or is the effective temp an average? Hmm, perhaps the problem is simplifying things. 

But maybe the way to approach this is to consider that the star's photosphere as a whole has an effective temperature of 5500 K when spots are present. So when the spots are present, the overall T is 5500 K, and when not, it's 6000 K. So the ratio n2/n1 is being compared at these two temperatures.

Wait, but the problem states: when the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So the photosphere's effective temperature changes. But the question is about the photosphere when spots are present.

Wait, no—the problem says, "in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in
