Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, the question is about identifying compound E through a series of reactions. There are several steps, so let's go through them one by one.

First, let's outline the reactions given:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are some hints provided as well. Let's look at them.

Hint a says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting a ylide with an aldehyde or ketone. So, if A reacts with a ylide to form that compound, A must be a carbonyl compound, either an aldehyde or ketone.

Looking at the product of the Wittig reaction: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The "ylidene" group is a CH2 group attached to the cyclopentane. Wait, no, the structure is 4-(propan-2-ylidene), which would be a substituent on the cyclopentane. The structure is cyclopentane with substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups and at position 4 as a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Actually, the ylidene group is a substituted double bond. For example, a methylene group is CH2=, but when it's propan-2-ylidene, it's CH2-C(CH3)=. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)= attached to the cyclopentane.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, the ylidene group is a substituent where the point of attachment is a double bond. So, the structure would be:

The cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. At position 4, there's a substituent which is a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would be a substituent where the group is CH2-C(CH3)=. Or perhaps it's a group like (CH2)2C= attached to the ring.

But wait, the product after Wittig reaction would have a double bond. So, the starting material A must have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) which reacts with the ylide to form the alkene.

So, when A reacts with the ylide, it forms an alkene. So A must have a carbonyl group adjacent to the position where the ylide's R groups will attach.

Wait, but the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, the ylide probably adds to the carbonyl
