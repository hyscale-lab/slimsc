Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, which corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by operators, and their eigenvalues correspond to possible measurement outcomes. So, the operator P here must have components P_x, P_y, P_z, each given with their respective matrices.

Wait, the problem gives me each component of P as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down to visualize better.

P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix:
[0 1]
[1 0]

P_y is (ħ/2) times:
[0 -i]
[i 0]

And P_z is (ħ/2) times:
[1 0]
[0 -1]

So, each of these is a Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So that's a good start.

Now, the operator P here is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, any direction in x-z plane would have angles θ and φ. Well, since it's in the x-z plane, the direction doesn't involve the y-component. So the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, no. Wait, no, in spherical coordinates, the direction vector is usually (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So φ must be 0 or π, but that would put it along the x or -x direction, but wait, perhaps I'm mixing up.

Wait, no. The x-z plane is the plane where y=0. So the direction could be any angle in this plane, meaning that the direction vector would have components in x and z, but not y. So, the direction can be represented as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Alternatively, θ could be from the x-axis. But I think in quantum mechanics, the direction is often given in terms of
