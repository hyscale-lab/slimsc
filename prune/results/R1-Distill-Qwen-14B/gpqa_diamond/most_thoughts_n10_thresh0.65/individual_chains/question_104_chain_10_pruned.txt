Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the main difference here is the measured Doppler shift in their spectral lines.

Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has 7 milliangstroms. Wait, so which planet causes a bigger shift? Oh, right, the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. A larger shift suggests a higher velocity. But wait, the RV method is more sensitive to the velocity amplitude, not the mass of the planet, because the velocity depends on the planet's mass and orbital period.

The formula I'm a bit rusty on. I think the RV semi-amplitude K is given by something like K = (v) which is proportional to ( (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) ... but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, more accurately, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (2Ï€ G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3
