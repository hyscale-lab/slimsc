Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data points are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters, so it's about really tiny distances, which makes sense for particles decaying quickly.

I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and velocity. The formula I think is distance = velocity * lifetime. Oh right, but first I need to find the lifetime of the meson.

Wait, the lifetime of a particle is given by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, right? The uncertainty in energy times the uncertainty in time is about ħ. So Γ is the width, which is like the uncertainty in energy (ΔE), so Γ ≈ ΔE. Then the lifetime τ is approximately ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the width Γ is actually the total decay width, which relates to the lifetime via Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, no, more accurately, the natural linewidth is Γ, and the lifetime τ is related by τ = ħ / Γ. So yeah, that's the relation.

But wait, I might be mixing things up. Let me recall: The decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. So that's correct.

So first, I need to compute τ, then find the velocity of the meson, and then multiply the two to get the distance.

But wait, what's the velocity here? The meson is produced with energy E_X, so I can calculate its velocity from that. Since the mass is given, I can find the relativistic velocity.

Hmm, the energy E is the total energy, so E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). Let's compute γ.

Wait, E is given as 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So E = 8 GeV, m c² = 1.2 GeV. Therefore, γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So approximately 6.6667.

Then, the velocity
