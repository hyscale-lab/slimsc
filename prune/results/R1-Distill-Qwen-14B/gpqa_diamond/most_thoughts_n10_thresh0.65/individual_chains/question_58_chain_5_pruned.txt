Okay, so I've got this question about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step. Let me start by recalling what regularization means. From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are the infinities that pop up in calculations, making the results non-physical. So the idea is to modify the theory in a way that these infinities are tamed, and then you remove the modification (like taking a limit) to get back to the original theory.

The question is asking which theory doesn't need this regularization when you go to high energies. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I know that string theory is a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity. It deals with things at very small scales, like the Planck scale. But wait, string theory is a quantum theory, right? So in quantum theories, you often get divergences which need regularization. But wait, maybe because it's a theory that incorporates gravity, perhaps it's free from some of the issues. Or maybe because in string theory, particles are extended objects, strings, which might lead to better behaved theories. I'm not too sure about this one.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, where the force between quarks becomes weaker at high energies (or short distances). But when you calculate loop diagrams in QCD, especially at lower energies, you get things like confinement and other non-perturbative effects. But does QCD require regularization? Well, all quantum field theories need some form of regularization when you're doing calculations because of the divergences. QCD is no exception. So B probably requires regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. But I remember that QED has issues with divergences, especially in calculations like the electron self-energy. These divergences led to the development of renormalization techniques, which are closely related to regularization. So QED definitely requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, this is the classical version, not the quantum one. Classical theories don't involve the same kind of divergences that quantum theories do. For example, in classical electromagnetism, you can have issues like the infinite self-energy of a point charge, but those are handled in
