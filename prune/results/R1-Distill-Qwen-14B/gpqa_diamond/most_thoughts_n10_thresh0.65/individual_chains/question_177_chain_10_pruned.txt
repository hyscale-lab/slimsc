Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down. 

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. But wait, the question is about luminosity, which I'm pretty sure relates to how bright they are, not their mass. Hmm, but maybe the mass isn't directly relevant here. The problem says that through spectroscopy, the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law. 

Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature of the black body. So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. Since both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Oh, interesting. So both stars have the same temperature. Wait, but why is that? I thought maybe if they're in a binary system or something, but no, the problem just states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So same temperature.

Now, the luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which is L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Here, R is the radius, T the temperature, and σ the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same T, and their radii are different, the luminosity depends on R squared.

Star_1 has R = 1.5 R_2. So the ratio of luminosities would be L1 / L2 = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, the T term is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. That would make option A the answer, around 2.25. 

Wait, but what about the radial velocities? The radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. How does that affect anything? Oh, wait, radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But if the star is moving, does that affect its observed luminosity? Hmm. I think the observed flux might depend on the velocity, but the problem says to compute luminosity assuming they radiate as black bodies. So perhaps the velocity doesn't directly affect the calculation of luminosity. Luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, not the observed flux. 

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me think. Luminosity is the total energy output per second. If the star is moving, does that change its actual energy output? No, because the star's intrinsic properties (radius, temperature) determine its luminosity. The velocity might affect the observed flux if we're considering Doppler shifting, but the question says to compute luminosity, which is an intrinsic property. So the radial velocity might not be relevant here. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. If a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, which would affect the observed wavelength. But the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, would that affect the star's observed temperature? Because blueshift would make it appear hotter, right? But the problem says that the peak wavelengths are the same, so the observed temperatures are the same. So perhaps the Doppler effect is already accounted for in the observed wavelength. 

Wait, but the problem states that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So perhaps they accounted for any Doppler shifts. So the λ_max they measured is the same, implying that the stars' temperatures, after considering any Doppler shifts, are the same. So I don't need to adjust the temperature based on the radial velocities because the λ_max already factors that in.

So maybe the radial velocities don't affect the calculation of the stars' intrinsic luminosities because the observed λ_max already accounts for Doppler shifts. Therefore, the luminosity ratio is simply (R1
