Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a operator along an arbitrary direction. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about a muon, but I think that's just a particle with the same quantum properties as an electron for this purpose. The operator is P, and we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The direction is arbitrary but lying in the x-z plane, so the direction vector n must be in the x-z plane. So n would be something like (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), wait no, wait. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the direction vector n can be expressed as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So φ would be 0 or π? Wait, no. Wait, if it's in the x-z plane, the angle φ is either 0 or π because the y-component is zero. So the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps? Or maybe (x, 0, z), where x² +z² =1. So the vector is along x and z, but not y.

The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, Pz. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix.

So, P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Because each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by a Pauli matrix.

Wait, let me think about the matrices:

Px matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], which is σ_x.

Py matrix is [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is σ_y.

Pz matrix is [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is σ_z.

So each component is (ħ/2) times the respective Pauli matrix. So the operator P is:

P = (ħ/2)(σ_x x + σ_y y + σ_z z) ?

Wait, more accurately, the operator P is P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z), where n is the direction vector. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y =0, so P becomes (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ
