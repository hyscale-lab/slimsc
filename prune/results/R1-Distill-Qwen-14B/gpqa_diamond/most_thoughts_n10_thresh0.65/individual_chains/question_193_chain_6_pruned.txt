Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, which are various powers of r.

Hmm, okay. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle at which the position of a star appears to shift when viewed from two points in space. The formula for distance in parsecs is d = 1 / plx. So, plx is inversely proportional to distance. So, if plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

Wait, so if the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, that means N is proportional to 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So substituting, N ∝ (d)^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5.

Wait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. N is proportional to 1/plx^5. But plx is 1/d, so 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So N is proportional to distance to the fifth power. 

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance. So I think that relates to the number density, like how many stars are there in a given volume as you go further out. Because if N is proportional to d^5, but volume increases with d^3, maybe the density changes differently.

Wait, maybe I should think about how the number of stars relates to the volume. The number of stars in a region can depend on the volume, but here it's given as a function of parallax, so perhaps the function is given in terms of a specific region, maybe a unit area, so it's like the number of stars per unit area per distance.

Wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so higher parallax means closer stars. But the number of stars is given as 1/plx^5. So as parallax decreases (stars are farther), N increases as 1/plx^5, which is (d)^5. So
