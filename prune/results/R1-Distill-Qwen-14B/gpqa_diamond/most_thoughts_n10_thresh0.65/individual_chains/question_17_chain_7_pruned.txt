Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution when we have a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium.

The problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. The K value, which I think is the formation constant, is 5x10^10. Oh wait, K for the complex formation is given, right? So K_Ca-EDTA = 5e10. The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that affecting the EDTA's protonation state. Oh, and the temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard conditions, so no need to adjust for temperature.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula here. So, the reaction when Ca²+ and EDTA form a complex. EDTA is usually in the Y^4- form when it's deprotonated. The complex formation would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (or some charge like that). But for the purpose of the calculation, maybe the stoichiometry is 1:1, so each Ca²+ binds one EDTA.

The key thing is that the formation constant K is given. K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction. So K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). But wait,
