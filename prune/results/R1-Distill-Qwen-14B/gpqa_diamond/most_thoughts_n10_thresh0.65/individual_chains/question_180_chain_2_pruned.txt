Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I get all the details right.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each particle has a charge of 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about any kinetic energy or motion-related stuff, just electric potential energy.

So 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system. The options are A to D, but I'm not going to look at them yet—I want to think it through.

Hmm, okay. So the setup is like this: one charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of those 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P where the 13th charge is fixed. But wait, since all the 12 are fixed at 2m from P, does that mean they're all equidistant from the fixed charge? So it's a symmetrical setup.

Wait a second, the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So I think I need to consider the electric potential energy of the system. Because in electrostatics, the potential energy is the work done to bring the charges together, and that's the energy stored.

So the formula for electric potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But when you have multiple charges, you have to consider all pairs because each pair contributes to the total potential energy. Oh right, the total potential energy U_total is the sum of the potential energy of each pair.

So in this case, there are 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the 13th. But also, the 12 charges are probably at some arrangement, but since they are constrained to stay at 2m from P, their mutual distances might not be specified. Hmm, but wait, the problem doesn't say anything about the distances between the 12 charges. So perhaps we're assuming that the 12 are arranged in a way that they are very far apart, or maybe their mutual interactions are negligible compared to their interaction with the central charge. That might not be the case, though. Oh wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the mutual interactions between the 12 charges are part of the system's energy as well.

Wait, but the 12 charges are identical and each has a charge of 2e. So each of them is a point charge. But since they are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but are they allowed to move relative to each other? The problem says they are "constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P." So I think that means each of the 12 is fixed on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m, but their positions on that sphere can vary. But for the minimum energy, I think
