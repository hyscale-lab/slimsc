Okay, so I have this question about crystallography and interplanar distances. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are important in things like X-ray diffraction. The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Oh wait, a rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh, wait, wait. No, wait, no. Wait, rhombohedral means it's a special case where the three lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, and the angles between them are all the same. So yeah, that makes sense. So a, b, c are all the same here.

The question gives the interatomic distance as 10 angstroms. Wait, wait. Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms along the lattice. So in a cubic system, that's the lattice parameter. But in a rhombohedral system, all a, b, c are equal, so in this case, a = b = c = 10 angstroms. Because the interatomic distance is the lattice parameter, right? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing some terms. Wait, the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms. So in a simple cubic structure, that's the lattice parameter. But in a rhombohedral structure, if it's a primitive lattice, the atoms are at the corners, but with rhombohedral cells, maybe the basis is different. Hmm, but in this question, perhaps the interatomic distance is given as the lattice parameter a, so a = 1
