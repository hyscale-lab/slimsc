Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y to produce some products. I need to figure out what X is and then determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Let me read the problem again. Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is also used similarly.

Hmm, I think I need to first figure out what X is. The violent reaction with Y suggests it's something like a halogen, maybe. Wait, but Y is a liquid. Let me thinkâ€”common liquid Y could be water, but wait, no, water is a liquid but when X reacts with it... Or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, Y could be something like concentrated sulfuric acid? No, wait, sulfuric acid is more of a liquid but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is a hydrocarbon, but that seems less likely.

Wait, when X reacts with Y, it releases gas W. W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule is something where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let me think: for a molecule, like H2O doesn't fit, but maybe NH3? No, but wait, a molecule like CO2 has 12 neutrons (assuming C-12) and 16 protons? No, that doesn't add up. Wait, wait, maybe it's CH4? No, that's four H with one C. Wait, wait, maybe the molecule is something like O2? No, because O has eight protons each, so O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons (each O has 8 neutrons in O-16). So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons total. Wait, that makes sense. Or maybe H2O, but that's not same number. Let me see:

Wait, the molecule W has same number of neutrons and protons. So for a molecule with a single atom, like O-16
