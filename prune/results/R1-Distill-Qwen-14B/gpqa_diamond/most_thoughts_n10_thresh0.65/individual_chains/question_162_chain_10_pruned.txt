Okay, so I have this metric given, and I need to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, let's start by recalling what a pseudosphere is. I think a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? It's like the hyperbolic equivalent of a sphere.

The metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like the metric for a sphere but in flat space. Wait, no, the denominator here is 4 minus x² minus y², which reminds me of the expression for the radius squared. Oh, because r² = x² + y², so 4 is (2)^2, so the radius is 2. Interesting.

But the metric is given in terms of x and y. So this might be a coordinate system that's been used. I'm trying to remember, in the case of a sphere, the metric is something like (R²)/(R² - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²), but that's in polar coordinates. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up with something else.

Wait, no, another thought. For a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, the metric in polar coordinates usually looks something like ds² = dr² + (a² sinh²(r/a))² dθ², where a is the curvature radius. But that's in polar coordinates, and this metric is in terms of x and y. Alternatively, maybe it's using a different coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is in isothermal coordinates or something similar. Isothermal
