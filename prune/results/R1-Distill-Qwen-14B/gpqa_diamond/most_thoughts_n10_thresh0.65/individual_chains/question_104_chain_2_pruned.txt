Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. When a planet orbits a star, the star wobbles, causing the spectral lines to shift as the star moves towards or away from us.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So their masses are the same, and the stars are identical. The key difference is the Doppler shift detected: planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Wait, but how does the Doppler shift relate to the planet's orbital period? Oh right, the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity (K). The formula for the semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (4π²/P²) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Let me think about what factors affect the semi-amplitude K. Since both stars have the same mass (like Sun) and the planets are similar to Neptune (same mass), and the orbits are circular (so e=0, simplifying). So the difference in K must come from other factors, like the orbital period or the distance from the star.

Wait, wait. Wait, the semi-amplitude K is given by the formula: K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) ) * (1/( (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) )

But since the planets' masses are the same (Neptune-like), and the stars' masses are same, and e is zero, the only variables are sin i and P. But if the orbits are edge-on, sin i is 1, so that's the same for both. So K should depend on P.

Wait, no. Wait, let me get the formula right. I think K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* )^(1/3) (P)^(1/3) )
