Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point. Alright, I remember that titration involves neutralizing an acid with a base, and pH changes along the way. 

First, let me read the problem again. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is being diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, it's titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. We need the pH when 25% of the acid is neutralized and at the equivalence point.

Wait, so first, let me think about the initial dilution. Diluting the acetic acid with water will decrease its concentration. The initial volume is 20 cm³, after adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration can be calculated using M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 is (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.0125 M? Wait, no, 0.05 *20 = 1 mmol, divided by 40 cm³ gives 0.025 M. Oh wait, wait, let me re-calculate that. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, so 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles of acetic acid. After dilution to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Right, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid will be neutralized to form acetate ions. The solution will consist of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it should hydrolyze in water to make the solution basic. So the pH at equivalence point should be above 7, maybe around 8 or so. But let's get exact.

First, let's find the amount of NaOH needed for equivalence. The original acetic acid is 20 cm³ * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed is same as moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25
