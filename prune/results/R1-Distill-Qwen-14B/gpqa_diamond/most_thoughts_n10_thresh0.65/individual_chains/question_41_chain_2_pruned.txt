Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I understand the setup correctly. The glass is moving towards the observer, and the light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards me, and the light is moving along with it. Wait, but the light is inside the glass, which has a refractive index n. So the speed of light in the glass, without considering any motion, is c/n, right? Because normally, in a medium with refractive index n, speed v = c/n.

But now, the glass itself is moving. So I think this is a problem involving the addition of velocities, perhaps using special relativity. Oh wait, but since the speed of light in the glass is c/n, which is less than c, and the glass is moving at v (which I assume is much smaller than c, but perhaps not). So I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame when the medium (glass) itself is moving.

Hmm. I remember that when you have a medium moving relative to an observer, the speed of light in that medium can be found using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (u'
