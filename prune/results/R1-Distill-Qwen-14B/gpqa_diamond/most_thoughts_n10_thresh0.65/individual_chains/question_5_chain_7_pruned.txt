Okay, so I need to calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let me think through this step by step.

First, the operator P is given with its X, Y, and Z components. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The eigenvector for the operator P (which is a vector operator) along direction n will be the eigenstate of the corresponding component of P in that direction.

Wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so it's not in the y direction. That means n can be parameterized using angles θ and φ, but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero. Or wait, maybe φ is the angle in the x-y plane, so if it's in the x-z plane, φ is 90 degrees? Or maybe I should just consider n as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So φ would be 90 or 270 degrees? No, wait, actually, in the x-z plane, the direction would have y=0, so the spherical coordinates would have φ = π/2 or 3π/2, but perhaps more accurately, the direction can be represented with φ=0, but that's the x-axis. Hmm no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, maybe the direction n is given in the x-z plane, which is a plane where y=0. So any direction in this plane can be described with polar angles θ from the z-axis and φ=0 or π, because in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ is 0 (along +x) or π (along -x). Alternatively, perhaps the direction is more generally described by an angle θ from the z-axis, with φ=0. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right?

So the operator P along n is given by the vector operator P · n, which would be P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. Since n_y is zero, the P_y component doesn't contribute.

So the operator we're looking at is P = P_x * n_x + P_z
