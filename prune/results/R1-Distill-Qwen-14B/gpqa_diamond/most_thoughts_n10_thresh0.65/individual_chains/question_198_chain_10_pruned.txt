Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution containing Co(II) and thiocyanate ions. The given data includes the concentrations of Co and SCN-, and the stability constants for the complexes.

So, I remember that when a metal ion is present with a ligand, they form various complexes. The stability constants (β) tell us how stable each complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable.

The problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]²+ complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached. So, it's the second complex in the series.

The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's a bit confusing because β usually increases with the order of the complex. Here, β3 is the highest, so the third complex is the most stable. Oh, right, the complexes are [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)₂]²+, [Co(SCN)₃]³-, and [Co(SCN)₄]^4-.

Wait, the blue one is the dithiocyanato, so that's [Co(SCN)₂]²+. So, we're looking for the concentration of this species relative to all Co species.

The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So, I need to calculate the distribution of Co species.

I think the approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. The fraction of each complex is given by the product of the stability constant, the concentration of SCN- raised to the power of the number of ligands, divided by the sum of all such terms for each possible complex.

Wait, the general formula for the fraction f_n of the nth complex is:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN^-]^n) / Σ (β_k * [SCN^-]^k) for k=1 to 4.

Wait, but wait—the complexes start with n=1? Or n=0? Because [Co²+] is n=0. Oh, right, because β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, which is n=1. So the possible species are n=0 (free Co²+), n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4.

Wait, but the stability constants are given starting from β1. So, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, and so on up to β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^4-.

So, all possible species are [Co²+], [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, [Co(SCN)_4]^4-.

But I think the formula for the fraction of each species involves the log of the stability constants, or the product of β and [SCN] terms.

Wait, the distribution is calculated using the formation of each complex step by step.

The formation of each complex from the previous one is governed by the stepwise formation constant, but here the β values are the overall stability constants.

So, the fraction of each complex is given by:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / Σ (β_k [SCN]^k) for k=0 to 4.

Wait, but wait—what is β0? Because for n=0, it's just Co²+ without any ligand. So β0 would be 1, I think. Because [Co²+][SCN]^0 = [Co²+].

Wait, but the given β values start at β1. So maybe the formula is:

The fraction f_n for each complex is (β_n [SCN]^n) divided by the sum of β_k [SCN]^k from k=0 to k=4. But wait, β0 would be 1, since the complex [Co] is just Co²+.

Wait, no, because β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+ from Co²+ and SCN^-.

So, let me think again. The overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} is β_n = [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} / ([Co²+][SCN^-]^n).

So, the concentration of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n.

But the total concentration of Co is the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n] plus any other forms, but in this case, the total Co is all in these complexes.

Wait, the total cobalt concentration is given as c(Co)=1e-2 M. So,

c(Co) = [Co²+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_3]^3
