Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in relativity, you can't just subtract speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, the velocity addition formula is different. So the relative speed isn't just 0.6c minus 0.5c. I think the formula is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/c²). Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, wait. Wait, one is moving at v and the other at u. So from the perspective of the first astronaut (the one moving at 0.6c), what's the speed of the second astronaut?

Wait no, wait, actually, the problem says "relative speed". So perhaps the relative speed is from the frame of the first astronaut to the second, or vice versa? Or maybe it's the speed of one as observed from the other's frame. Hmm, I think I should clarify that.

So, let's say astronaut A has mass 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B has mass 3m moving at 0.5c. Both are in the same direction, so A is moving faster than B. So from A's frame, what's the speed of B?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the relative speed would be the speed of one as observed from the other's frame. So if I'm in A's frame, I'm stationary, and B is moving. What's B's speed in my frame? So using the velocity addition formula, v' = (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/c²), where u is the speed of A relative to the lab frame, and v is the speed of B relative to the lab frame. But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction—so from the lab frame, A is at 0.6c, B at 0.5c.

Wait, but wait. The issue here is that the relative speed is how fast each is moving relative to each other. So if I'm in B's frame, what's A's speed? Or if I'm in A's
