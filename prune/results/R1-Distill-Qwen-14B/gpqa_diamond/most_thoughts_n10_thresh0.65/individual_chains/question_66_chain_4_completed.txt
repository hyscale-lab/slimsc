Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators that preserve the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect.

The options given are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Let me break down each symmetry.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: This is the symmetry of special relativity, meaning that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in constant velocity (i.e., inertial) frames. In the SMEFT, all terms must transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. So operators must be Lorentz scalars or, if they're tensors, they should transform properly. I think SMEFT operators are constructed to respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (i.e., momentum conservation). So it's a bigger symmetry group. But wait, in the SMEFT, the operators are added to the Standard Model Lagrangian. The SM already respects Poincare symmetry, so the SMEFT operators, which are corrections, must also respect it. So I think Poincare symmetry is a must.

Wait, but wait. The SMEFT can have operators that are higher-dimensional, but do they necessarily have to respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations, which implies momentum conservation. If an operator has derivatives, say, they transform in a way that maintains Poincare. But wait, operators in SMEFT are interactions, and interactions in the SM are local, so they should respect Poincare. So yes, SMEFT operators must respect Poincare.

3. CP symmetry: CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. This symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators. In the Standard Model, some terms (like the CKM matrix) violate CP. So the SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. Therefore, operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP. So option 3 is not necessarily a symmetry that must be enforced.

4. CPT symmetry: CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, and I think the SMEFT must also respect it because the underlying theory (the SM plus SMEFT corrections) must preserve CPT. All terms in the Lagrangian should transform correctly under CPT. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

Wait, but wait again. Are there any cases where an operator could violate CPT? I think in SMEFT, because the operators are built from SM fields, which respect CPT, the SMEFT operators would automatically respect CPT as well. Because each field transforms under CPT in a specific way, and higher-dimensional operators are built from products of these fields, which are arranged to respect CPT. So yeah, CPT must be respected.

So looking back at the options, the question is which of these symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Symmetry 1: Lorentz - yes.

Symmetry 2: Poincare - yes.

Symmetry 3: CP - no, because operators can violate CP.

Symmetry 4: CPT - yes.

So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4.

Now, looking at the answer options:

Option C: 1,2,4.

Option D: 1,3,4.

Wait the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C) 1,2,4

D) 1,3,4

So the correct answer would include 1, 2, and 4, which is option C.

Wait, but wait a moment. Another thought: Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translations. So if SMEFT operators respect Lorentz, do they automatically respect Poincare? Because the presence of translation symmetry requires that the theory is Lorentz invariant and that the Lagrangian is divergence-free (so that momentum is conserved). Since the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it must respect the same symmetries as the SM. The SM respects Poincare, so the SMEFT must as well.

So yes, all SMEFT operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. So 1 and 2 are both correct. And 4 (CPT) must also be correct.

So the correct answer should include 1,2,4. That's option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that the SM respects Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT does too. So the operators must respect Poincare.

So the correct choices are 1,2,4. So the answer is C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM). The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry, which underpins special relativity, requires that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in inertial frames. SMEFT operators are constructed to respect Lorentz symmetry, as they must transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations (momentum conservation). Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, and SMEFT is an extension of the SM, all SMEFT operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry. Thus, Poincaré symmetry must be respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry involves charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). While the SM respects CP symmetry in many cases, there are phenomena (e.g., CP violation in the CKM matrix) where CP is not preserved. SMEFT operators can also violate CP symmetry, meaning CP symmetry is not a strict requirement for all SMEFT operators. Therefore, CP symmetry does not need to be universally respected.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). The SM respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT operators, being built from SM fields, must also respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, CPT symmetry must be respected.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct combination is provided in option C.
