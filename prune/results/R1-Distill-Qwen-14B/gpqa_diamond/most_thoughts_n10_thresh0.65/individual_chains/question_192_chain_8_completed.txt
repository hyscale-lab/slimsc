Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand.

So, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is some distance s away from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's smaller than R. Then, they put a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. Also, l and L are both greater than R, and there's an angle theta between l and s.

Hmm, so I remember from my studies that when there's a charge inside a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But in this case, the conductor was initially uncharged, so maybe the charges inside the cavity will induce charges on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, right! For a conductor, the charges reside on the surface. So when you have a charge inside the cavity, it induces equal and opposite charges on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor was uncharged, those induced inner charges must be -q. Then, since the total charge of the conductor is zero, the outer surface must have +q induced charges, because the inner surface has -q. Wait no, wait. Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So the cavity has +q. The inner surface of the conductor (the part near the cavity) will have -q induced because of the +q. But since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner is -q, and the outer is +q, the conductor's net charge is zero. Oh wait, no. Let me think: the conductor was neutral. The cavity has +q. The inner surface of the conductor (the one touching the cavity) will have -q, because the charge induces an opposite charge. But the conductor's total charge is zero, so the outer surface must have +q, because the inner is -q: conductor's outer surface has +q. So the conductor's net charge is zero: (-q) from inner, +q from outer, so zero.

So for any point outside the conductor, the electric field would be as if the charge were a point charge at the center of the conductor. Because, according to Gauss's Law, the outer Gaussian surface would treat the induced charges on the outer surface as if they were a point charge at the center.

Wait, but point P is outside the conductor. So, the field at P should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Because the conductor's induced outer charge is +q, so the field outside would be due to that +q at the center.

But wait, the charge is inside a cavity that's not at the center of the conductor. The cavity's center is offset by distance s from the conductor's center. So the charge +q is not at the center of the conductor. So the induced charges might not be symmetrically distributed, right?

Ah, that's a good point. If the cavity is not at the center, then the +q inside isn't at the center of the conductor. So the inner surface's induced -q would arrange themselves in a way that's not symmetric. But wait, no. Wait, the inner surface is a sphere, so the induced charge distribution would still be spherically symmetric if the cavity is a sphere. Because regardless of where the charge is inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have a uniform distribution, right? Because the conductor is a sphere, so any internal charge would produce a symmetric induced charge on the inner surface. Wait, but in the problem, the cavity is inside the conductor, but its center is offset by s. Oh wait, no, no. The cavity is a small sphere, and the conductor is a larger sphere. The problem says the center of the cavity is separated by distance s from the center of the conductor.

Wait, so the cavity is a small sphere inside the conductor, but its center is not at the same point as the conductor's center. So the +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. So the conductor is a larger sphere, and the cavity is a smaller sphere not at the center.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because a conductor allows charges to move freely. So if the cavity is not centered, the +q inside would cause the inner surface of the conductor to have -q, but because the cavity is not at the center, maybe the inner surface's charge distribution isn't uniform.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, so any charge inside (cavity) would cause the inner surface to have an induced charge, but if the cavity is not at the center, the inner surface's induced charge would be asymmetric. Because the +q is inside the cavity, which is offset from the center. So the inner surface would have a charge distribution that's not uniform, leading to a dipole or something.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the outer surface's induced charge would be symmetric, but maybe not. Hmm.

Alternatively, another approach: using the method of images or considering the superposition of fields.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has +q, because the inner surface is -q, and the conductor was neutral. So the total charge on the conductor's outer surface is +q. Now, because the outer surface is a sphere, any point outside the conductor would see the field due to this +q as if it were at the conductor's center. So regardless of where the charge is inside the cavity, the outer surface's field outside would be as if the charge were at the conductor's center.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when the cavity's center is offset, the induced charges on the inner surface would not be uniform, so the outer surface might not be uniform either. Or would it?

Wait, no. The conductor's outer surface is a spherical shell. The charges on a spherical shell will arrange themselves to be symmetric if there's no external fields or other charges influencing them. So, even if the inner surface isn't symmetric, the outer surface might still be symmetric because it's a spherical shell. Because the inner surface's induced charge could create an internal field that would cause the outer surface to have a uniform distribution.

Wait, no. That's not correct. The inner surface's charge distribution affects the outer surface. Let me think: for a spherical conductor, if the cavity is a sphere, but not at the center, then the inner surface's charge distribution would be such that the electric field inside the conductor material (between inner and outer surfaces) is zero. But that's more complex.

Alternatively, think about the conductor as a spherical shell. The inner surface has a charge of -q, but it's in a cavity that's not at the center. So the inner surface's charge distribution isn't uniform. But the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface's charge distribution must be uniform, because any non-uniformity would create an electric field within the conductor's material, which isn't possible since it's a conductor and charges move freely.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the conductor's outer surface must be a conductor, so the charges there rearrange to ensure that the electric field inside the conductor's material is zero. The only way that can happen, for a spherical shell, is if the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed. So regardless of the inner surface's distribution, the outer surface's charge is uniform. So the charge on the outer surface is +q, uniformly distributed.

Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor (like at point P) would be the same as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. So the electric field at P would be (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * (q / L^2), because it's a point outside a sphere with charge q.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is that. But wait, option B's E is (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * (q / L^2). So that would be the case.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the point P's distance from the cavity's center is l, and the distance from the conductor's center is L. Also, the angle theta is between l and s.

Wait, but if the conductor's outer surface is a uniformly charged sphere with +q, then the field at any point outside the conductor depends only on the distance from the conductor's center. Because the sphere's symmetry makes the field the same as a point charge at the center.

So in that case, the field at P would be E = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * (q / L^2). So the answer would be option B.

But wait, could that be correct? Because the charge is inside a cavity that's offset. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the field would be as if the point charge is at the center of the conductor, not the cavity. Because the conductor's outer surface is the one contributing to the external field.

So yeah, the answer should be option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   The spherical conductor of radius $R$ is initially uncharged. A small spherical cavity of radius $r$ is inside the conductor, and its center is offset by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. This induces a charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (due to the charge $+q$ inside the cavity). Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge $+q$ induced on it.

2. **Symmetry of the Outer Surface**:  
   The outer surface of the conductor is a spherical shell. Regardless of the position of the cavity or the induced charge distribution on the inner surface, the charges on the outer surface will rearrange to ensure that the electric field inside the conductor's material is zero. This requires the outer surface to have a uniform charge distribution of $+q$.

3. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   For a point $P$ outside the conductor, the electric field is determined by the uniformly distributed charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. By Gauss's Law, the field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor. Thus, the electric field at $P$ depends only on the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to $P$.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The formula $\dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{(l-s \cos\theta)^2}$ does not describe the field outside the conductor, as the field depends only on the distance $L$ from the conductor's center, not on $l$ or $\theta$.  
   - **Option B**: Correct. The formula $\dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$ correctly represents the electric field outside the conductor, as it is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ at the center of the conductor.  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The formula $\dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{(l+s \cos\theta)^2}$ is also incorrect for the same reason as Option A.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The formula $\dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{l^2}$ incorrectly assumes that the field depends on $l$, the distance from $P$ to the cavity's center, rather than $L$, the distance from $P$ to the conductor's center.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The electric field at point $P$ is determined solely by the uniformly distributed charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor, and it is given by $\dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$.

**Answer: B**
