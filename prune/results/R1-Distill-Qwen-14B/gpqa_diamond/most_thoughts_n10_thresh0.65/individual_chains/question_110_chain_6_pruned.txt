Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two specific spectrographs. Let me see what I can do here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about which stars can be observed by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The key seems to be their apparent magnitudes because each spectrograph has different brightness limits.

From what I remember, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So, that means it can see stars down to about 17 mag or brighter. Wait, wait. Wait, no, actually, when a telescope can observe stars brighter than a certain magnitude, that means it can see up to that magnitude. So, if a star is magnitude 17 or less, ESPRESSO can see it. Because higher magnitude means fainter. So, if a star is brighter (lower magnitude number), it's easier to see. So, for ESPRESSO, any star with V <=17 mag is observable.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So, V <=16 mag for HIRES.

So the stars must have apparent V magnitudes <=17 (for ESPRESSO) and also <=16 (for HIRES). Wait, no, wait. Because the question is which stars can be detected with both. So, the star must be bright enough for both. So, it needs to be brighter than both limits. Wait, no. Let me
