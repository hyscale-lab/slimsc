Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with the same radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric observations show brightness variations because the star is rotating, modulating the spots into and out of view. The interesting part is that this can mimic an exoplanet's signal. The question is asking: if the star wasn't spotted, what exoplanet radius relative to the star would produce the same brightness variation amplitude?

Hmm. So the key here is to compare the change in brightness caused by the spots to the change that would be caused by an exoplanet transiting the star.

First, I'll think about the star's brightness variation due to the spots. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, they make the star appear a bit dimmer. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing the observed brightness to dip periodically.

The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Since the star is a sphere, the total area covered by spots would be 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere. Wait, or is it the fraction of the star's total area? Hmm, the question says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%, so maybe the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So each hemisphere is half the star's surface. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * (π R^2 / 2) = 0.1 π R².

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spots come into our view. So the maximum effect would be when the spots are on the side facing us. The brightness change would then be proportional to the area of spots times the temperature difference.

Wait, the star's flux is proportional to the area and the fourth power of temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ Teff^4. So the flux from the star is F = σ Teff^4.

But when part of the star is cooler, the total flux is reduced. The variation in flux depends on the area of the spots
