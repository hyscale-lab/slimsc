Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at 0.96c. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

First, the question says that nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium? So the atomic number of lithium is 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) = 6. So X is Li-6, right? So that's the nucleus we're dealing with.

The problem is to find the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of the Li nucleus is 0.96c. I remember that in particle accelerators, the energy is usually the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. I need to be careful here. Oh wait, RHIC is a collider, so it's likely that the energy given is the kinetic energy per particle, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, in accelerators, the energy specified is often the kinetic energy. But when you're dealing with relativistic speeds, you have to consider the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy. So maybe I should calculate the total energy and then subtract the rest mass energy to get the kinetic, depending on the context. Hmm, but the question says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So perhaps it's the total energy
