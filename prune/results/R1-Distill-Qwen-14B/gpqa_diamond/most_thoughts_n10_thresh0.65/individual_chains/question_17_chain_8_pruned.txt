Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again.

The problem says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. So in this case, calcium is bound with EDTA to form a complex, and we're supposed to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

Wait, wait. The solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. I think that means the concentration of the complex, [CaY], where Y is the EDTA. Since it's a 1:1 complex (I think), each mole of CaY gives one mole of Ca²+ and one of Y⁴- or something like that when it dissociates, but maybe it's not fully dissociated because of the formation constant.

The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formula for K is [CaY]/([Ca][EDTA]). Right. So the higher the K, the more the complex is formed, meaning less free ions.

Given that K is 5x10^10, that's a large value, so the complex is very stable. So most of the Ca and EDTA would be tied up in the complex, leaving very little free calcium and EDTA ions.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of calcium ions. So I need to find [Ca²+].

Let's think about the initial situation. We start with 0.02 M CaY. Let's say the dissociation is as follows:

CaY ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4- (or HEDTA, but since pH is ideal, maybe it's in the form Y^4-).

Wait, but EDTA can have different forms depending on pH. Oh, the problem says pH is ideal, so probably the fully deprotonated EDTA, Y^4-, is dominant. So the reaction is as I wrote.

At equilibrium, let the concentration of free Ca²+ be x. Similarly, EDTA would
