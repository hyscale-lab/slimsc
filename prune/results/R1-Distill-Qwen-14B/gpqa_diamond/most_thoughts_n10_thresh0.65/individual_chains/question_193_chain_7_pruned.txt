Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance based on their parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance in some way. Oh wait, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if distance increases, parallax decreases.

The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Or is it that when you plot number of stars against parallax, the relationship is N ∝ 1/plx^5? So N = k * (1/(plx)^5), where k is some constant.

But how does that relate to distance? Because plx is inversely proportional to distance. I think the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Or wait, actually, I'm pretty sure it's plx (in parsecs) is equal to 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, which makes d = 1/plx.

So if I substitute d into the equation. Let's think: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, substituting that gives N proportional to 1/( (1/d)^5 ). Because (plx)^5 is (1/d)^5, so 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power.

Wait, but wait. The question is asking how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance. Oh, right, so it's the change in number with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dr, would be proportional to d^5. But wait, wait, that doesn't seem right because the volume increases with d^3, but this seems to be a different scenario.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the differential. If N is proportional to d^5, then the number in a small range dr would be N dr = something proportional to d^5 dr. But that's when you're considering a differential element. But the question is how the number changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So perhaps it's the rate of change, which is dN/dr
