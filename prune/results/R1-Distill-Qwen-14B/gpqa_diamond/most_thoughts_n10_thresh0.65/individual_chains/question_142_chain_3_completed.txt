Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. But wait, what about the geometrical position? Oh right, I think for single qubits, the density matrix can be represented as a point in a three-dimensional space, called the Bloch sphere.

The Bloch sphere has coordinates (x, y, z), and any single-qubit state can be represented as a vector on this sphere. For a pure state |ψ⟩, it's on the surface, and for a mixed state, it's inside. The density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, which would have trace 1 and be a projector. But this ρ is a mixture of |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|, each with equal weight.

So, ρ can also be written as (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me think about what this represents. Each of the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states are orthogonal, so their projectors are along the z-axis, I believe. The state |0⟩ is at (0, 0, 1) on the Bloch sphere, and |1⟩ is at (0, 0, -1). But since we're taking an equal mixture of the two, perhaps the density matrix represents a completely mixed state.

Wait, the completely mixed state for a qubit is (I/2), where I is the 2x2 identity matrix. Let me compute ρ. The standard basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are orthonormal. So, |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. Then ρ is (1/2) I, which matches the completely mixed state.

Now, the Bloch vector r for a density matrix ρ is found by expressing ρ in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices. For the completely mixed state, I/2 equals this expression. So, setting r·σ to zero, because I/2 = (I + 0)/2. That means r must be (0,0,0). So the point is at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which should be the correct answer. The other options don't make sense because, for instance, (1,1,0) would imply a point on the equator, but our state is completely mixed, which is at the center.

Wait, did I get the expansion right? Let me double-check. The density matrix for any state can be written as (I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z)/2. When all coefficients x, y, z are zero, it's (I)/2 which is the mixed state. So yes, the vector r is all zeros. So the geometrical position is the origin.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, which is commonly used to visualize qubit states, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the \(2 \times 2\) identity matrix. This form corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere, i.e., \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A (\(r = (1,1,0)\))**: This corresponds to a pure state on the equator of the Bloch sphere, which is not the case here.
- **Option B (\(r = (0,0,1)\))**: This corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\), which is also not the case here.
- **Option C (\(r = (0,0,0)\))**: This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which matches the given density matrix.
- **Option D (\(r = (1,1,1)\))**: This is not a valid state in the Bloch sphere representation.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the given density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
