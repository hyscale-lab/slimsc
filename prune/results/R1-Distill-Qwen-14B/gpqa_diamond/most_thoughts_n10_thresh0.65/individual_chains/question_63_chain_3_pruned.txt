Okay, so I've got this question here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are given as A, B, C, D with various p values.

First, I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels have two parts: rotational and vibrational. The fundamental state is the lowest possible energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So, when they say the molecule is in the fundamental state, I think that refers to the lowest rotational and vibrational states. 

Wait, but wait, the next state with the lowest possible energy could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. Since the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which I think combines both rotation and vibration. But I'm not entirely sure. Oh, wait, the non-rigid rotor model is an extension of the rigid rotor, considering bond vibrations. So, the energy levels would account for both rotation and vibration.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. The question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, the next state would probably be the next higher energy state, which could involve either a vibrational transition or a rotational transition. But the model given is the rotation-vibration model, so transitions can involve both.

Wait, but when a photon is absorbed, the molecule's energy increases. The photon's energy should match the energy difference between the two states. So, we're looking for the energy difference between the current state and the next possible state.

The fundamental state is the lowest, so the next state could be the first excited vibrational state (v=1) if it's higher than the next rotational state. Or maybe the next rotational state is lower in energy than the first vibrational excited state. I'm not sure which is higher.

Wait, let me think about the energy levels. Vibrational energy levels are quantized and given by (n + ½) ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. Rotational energy levels are (J(J+1)ħ)/(2I), where J is the rotational quantum number, I is the moment of inertia.

So, the ground state would be v=0 and J=0. The next possible energy state could be either v=1 or J=1. Which of these has a lower energy?

Hmm, I'm not sure. Let's think about the energies. The vibrational energy for v=1 is (1 + ½) ħω = (3/2) ħω. The rotational energy for J=1 is [1(1+1)] ħ/(2I) = (2 ħ)/(2I) = ħ/(I). So, which is bigger: 3/2 ħω or ħ/(I)?

We have the values given: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu, bond length R is 2 angstroms. Wait, the moment of inertia I is μR², where μ is the reduced mass.

So, let's compute μ. μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. 

1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg, so μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.019e-27 kg. 

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So I = μR² = 3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational energy for J=1 is (ħ/(I)) * (J(J+1)/2). Wait, no, the formula is E_rot = [J(J+1)ħ²]/(2I). So, for J=1, E_rot = (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I). 

Wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So, ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²s². Then, E_rot = 1.112e-68 / (1.2076e-46) ≈ 9.21e-23 J. 

Alternatively, the vibrational energy for v=1 is (3/2) ħω. Let's compute that. ω is 4e14 rad/s. So, (3/2) * 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 = (3/2)*1.05457e-34 *4e14 = (3/2)*4.218e-20 = 6.327e-20 J.

Wait, comparing E_rot (9.2e-23 J) and E_vibr (6.3e-20 J), the vibrational transition is a much larger energy jump. So, the next possible state with the lowest energy would be the J=1 rotational state, since that's a lower energy than the first vibrational state.

So, the photon should have enough energy to make that rotational transition.

Wait, but wait, can the molecule make a transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy?
