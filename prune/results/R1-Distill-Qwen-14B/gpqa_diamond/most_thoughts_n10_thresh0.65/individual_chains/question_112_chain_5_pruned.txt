Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which means they form a basis for the spin-1/2 system.

The first part asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij = hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. So, that's a 2x2 matrix. Wait, let me think. Since it's a 2x2 matrix for spin-1/2, the eigenstates of this operator will form a new basis. So, I need to find the eigenstates of this matrix A, and then find the probabilities of |alpha> being in each of these new eigenstates.

But wait, before getting into that, maybe I should normalize the given state |alpha>. Because right now, it's proportional to that combination, but normalization is important for probabilities.

So the state is |alpha> = k*(1+i)|up> + k*(2-i)|down>, where k is some normalization constant. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. Let's compute the inner product.

The inner product would be [k*(1-i) (since the conjugate of (1+i) is (1-i)) ] * (1+i) |up><up| + [k*(2+i)] * (2 - i)|down><down| + cross terms. Since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, the cross terms vanish.

So the norm squared is |k|^2 [ (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) ].

Computing each term: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. Similarly, (2-i)(2+i) is 4 + 2i - 2i -i². Wait: (2-i)(2+i) = 4 + (2i -2i) + (-i^2) → 4 + 0 +1 =5.

Wait, no, let me compute it again. (2 - i)(
