Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

Alright, the setup: there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. So, each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge, which is 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. That makes each charge 3.204 x 10^-19 C. And they say the masses are negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the system has one charge at the center, and twelve around it, all at a distance of 2 meters. Hmm, I think this forms something like a spherical arrangement, but the specifics of their arrangement might not matter because electric potential energy depends on distances between each pair.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Wait, minimum energy. So, I guess the configuration should be the one that gives the lowest possible potential energy. For point charges, the potential energy is determined by their positions. Since the charges are all positive (assuming 'e' is positive), bringing them closer would increase the potential energy because positive charges repel. But wait, in this case, the charges are fixed in their positions except for the 13th one. Wait, noâ€”the 13th is fixed at P, and the others are fixed at 2m from P. So, their positions are fixed. So the system's potential energy is a fixed value, not something that can be minimized further. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem says it's an isolated system, so maybe it's about how the charges are arranged. But wait, all the 12 charges are at 2 meters from P, so the distance from each of them to the 13th charge is 2 meters. So, maybe the potential energy is due to the interaction between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges, plus the interactions among the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy. So perhaps the system's configuration is such that all 12 charges are arranged symmetrically around the central charge to minimize repulsion. But wait, since all their positions are fixed, maybe I just have to calculate the potential energy of the entire system as given.

Wait, but I think I should compute
