Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an operator. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The question says that the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator A is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay. The equation given is Ay(φ) = a(φ), where a is the eigenvalue and φ the eigenfunction. The matrix operator is Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0).

Wait, I think S looks a lot like the Pauli Y matrix. Oh right, because the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and used often in spin systems. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so that's exactly what S is here. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * Y, where Y is the Pauli Y matrix.

I remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are ±ħ/2, but wait, the units here might be different. Let me think. Since Ay is c times S, and c is h/(4π), let me compute the eigenvalues.

The eigenvalues a of Ay would be c times the eigenvalues of S. Because the eigenvalues of S are ±1/2 multiplied by something? Wait, no. Wait, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, right? Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian and traceless, their eigenvalues are ±1. But wait, no, the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1? Let me think. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Each is Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. For σy, what are the eigenvalues? I think they are +1 and -1 because when you solve the characteristic equation, the determinant would be (0 - λ)(-λ -i) - (-i)(i) )= λ(λ +i) - (-i^2) ). Wait, maybe I should compute the eigenvalues of S.

Alternatively, since S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], let me find its eigenvalues. The trace is 0, and the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = 0 - (-(-1))= 0 - (1)= -1? Wait, wait. Let's compute the determinant correctly. The (1,1) element is 0, (1,2) is -i, (2,1) is i, (2,2) is 0. So determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = 0 - ( - (-1))= 0 - (1) = -1. Hmm, so the characteristic equation is λ² - (trace)λ + determinant = λ² + determinant = λ² - (-1) = λ² +1 =0. So λ = ±i. Wait, that's not right because the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are actually ±i for σy? Wait, no, because I thought the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Wait, no, maybe I'm confused. Alternatively,
