Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The idea is that as the planet orbits the star, it makes the star wobble a bit, and this wobble shifts the spectral lines we observe.

The question states that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar in mass to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the key point is that the stars have the same mass, which probably means their gravitational influence on the planets would be similar in some aspects.

The problem gives the RV shifts for each planet. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms (I think that's 5e-3 angstroms), and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, but the RV method gives us the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis of its orbit. Oh wait, no, the RV gives us the velocity of the star, which relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Let me think.

The RV method actually gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is given by K = (v) in m/s. The formula I remember is K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) )^( something )... Wait, maybe it's better to think about the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ (some exponent?))

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to look up the formula. I think the formula is K = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, another approach: Since the mass of the planet is given and the stars have the same mass, which is much larger than the planet's, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So for both planets
