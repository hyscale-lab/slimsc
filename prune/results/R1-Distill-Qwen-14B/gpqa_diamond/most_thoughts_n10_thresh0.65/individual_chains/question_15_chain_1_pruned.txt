Okay, I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let's start by recalling what factors affect the transit probability.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the relative sizes of the planet and the star, but wait, actually, more precisely, it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's size. Oh, right, the transit probability formula is something like (R_p / a) / (R_s), but wait, no, wait. I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a) divided by (R_s), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough for the planet to pass in front of the star from our perspective. The formula I remember is that the probability P is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a, but I think R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so it's approximately R_star / a. Wait, no, wait: the exact formula for the geometric probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's roughly R_star / a times something else? Hmm, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, no, the geometric probability is the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the orbit. More precisely, the probability that a randomly oriented orbit would cause a transit is given by (R_star / a) multiplied by some function. Oh right, I think it
