Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what it's asking.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, not entirely sure what the specifics of this interaction are, but I think it's about how the boson X couples to fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, I need to find the kinematically allowed decay channels of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion pairs.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to the mass of X, right? Because, from conservation of energy, the total rest mass of the decay products can't exceed the mass of the decaying particle. Otherwise, the decay wouldn't be possible.

So, X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The possible pairs would be those where each fermion has a mass less than 6 GeV/2, because each would have half the mass of X if the decay is symmetric. Wait, no, actually, the combined mass of the pair must be less than or equal to X's mass. So, each fermion's mass must be less than 3 GeV, because each takes half in the rest frame.

Wait, no. The rest mass of each fermion in the pair must be less than the mass of X. Because when a boson decays into a pair of fermions, each fermion's rest mass must be less than the boson's mass. Otherwise, the decay is not possible. Because if, say, the fermion has a mass higher than X, then X can't decay into that fermion plus its antiparticle because their combined rest mass would exceed X's mass.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of invariant mass. The boson is at rest, so the fermions would have to each have a rest mass less than or equal to half the X's mass. Because if each is m, then 2m ≤ M_X. So, m ≤ 3 GeV.

So, X can decay into any fermion pair where each fermion has a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Now, let me think about the masses of the known fermions
