Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required to accelerate a nucleus. Hmm, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is protons + neutrons, which would be 3 +3 =6. So it's a Li-6 nucleus.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. So I need to find the total energy, which I think is the relativistic energy because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, so relativistic effects are important.

Right, from what I remember, the total energy E of a particle is given by gamma times mc squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, yes, so first I need to calculate gamma for v=0.96c.

Calculating gamma: v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which I think is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 times 3.5714 is roughly 1, right? Because 0.28 * 3 =0.84, 0.28 * 0.5714 ≈ 0.16, so total about 1. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus can be calculated using the atomic mass. I think the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0141 g/mol. Wait, no, that's the molar mass. Oh right, to find the mass of a single nucleus, I need to divide by Avogadro's number. But wait, maybe I remember the mass in atomic mass units (u), which is approximately 6.0141 u.

Wait, yeah, let's get exact. The exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.0141 u. But to calculate energy, I'll need to convert that into kilograms. 1 u is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So 6.0141 u would be 6.0141 * 1.660539e-27 kg.

Let me calculate that. 6 * 1.660539e-27 is about 9.96323e-27 kg. 0.0141 * 1.660
