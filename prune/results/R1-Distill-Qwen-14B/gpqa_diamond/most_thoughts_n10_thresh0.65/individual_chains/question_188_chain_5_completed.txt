Okay, so I'm trying to solve this crystallography problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The question gives a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms and all angles α, β, γ equal to 30 degrees. The goal is to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, wait. I need to recall the formula for interplanar distances. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance (d_hkl) in a crystal is given by d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cosβ + hl cosγ + kl cosα) )) ), but wait, that's for a general triclinic crystal. But here, it's a rhombohedral crystal, which is a special case where all edges are equal (a = b = c) and all angles are equal (α = β = γ).

So in a rhombohedral system, the formula might be simplified. Let me think. The general formula for interplanar spacing in a cubic system is a/sqrt(h² +k² +l²), but that's when all angles are 90 degrees. But here, the angles are 30 degrees. So I guess the formula needs to account for the angles.

Wait, I think for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula can be expressed as d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is the angle between the edges. Since all angles are 30 degrees, θ is 30 degrees.

Wait, let me make sure I'm getting the formula right. In a rhombohedral crystal, the structure is more symmetric than a general hexagonal or triclinic. So the formula might involve the same terms but with all angles being the same.

Another thought: perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a/(sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Since in this case, all three angles are 30 degrees, θ is 30.

So in this problem, the plane is (111), so h=k=l=1. So substituting these values into the formula.

Let me compute the denominator first. h² + k² + l² is 1+1+1 =3. Then 2(hk + hl + kl) is 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) = 2*(3) =6. So the second term is 6 * cos(30 degrees). Cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2, approximately 0.8660.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) ) = sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

First, compute 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2). 6*(sqrt(3)/2) is 3*sqrt(3). So 3 + 3*sqrt(3).

So the denominator is the square root of (3 + 3√3). Let's compute that numerically.

What's the value of 3 + 3√3?

√3 is approximately 1.732. So 3*1.732 is about 5.196. So 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

Wait, wait, no. Wait 3 + 3√3 is 3(1 + sqrt(3)).

Compute 1 + sqrt(3) ≈ 1 + 1.732 ≈ 2.732.

Multiply by 3: 3 * 2.732 ≈ 8.196. So the denominator is sqrt(8.196).

What's sqrt(8.196)? Well, sqrt(9)=3, sqrt(8.196) is a bit less. Let me calculate:

Compute 2.86² = 8.1796. 2.87² = 8.2369. So sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863.

So denominator is around 2.863. Therefore, the interplanar distance d is a divided by this number.

Wait, wait. The a here is the interatomic distance given as 10 Angstroms. So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 10 divided by 2.863. Let's see: 2.863 * 3.49 is approximately 10. Let me compute 2.863 * 3 = 8.589. 2.863 *3.5 = 10.0205. Oh wait, so 3.5 times 2.863 is about 10.0205. So 10 /2.863 ≈ approximately 3.49.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, d = a / denominator. So 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.49? That can't be right because the interplanar distance should be smaller than the interatomic distance in a crystal. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the interatomic distance is the edge length, a. Interplanar distance is in the direction perpendicular to the planes. So in a cubic system, for (111) plane, the interplanar distance is a/(sqrt(3)) which is about 5.77 Angstroms for a=10. But here, the angles are 30°, so maybe the interplanar distance is smaller or larger?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the correct formula for a rhombohedral crystal.

In a rhombohedral system, all a, b, c are equal, and all angles are equal. The interplanar distance formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So substituting, d = a / sqrt( 3 + 6*cosθ ), since 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) =6, multiplied by cosθ.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 ( hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α ) )

But in a rhombohedral system, all angles α, β, γ are equal to θ, which is 30°. So the formula becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cosθ + 2 hl cosθ + 2 kl cosθ )

Which can be written as:

d = a / sqrt( (h + k + l)^2 + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (cosθ - 1) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. Let me think differently. Since h=k=l=1:

So the denominator inside the sqrt becomes 1+1+1 + 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 ). So that's 3 + 2*(3 * cos30) = 3 +6 * cos30.

So, as I did earlier, 3 +6*(√3/2) =3 +3√3 ≈ 3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) is about 2.863.

Then d =10 /2.863 ≈ 3.49 Angstroms? Wait, that can't be right because the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, but the interplanar distance would be smaller. Wait, no, wait. If the lattice parameter is a, which is the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in a crystal, the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms, which in a cubic structure would be the edge length. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps a is the edge length, which is the interatomic distance.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. Wait, in a cubic system, the interplanar distance for (111) is a/(sqrt(3)), which is about 5.77 Angstroms when a=10. But our rhombohedral system has angles of 30°, which would change the interplanar distance.

Wait, but my calculation gave d=10/2.863≈3.49, which is way smaller than the cubic case. Is this possible?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the general formula for any crystal system.

The general formula is 1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)/(a²).

Wait, wait, I might have missed the terms correctly. Let me look up the formula again. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I remember that the general formula for interplanar spacing is 1/d² = (h²A +k²B + l²C + 2hkD + 2hlE + 2klF)/a², where A, B, C are the reciprocals of the squares of the lattice parameters, and D, E, F involve cosines of the angles. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the unit cell vectors. Let me model the rhombohedral lattice.

In a rhombohedral lattice, the three lattice vectors are a, b, c, each of length 'a', and the angles between them are all 30 degrees. So the vectors are a, b, c with |a|=|b|=|c|=a, and the angles between any two vectors is 30 degrees.

The interplanar distance for plane (hkl) can be found by the formula:

d = | (a h + b k + c l) · n | / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is more straightforward. Alternatively, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the following formula, which I think is correct:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)/(a²)

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. Alternatively, the formula for the interplanar distance is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

where θ is the angle between the vectors. Since in this case, all angles are the same, θ=30°, and h=k=l=1.

So substituting the values:

d = 10 / sqrt(1+1+1 + 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * cos30° )

Which becomes:

d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

Simplify:

6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3) ≈5.196

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 +5.196=8.196

So sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863

So d =10 /2.863 ≈3.49 Angstroms.

Wait, but that would make the answer about 3.49, but the options provided are around 8-10 A. So I'm doing something wrong here. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Maybe the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl +kl) cosθ )^{-1/2} }

Wait, no, that's what I had. So the problem must be that I'm using the formula correctly but perhaps the given a is not the interatomic distance but something else.

Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So in a cubic system, the interatomic distance is a, which is the edge length. But in a rhombohedral system, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest neighbors, which might not be along the a-axis.

Wait, in a rhombohedral lattice, the nearest neighbors are found at a distance equal to a, but the actual interatomic distance could be along a different vector.

Wait, no, maybe the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a. Because in a rhombohedral system, the atoms are typically at the vertices of the rhombohedral unit cell, so the nearest neighbor distance is a, so a is 10 Angstroms.

But then the (111) plane's interplanar distance comes out to be about 3.49 Angstroms, but the options are much larger, so I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I inverted something. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ), and in this case, since all angles are 30°, but perhaps I have to account for their positions in the formula.

Wait, the general formula is:

1/d² = (h²/(a²) ) + (k²/(b²)) + (l²/(c²)) ) + 2( hk/(a b) cos γ + hl/(a c) cos β + kl/(b c) cos α )

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, the lattice parameter, and all angles are equal. So substituting a0 for a, b, c, and all angles as 30°, the formula becomes:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a0²) + 2( hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α )/(a0² )

Which simplifies to:

1/d² = [ h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(30°) ] / a0²

So,

d = a0 / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Where theta is 30°, and a0 is the lattice parameter, which is 10 Angstroms.

So with h=k=l=1, substituting:

Denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

So d=10 /2.863 ≈3.49 Angstroms.

But the options are much larger. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the formula uses the reciprocal of the lattice parameter. No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not the lattice parameter, but the nearest neighbor distance. In a rhombohedral system, sometimes the nearest neighbor distance is along a different vector, not a. Let me think: in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell vectors are a, b, c which are not orthogonal. The nearest neighbor distance could be along a diagonal, so the interatomic distance (nearest neighbor) might not be equal to a.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused between the lattice parameter and the interatomic distance. Suppose the lattice parameter is 'a' and the nearest neighbor distance is 'd', which could be shorter than 'a' depending on the structure.

Wait, but in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is 'a', but in a face-centered cubic, it's a*sqrt(3)/2, or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance. So if the lattice parameter is 'a', and the nearest neighbor distance is 10 Angstroms, but in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is along a different direction.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about how the interatomic distance relates to the lattice parameter in a rhombohedral system.

In a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a, the lattice parameter. But in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance could be different. For example, in a body-centered cubic, the nearest neighbor is a*sqrt(3)/2, which is less than a.

So perhaps, in this problem, the interatomic distance (nearest neighbor) is 10 Angstroms, but the lattice parameter 'a' is different.

Wait, that's a possibility. So the given 'interatomic distance' is 10 A, and I need to find the lattice parameter 'a' based on that.

Wait, but how? Let me think.

In a rhombohedral lattice, the distance between nearest neighbors can be found by considering the vectors from the origin.

The vectors are a, b, c, each with magnitude a, and the angles between them are 30 degrees.

The nearest neighbor distance is the smallest distance between any two lattice points. In a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbors are at a distance of a, but perhaps that's not the case here.

Wait, no. The nearest neighbor distance in a rhombohedral system can be determined by the magnitude of the vector that represents the edge of the unit cell. For example, the vector from (0,0,0) to (1,0,0) is a, so the distance is a. Similarly, from (0,0,0) to (0,1,0) is b, which is a. Similarly, (0,0,0) to (0,0,1) is c, which is a.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is such that all edges are equal, but the angles between the edges are 30 degrees. So the vectors a, b, c are each of length a, and the angle between any two is 30 degrees.

Wait, but the distance between the points (0,0,0) and (1,0,0) is a. The point (0,0,0) and (1,1,0) would have a distance determined by the vectors a and b.

So, the vector from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0) is a + b. The magnitude of this vector is sqrt( a² + a² + 2ab cosθ ), where θ is 30 degrees.

So magnitude squared is a² + a² + 2a² cos30 = 2a² (1 + cos30).

So the magnitude is a * sqrt( 2 (1 + cos30) )

Similarly, the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,1) would be a√[3 + 2(1 +1 +1) cos30 ] = a√[3 + 6 cos30 ] which is the same as the denominator we had earlier.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbors are along the edges, so the nearest neighbor distance is a. But in this problem, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. So if the nearest neighbor is a, then a is 10 Angstroms.

So then, the interplanar distance d for (111) would be 3.49 Angstroms, which doesn't match any of the options. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the lattice parameter 'a', so a=10 Angstroms. Then, the interplanar distance d I calculated as 3.49 Angstroms, but none of the options are that low.

Looking at the options:

A) 9.08 A

B)8.95 A

C)9.54 A

D)10.05 A

Hmm, all are around 9 Angstroms. So something's wrong with my approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps I should use the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a)(sin α, sin β, sin γ) or something like that? No, perhaps that's not the right way.

Another approach: using the general formula for interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters.

The formula is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 (1/a^2)) + (k^2 (1/b^2)) + (l^2 (1/c^2)) ) - (2hk cos γ)/(a b) - (2hl cos β)/(a c) - (2kl cos α)/(b c) )

But in a rhombohedral system, a=b=c=a0 and α=β=γ=30°, so substituting:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²)/(a0^2) + 2(hk cos30 + hl cos30 + kl cos30)/(a0^2) )

This simplifies to:

d = a0 / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos30 + 2hl cos30 + 2kl cos30 )

Which is the same as before.

So with h=k=l=1,

d= a0 / sqrt(3 + 6 cos30 ) = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2)) =10 / sqrt(3 + 3√3 )

Wait, 3 +3√3 is approximately 3 +5.196=8.196. sqrt(8.196)=2.863

So d=10 /2.863 ≈3.49 Angstroms. So that's about 3.49 Angstroms which is not in the options.

Wait, the options are all about 9 Angstroms. So I must have a wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the interplanar distance for a different plane, but no, the question is for (111).

Another possibility: Maybe the angles given are the angles between the planes, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the reciprocal of the interplanar distance.

Wait, no, the formula I used is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the rhombohedral crystal is actually a special case where the formula for interplanar distance is different.

Alternative approach: perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance in a hexagonal crystal, but that's not a rhombohedral.

Wait, another idea. Maybe I should compute the reciprocal of the interplanar distance using the Miller indices.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance is:

d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )) )

where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors, which is 30°.

So with a=10, h=k=l=1.

Wait, let me compute this again.

Denominator: sqrt(3 + 6*(cos30)).

cos30 is approx 0.8660.

So 3 +6*0.8660 =3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)= 2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49.

Hmm. So unless the given interatomic distance is not the lattice parameter, but something else.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the edge length a, but in a rhombohedral structure, the actual nearest neighbor distance is along a different direction, so perhaps the a is different.

Wait, maybe I should compute the actual nearest neighbor distance in a rhombohedral system with lattice parameter a and angles 30°, then set that equal to 10 Angstroms and solve for a, then proceed with the (111) plane.

So, the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,0) is sqrt( a² + a² + 2 a a cos30 ) = a * sqrt(2 + 2 cos30 )

= a * sqrt(2*(1 + cos30)).

cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 1 + cos30 = 1.866.

So 2*(1.866)=3.732.

sqrt(3.732)= approx 1.931.

So the distance is a * 1.931.

If the nearest neighbor distance is 10 A, then a=10 /1.931 ≈5.175 Angstroms.

So then, the interplanar distance for (111) is:

d = a / sqrt(3 +6 cos30 )

a is 5.175.

Compute denominator again: 3 +6*(0.866)=3 +5.196=8.196. sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=5.175/2.863≈1.808 Angstroms. That's even smaller, which can't be right.

Wait, but the options are all around 9 A, so this approach isn't working.

Alternative idea: perhaps I should use the volume of the unit cell or something else. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the interplanar distance. Let me think.

Another approach: in a rhombohedral system, the volume of the unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2θ + 2 cos^3θ ), where θ is the angle between the edges.

But I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for interplanar distance is:

d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )) )

But perhaps I should have used cos(60°) instead of 30°, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. The angle between the vectors is 30°, so the angle in the formula is 30°, so cos30 is correct.

Hmm. Now I'm really stuck. I think I must have made a mistake in assuming the formula, perhaps the correct formula is different.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But perhaps the angle is not the same as the angle between the lattice vectors. Wait, in some sources, the formula uses the angles between the planes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Miller indices in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal lattice vectors and then find the magnitude.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) (1, 0, 0) - (2π/a) (cos α, sin α, 0) )

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, I remember that in a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a/sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But in a rhombohedral system, it's a/(sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )) ), which is what I've been using.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is more compressed, so the interplanar distances are longer than in the cubic case. But in our case, the interplanar distance came out shorter than the cubic system, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I have to take into account that the angles are 30°, which are smaller than 90°, so the denominator in the formula would be smaller, leading to a larger interplanar distance.

Wait, let me re-express the denominator.

Denominator: sqrt(3 +6 cos30 )

cos30≈0.866, so 6 * 0.866=5.196; 3+5.196=8.196. sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So the interplanar distance is a/2.863.

If a is 10, then d≈3.49, which is smaller than the cubic case.

Wait, but in the cubic case, (111) d is 5.77 A when a=10.

So the interplanar distance is smaller because the angles are smaller, which brings the planes closer together. That makes sense.

But the options given are around 9 Angstroms, which would mean that the interplanar distance is longer than the lattice parameter, which doesn't make sense because the lattice parameter is the maximum possible distance along the axes.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me look for another approach.

Wait, another approach: using the general formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters.

The formula is:

d = [ (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + ... ) ]^-0.5, but I'm not recalling it correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula involving the metric tensor. The metric tensor (g_ik) for a rhombohedral system is:

g_11 = a²

g_22 = a²

g_33 = a²

g_12 = g_13 = g_23 = a² cosθ

The interplanar distance is then given by:

d = [ (h^2 g_11 +k^2 g_22 + l^2 g_33 + 2 h k g_12 + 2 h l g_13 + 2 k l g_23 ) ]^-0.5

So substituting the values:

h=k=l=1, theta=30°, a=10.

g_11 = a² =100

g_12 =100 cos30=100*(√3/2)=50√3≈86.60

g_13 = same as g_12.

g_23 = same as g_12.

So the numerator inside the square root is:

(1^2 *100 ) + (1^2 *100 ) + (1^2 *100 ) + 2*1*1*86.60 + 2*1*1*86.60 +2*1*1*86.60

Compute each term:

h² g11=100

k² g22=100

l² g33=100

2hk g12=2 *1*1*86.60= 173.2

2hl g13= same as above, 173.2

2kl g23= same as above, 173.2

So sum all terms:

100 +100 +100=300

173.2 +173.2 +173.2=519.6

Total sum:300 +519.6=819.6

So sqrt(819.6) = approx 28.63.

Thus, d=1/sqrt(819.6) =1/28.63 ≈0.0349 Angstroms^-1.

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, because the formula for d is 1/(sqrt(...)), but wait, no, the formula is d = 1 / sqrt( sum terms ), so in this case:

d = 1 / sqrt(819.6) = 1/28.63 ≈0.0349 Angstroms^-1.

Wait, that can't be right because the units don't match. Wait, no, wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the correct formula is d = 1/sqrt( sum terms ), where sum terms is in (Angstrom^-2).

Wait, so each g_ik term is (1/Angstrom)^2, so sum is in (1/Angstrom^2), sqrt gives 1/Angstrom, so d = [1/(1/Angstrom)] = Angstrom.

Wait, so let's compute the sum inside the sqrt:

sum = 300 + 519.6 =819.6 (1/Angstrom²)

sqrt(819.6) = approx 28.63 (1/Angstrom)

So d =1/(28.63 (1/Angstrom)) )= 0.0349 Angstroms.

But that's way too small. So I must have made a mistake in the metric tensor approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula with the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me think again.

The formula for interplanar distance is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 g_11 +k^2 g_22 +l^2 g_33 + 2 hk g_12 + 2 hl g_13 + 2 kl g_23 ) )

So in this case:

sum =3*(1^2 *100) + 3*(2*1*1 * 86.60 )

sum =300 + 3*(173.2) =300 + 519.6=819.6.

So sqrt(819.6)=28.63.

d=1/28.63≈0.0349 Angstrom^-1.

Wait, but this gives d in reciprocal Angstroms, which is incorrect.

Wait, no, I think I messed up the units. The metric tensor is in terms of a², which is (10 Angstrom)^2=100 A².

So, each term in the sum is in A².

So the sum is 819.6 A².

sqrt(819.6 A² )= 28.63 A.

So d=1 / (28.63 A ) ≈0.0349 A^{-1}.

Wait, that can't be right. I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is d = sqrt( [h^2 g_11 +k^2 g_22 + l^2 g_33 + ... ] )^{-1}.

Wait, no, the correct formula is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 g_11 +k^2 g_22 + l^2 g_33 + 2 hk g_12 + 2 hl g_13 + 2 kl g_23 ) )

So the units inside the sqrt are (A²), so sqrt gives A, and 1 over that is 1/A.

But interplanar distance is in A, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = sqrt( (h g11 +k g12 + l g13)^2 + ... )^-1.

No, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternative idea: perhaps I should look for a calculator approach, but given I can't, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the denominator.

Denominator is sqrt(3 +6 cos30) = sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2))= sqrt(3 +3√3) ≈ sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So if I have a=10, d=10/2.863≈3.49 A.

But the options are all around 9 A. So perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given angles are the angles between the planes, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the denominator. No, that would give a larger d, but not 9 A.

Wait, if the denominator were sqrt(3 -6 cos30), that would give sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.

So I'm stuck. I think I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but looking at the options, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute 3 +6 cos30 again.

cos30=√3/2≈0.8660.

6 *0.8660=5.196.

3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49.

But options are A)9.08, B)8.95, C)9.54, D)10.05.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 10 * (sqrt(3 +6 cos30)) / (sqrt(3)).

Wait, because in a cubic system, d is a/sqrt(3), which is about 5.77. But in our case, the denominator is sqrt(3 +6 cos30)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So 5.77 /2.863≈2.015.

So 10 * 2.015 ≈20.15, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 10 * sqrt(3)/sqrt(3 +6 cos30).

sqrt(3)=1.732. sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So 1.732/2.863≈0.605. 10*0.605≈6.05. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the formula, and the correct formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) )^{-1}.

Wait, no, that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the angles are in degrees, but I'm using cos in radians.

No, because when I compute cos(30 degrees) in calculator, it's 0.866, which I used.

Another possibility: perhaps the angles are 150 degrees, not 30, but that's not what the question says.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use 60 degrees. Let's try that.

If theta=60°, cos(theta)=0.5.

So denominator: 3 +6*0.5=3+3=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.08 Angstroms. Still not matching options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / [sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosγ) ) ]

But substituting alpha=beta=gamma=30°, h=k=l=1:

d=10 / sqrt(3 + 2*(1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30 ) )

=10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(0.866) )

=10 / sqrt(3 +5.196)=10 / sqrt(8.196)=3.49.

Same as before.

I think I have to conclude that either the options are incorrect or I have a misunderstanding of the formula. But given the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the angles are the angles between the planes, not the vectors. No, that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the formula should use cos(180-30)=cos(150°)=-0.866. Let me try that.

So denominator:3 +6*(-0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196. That's impossible, so no.

So I think the only conclusion is that the correct answer is approximately 3.49 Angstroms, but it's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a', but the nearest neighbor distance which isn't along the a-axis. Let me try that.

In a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbor distance can be calculated using the vector from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1), which is the diagonal.

Wait, the vector (1,1,1) in the rhombohedral system has magnitude:

sqrt( a² + a² + a² + 2a² cos30 + 2a² cos30 + 2a² cos30 ).

Which is a*sqrt(3 +6 cos30) = a *sqrt(8.196)=a*2.863.

If this is the nearest neighbor distance, set to 10 A.

So a*2.863=10 → a=10/2.863≈3.49 A.

Now, compute the interplanar distance for (111) plane.

Wait, the interplanar distance is d= a / sqrt(3 +6 cos30) )=3.49 /2.863≈1.218 A. That's even smaller, which doesn't fit the options.

I'm really stuck. I think I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reciprocal of the interplanar distance. If d is 3.49 A, then 1/d is about 0.2863 Å^-1. But that's not helpful.

Another idea: perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )) ), but perhaps the angle θ is 60°, not 30°. Let's try that.

cos60=0.5.

Denominator: sqrt(3 +6*0.5)=sqrt(3+3)=sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.08 A. Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the angle is 150°, which gives cos150=-0.866.

Denominator:3 +6*(-0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196. Impossible.

Hmm. Perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

The options are all around 9 A. Let's see: for d=9 A, what would the denominator be?

d=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49, but 10/9=1.111, which would mean the denominator is 10/9=1.111.

Wait, 10/ sqrt( sum )=9 → sqrt( sum )=10/9 ≈1.111 → sum=1.234.

But sum is 3 +6 cos30=8.196, so this doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 10 * sqrt(3 +6 cos30)/sqrt(3).

Wait, sqrt(3)=1.732.

So 10 * (2.863)/1.732≈10*1.653≈16.53. No, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 10 * sqrt(3 +6 cos30) / (sqrt(3 +6 cos60)).

Wait, cos60=0.5. So sqrt(3 +6*0.5)=sqrt(6)=2.449.

So 10 * 2.863/2.449≈10*(1.17)=11.7. Not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is different and I should use 2d = a / (sqrt(...)).

So, 2d=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49 →d=1.745. No, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the sum.

Wait, maybe I should compute 1/d = sqrt( sum ) → d =1/sqrt(8.196) → d≈0.1139 A, which is way too small.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to go with my initial calculation of approximately 3.49 A, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct answer is option C)9.54 A, perhaps due to a miscalculation.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula uses 2* the denominator.

Wait, if the denominator is 2.863 and a=10, then 10/2.863≈3.49. If the formula is a/(2 denominator), then 10/(2*2.863)=1.745. No, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator and multiply by a.

Wait, 1/denominator= 1/2.863≈0.349.

So a=10, d=10 *0.349≈3.49.

Same result.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A)9.08 A. Let me see.

What if I used cos(60) instead of cos(30), but in a different way.

Wait, if I made a mistake and used cos60=0.5, then denominator becomes sqrt(3 +6*0.5)=sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.08. Still not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the interplanar distance using the volume of the unit cell.

The volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2θ + 2 cos^3θ )

For θ=30°, V=10^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3 )

Compute inside sqrt:

1 -3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495).

0.75 *3=2.25; 0.6495*2=1.299.

So 1-2.25 +1.299= (1+1.299) -2.25 = 2.299 -2.25=0.049.

So V=1000 * sqrt(0.049)=1000 * 0.221≈221 A^3.

But I'm not sure how this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance uses the volume.

Wait, perhaps d = a * sqrt(3) / ( sqrt(3 +6 cosθ) )

Which would be 10*1.732/2.863≈ (17.32)/2.863≈6.05 A. Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I have to go with the calculation I did earlier, which gives approximately 3.49 Angstroms, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A)9.08 A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different, and I should compute the reciprocal.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance is a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ).

But that would give d= a * sqrt( (denominator) ) / sqrt(3 ), which is a * 2.863 /1.732≈10 *1.653≈16.53 A. Not an option.

I think I'm stuck and have to make an educated guess. Since the options are around 9 A, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the denominator should be sqrt(3 -6 cos30).

Wait, that would give sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary, so no.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the negative cosine. So denominator would be sqrt(3 +6*(-cos30)).

Which would be sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), still impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses cos(180-30)=cos150=-0.866.

So denominator becomes sqrt(3 +6*(-0.866))=sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.

No.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. My initial calculation gives 3.49 A, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option A)9.08 A, but I'm not sure how to get there.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula used is:

\[
d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)}}
\]

### Key Information:
- **Interatomic distance (lattice parameter \( a \))**: \( 10 \, \text{Å} \)
- **Angles**: \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \)
- **Miller indices**: \( h = k = l = 1 \)

### Substituting Values:
1. **Denominator Calculation**:
   - \( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3 \)
   - \( 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma) = 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ) \)
   - \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \)
   - \( 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866) = 2(0.866 + 0.866 + 0.866) = 2(2.598) = 5.196 \)
   - Total denominator inside the square root: \( 3 + 5.196 = 8.196 \)

2. **Square Root of Denominator**:
   - \( \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863 \)

3. **Interplanar Distance**:
   - \( d = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \)

### Analysis of Options:
The calculated interplanar distance is approximately \( 3.49 \, \text{Å} \), which does not match any of the provided options (\( 9.08, 8.95, 9.54, 10.05 \, \text{Å} \)). This discrepancy suggests either an error in the formula or the interpretation of the given interatomic distance. However, since the options are all around \( 9 \, \text{Å} \), the closest plausible answer based on the problem setup is **A) 9.08 Å**.

### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch between the calculated value and the provided options, and assuming the problem intends for one of the options to be correct, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: A**
