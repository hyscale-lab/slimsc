Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. It says that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is denoted as Ay. The matrix form is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The S matrix has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0).

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Then, among the given options, I need to determine which statement is correct.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I should write out the matrix for Ay. Since it's c multiplied by S, I can compute each element by multiplying the corresponding element in S by c.

Wait, so S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So multiplying by c, Ay becomes:
[ 0 * c      (-i)*c ]
[ i * c      0 * c ]

So, substituting c = h/(4π), that would make the elements:

Ay = [ 0           (-i h)/(4π) ]
      [ (i h)/(4π)  0          ]

Now, the eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

So let's set up the matrix (Ay - λI):

[ -λ     (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ] = λ² - [ (i * (-i) * h^2 ) / (4π)^2 ) ]

Wait, let me compute that. The product of the off-diagonal terms is (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) = (-i)(i) * (h²)/(4π)^2.

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So the product is 1*(h²)/(16 π²) ) = h²/(16 π²).

So the determinant equation becomes λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0. Therefore, λ² = h²/(16 π²), so λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait. Wait a second. There's a mistake here. Let me check the calculation again. Because S is a 2x2 matrix, and in quantum mechanics, S is related to the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, wait, wait! Because the Pauli Y matrix is usually given as:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Which is exactly the S given here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

But the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So if S has eigenvalues ±1, then Ay = c S would have eigenvalues c*(±1). Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues of Ay would be ± h/(4π).

Wait, that's a much simpler way to think about it
