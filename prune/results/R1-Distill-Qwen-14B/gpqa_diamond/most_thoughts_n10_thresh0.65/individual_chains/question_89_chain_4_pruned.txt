Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C to form product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows specific peaks: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). There's also an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I remember is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester.

So, what's happening in the first reaction? 1,3-dibromoadamantane is reacting with KOH. I recall that when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with a strong base like KOH, an elimination reaction can occur, forming an alkene. But wait, since both bromines are on adjacent carbons in adamantane, which is a diamondoid structure, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. Alternatively, if it's a 1,3-dibromo compound, perhaps it's more about forming an epoxide? No, wait, KOH isn't typically used for epoxidation. Or maybe it's a substitution reaction. Hmm.

Wait, the IR spectrum shows a strong peak around 1720 cm⁻¹, which suggests a carbonyl group. So maybe instead of elimination, it's a substitution. Oh, wait, when dihalides react with a strong base like KOH, sometimes they can form a ketone if the two leaving groups are on adjacent carbons but part of a bridge structure. Alternatively, maybe it's an E2 elimination forming a diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters. Or perhaps a Fittig reaction? No, that's for aryl halides. Wait, another thought: when dihalides are treated with a strong base, sometimes they undergo a double elimination, forming an alkene, but in this case, maybe the structure allows for a different product.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—adamantane has a very rigid structure. So
