Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. Half of its surface (one hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor for these spots is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When only one hemisphere is spotty, the brightness variations observed as the star rotates are similar to those caused by an exoplanet. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted.

Hmm, so I'm a bit rusty, but I think I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is related to the area of the planet compared to the star. The formula is something like delta F = (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area scales with the square of the radius. But wait, this might not directly apply here because the spots are causing a dimming effect as the star rotates, not a planetary transit.

Wait, the problem says that the spots cause variations in brightness. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the star appears dimmer because the spots are cooler and thus emit less light. As the star rotates, the spotted side comes into and goes out of view, causing the brightness to dip periodically. But if the star was not spotted, an exoplanet would cause a similar dip when it transits. So we're to find the exoplanet's radius such that the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same.

Wait, but wait a second. The star's brightness variation due to spots is a bit different from a planet's transit. Because the spots are on the surface, when the spotted area is facing us (in the case of the star's rotation), the observed flux changes. The planet, on the other hand, blocks a part of the star's light when it transits.

So, for the star, the variation in brightness depends on the area of the spotted regions. The filling factor is 20%, which means 20% of the hemisphere is covered in spots. Since the star's radius is same as the Sun's, but only half of it (the hemisphere) is spotted. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 (filling factor) * 0.5
