Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that, which is 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs. But wait, the problem says they have negligible mass, so I don't think mass will come into play here. They're asking about the minimum energy of the system, which I assume is the electric potential energy.

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the setup is that one charge is at the center, fixed, and the other 12 are all 2 meters away from it.

I remember that the electric potential energy (U) of a system of point charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But wait, in this case, the charges are identical, so I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair once.

Wait, the formula for electric potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. Since all the charges are the same, each pair will contribute the same amount. But how many pairs are there?

Wait, no. Because the system has one charge fixed at P and the others around it. So the 13th charge at P is fixed, and the 12 others are at 2m from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the 13th charge. So the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 charges contributes to the total.

But also, the 12 charges are each 2m away from the center, but what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Oh wait, since they're all the same and identical, the potential energy between any two of them would contribute as well. But the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but I don't know if they're fixed relative to each other or can move. Hmm, but the system is isolated, so the potential energy between the 12 charges also contributes to the total.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem describes the system as 13 charges, 12 at 2m from P, and 1 at P. So
