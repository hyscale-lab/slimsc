Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question is about.

So, the state is given as |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, these are the standard basis states for spin-1/2 particles, right? Like the eigenstates of S_z. 

The question is asking for two things: first, the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of some operator A, and second, the average value of that operator. 

The operator A has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 when i ≠ j, and zero otherwise. Wait, that's an interesting matrix. Let me think about its structure. For a 2x2 matrix, since there are two basis states, the matrix would look like:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Because the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So this operator is actually (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, I think. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yeah. So A is proportional to sigma_x.

But wait, in the problem statement, the matrix is A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j, else zero. So yeah, exactly, it's (ħ/2)(sigma_x). 

So the eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of A. So the operator A's eigenstates are probably the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are |+x> and |-x>, the spin-up and spin-down along the x-axis. 

But wait, the question is about measuring in the eigenstates of A. So, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of A, and the probabilities are the squares of the amplitudes when the state is expressed in those eigenstates.

So first, I need to find the eigenstates and eigenvalues of operator A. Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1 with corresponding eigenvectors |+x> and |-x>, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of sigma_x and then scale them.

Wait, let me think. The operator A is (ħ/2) * sigma
