Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and figuring out the mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question says X is a meson resonance with some given parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all different distances in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. So I need to find the mean decay distance.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. Like, particles that live longer can travel further before decaying. The formula I think is distance equals velocity multiplied by lifetime. So d = v * τ. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula here.

First, I think I need to find the lifetime τ of the meson. Oh right, the lifetime is connected to the particle's width. The width Γ is related to the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the lifetime and energy are inversely related. The formula Γ ≈ ħ/τ, but wait, I think it's actually Γ = ħ / τ. Or wait, no, because the uncertainty in energy ΔE is Γ/2, so maybe it's Γ = ħ/τ? Or is it Γ = ħ/ (2τ) )? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, I think the correct relation is Γ = ħ / τ. Because if the width Γ is the energy uncertainty, then the time uncertainty τ relates as Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Once I have τ, I can find the lifetime.

But wait, there's another step. The velocity v of the particle. Since the meson is moving, I need to find its speed. The production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, but the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. So I should probably calculate the velocity using relativistic mechanics.

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = gamma * m c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is equal to E/(m c^2). But wait, here the units are in GeV, so maybe I can use natural units where c=1. So E in GeV, m in GeV/c², but perhaps for calculation, I can treat them as units that cancel out.

So the Lorentz factor gamma is E/(m c²). But if I'm in units where c=1, then gamma = E/(m).

Wait, E is given as 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So gamma would be 8 / 1.2. Let me calculate that: 8 / 1.2 is approximately 6.666... So gamma is about 6.6667.

Then, the velocity beta is v/c. The relation between gamma and beta is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So solving for beta:

gamma^2 = 1 / (1 - beta^2)
1 - beta^2 = 1/gamma^2
beta^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2
beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)

Plugging in gamma ≈ 6.6667:

1/gamma^2 = 1/(44.444...) ≈ 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Then sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887. So v = beta c ≈ 0.9887c.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me double-check. Gamma for E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV is indeed 8/1.2 = 6.666..., correct? So that part is right.

Then, beta squared is 1 - (1/gamma²) = 1 - (1/(44.444)) ≈ 1 - 0.0225=0.9775. Square root gives about 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887, so the velocity is roughly 0.9887 * c.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 8/1.2 exactly. 1.2 GeV is 6/5 GeV, so 8 divided by (6/5) is 8*(5/6) = 40/6 = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

So 1/gamma^2 is 1/(400/9) )= 9/400 =0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775
