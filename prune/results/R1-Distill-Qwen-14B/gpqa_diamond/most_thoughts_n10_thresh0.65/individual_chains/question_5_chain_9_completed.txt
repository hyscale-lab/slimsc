Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to wrap my head around it. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along a certain direction. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and eigenvectors represent the possible states when a measurement is made.

Wait, the operator is given along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right, so the direction is in the x-z plane, which means the angle theta is measured from the z-axis, and phi is zero because it's in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

The operator P is a vector operator, probably the Pauli matrices scaled by some factors. The components P_x, P_y, P_z are given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So each component is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write them down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, I think I remember that these are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and their eigenvalues are ±1, so when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues become ±ħ/2. That makes sense.

The problem asks for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P along direction n. Oh right, when you have an operator in an arbitrary direction, you need to consider the operator as a combination of its components. So the operator P along n is given by P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So n is a unit vector. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, right? Because in the x-z plane, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So the components are (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Wait, but in our case, the direction is arbitrary, but lying in the x-z plane, so direction n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator P is P = (n_x * P_x) + (n_z * P_z). Substituting the matrices:

P = (n_x * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]] ) 
= (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, let me compute that matrix:

First term from P_z is [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]] multiplied by ħ/2. The P_x term is [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]] multiplied by ħ/2. Adding them together:

So the (1,1) element is (n_z * ħ/2 + 0) = (n_z ħ/2)
(1,2) is (n_x ħ/2)
(2,1) is same as (1,2)
(2,2) is (-n_z ħ/2 + 0) = (-n_z ħ/2)
So the matrix is:

[ [n_z ħ/2, n_x ħ/2],
  [n_x ħ/2, -n_z ħ/2 ] ]

Hmm, so the operator P is this matrix. Now, we're looking for an eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, let me write this in terms of matrices. Let me call the eigenvector as [a; b], normalized (so |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1), and we're going to find a and b.

So, the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a'; b']

Where [a'; b'] is the eigenvector.

Divide both sides by ħ/2:

[ n_z a + n_x b , n_x a - n_z b ] = [ a' ; b' ]

But since [a'; b'] is a scalar multiple of [a; b], we have:

n_z a + n_x b = λ a
n_x a - n_z b = λ b

Where λ is the eigenvalue, which is +1 in this case because we're looking for eigenvalue +ħ/2. Wait, wait, because we already factored out ħ/2. So in the equation, our matrix equation after factoring out ħ/2 gives us eigenvalues which are ±1 times ħ/2. So for this problem, the eigenvalue is +1 in that scaled equation.

So, the eigenvalue equation becomes:

n_z a + n_x b = a        (1)
n_x a - n_z b = b        (2)

So, the two equations are:

( n_z - 1 ) a + n_x b = 0   (from equation 1)
n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0   (from equation 2)

We can write this as a homogeneous system:

[ (n_z - 1)   n_x         ] [a]   = 0
[ n_x         -(n_z +1) ] [b] 

For non-trivial solutions, the determinant must be zero.

So determinant D = (n_z -1)(- (n_z +1)) - (n_x)^2 = 0 ?

Wait, let me compute D:

D = [ (n_z -1) * (-n_z -1) ) ] - [ n_x^2 ]

= [ (-n_z^2 -n_z + n_z +1 ) ] - n_x^2 

Simplify inside the brackets:

= [ (-n_z^2 + 1) ] - n_x^2 

But n_z^2 + n_x^2 = 1, since n is a unit vector.

So D = ( -(n_z^2) +1 ) - n_x^2 
= (1 - n_z^2) - n_x^2 
= 1 - (n_z^2 + n_x^2) 
= 1 - 1 = 0 

So the determinant is zero, which makes sense because the matrix is singular when the eigenvalue is considered. So, the system of equations has non-trivial solutions.

So, let's take the first equation:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

We can express b in terms of a.

n_x b = (1 - n_z) a → b = (1 - n_z)/(n_x) a 

But wait, if n_x is zero, we'd have a problem, but n is in the x-z plane. If n_x is zero, then the direction is along z. But let's consider the general case where n_x is not zero.

So, b = [(1 - n_z)/n_x ] a 

Now, the eigenvector is [a; b] = a [1; (1 - n_z)/n_x ]

But we can also write this as:

a = 1 (normalization factor aside)
b = (1 - n_z)/n_x

Wait, but since the eigenvector can be any scalar multiple, we can set a = 1, and then b = (1 - n_z)/n_x.

Wait, but let's see if these satisfy the second equation as well.

From the second equation:

n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0 

Substituting a =1 and b = (1 - n_z)/n_x:

n_x * 1 - (n_z +1) * (1 - n_z)/n_x = 0

Let me compute this:

n_x - [ (n_z +1)(1 - n_z) ) ] /n_x =0

Multiply both sides by n_x:

(n_x)^2 - (n_z +1)(1 - n_z) = 0 

Expand the second term:

(1 - n_z^2 + 1 - n_z + ... wait, better to multiply it out.

(n_z +1)(1 - n_z) = (1)(1) + (1)(-n_z) + (n_z)(1) + (n_z)(-n_z)
= 1 - n_z + n_z - n_z^2 
= 1 - n_z^2 

So,

(n_x)^2 - (1 - n_z^2) =0 

But (n_x)^2 + n_z^2 =1 → (n_x)^2 = 1 - n_z^2 

Substituting:

(1 - n_z^2) - (1 - n_z^2) =0 → 0=0. So the equations are consistent.

So, the eigenvector is of the form [1; (1 - n_z)/n_x ]

Wait, but this is in the a=1 case. Now, we need to normalize this vector.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

Compute |b|^2:

| (1 - n_z)/n_x |^2 = (1 - n_z)^2 / (n_x^2 )

So,

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1 + (1 - n_z)^2 / n_x^2 = [n_x^2 + (1 - n_z)^2 ] / n_x^2 

But n_x^2 + (1 - n_z)^2 = n_x^2 + 1 - 2 n_z + n_z^2 

But n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1 → substituting:

= 1 + 1 -2 n_z 

= 2(1 - n_z )

So,

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = [2(1 - n_z)] / n_x^2 

Wait, but wait, the numerator is 2(1 - n_z) and the denominator is n_x^2. So,

The norm squared is [2(1 -n_z)] / (n_x^2) 

But n_x^2 = 1 -n_z^2 → since n_x^2 +n_z^2=1.

So,

= 2(1 -n_z) / (1 -n_z^2 )

Factor denominator: 1 - n_z^2 = (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z)

So,

= 2(1 -n_z) / [ (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ] = 2/(1 +n_z )

So,

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 2/(1 +n_z ) 

We need the norm to be 1, so the eigenvector is [1; (1-n_z)/n_x ] multiplied by sqrt( [1 +n_z ]/2 )

So,

a = sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) * 1 
b = sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) * (1 -n_z)/n_x 

But let's see. Wait, the factor is sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), because the norm is sqrt(2/(1 +n_z )) → the inverse.

Wait, the norm squared is 2/(1 +n_z ), so the normalization factor is sqrt( (1 +n_z )/2 )

So, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) , (1 -n_z)/n_x * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) ]

Let me write it as:

a = sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

b = [ (1 - n_z) / (n_x) ] * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

Hmm, but maybe I should express this in terms of theta. Because n_z is cos(theta), since in the x-z plane, the z-component is cos(theta). So, n_z = cos(theta), n_x = sin(theta).

So, substituting:

a = sqrt( (1 + cos(theta))/2 )

b = [ (1 - cos(theta)) / sin(theta) ] * sqrt( (1 + cos(theta))/2 )

Wait, let's compute a and b.

First, a = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = cos(theta/2), because I remember the half-angle identity: cos^2(theta/2) = (1 + cosθ)/2.

So a = cos(theta/2).

Similarly, for b:

(1 - cosθ) = 2 sin^2(theta/2)

So,

(1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin^2(theta/2)] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] 
= [ sin(theta/2) ] / [ cos(theta/2) ) ]
= tan(theta/2 )

Wait, let me see:

Wait, (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin^2(theta/2 )

And sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

So,

(1 - cosθ)/ sinθ = [2 sin^2(theta/2)] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] 
= [ sin(theta/2) ] / [ cos(theta/2) ) ]
= tan(theta/2 )

So,

b = tan(theta/2 ) * sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 )

But sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) is cos(theta/2 ), so:

b = tan(theta/2 ) * cos(theta/2 )

= [ sin(theta/2) / cos(theta/2) ) ] * cos(theta/2 )
= sin(theta/2 )

So, putting it together:

a = cos(theta/2 )

b = sin(theta/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Wait, but wait, that's the same as option C, which is (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )). But looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ))

Option D is (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2 ), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2 ) )

Wait, but wait a second. The eigenvector we found is [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

But looking at the options, option C is exactly this. So why would the options have other possibilities?

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let's think again.

Wait, the operator given is P. But when you have spin-1/2 particles, the spin operator is given by S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So for spin along a direction n, the operator is S·n = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z )

In this problem, the operator P is given as (ħ/2) matrices. So, P is the spin operator, each component P_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, etc.

Wait, but the eigenvector found is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Which is the standard eigenvector for spin-up along the z-axis when theta is zero. Wait, but in our case, the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane.

Wait another thing: when theta is the polar angle, the standard basis for spin-up along n is [ cos(theta/2 ), e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2 ) ]

But in our problem, phi is zero, since direction is in x-z plane. So phi=0, so the standard spin-up state is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Which matches our result. So option C is correct.

But looking at the options, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like a spherical harmonic, but that's for a state with well-defined l=1, m.

Option C seems correct, but let's look at the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) )

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2 ), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2 ) )

Wait, but the options have hbar multiplied in them, which is not part of the eigenvector. Because the eigenvector is a unit vector, so the components should have magnitude 1. But in option D, the terms are multiplied by sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar, which if hbar is Planck's constant, it's a physical quantity, not a dimensionless factor.

So that can't be right. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but the question says the operator is P along an arbitrary direction n. Wait, but in the problem statement, the eigenvector corresponds to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the analysis I did holds.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Which is option C.

But wait, the options don't have hbar in them except for option D. So perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization.

Wait, in the process, I had to multiply by the normalization factor sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), which I expressed in terms of cos(theta/2 ). So the components are [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

That's correct.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: (\cos(\theta/2), \sin (\theta/2))

Yes, that's exactly what I got. So the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be represented as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is then expressed as:

\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Substituting $\vec{P}$ and dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, the eigenvalue equation becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

\[
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \quad n_x a - (n_z + 1)b = 0.
\]

For non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the system must vanish, which it does since $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector ($n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$). Solving the system, the eigenvector is found to be proportional to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \frac{1 - n_z}{n_x} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Normalizing this vector, the normalized eigenvector becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \frac{1 - n_z}{n_x} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Using the trigonometric identities $\cos\theta = n_z$ and $\sin\theta = n_x$, the components are simplified to:

\[
a = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad b = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it introduces an unnecessary factor of $\hbar$ and does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it represents a spherical harmonic and does not correspond to the eigenvector of $\vec{P}$.
- **Option C**: Correct, as it matches the derived eigenvector.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it introduces an unnecessary factor of $\hbar$ and modifies the coefficients.

The correct answer is **Option C**.

Answer: C
