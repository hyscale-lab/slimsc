Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question gives a density matrix rho as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to find its geometrical position in qubit space from the given options. The options are vectors in 3D space, which probably refers to the Bloch sphere representation.

Wait, density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors, like |psi><psi|, but mixed states are statistical ensembles. The given rho looks like it's a classical mixture of |0> and |1> states.

So, for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector (r) has components (x, y, z). The density matrix rho can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The standard form is rho = (I + r·sigma)/2, where sigma are the Pauli matrices, and I is the identity matrix.

Let me write down the given rho. Expanding it, rho equals (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute each term. |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1,0. Similarly, |1><1| is diagonal with 0,1. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]] divided by 2. So rho is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. That's the identity matrix multiplied by 0.5.

Wait, the identity matrix is (I), so rho is (I)/2. Comparing that to the Bloch form, which is (I + r_x sigma_x + r_y sigma_y + r_z sigma_z)/2. So if rho is I/2, that implies all the coefficients r_x, r_y, r_z are zero. Because I/2 = (I + 0)/2.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That corresponds to the completely mixed state in the middle of the Bloch sphere, right? Because the origin is the maximally mixed state when the qubit is in a superposition of all possible states with equal probability.

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So that's the answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, where the qubit is in a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector.

Expanding \(\rho\), we find:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right) = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Comparing this to the Bloch form, we see that all components of the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) (i.e., \(r_x\), \(r_y\), and \(r_z\)) must be zero. This corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, which represents the maximally mixed state.

From the given options, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the Bloch vector is \((0,0,0)\).

Answer: C
