Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what reagents A and B are. Let me take it step by step. 

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is also known as methylacetone, right? Its structure is (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts with NaCN, which is a nucleophile, what usually happens in such cases?

I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (CN-), it adds to the carbonyl group. But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. It's (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Hmm, wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the formula would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or perhaps it's (CH3)C(OH)(CH2CN)CH3? Wait, but the formula would be C5H9NO, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. So the reaction is a nucleophilic addition. But after adding CN-, we need to protonate it to form the alcohol. Oh wait, but the product is a nitrile adjacent to an alcohol group. Hmm, maybe it's a two-step process. Wait, perhaps the initial addition forms the cyanohydrin.

Wait a minute, I think that when a ketone reacts with NaCN in a protic solvent, it forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanide adds to the carbonyl, and then a proton is taken from somewhere to form the alcohol. So the product is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached.

But the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons with a nitrile group. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, but wait, the starting material is butan-2-one which is (CH3)2CO. So when
