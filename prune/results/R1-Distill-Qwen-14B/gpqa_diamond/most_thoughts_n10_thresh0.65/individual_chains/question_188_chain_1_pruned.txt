Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, which I'm a bit rusty on, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral, right. So rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all angles equal too. Oh wait, but wait, in some cases, rhombohedral can be either acute or obtuse, depending on the angles. But in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees, which are acute.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, wait, interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, so that's the a parameter of the crystal structure, right? Or is it the lattice parameter? Because in a cubic system, the interatomic distance is usually the lattice parameter a, but here it's a rhombohedral system, which is not cubic. So the lattice vectors are all the same length, a, but the angles between them are 30 degrees each.

The problem is to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the lattice vectors. Oh wait, the formula is d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos(alpha) + ... wait, no, I think that's for non-cubic systems. Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a
