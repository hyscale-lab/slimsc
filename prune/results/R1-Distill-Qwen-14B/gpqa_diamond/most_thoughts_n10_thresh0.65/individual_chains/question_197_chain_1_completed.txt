Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, I'll look at the spectroscopic data provided. The IR and NMR data should tell me what the structure of Compound X is. Once I know that, I can determine what reaction it undergoes with red phosphorus and HI.

Let me start with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which is a broad region, probably indicating O-H stretch. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl (C=O) peak. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ regions might be aromatic C=C stretches, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the 1610 could be a carbonyl in another context, but given 1720 is present, maybe the 1610 is aromatic.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, likely an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid. Because if it were an aromatic proton, the integration would probably be higher and the splitting different. Wait, but a broad singlet could also be an exchange with water, like in an acid.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest coupling between two protons each. So maybe a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 and 4 or something similar. The two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm would mean two sets of protons that are each split into doublets. So that's probably a para-substituted benzene with two substituents: maybe a substituent that's deactivating, like a carbonyl group.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet, integrating for one proton. Could be a CH group adjacent to something else. Maybe a CH next to a carbonyl or part of an isopropyl group or something.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons, possibly part of a chain, maybe next to a branching point. Like adjacent to a CH2 or a CH that's part of a longer chain.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons as a doublet? Wait, no. Wait, 3H as a doublet. That's typical of a methyl group attached to something, like a CH2 or a carbonyl. So maybe a CH2CH(CH3) group or something like that.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet (maybe) for three protons. That's usually a terminal CH3, like in an ethyl group. So maybe a CH2CH3 somewhere.

Putting this together. The IR has a strong carbonyl, so maybe the compound is a substituted benzoic acid. The broad peak at 10.5 ppm would make sense for a carboxylic acid proton. So in the NMR, the two doublets in the aromatic region suggest the ring has substituents at para positions. Let me imagine a benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent at the para position.

Wait, but the substituents don't have to be para; perhaps they're at positions that create the two doublets. Another possibility is that there's a substituent meta to another, but that would complicate the splitting. Alternatively, an ortho substituent would lead to more splitting, but that's not the case here. So probably, the substituents are para.

So, the benzene ring has a substituent that's a -COOH group and another substituent which is an alkyl group perhaps. Because the NMR shows a CH group (2.9 ppm), a CH2 (1.7), a methyl (1.4 ppm, d), and a terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm, t). That suggests a chain attached to the ring.

Let me think about the substituent structure. The NMR has a 1H at 2.9 ppm (m), which could be a CH connected to something. The 1.7 ppm is two Hs, maybe as part of a CH2 adjacent to the CH. Then, the 1.4 ppm is a methyl as a doublet—so perhaps it's attached to a CH that's connected to another group. For example, a structure like -(CH2)n-CH(CH3)-. Or maybe a propyl chain.

Wait, the 1H at 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d) for 3H, which is typical for a methyl group attached to a CH2 or a CH. So perhaps the substituent is a propyl group or something with branching.

Looking at the integration: the aromatic Hs are 2H each, so four aromatic Hs in total. That suggests that the ring is para-substituted because each substituent takes up two positions, resulting in two sets of doublets. So, the structure could be a phenyl group with a substituent at position 1 and another at position 4.

Wait, but if it's a benzene ring with two substituents, each at para positions, then each substituent would take two Hs? No, each substituent takes one H if it's a single substituent, but if they're two substituents, each at opposite ends, each substituent would lead to two Hs being split. Or wait, perhaps the substituent is a group that's attached to the ring and has branching.

Wait, let me try to sketch this. The benzene ring has a COOH group at position 1 and another substituent at position 4. So, each of these substituents would cause the adjacent Hs to split into doublets. Hence, the two doublets in the NMR.

The substituent at position 4: looking at the NMR, the other groups are a CH, a CH2, and two CH3 groups. So perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)2 group? Or maybe a propyl group with branching.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows 2.9 (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), and 0.9 (t,3H). That seems like a propyl chain with a branch. Let's think: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that's four carbons. Alternatively, maybe CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH? No.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Like -CH2-CH(CH3)-something. Let me think about the integration.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is likely a CH3 at the end of a chain. So the substituent could be a chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-something. But the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which is a CH3 attached to a CH2 or a CH.

Wait, perhaps it's like this: the substituent is a -CH2-C(CH3)(something). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH, but that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to the ring, but with a branching. Let me think. If the substituent is a propyl group, like -CH2-CH2-CH2-, but that doesn't match the NMR. Because in that case, the Hs would be more downfield or in different regions.

Wait, the substituent could be a secondary or tertiary butyl group. Let's think: if the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, then the structure could be.

Looking at the protons:

- The 0.9 ppm is the terminal CH3 of a propyl group. So, the substituent is attached to the ring via a CH2 group, then another CH2, then a CH, and then a CH3. But the NMR doesn't show that.

Wait, the NMR has 2.9 ppm (m,1H), which is a single proton. That suggests a CH group, perhaps attached to another group. The 1.7 ppm is two Hs, which could be a CH2 adjacent to the CH.

So maybe the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH? No, that's getting complicated.

Wait, let's think about possible substituent structures.

The substituent must have a chain that includes a CH, a CH2, and a methyl group. Let me think:

- The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH that's connected to something else. So perhaps a structure like -(CH2)-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, maybe it's a propyl group with a methyl branch. For example, -(CH2)-CH(CH3)-2. Wait, but where would that fit?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a secondary butyl group. Let's say the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Hmm, but that would have a CH(CH2CH3), which would have a triplet for the CH2CH3 groups. Wait, but in the NMR, the 0.9 is a triplet for 3H. So perhaps that's the CH2CH3.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene. Then, the structure would be benzene with a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH group? But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more like a ketone or an ester, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid.

Wait, if the compound is a benzoic acid derivative, the structure would be benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent, which is an alkyl chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Let me see.

So, if the substituent is a propyl group with branching, like -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-, but that doesn't fit the NMR data perfectly.

Alternatively, let's think about the entire substituent attached to the benzene. The substituent would be a chain that includes a CH (2.9 ppm), a CH2 (1.7 ppm), and a methyl group (1.4 ppm, d) and another CH3 (0.9 ppm, t). So maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, but that doesn't immediately make sense. Let me try to break it down.

The substituent attached to the benzene would be something like -(CH2)n-CH(CH3)-. So, considering that, the NMR shows:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): terminal CH3. So the substituent may end in a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. For example, a structure like -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. But let me think of the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a butyl group with a branch. Let's consider a substituent like -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Hmm, but that's a pentyl group?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, like -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach. The IR shows a carbonyl, which in this case might be a carboxylic acid. So, the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

The NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm for one proton, likely the -COOH proton. Then, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, as two doublets. So, the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions. For example, substituents at positions 1 and 4.

So, the benzene has a COOH group at position 1 and another substituent at position 4. What's the substituent at position 4?

Looking at the NMR, the substituent must have a CH group, a CH2, and a methyl group. Let me think of an isopropyl group. Wait, an isopropyl group is CH(CH3)2, but that doesn't fit the NMR. Because in that case, the CH would have two CH3 groups attached, but in the NMR, the methyl groups are split into two different signals: 1.4 (d) and 0.9 (t).

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, but not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- group. But that would require more protons.

Wait, another possibility is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring. Then, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, which would have a CH2 group attached to the ring, followed by a CH that has a CH2CH3 group.

Let me see. The substituent is -(CH2)-CH(CH2CH3)-.

In this case, the NMR would show:

- The CH group (from CH(CH2CH3)) would have protons around 2.9 ppm, maybe as a multiplet because of coupling with adjacent CH2 groups.

- The (CH2CH3) group would have the CH2 at around 1.7 ppm (maybe as a multiplet) and the CH3 at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of two Hs, which could be the CH2 attached to the CH(CH2CH3). Then, the CH would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). The methyl groups would be the 0.9 ppm (t) and the 1.4 ppm (d).

Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H. That suggests a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-.

So, putting it together: the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-, but that would be a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, the structure would be phenyl-(CH2)CH(CH3)-COOH?

Wait, no. The COOH is on the benzene, and the substituent is another group. So, perhaps the structure is benzene with a COOH group at position 1 and an -CH2-CH(CH3)- group at position 4.

Wait, but how would that fit the NMR? Let me think about the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group? No, that's getting longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. That would give the CH group, then the CH2CH2CH3. The CH would be at 2.9, the CH2 would be at 1.7, and the terminal CH3 at 0.9.

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d) of 3H, which is a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2- group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group. Then, the 1.4 ppm would be the two CH3 groups on the CH, but that would likely integrate to 6H, which doesn't match the NMR (only 3H). So probably not.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. Let me see.

The substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. Then, the CH would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), the CH2 (from CH2CH3) would be split into a triplet around 1.7 ppm (but integration is 2H; maybe it's a -CH2- group adjacent to the CH), and the CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). But where does the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) come from?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group. Then, the structure would be:

Phenyl-COOH at position 1 and -CH2-CH(CH3)2 at position 4.

The -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group would have a CH2 group attached to the ring, then a CH attached to two CH3 groups. The NMR signals would be:

- The CH2 (attached to the ring) would be around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), but wait, the CH2 is next to a CH, so the protons would split into a quartet or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's another arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Then:

- The CH would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H),
- The middle CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H),
- The terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

But again, where does the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) come from? That's a CH3 attached to a CH, so perhaps there's another methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2- group. Wait, but that would require another CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. So, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. Then the CH is at 2.9 ppm, the CH2 next to it (from CH2CH3) would be at 1.7 ppm, and the terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm. But again, where does the 1.4 ppm come into play?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of the entire structure.

IR shows a strong carbonyl (1720 cm⁻¹) and O-H (broad between 3400-2500). The broad O-H suggests a carboxylic acid, so the structure is probably a benzoic acid with some substituent.

NMR:

- 10.5 ppm: -COOH proton (1H, broad singlet).
- Aromatic protons: two doublets, 2H each. So, the ring is para-substituted.
- The rest of the NMR data suggests a chain attached to the ring.

So, the substituent on the benzene is an alkyl group. The alkyl group has a structure that includes a CH, a CH2, and two CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)2 group. Then the NMR would show:

- The CH would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H),
- The CH2 (from CH2CH(CH3)2) would be around 1.7 ppm (m,2H),
- The two methyl groups on the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (each as a triplet?), but that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So, substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3).

In this case:

- The CH(CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H),
- The middle CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m,2H),
- The terminal CH3 would be at 1.4 ppm (d,3H),
- The end of the chain (if longer) would have a CH2CH3, but that's not matching.

Wait, but the 0.9 ppm is a t, 3H, which is a CH3 at the end of a chain.

So substituent is -(CH2)n-CH(CH3)-X, where X is another group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. Then, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH2CH3) at 2.9 ppm (m,1H),
- The CH2 (from CH2CH3) at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H),
- The terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

But then where is the 1.4 ppm (d,3H)? That would suggest another CH3 attached to a CH. So, perhaps the substituent has another methyl branch.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2- group attached to the ring. Then:

- The CH(CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H),
- The adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m,2H),
- The CH3 on the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d,3H),
- And the end of the chain would have another CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

Wait, that makes sense. So substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2-CH3? No, that's longer. Alternatively, substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's pentyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. But that doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH(CH3)CH2- group. So substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring.

In that case, the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2-.

But then:

- The CH(CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H),
- The CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m,2H),
- The CH3 on the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d,3H),
- And the end of the chain (if it's longer) would have a CH3 at 0.9 ppm.

But that would require the substituent to be longer than that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group, but that would add more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, attached to the ring. Then, the substituent is -(CH2)-CH(CH3)-.

So, substituent is benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH? No, that can't be because the COOH is already on the ring.

Wait, maybe the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-, attached to the ring. So the structure is benzene with COOH at position 1 and -(CH2)CH(CH3) at position 4.

So, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-.

So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-, which would mean that the ring has a -(CH2)CH(CH3) group attached.

In this structure, the substituent would have:

- The CH(CH3) group: which would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H),
- The adjacent CH2 (from CH2CH(CH3)) would be at 1.7 ppm (m,2H),
- The CH3 on the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d,3H),
- And the end of the substituent would have a CH3 somewhere else. Wait, but where does the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) come from?

Ah, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Then the structure would be benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3 at position 4.

In that case:

- The CH(CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H),
- The adjacent CH2 (from CH2CH(CH3)) would be at 1.7 ppm (m,2H),
- The CH3 on the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d,3H),
- The CH2CH3 at the end would be at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

That seems to fit all the NMR data.

So the structure would be 4-(3-methylbutyl)benzoic acid. Or perhaps 4-(sec-pentyl)benzoic acid? Wait, let me think about the substitution.

Wait, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. That's a pentyl group with a branch. Wait, let me count the carbons. The substituent is -(CH2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's actually a pentyl group with a branch on the second carbon.

Wait, no, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

So, the substituent is -(CH2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. That's a four-carbon chain with a branch. Wait, that's a pentyl group with a branch on the second carbon. So, the substituent would be 3-methylpentyl? No, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let me draw this:

- The substituent is attached to the benzene ring as -(CH2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's actually a 4-methylpentyl group attached to the ring. But that's perhaps not the correct way to name it.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain with a methyl branch. Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group with a methyl branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)2 group. But that would have two methyl groups on the same carbon.

Wait, but according to the NMR, there's a CH3 at 1.4 ppm (d) and another at 0.9 ppm (t). So the substituent must have a methyl group attached to a CH (the 1.4 ppm) and another CH3 at the end (0.9 ppm).

So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- group, but that would require more protons.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)2 group, but that would have two methyl groups on the same CH, giving a singlet for the methyl groups, but the NMR shows 1.4 ppm as a doublet (d).

Wait, if the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-CH2-CH3, that's longer than needed. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-CH3 group. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Breaking it down:

- The substituent is attached as -(CH2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that's a bit complicated. Let me count the protons.

The substituent would have:

- CH2 group attached to benzene: 2H (integration 2). But in the NMR, we have 2H at 1.7 ppm (m). Wait, that's matching.

- Then, the next group is CH(CH3): 1H at 2.9 ppm (m), which matches.

- The CH3 on the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which matches.

- The next group is CH2: 2H, which would be around 1.7 ppm. But wait, that's already accounted for. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3) group, with a terminal CH2CH3 elsewhere. So perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group with a branch. Let me see:

The substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. No, that's too long.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-CH3. So:

- Benzene ring (positions 1 and 4)
- Position 1: COOH
- Position 4: -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-CH3

So, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

In this structure, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3) at 2.9 ppm (m,1H),
- The adjacent CH2 (from -(CH2)CH(CH3)) at 1.7 ppm (m,2H),
- The CH3 on the CH at 1.4 ppm (d,3H),
- The terminal CH2CH3 would have the CH2 at 1.7 ppm and CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

Wait, but the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

The CH2 adjacent to the ring (the first CH2) would have protons, but in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H. So perhaps that's the CH2 attached to the CH(CH3) group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the options given and see which one matches the data.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, the options suggest that the product is after reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the substitution of a hydroxyl group, like in the preparation of a ylide, or maybe for elimination. Alternatively, when an alcohol is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it's a common method to dehydrate it to form an alkene or for substitution.

Wait, but the initial compound is likely a benzoic acid with an alkyl group. So, when treated with red phosphorus and HI, it might undergo a substitution reaction.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydroxy group in the preparation of ylides, like in the Wittig reaction. Alternatively, if it's an acid, the reaction might form an acid chloride or an acylium ion, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydration, but benzoic acid is less likely to undergo that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -OH (of the carboxylic acid) is replaced by another group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if the compound is a phenol with an alkyl chain, then red phosphorus and HI would lead to substitution, but in this case, the compound seems to be a benzoic acid, not a phenol.

Wait, but let me think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI is often used in the hydroxy group substitution, like in the formation of ylides. Alternatively, perhaps it's used to convert an alcohol to an iodide.

Wait, assuming that the initial compound is a benzoic acid, treating with red phosphorus and HI might not do much. Alternatively, maybe the initial compound is a phenol, but the IR and NMR suggest a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound has both a phenol and a carboxylic acid group. But that may complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is a benzaldehyde with an alkyl group, but the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹ which is more like an acid or ester.

Wait, but if the initial compound is a benzoic acid, what would happen when you treat it with red phosphorus and HI? Does that lead to any reaction?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is a phenol with an ester group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is a benzyl alcohol, but the IR shows a broad O-H, which is more indicative of a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe the reaction is something else. Red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the hydroxy-Wittig reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the initial compound is a bromide or iodide, but I don't think so because the IR doesn't show an absorption that suggests that.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is a phenol, but in that case, the NMR wouldn't have a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, since phenolic OH protons are usually broader but can be around 5 ppm. Wait, no, phenolic protons are typically around 5 ppm, not 10.5. The 10.5 ppm is more indicative of a carboxylic acid.

So, the initial compound is a benzoic acid with an alkyl substituent.

So, back to the options. The options are about the final product after the reaction. So, let's consider what reaction would occur.

If the initial compound is a benzoic acid with a substituent R, and it's treated with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's undergoing a substitution reaction at the R group.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI can cause alkylation or dehydrohalogenation. Alternatively, maybe the R group has a leaving group, and the reaction is an elimination or substitution.

Wait, but without knowing the structure of R, it's hard to say. So perhaps I should first figure out the structure of compound X.

Let me try to see the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the structure would be:

Phenyl ring with a COOH group at position 1, and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

What's a sec-butyl group? It's a four-carbon group where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

Wait, no. Wait, the sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring? Wait, no.

Wait, the sec-butyl group is a four-carbon group where the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So, it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is:

The butyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-, but sec-butyl would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, but wait, that's not correct. Wait, the sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is:

The butyl group has four carbons: when the substituent is attached to the second carbon, it's a sec-butyl group. So, it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, that's not right.

Wait, the correct structure of sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH2CH3)-? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: the butyl group can be primary, secondary, or tertiary.

Primary butyl: -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

Secondary butyl: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that's not right.

Wait, maybe it's -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, but that's more of a tertiary group.

Alternatively, the correct structure of the sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the sec-butyl group as the substituent where the point of attachment is on a secondary carbon. So, the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, that's a pentyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is -CH2-CH(CH3)CH2- but that's a four-carbon substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the naming. So, perhaps I should look at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the structure would be:

Phenyl ring with COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The sec-butyl group would have the structure: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but that would require more protons, but our NMR has only 1.4 ppm and 0.9 ppm as CH3 groups, maybe.

Wait, let me imagine the substituent as -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring.

Then, the substituent would be a three-carbon chain: the CH2 attached to the ring, then a CH with a methyl group, then another CH2 group leading to a CH3.

But wait, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-CH3.

No, that would be a four-carbon chain: the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

But that's a four-carbon group with a branch on the second carbon.

In that case, the substituent is a pentyl group, but with a branch on the second carbon. So, it's a 3-methylpentyl group or something similar.

But let's see if that fits the NMR data.

The substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Breaking down the substituent's protons:

- The CH2 attached to the ring: 2H, which would appear around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) in the NMR. That matches the NMR data.

- The CH(CH3) group: 1H (m, 2.9 ppm), which matches.

- The CH3 on the CH: 3H, which would be a doublet around 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), as seen in the NMR.

- The terminal CH2CH3 group: the CH2 would be around 1.7 ppm, but wait, the substituent already has a CH2 at 1.7 ppm. Hmm, this might cause overlap.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-CH3. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

In this case, the CH2 groups would be:

- attached to the ring: 2H (1.7 ppm),
- the middle CH2: 2H (maybe around 1.7 ppm as well),
- and the terminal CH2CH3: 2H (around 1.7 ppm), but that would cause multiple signals around the same region.

This might complicate the NMR, but perhaps the multiplets would account for that.

Wait, but in the NMR data, we have 1.7 ppm (m,2H), which could be the CH2 attached to the ring and the middle CH2. Then, the terminal CH2CH3 would contribute a triplet (but that's at 0.9 ppm as the CH3).

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)2 group, but that would give a singlet for the CH3, which doesn't match the NMR.

Hmm, perhaps I should go back to the options and see which one's structure would fit the NMR data.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The structure would be benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position.

The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no. Wait, the correct structure of the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, the correct IUPAC name would be different. Let me think: the substituent is attached to the benzene at position 4, and it's a sec-butyl group.

The sec-butyl group is a four-carbon group where the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So, the structure would be:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but the point of attachment is on the second CH2. Wait, no.

Wait, no. The correct structure for a sec-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. No, that's a tertiary group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the naming wrong. Let me clarify: the butyl group can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. The primary butyl group is -CH2CH2CH2CH2-, the secondary is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, and the tertiary is -CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct way is:

The primary butyl group is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

The secondary butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

The tertiary butyl group is -C(CH3)2-CH2-.

Wait, perhaps that's not accurate. Maybe I should think of the substituent as a four-carbon group where the attachment is on a secondary carbon.

So, the structure would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, that would require a five-carbon chain, which is not the case. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, making it a sec-propyl group. Hmm.

But let me try to think about option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The structure would be benzene with a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The sec-butyl group would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

So, substituent: -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that's a four-carbon chain with a branch on the second carbon, making it a sec-butyl group.

So, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

In this case, the substituent's NMR would show:

- The CH2 attached to the ring: 2H at 1.7 ppm (m),
- The CH(CH3): 1H at 2.9 ppm (m),
- The CH3 on the CH: 3H at 1.4 ppm (d),
- The terminal CH2CH3 group: 2H (maybe at 1.7 ppm), and CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t).

Wait, but the 1.7 ppm is already taken by the CH2 attached to the ring. So, perhaps the middle CH2 would be around 1.7 ppm as well, but that would complicate the NMR.

Alternatively, the substituent might not have a terminal CH2CH3 group, but perhaps a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)2 group, but that would have 6H on the CH, but the NMR only shows 3H as a doublet.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to match the NMR data with option C.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, substituent is a sec-butyl group. Its structure is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

In this case:

- The substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

So, the substituent is a four-carbon group with a branch on the second carbon.

So, the substituent's protons would be:

- CH2 attached to the ring: 2H at 1.7 ppm (m),
- CH(CH3): 1H at 2.9 ppm (m),
- CH3 on CH: 3H at 1.4 ppm (d),
- CH2CH3 group: 2H at 1.7 ppm and 3H at 0.9 ppm (t).

Wait, that would lead to the 1.7 ppm integrating for 4H (2H from the ring-attached CH2 and 2H from the CH2CH3). But in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm is only integrating for 2H.

So that might not match. So perhaps option C's structure doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, making it a 2-methylpropyl group or something else.

Wait, let's consider option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

That would be a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group at para.

But the initial compound's NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which would suggest a carboxylic acid. So, option D is a benzene with substituents, but no COOH group.

So, perhaps the initial compound is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But then the reaction comes into play. The question is, what happens when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, when a benzoic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's undergoing a reaction similar to the hydroxy group substitution, but benzoic acid isn't typically reactive under those conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into an acyl iodide.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the initial compound isn't a benzoic acid but a phenol. But the NMR suggests a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between the substituent and HI. If the substituent is an alkyl group with a leaving group, the reaction could substitute it. But without a leaving group, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI can also be used for the substitution of alcohols to form iodides. So, if the initial compound had an alcohol group, the reaction would substitute it with iodine. But in this case, the initial compound is a benzoic acid.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is not a benzoic acid but an ester. Let me think. If the IR shows a carbonyl, it could be an ester as well. The 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with an ester (maybe a bit lower than a ketone). But the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more indicative of a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, maybe the reaction is a substitution of the carboxylic acid's -OH group with HI. So, the reaction would convert the -COOH into a -COO⁻I or perhaps form an acyl iodide. But I'm not entirely sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is a bromide or iodide, but the IR and NMR don't suggest that.

Wait, going back to the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the presence of alcohols to form alkyl halides. So, if the initial compound has an -OH group, perhaps an alcohol, the reaction would substitute the -OH with iodide.

But in the initial data, the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more likely a carboxylic acid than an alcohol. So, perhaps the initial compound is a phenol. But the IR and NMR don't match that.

Wait, maybe the initial compound is a phenol with an ester group or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is a benzaldehyde with an alkyl group. The IR would then show a strong carbonyl, but the NMR would have different features. The NMR shows a broad peak, which would be a phenol or carboxylic acid.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to summarize.

Based on the NMR and IR data, the initial compound is a benzoic acid with an alkyl substituent.

The substituent's NMR data suggests a chain with a CH, a CH2, and two methyl groups.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If that's the case, then what would the reaction with red phosphorus and HI do?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is substituting the -COOH group with iodide. But I don't think that's likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent (sec-butyl) has a hydroxyl group, but the NMR doesn't show an -OH.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a secondary alcohol, which then gets converted to an iodide.

Wait, but the NMR data doesn't show an -OH proton, so perhaps the substituent isn't an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of the benzoic acid. But that's not typical with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the initial compound is a phenol, and the substituent is an alkyl group. Then, the reaction would substitute the -OH group with iodide, forming a benzyl iodide.

But the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which would be more consistent with a carboxylic acid.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not substituting the -OH group but the substituent's group. For example, if the substituent is a bromide, the reaction could substitute it with iodide. But the initial data doesn't suggest the presence of bromide.

This is getting a bit too confusing. Maybe I should think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the synthesis of ylides, like in the Wittig reaction. To form a ylide, an alkyl halide reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So, perhaps the initial compound has a leaving group, such as a bromide or iodide, which would form a better leaving group in the presence of HI.

Wait, but the initial compound's structure doesn't suggest a leaving group. Unless the substituent is a bromide or iodide.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is a bromide. Let me think: if the substituent is a bromide, then treating with HI would substitute it with iodide.

But the NMR doesn't show any peaks indicative of a halogen. So, perhaps the substituent isn't a bromide. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an alcohol, and the reaction converts it to an iodide.

But without an -OH peak in the NMR, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting a ketone into an enol, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options again and see which product makes sense.

The reaction is between compound X and red phosphorus and HI.

If compound X is a benzoic acid derivative, and after reaction, the product is an iodide, then the options would be one of the iodide derivatives.

Looking at the options, options B and D are benzene derivatives with substituents, but without a COOH group. So, perhaps the reaction is deprotonating the COOH and substituting with iodide.

Wait, but how?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the -COOH group is converted into a better leaving group. For example, converting the acid into an acyl iodide.

The reaction of a carboxylic acid with PPh3 and HI can form an acyl iodide. But I'm not certain about the conditions.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be an acid chloride formation. Carboxylic acids can react with SOCl2 to form acid chlorides, but that's not red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into an acyl iodide using P and HI.

So, if the initial compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the reaction would convert the -COOH into -COI, forming 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide.

But that's not one of the options. The options are about the structure after reaction, but the options given don't include such a compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not affecting the carboxylic acid but another group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent has an -OH group, which reacts with HI to form an iodide. For example, if the substituent is an alcohol, the reaction would substitute it with iodide.

So, in that case, the substituent would be an alcohol before the reaction, and after reaction, it becomes an iodide.

But the initial NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which would correspond to the -COOH, not an alcohol.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a secondary alcohol, which would have protons around 1-2 ppm, but the NMR shows a peak at 2.9 ppm for a CH group. That doesn't match.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone, but the IR doesn't show a strong enough peak for that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is an elimination reaction. If the substituent has a leaving group, the reaction could eliminate to form an alkene.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a tosyl or similar group that leaves, forming an alkene. But again, the initial data doesn't suggest that.

I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think of the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the substituent is modified.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the sec-butyl group into a different structure. For example, if the substituent is a secondary alcohol, it would become an iodide.

But without the NMR data supporting that, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is deprotonating the COOH and substituting it with iodide, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution. The -COOH could react with HI to form an acyl iodide. But under what conditions?

I recall that carboxylic acids can be converted to acyl chlorides using thionyl chloride (SOCl2), and to acyl iodides using phosphorus and iodine (maybe HI).

So, if compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacting with red phosphorus and HI would form 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide.

But none of the options match that. The options are all benzene derivatives with substituents, either methyl, ethyl, or sec-butyl, but as substituents, not as acyl groups.

So perhaps the initial compound is a benzaldehyde, but the IR and NMR don't support that.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which could be an ester or a ketone. But the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which suggests a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into an acid chloride, but that's not matching the options.

Hmm. I'm not making progress on the reaction part. Let me try to focus on the initial structure.

The substituent's NMR data suggests a structure like:

-(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Which would be a pentyl group with a branch.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon substituent with a branch, making it a sec-butyl group.

So, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-CH3, which would make the substituent a 3-methylbutyl group.

Wait, perhaps that's the substituent. So the structure is 4-(3-methylbutyl)benzoic acid.

But looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would match.

So, if the initial compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, what's the reaction with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the benzoic acid into a benzaldehyde. But that would require a reduction, which isn't what red phosphorus and HI do.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination to form a benzene ring with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent is a benzyl bromide, and the reaction substitutes the bromide with iodide. But that's not matching the initial data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent undergoes a substitution reaction, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the -COOH into an acid iodide. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide.

But none of the options are like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the -COOH into a methyl ester, but that's not done with red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a substitution of the -COOH group's oxygen with iodide. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with an iodide substituent.

But the initial compound has a COOH group, so this would change the structure significantly.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration to form an acid anhydride, but I don't think so.

Hmm. I'm not making progress, but perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options and the reaction.

If the initial compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction is converting the -COOH into an iodide, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide, which isn't an option. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is converting the substituent into something else. For example, the substituent is an alcohol that gets converted into an iodide.

But without the data, I can't be certain.

Wait, another thought. Red phosphorus and HI can cause the substitution of an alcohol group to form an iodide. So if the substituent is a secondary alcohol, the reaction would convert it into a secondary iodide.

Looking at the substituent in option C: it's a sec-butyl group, which has a CH(CH3) group. If that CH group is a secondary alcohol (OH), then the reaction would convert it into a CHI group.

So, the substituent would change from -(CH2)CH(OH)CH3 to -(CH2)CH(I)CH3.

But the initial NMR doesn't show an -OH proton, so perhaps the substituent isn't an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a primary alcohol, but I don't know.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction doesn't change the structure. But that doesn't make sense because the question says the compound reacts to form a new product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of the -COOH group's oxygen with iodide. So, the product would have an iodide at that position.

But without knowing the exact reaction mechanism, I can't be certain.

Given the time I've spent, I think I should look for the most plausible option based on the data.

The initial structure seems to fit option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Now, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the formation of ylides from alkyl halides, but in this case, the initial compound is a benzoic acid. So perhaps the reaction isn't directly affecting the substituent but the COOH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into an acid iodide.

If that's the case, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration to form an acid anhydride, but again, not matching the options.

Another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, like a Friedel-Crafts, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not affecting the substituent but the ring. For example, if the substituent is activating, the ring could undergo further substitution. But I don't have enough data to support that.

Given the confusion, I'm going to tentatively conclude that the initial compound is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Then, upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, which I'm not entirely sure about, but perhaps the product is option A or C.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be converting the substituent's alcohol into iodide. Suppose the substituent is a secondary alcohol; then, the reaction would substitute it with iodide, forming a secondary iodide.

If the substituent is a secondary alcohol, its structure would be -(CH2)CH(OH)CH3.

Upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it would become -(CH2)CH(I)CH3.

Then, the product would be 4-(3-iodopropyl)benzoic acid.

But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a primary alcohol, which would become a primary iodide.

But again, without the NMR data, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is removing the -COOH group, but that's unclear.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I think I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the NMR and IR data, the initial compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is likely converting the carboxylic acid into an acid iodide, but since that's not an option, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent but another part.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the substituent in the initial compound is a bromide, which is then substituted with iodide.

If the substituent is a bromide, the reaction with HI would substitute it with iodide, but the NMR doesn't show a peak for bromide.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an alcohol, which is then substituted with iodide.

But without more data, it's hard to say.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to go with option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the initial compound, and perhaps the reaction doesn't change it. But that can't be, as the question states that it reacts.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is something else, like eliminating the substituent to form a double bond. But I don't see how.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, maybe the substituent is undergoing a substitution reaction. If the substituent is a secondary alkyl bromide, it would substitute to form an iodide. But again, without the data, I can't be sure.

In conclusion, based on the NMR and IR data, the initial compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI might convert it into an acid iodide, but since that's not an option, perhaps the product is still option C, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the substituent but another part.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine the NMR data.

The 1H NMR has a singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H), which is the -COOH proton. Then, the aromatic protons are two doublets, 2H each, suggesting para substitution.

The other signals are:

2.9 ppm (m,1H): likely a CH group,
1.7 ppm (m,2H): CH2,
1.4 ppm (d,3H): CH3 attached to CH,
0.9 ppm (t,3H): CH3 at the end of a chain.

So, the substituent's structure is:

-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, perhaps it's -(CH2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that would make the substituent a 3-methylpentyl group.

But in that case, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3, which would have more carbons than the NMR suggests.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Which would make it a propyl group with a methyl branch.

So, putting it all together, the initial compound is 4-(3-methylbutyl)benzoic acid.

But the options don't have that. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction between Compound X and red phosphorus and HI, based on the provided IR and NMR data. The IR spectrum shows a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ and a broad O-H stretch in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ region, consistent with a carboxylic acid. The NMR data includes a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, likely the -COOH proton, and two doublets in the aromatic region at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring. Additional signals at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) suggest an alkyl chain attached to the ring.

The para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring and the NMR data for the alkyl chain indicate that the substituent is a sec-butyl group (-CH2-CH(CH3)-). This leads to the identification of Compound X as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

The reaction of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid with red phosphorus and HI is typically associated with the formation of an acyl iodide. However, none of the provided options correspond to such a product. Given the data and the options, the most plausible conclusion is that the reaction does not alter the substituent but instead affects the -COOH group, converting it into an iodide. Despite this, the options do not explicitly include such a product. Based on the analysis, the initial compound is correctly identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction likely produces a derivative not listed in the options. However, the best match among the options is **option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

Answer: C
