Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. In the classical case, it's F = -kx. But now it's relativistic, so I have to consider how relativity affects the equations.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about how to approach this.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², where A is the amplitude. So the kinetic energy at that point would be (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max² → v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is a relativistic problem, so option C is probably the non-relativistic case. So the correct answer should account for relativistic effects.

In relativity, the total energy includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The total energy E is gamma * mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The potential energy in the relativistic oscillator is probably similar to the classical case, but how does it fit into the energy equation?

Wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is conserved. So at maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, and all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the kinetic energy is maximum, so KE = (γ-1)mc², since the total energy is γmc².

Wait, no. Wait, in the relativistic case, the potential energy might not be the same as the classical (1/2)kx². Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Maybe the force is still F = -kx, but the equations of motion would be relativistic.

Another approach: The energy of the oscillator should be the sum of rest mass energy and the potential energy. Or wait, maybe the potential energy is (1/2)kx² as usual, but the kinetic energy is relativistic, so KE = (γ - 1)mc². So the total energy is E = (γ - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx².

But at maximum amplitude x=A, the velocity is zero, so KE is zero. So E = (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point (x=0), the velocity is maximum, so all energy is KE. So (γ - 1)mc² = (1/2)k A².

Wait, wait. No, because when x=0, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy E is all kinetic. So:

E = (γ) mc² = (1/2)k A² + (γ - 1) mc². Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me start over.

In the classical case, total energy is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, when the mass is moving, its kinetic energy is (γ - 1) mc². So when x=0, the mass has maximum speed, so all the energy is kinetic. Therefore:

(γ - 1) mc² = (1/2)k
