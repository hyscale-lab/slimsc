Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember from my studies that particles like mesons are subatomic and can decay, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas.

The problem gives me some values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, and the options are given in meters with exponents like 10^-15 or 10^-16. 

Wait, so mean decay distance... I think that has to do with how far the particle travels before it decays. The formula I vaguely remember involves the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the mean decay length is c multiplied by the lifetime (τ) multiplied by the velocity (βc), so like L = βγ c τ. But wait, since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, gamma (γ) comes into play too.

But wait, another approach I've heard about is using the uncertainty principle, maybe through the relation of the particle's lifetime with its width. The width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by τ = ħ / Γ. Because the uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, so if Γ is the energy uncertainty, then Δt ≈ τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

So first, I should compute τ. Let me jot that down. Γ is given as 320 MeV. But I need to convert that into units of energy compatible with the Planck constant. Let me see, 1 eV is 1.6e-19 joules. But wait, maybe I should work in units where ħc is a known value to make things easier.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh right, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV·s is 1.6e-19 joule-seconds, but using these units can get messy. So using natural units where ħc is a standard value might be better.

Wait, the formula for τ is τ = ħ / Γ. Since Γ is in GeV, and ħ is in GeV·s, the units should work out. So let me compute that. ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (Γ in GeV).

Wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ let's calculate that. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582 / 0.32 = approx 20.56875, so τ is 20.56875e-25 seconds? No, wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is 20.56875e-25? Wait, wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 20.56875e-25? No, let me do that again: 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875, so 20.56875 multiplied by 1e-25 seconds. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, no, wait, wait. No, 6.582e-25 is 6.582 multiplied by 1
