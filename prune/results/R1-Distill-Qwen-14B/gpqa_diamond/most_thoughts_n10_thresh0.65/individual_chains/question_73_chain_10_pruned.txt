Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm. Let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see.

The question says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, right. So the options are A to D. The relative speed part and the total energy part.

First, I think about relative speed. Oh wait, in relativity, you can't just subtract velocities like in classical mechanics. Relativity has a formula for that. The formula for relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)), but wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Actually, when you have two objects moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just the difference. Let me get this right.

Alternatively, I remember that the relative velocity is calculated using the formula: (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). But wait, wait no. Let me think. Let me get the correct formula. Oh right, the velocity of one object as seen from the other's frame. So if astronaut A is moving at u and astronaut B at v, both in the same direction, then the relative speed of B from A's frame is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think I got it reversed. If A is moving at u relative to the lab frame, and B
