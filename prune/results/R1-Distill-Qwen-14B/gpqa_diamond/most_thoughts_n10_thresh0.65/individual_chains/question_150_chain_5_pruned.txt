Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So plugging in the numbers: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

Wait, X is halogens, but the formula doesn't have any, so X=0. So calculation: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That could be one ring and two double bonds, or maybe a ring and a double bond and a triple bond, but probably more likely a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees), a double bond (1), and an amine or something else (another 1? Wait, maybe not. Let me see.

Wait, benzene has three double bonds, but it's considered as one ring and three double bonds, but each double bond is one degree, so a benzene ring is 4 degrees? Wait, no, wait. Each double bond or ring counts as one degree. So benzene has three double bonds, which is three degrees, plus the ring, which is another degree? Or wait, no—no, each ring or double bond is one degree. So a benzene ring has three double bonds, which contribute three degrees, and the ring itself is another, so four in total. Wait, no, that's a misunderstanding. Actually, each benzene ring counts as three degrees of unsaturation because it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds—each double bond is a degree, and the ring is another, but wait, no. Wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For benzene (C6H6), it would be (2*6 +2 -6)/2 = (14-6)/2=4. So yes, benzene has four degrees of unsaturation. So in our compound, we have five degrees. That would mean one more degree beyond the benzene. So maybe an additional double bond or a ring or a triple bond.

Looking at the NMR data:
