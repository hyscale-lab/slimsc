Okay, let me try to work through this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot. So the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator for a given quantum state.

Alright, the state given is |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, proportional, so I guess I need to normalize it first. Oh right, because the probabilities must add up to 1.

First, let me write the state as a vector. The spin up and down states are basis states, so let's represent |alpha> as a two-component vector. The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2 - i) for |down>. So the vector is [1+i, 2-i]^T. But I need the norm, right? The norm squared is the sum of the magnitudes squared of each component.

Calculating each component's magnitude. For the first component, |1+i|² is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. For the second, |2 - i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, the problem says the state is proportional, which makes sense since I have to normalize it by dividing by sqrt(7). So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Now, the operator whose matrix representation is given. The matrix A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, that would look like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, wait—no. Because in matrices, the rows are i and columns j. So A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2, and the diagonals are zero.

So the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. That's a 2x2 matrix. Hmm, what operator could this be? Oh, wait, I think I've seen this before. This looks like the Pauli X
