Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it properly.

The question says: We have a state |alpha> that's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think are the standard basis states for spin-1/2 systems. So, first, I probably need to normalize this state because it's given as proportional, meaning it's not necessarily of unit length.

Then, there's an operator whose matrix representation has elements Aij. The rule is that Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so for a 2x2 matrix, that would mean A12 and A21 are hbar/2, while A11 and A22 are zero. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Hmm, that's a 2x2 matrix. That operator is probably the Pauli X operator scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix has 0s on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. Oh wait, Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yeah, our operator A would be (hbar/2) times Pauli X.

The problem asks for two things: the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator A, and the average value (expected value) of the operator.

So first, I need to find the eigenstates of A, then express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates and find the probabilities. Alternatively, since A is a scaled Pauli X, maybe I can find the expectation value directly.

Wait, but let's break it down step by step.

First, normalize |alpha>:

The state is |alpha> = c * ( (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ), where c is a normalization constant.

So the inner product is <alpha|alpha> = |c|^2 [ |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2 ]

Calculating |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 - i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the sum is 2 +5=7. So |c|^2 *7 =1 → |c|=1/sqrt(7). So c=1/sqrt(7) multiplied by e^{iθ}, but since the phase doesn't matter, let's take c=1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the operator A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. The eigenstates of A are the same as those of the Pauli X matrix because A is just a scalar multiple of X. The eigenvalues of Pauli X are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, the spin-up and spin-down states along the x-axis. The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and the |−x> state is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), but wait, I think I need to double-check that. Alternatively, the eigenvectors for the Pauli X are (1,1) and (1,-1), normalized.

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so its eigenvectors satisfy X|v> = λ|v>.

For λ=+1: solving (X - I)|v> = 0 → [ [-1 1], [1 -1] ] |v> =0 → v1 = v2. So the eigenvector is (1,1), normalized to (1/sqrt(2)) (1,1) → (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) = |+x>.

Similarly, for λ=-1, the eigenvector is (1, -1), normalized → (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) = |−x>.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2 respectively.

Now, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate when we measure A, we need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis, we can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>, and the coefficients' squares will give the probabilities.

Another approach: the probability of measuring +hbar/2 is |< +x | alpha > |^2, and same for -hbar/2 with |< -x | alpha > |^2.

So let me compute these inner products.

First, compute <+x | alpha >:

<+x| = ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So <+x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> + <down|alpha> ]

We already have |alpha> expressed as (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, divided by sqrt(7). So <up|alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7), and <down|alpha> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So <+x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i + 2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ].

Wait, wait, because when you take the inner product, you have to compute the sum of the products of the components. So perhaps I should write it correctly:

 <+x | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me write it out again.

< up | alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7), since alpha is (1+i)|up>/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)|down>/sqrt(7).

Similarly, < down | alpha> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So <+x | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Let me compute the numerator: (1+i) + (2 -i) = 1+2 + i -i = 3.

So this becomes (3) / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, the other inner product <−x | alpha> would be (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Compute numerator: (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 -2 + i +i = (-1) + 2i.

So <−x | alpha> = ( -1 + 2i ) / ( sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) ) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(
