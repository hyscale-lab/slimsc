Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass attached to a spring oscillates. But wait, this is relativistic, so I need to consider special relativity effects.

The question is asking for the maximum speed, v_max. The options are given with different formulas, some involving the speed of light c, which tells me relativity is definitely a factor here.

Let me think about the setup. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So it's a standard harmonic oscillator but under relativistic considerations.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is relativistic, so option C is probably not the correct answer.

But wait, in relativity, energy isn't just kinetic; there's also rest mass energy. The total energy E in relativity is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So maybe the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy? Or is it different?

Wait, no. The total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of its rest energy and its kinetic energy. So the total mechanical energy (which in the classical case is conserved) would include relativistic effects. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x = A), all the energy is potential, and at the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic.

In the classical case, potential energy U = (1/2)kx². At x = A, U = (1/2)kA². Kinetic energy K = (1/2)mv². But in relativity, kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy: E = gamma mc². Alternatively, when the mass is at the amplitude, all the energy is potential. But in relativity, I think the potential energy expression might change. Wait, but the problem says it obeys Hooke's law F = -kx, which is the classical
