Okay, so I need to figure out the correct statement about the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator given by Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S has the matrix:
First row: 0, -i
Second row: i, 0.

Wait, so S is a matrix. Let me write that out:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i,  0]]

And Ay is c multiplied by this. So Ay = c * S.

Hmm, angular momentum operators usually have specific properties. I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin matrices are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, but here c is h/(4π), and h is Planck's constant. Let me calculate c first.

c = h / (4π). So c = ħ/(2), since h = 2πħ. So c = (2πħ) / (4π) )= ħ/2. Wait, wait: h = 2πħ. So substituting, c = (2πħ)/(4π) = ħ/2. So c is ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) * S.

Now, what's the matrix S? Let me write S again:

[[0, -i],
 [i,  0]]

So if I compute Ay, it's (ħ/2) times this matrix. So:

Ay = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] = [[0, -iħ/2], [iħ/2, 0]]

Wait, but wait. I'm trying to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. To find eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So the matrix (Ay - a I) would be:

[[ -a, -iħ/2 ],
 [ iħ/2, -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-iħ/2)(iħ/2) = a² - [ (-i)(i) (ħ²)/(4) ) ].

Wait, let's compute the determinant:

The determinant is [(-a)(-a)] -
