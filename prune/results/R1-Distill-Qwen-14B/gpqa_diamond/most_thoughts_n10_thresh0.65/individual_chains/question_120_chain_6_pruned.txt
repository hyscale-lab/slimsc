Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means that their density is the same throughout space, right? So the number of stars doesn't change as you go further out, except for how they appear to us.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. Oh right, parallax is inversely related to distance. So the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Like, plx = 1/distance in parsecs or something.

So if I have a unit range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars would be in that range? Since the stars are uniformly distributed, perhaps the number depends on the volume of space they occupy.

Wait, let's think in terms of distance. Parallax plx is in arcseconds, and distance d is in parsecs. The relationship is d = 1/plx. So when plx increases, distance decreases. So a higher parallax means a closer star.

But wait, in this scenario, stars are uniformly distributed, meaning the number density n is constant. So the number of stars in a certain volume is proportional to that volume.

So I need to find the volume corresponding to a shell between distances d and d + dd. Because each shell at distance d has a volume of 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd
