Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, the question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to an amine, but wait, no, wait. Oh right, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Or wait, maybe it's more specific. Oh right, when a nitrile (R-C≡N) reacts with H-I and red phosphorus, it gets hydrolyzed to an amine. The reaction is R-C≡N → R-CH2-NH2. Wait, no, wait! Wait, the typical reaction is that a nitrile with H2O and acid would give a carboxylic acid. But with HI and red phosphorus, it's a different pathway. Oh right, I think it's the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a primary amine via the Stephen reduction or something else. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Actually, the combination of red phosphorus and HI is used to convert nitriles into primary amines. The reaction is R-C≡N + excess HI → R-CH2-NH2. So, if Compound X is a nitrile, then the product would be an amine. But wait, maybe I'm getting confused with another reaction. Alternatively, another possibility: Maybe Compound X is an ester or something else that reacts with HI under those conditions. Hmm. Let me think more.

Looking at the IR and NMR data for Compound X. The IR shows strong absorption around 3400–2500 cm^-1, which is a broad peak likely due to N-H or O-H stretching. But wait, IR peaks in that region: O-H (like in carboxylic acids or alcohols) would be around 3200-3600, perhaps broad. N-H in amines would also be around there. Also, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 could be aromatic ring vibrations (C=C). So, maybe a benzene ring with substituents and a carbonyl group.

The 1H NMR of Compound X has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a singlet and broad. That could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton is usually around 10-12 ppm, but as a broad peak. So, maybe Compound X is a carboxylic acid. But wait, if that's the case, reacting with red phosphorus and HI wouldn't make much sense. Because HI is a strong acid, but maybe if it's a ester, but no, the IR has 1720, which is more like a ketone or aldehyde or ester. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ester.

Wait, looking again. The NMR: 10.5 ppm, broad singlet (1H). Could that be an acidic proton, like a phenolic OH? But in that case, the IR would show a broad peak, but also maybe a peak around 3000-35
