Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I need to find the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the crystal structures, right? It's like a distorted cubic structure. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each.

Wait, interatomic distance... I think that's the distance between adjacent atoms along one lattice parameter. Or is it the lattice parameter itself? Oh, wait, in crystals, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter (a, b, c) in a cubic system, but rhombohedral is a bit different. No, wait, in a cubic system, a=b=c, but rhombohedral has a=b=c but angles not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, they've given all angles as 30 degrees, which is quite a distortion from the cubic structure.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance, d_{hkl}, is calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor. I think the formula is d_{hkl} = a/(√(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)cosθ)), but wait, that might be for a different system. Or maybe it's the  formula involving the reciprocal lattice.

No, another approach: for a cubic system, the interplanar distance is given by d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But rhombohedral is a bit more complicated because the angles between the lattice parameters are not 90 degrees. So I think the general formula for d in a rhombohedral crystal is different.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector. The reciprocal lattice vector components are h, k, l multiplied by some factors involving the metric tensor.

Alternatively, the formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk + hl + kl)/(a²) * cosθ,

where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors, which in this case is 30 degrees for all angles since alpha=beta=gamma=30.

Wait, let me make sure I remember the formula correctly. Oh right, the general
