Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, no, hold on. Oh right, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by something? Or is it a divided by sqrt(1+x) minus 0.5i? Wait, the way it's written, it's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but wait, i is the square root of -1. So this would make the wave function a complex number. That's a bit confusing because usually, in simple cases, the wave functions are real. But maybe this is a typo or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the expression is actually (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by something else, like a complex exponential. Hmm, but the way it's written, it's an expression with a real part and an imaginary part. 

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the expression. Let me look again. It says the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So, Ïˆ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. Hmm, that's interesting. But wait, wave functions are often taken to be normalized, and usually, for a
