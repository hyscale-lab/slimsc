Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on some spectroscopic data. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem lists the techniques used: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each piece of data.

Starting with the FTIR. The main peaks are a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1, and strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak around 3000 usually indicates O-H stretching. O-H can be from alcohols, carboxylic acids, or maybe an ester. But the other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650. I know that a peak around 1700 is often a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 peak might be an aromatic ring (like C=C stretch) or maybe another carbonyl if it's conjugated. Wait, maybe it's an ester? Because esters have two carbonyl groups. Wait, no. Wait, esters usually have one carbonyl group, but maybe in conjugation or something else. Alternatively, if there's a conjugated carbonyl, like in a carbonyl next to an aromatic ring, the stretching frequency might be lower. Oh, wait, the strong peak at 1650 could be from a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents.

Wait, another thought: 1700 is a typical carbonyl for something like an ester or a ketone. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching). But wait, aromatic C=C is usually around 1450-1600, so 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone next to an aromatic ring or maybe an amide. Hmm, but amides are usually around 1650 for the N-H bend, but here it's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is part of a conjugated system, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. Because in such a case, the carbonyl might be at a higher wavenumber.

But wait, the NMR part says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydro
