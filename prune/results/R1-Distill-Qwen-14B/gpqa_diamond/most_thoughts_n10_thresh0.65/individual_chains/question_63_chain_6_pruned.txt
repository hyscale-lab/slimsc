Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and some quantum states. Hmm, I need to figure out the momentum of a photon that would cause the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state. Let me try to break this down.

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, that model considers both rotational and vibrational energy states. But the question is about the fundamental state and the next state. Hmm, so I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it moves to the next higher state.

The molecule is made of atoms X and Y. Their masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for vibration are quantized. The energy levels are given by the formula E_v = (v + 1/2) h w, where v is the vibrational quantum number. So the fundamental state is v=0. The next energy level would be v=1.

So the photon needs to provide enough energy to increase the vibrational state from v=0 to v=1. So the energy of the photon should be equal to the difference between E_v=1 and E_v=0.

The energy difference ΔE is E_1 - E_0 = (1 + 1/2) h w - (0 + 1/2) h w = (1/2 h w) difference, so ΔE = (1/2) h w.

But wait, wait. Or is it the full h w? Because for a harmonic oscillator, the spacing between energy levels is h w. So from v=0 to v=1, the energy difference is h w. Because E_(v+1) - E_v = h w. Let me double-check that. Oh right, yeah, because each step is h w. So E_v = (v + 1/2) h w. So E_1 is (3/2) h w and E_0 is (1/2) h w. So the difference is h w. So the photon must have an energy of h w.

Alternatively, wait, in some cases, like rotational transitions, only certain changes are allowed. But in this case, it's a vibration transition, so I think Δv = ±1 is allowed, so the photon energy just needs to match the energy difference.

So the photon's energy is E_photon = h f, where f is the frequency. But since the angular frequency is given as w, and we know that w = 2π f, so f = w / (2π). So E_photon = h w / (2π). So E_photon = (6.626e-34 J s) * (4e14 rad/s) / (2π).

Wait, but wait. No, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The energy of the photon is E_photon = h f. And since w = 2π f, so f = w/(2π). So substituting, E_photon = h * (w/(2π)).

Wait, let me compute that. So h is 6.626e-34 J·s. w is 4e14 rad/s. So (4e14) / (2π) would be approximately (4e14)/(6.283) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So E_photon = 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.20e-20 J.

Wait, but wait another thing: is the molecule allowed to absorb a photon in the vibrational transition? Or is there something else involved, like rotational energy levels as well?

Wait, the question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I believe is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration. Oh, but the question is about the next
