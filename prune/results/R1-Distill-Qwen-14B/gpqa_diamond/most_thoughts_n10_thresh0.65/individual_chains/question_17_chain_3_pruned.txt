Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

The problem says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. I remember that formation constants are related to the stability of complexes, so a high K like this means the complex is quite stable.

Wait, what's the question again? Oh right, the concentration of calcium ions. Hmm. Since the solution is the Ca-EDTA complex, I think that in solution, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions, but because the complex is stable, the degree of dissociation must be really low, right?

So, the Ca-EDTA complex is probably dissociating like this: Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. The formation constant K is given, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. I think the formation constant K is equal to [Ca-EDTA] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA] ). 

Wait, but wait a second. If the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, that's the concentration of the complex. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. Let me set up the variables. Let’s call the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. Since the complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4- per molecule, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, right? 

So the expression for K would be K = [Ca-EDTA] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA] ) = 5x10^10. Substituting, 5e10 = 0.02 / (x * x). Wait, because both [Ca²+] and [EDTA] are x each. So that becomes 5e10 = 0.02 / x².

Wait, no, wait. Because [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M, and the other terms are x each. So equation is 5e10 = (0.02) / (x²). Because K = [complex]/([Ca²
