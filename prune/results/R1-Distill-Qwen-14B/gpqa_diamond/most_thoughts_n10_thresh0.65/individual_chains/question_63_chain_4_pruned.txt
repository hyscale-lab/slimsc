Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, or the non-rigid rotor model, for a diatomic molecule. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, the energy transitions involve both rotational and vibrational states. But wait, the question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, so I think it's considering both aspects. The fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, right? So the next state would involve a transition to the next higher energy level.

Wait, but I think the question is about the transition to the next state, which might involve either a vibrational or rotational change. Oh, but the molecule is in the fundamental state, so maybe it's the first vibrational state or the first rotational state. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the fundamental state in vibration is the ground state, n=0. The next state would be n=1. But for a diatomic molecule, the rotational states are quantized as well. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B * J*(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w (n + 1/2), but I'm not sure about that. Wait, no, the vibrational energy levels are typically given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w
