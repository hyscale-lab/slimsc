Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Alright, let me think.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. Wait, but when they're moving relative to each other, I can't just subtract their speeds normally because they're moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. Oh right, I remember that at relativistic speeds, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

So the velocity addition formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait no, wait. Let me make sure. If one object is moving at u relative to a frame, and another is moving at v in the same direction, then the speed of the second object as seen from the first one's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). But wait, actually, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed would be the difference in their speeds divided by 1 minus the product of their speeds over c squared.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). So u is the speed of one object in the other's frame. So in our case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's perspective, what is B's speed
