Okay, so I've got this question here about exoplanet transits, and I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting from the given options. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, Planet_1's is P/3. Both have circular orbits.

The stars they orbit are also different. The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. However, both stars have the same radius. Oh, and Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but I'm not sure how that affects this particular calculation.

The researchers want to observe the planet that has the highest probability of transiting. So I need to figure out which planet has a higher transit probability.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the size of the planet's orbit. The formula I recall is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (a + R_s))^2

But wait, I think that's the approximate formula. Alternatively, another version is that the transit probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis (but I might be mixing things up).

Wait, no, more accurately, the probability of a transit is given by the formula:

P â‰ˆ (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s + a) / a )^2 )

Wait, perhaps I should think about the geometry. The probability depends on whether the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The chance that the inclination is just right for a transit is higher for planets with smaller semi-major axes (closer to the star) because the alignment is more probable.

Wait, another approach: the probability can be approximated using P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s + a) / a )^2 ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2, which simplifies to (R_p^2 R_s^2) / (a^2 R_s^2) ) = (R_p^2)/(a^2). But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability is highest when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on to our line of sight. The probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. The formula I found in my notes is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a )^2 

Wait, that seems a bit off. Alternatively, another source says that the probability is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s + a) / a )^2 )

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to derive it.

The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane crosses our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the favorable orbital inclinations to the total possible. The orbit must be inclined such that the planet passes in front of the star as seen from Earth
