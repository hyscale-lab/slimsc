Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. In the classical case, it's F = -kx, right? But this is relativistic, so I guess we're dealing with high speeds where relativistic effects matter.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of the mass. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different formulas. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found by considering the energy. The potential energy at maximum amplitude is (1/2)kA², and that's converted into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. So (1/2)mv² = (1/2)kA², which gives v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, the question is relativistic, so that's probably not the right approach here.

In relativity, the equations change because mass increases with velocity. Oh right, the total energy in relativity is gamma times mc². So the total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but wait, for a harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is quantized, but in this case, I think we're considering it classically.

Wait, but in the relativistic scenario, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1
