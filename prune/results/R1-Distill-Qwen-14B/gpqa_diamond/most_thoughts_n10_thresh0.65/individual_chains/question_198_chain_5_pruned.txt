Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate ion concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, dithiocyanato probably means the complex with two SCN- ions. So, the Co(SCN)₂²+ complex is the one we're interested in. I remember that the stability constant, β, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So, the higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The first step is to figure out the concentrations of all the possible cobalt complexes. Since there are four formation steps, the possible species are Co²+ (free ion), Co(SCN)⁺, Co(SCN)₂²+, Co(SCN)₃²−, and Co(SCN)₄²−? Wait, wait. No, wait, let me think again. For each step, the charge increases by one SCN⁻. So, Co²+ can form complexes with 1, 2, 3, or 4 SCN⁻ ions.

But wait, the stability constants go β1, β2, β3, β4. So, β1 is for the first complex: Co(SCN)⁺. Wait, no, because each SCN⁻ has a charge of -1. So Co²+ plus one SCN⁻ would be CoSCN⁺ (charge 2+ + (-1) = +1). So β1 is for the first complex. Similarly, β2 is for Co(SCN)₂²+ (since charge becomes +2 - 2 = 0? Wait, no, no. Let me get the charges right.

Wait, Co²+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN⁻ is -1. So when they form a complex, the overall charge depends on the number of SCN⁻ attached. So:

- Co²+ → charge +2
- CoSCN⁺ → +2 + (-1) = +1? No, wait, when a ligand binds, it's neutral in the complex. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the complex formula. For Co and SCN:

The first complex is [Co(SCN)]²+? Because Co²+ plus one SCN⁻ would give charge +2-1 = +1? Or wait, no, [Co(SCN)]²+ would mean that the complex as a whole has a charge of +2. So, SCN⁻ is a ligand that contributes a -1 charge, but when part of a complex, it's considered as a neutral ligand? Hmm, maybe I should look up the standard notation, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the general formula for the nth complex would be [Co(SCN)_n]^{2 - (n-1)}. Or wait, maybe that's not correct. Let's think: Co²+ has a charge
