Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with some spots on it. These spots are covering one hemisphere, and they have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective, causing brightness variations that could look like an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

The main question is: if there were an exoplanet causing the same brightness variations (same amplitude in the light curve), what would be its radius relative to the star's radius?

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet compared to the star. The formula I think is (Rp/Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius. But wait, in this case, the star has spots, so the situation is a bit more complicated.

The star's spots are causing the brightness variations, but we need to model that as if it were a planet. So maybe we should calculate the equivalent signal the spots produce and then find the planet radius that would cause the same effect.

Let me break it down. The star is observed in photometric time series. As the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, which makes the observed brightness dip because the spots are cooler. The filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the hemisphere is spots. But wait, the star's surface is a sphere, so the hemisphere's area is (4πR²)/2 = 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total area of spots is 0.4πR².

But how does this affect the brightness? The star's total luminosity without spots would be L = 4πR² σ Teff⁴. But with spots, part of the surface is cooler. The spots have a temperature of (6000K - 1000K) = 5000K. Wait, no, the temperature difference is 1000K, but it's not specified whether they're hotter or cooler. Oh, wait, the question says the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. Since the star's Teff is 6000K, the spots are probably 5000K, but I need to read carefully. It says "temperature difference of 1000K", but it's not clear. Oh, wait, the star has a Teff of 6000K, and the spots are cooler, I think, because spots are darker. So the spot temperature is 5000K.

The star emits more light when the unspotted hemisphere is visible and less when the spotted side is facing us. The variation in brightness (ΔL) would be the difference between the maximum and minimum light received.

The maximum light is when the unspotted hemisphere is fully visible. The minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible. Wait,
