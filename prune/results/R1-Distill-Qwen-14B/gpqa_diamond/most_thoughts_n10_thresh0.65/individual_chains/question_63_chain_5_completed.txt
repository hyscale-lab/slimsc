Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, diatomic means it's made of two atoms, X and Y. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think means the lowest energy state. They want to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, would switch the molecule to the next lowest energy state. So, I guess we need to figure out the energy difference between these two states and then relate that to the photon's momentum.

The given data: Mx is 20 amu (atomic mass units), My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms. And the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, amu... right, atomic mass units. Oh, and 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So I'll need to convert those masses into kilograms for calculations.

So first, let's find the reduced mass of the molecule because in rotational and vibrational models, the reduced mass is crucial. The formula for reduced mass mu is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). 

Calculating mu: Mx is 20, My is 2. So mu = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818... amu. But let's convert that to kg. 1.818 amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu. Let me calculate that: approximately 1.818 * 1.66e-27. Hmm, 1.8 * 1.66 is around 2.988, so 2.988e-27 kg. Wait, let me get the exact number. 20/11 is about 1.8181818 amu. Multiply by 1.66e-27: 1.81818 * 1.66 = let's see, 1.8 * 1.66 is about 2.988, and 0.01818 *1.66 is about 0.02997. So total about 3.0179e-27 kg? Maybe I should calculate it more accurately later, but perhaps I can just keep it in symbolic form for now.

Next, the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think refers to the lowest vibrational state (v=0), but wait, in rotation-vibration coupling models, the states are described by both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers. The fundamental state is v=0 and the lowest rotational state, which is J=0 (since J can be 0,1,2,...). So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it moves to the next higher state. The next state could be either increasing J by 1 (vibrational stays same, rotational changes) or increasing v by 1 (rotational stays same, vibrational changes). But wait, the problem says "next state with the lowest possible energy." So the energy levels are a combination of vibrational and rotational energies. So the next state would be the one with the smallest energy increment above the current state.

Hmm, so which transition has the lower energy: a change in vibrational state (v=0→v=1) or a change in rotational state (J=0→J=1)? Because the energy required for these transitions might be different.

Wait, the energy levels for rotation are quantized. The rotational energy is given by E_rot = B * J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy is E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v, where v is the vibrational quantum number. So in the fundamental state, v=0, J=0. The next possible states would be either J=1 (v=0) or v=1 (J=0). Which one has lower energy?

Let me compute the energies. 

First, the energy of the fundamental state: E0 = E_rot (J=0) + E_vib (v=0) = 0 + 0 = 0 (well, not exactly, but relative to zero). 

The next states: 

- For J=1, v=0: E_rot = B*(1)(2)=2B, E_vib=0. So E1 = 2B.

- For J=0, v=1: E_rot=0, E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w (1) = (3/2) h w. 

So which is smaller, 2B or (3/2) h w? That determines which transition has lower energy.

So I need to calculate both B and (3/2) h w and compare.

The rotational constant B is given by h/(8 pi^2 mu R^2 c), wait no, wait. Rotational constant B is h/(8 pi^2 mu R²) ) divided by something? Wait, no, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), and B is given by (h²)/(8 pi² mu R²).

Wait, right, the rotational constant B is h/(8 pi² mu R²). No, wait. The formula for B is (h/(8 pi²)) * (1/(mu R²)). Because rotational energy levels are (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. And I = mu R². Also, ħ is h/(2 pi). So let me get this right.

The moment of inertia I = mu * R².

The rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ħ² / (2 I)) * J (J+1) = (h²/(8 pi² I)) * J (J+1) = (h²/(8 pi² mu R²)) * J (J+1). So B is h²/(8 pi² mu R²). 

So B = (h^2) / (8 pi² mu R²)

But h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of wavenumbers or something else? Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute both B and (3/2) h w numerically, then compare.

So let's proceed.

First, let's compute B.

Given mu in kg, R in meters.

mu = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = 40/22 amu = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.818 amu. Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg.

Let me compute that: 1.818 * 1.66 = 3.01788e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

Now, B = h²/(8 pi² mu R²).

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

Compute numerator h²: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx (4.39e-67) (exact value is 6.626^2 = around 43.9, so 43.9e-68 → 4.39e-67 J²s²).

Denominator: 8 pi² * mu * R².

Compute denominator:

8 pi² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

mu ≈ 3.01788e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m → R² = 4e-20 m².

So denominator: 78.9568 * 3.01788e-27 kg * 4e-20 m².

Multiply 78.9568 * 3.01788e-27 → approx 78.9568 *3e-27 = 2.3687e-25, but more accurately, 78.9568 *3.01788e-27 = 78.9568 *3.01788= ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute step by step.

78.9568 * 3.01788e-27 = let me compute 78.9568 *3.01788 = about 78.9568 *3 = 236.87, plus 78.9568 *0.01788≈ 1.410. So total ≈ 238.28e-27 → 2.3828e-25.

Wait, wait, no, wait: 78.9568 multiplied by 3.01788 is approximately 78.9568 *3 = 236.87, 78.9568 *0.01788 ≈ 78.9568 *0.017=approx 1.342, 78.9568 *0.00088 ≈0.0695. So total around 236.87 + 1.342 +0.0695 ≈ 238.281. So 238.281e-27 → 2.38281e-25.

Then multiply by R² (4e-20 m²): 2.38281e-25 *4e-20 = 9.53124e-45.

So denominator is 9.53124e-45 kg m².

So B = numerator (4.39e-67) / denominator (9.53124e-45) → 4.39e-67 / 9.53e-45 ≈ (4.39 /9.53) *1e-22 ≈ 0.46e-22 → 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, wait, let me calculate it more accurately.

4.39e-67 / 9.53124e-45 = (4.39 / 9.53124) ) * 1e-67 +45 = (0.46) *1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

So B ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

Now, the energy for J=1 is E_rot = 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

Next, compute the vibrational energy when v=1. The vibrational energy is (3/2) h w.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

w is 4e14 rad/s.

So (3/2) h w = (3/2) *6.626e-34 *4e14.

Compute that: 3/2 is 1.5.

1.5 *6.626e-34 = approx 9.939e-34.

Multiply by 4e14: 9.939e-34 *4e14 = 3.9756e-19 J.

So E_vibrational = 3.9756e-19 J.

Compare E_rot=9.2e-23 J and E_vibrational=3.9756e-19 J.

E_rot is much smaller. So the next state with the lowest energy is J=1, v=0. So the transition is from (J=0, v=0) to (J=1, v=0).

Wait, but wait a second. The energy for J=1 is 2B =9.2e-23 J. But the energy for v=1 is 3.9756e-19 J, which is about 4.3e21 times higher. So the transition with lower energy would be the rotational one. Therefore, the photon needed would be the one that provides the rotational energy, not the vibrational.

Wait, but wait. The question says: "the next state with the lowest possible energy". So the next state could be either a higher state in rotation or in vibration, but which one requires less energy. Since 2B is much lower than the first vibrational energy, the photon would be for rotation.

So the energy difference is 2B.

Wait, but wait. No, wait. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is (J=0, v=0). The next state with the lowest energy is the one with the smallest energy above the fundamental. So if the energy levels are E = E_vib + E_rot.

So possible next states are:

1. J=1, v=0 → E = 2B +0 = 2B.

2. J=0, v=1 → E = (3/2) h w.

Which of these is lower? Since 2B is 9.2e-23 J and (3/2) h w is 3.97e-19 J, 2B is way smaller. So the molecule would prefer to transition to J=1, v=0 as it requires less energy. So the photon's energy should match the energy difference of 2B.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state is the one immediately above the fundamental state with the least energy. So that would be the J=1, v=0 state, requiring energy 2B.

So the energy of the photon should be equal to 2B.

Alternatively, could there be a transition that changes both J and v? Like J=1, v=1? But that would have even higher energy, so that's not the minimal.

So the answer is the photon has energy 2B.

But wait, the problem is about the momentum of the photon, not the energy. So we need to find p = E/c, since for photons, E = pc.

Wait, no: E = h f = pc → p = E/c.

Wait, but let me think. The energy of a photon is E = h f = pc, where p is the momentum. So p = E/(c).

But wait, in this case, the energy needed is 2B. So the photon's energy E_photon = 2B =9.2e-23 J.

So p_photon = E_photon / c = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s).

Compute that: 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.0666e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, 9.2 /3 is about 3.0666, and 1e-23 /1e8=1e-31. So 3.066e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me compute it more accurately. 9.2 /3 is exactly 3.066666..., so 3.066666e-31 kg m/s.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation of B.

Wait, B was computed as 4.6e-23 J. So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

So E_photon =9.2e-23 J.

p_photon = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (9.2 /3) *1e-31 = ~3.066e-31 kg m/s.

But looking at the options, they are in the order of 1e-27 N·s.

Wait, wait. Oh! Because 1 N·s is 1 kg·m/s. So 3.066e-31 kg·m/s is 3.066e-31 N·s.

But the options are much larger:

Options are A: ~2e-28, B: ~2e-27, C: ~1e-27, D: ~1e-28.

Wait, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Hmm. Let's recheck the computation of B.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of B.

Let me recalculate B step by step.

B = h²/(8 pi² mu R²).

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 = approx 43.9, so 43.9e-68 → 4.39e-67 J²s².

mu is (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Convert mu to kg: 1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg/amu.

1.818 *1.6605 = let's calculate that.

1.6605 *1.8 = 3.0, 1.6605 *0.018=0.02989. So total 3.02989e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms → 2e-10 m. So R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

Now, denominator:

8 pi² mu R² = 8 * (pi^2) * mu * R².

Calculate each part:

8 pi² ≈ 8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

mu R² = (3.02989e-27 kg) * (4e-20 m²) = 1.211956e-46 kg m².

Multiply by 78.9568: 78.9568 *1.211956e-46 ≈ let's compute 78.9568 *1.211956 = approx 78.9568 *1.2 =94.748, plus 78.9568 *0.011956≈ 0.947. So total ~95.695e-46 →9.5695e-45.

So denominator is 9.5695e-45.

So B = (4.39e-67) / (9.5695e-45) = (4.39 /9.5695)*1e-22 ≈ 0.4589e-22 → 4.589e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.178e-23 J.

So that's correct. So E_photon =9.178e-23 J.

p_photon = E_photon /c =9.178e-23 /3e8 = 3.059e-31 kg m/s =3.059e-31 N·s.

But looking at the options, the choices are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, 3e-31 is way smaller than the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, wait, perhaps the molecule is a rigid rotor, but the question says non-rigid (rotating-vibrating model). But perhaps for the purposes of this question, the transition is in vibration, not rotation.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It could be that the molecule is in its ground vibrational state but in the lowest rotational state. So the next state with the lowest possible energy is the next vibrational state, not the rotational.

Wait, but in that case, the energy required would be higher. But the options don't go that low.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I confused w with the rotational frequency. Maybe the question is about the rotational transition, but maybe I should calculate the vibrational energy instead.

Wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So if the rotational energy is lower than the vibrational, the photon should provide that. But perhaps I made a mistake in the direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in the vibrational ground state but the rotational state can change, so the next state is the next rotational state.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the vibrational transition because the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which couples rotation and vibration. Hmm, but the fundamental state is the lowest energy, which is v=0 and J=0.

But then the next state could be J=1, v=0 (rotational) or v=1, J=0 (vibrational).

But the energy required for J=1 is 2B, and for v=1 it's (3/2) h w.

Wait, the problem statement says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the minimal possible energy difference is 2B, which is about 9e-23 J, but the options are way larger. So perhaps I messed up the units.

Wait, could the question be about the energy for a vibrational transition? Because (3/2) h w is about 3.97e-19 J, which is much larger than 2B, but the photon's momentum would be (3.97e-19 J)/(3e8 m/s) = ~1.323e-27 kg·m/s = 1.323e-27 N·s. That's closer to option C (1.1e-27) or B (2.3e-27).

Wait, but why would the fundamental state transition to vibrational state? Because the rotational transition requires less energy, so why would it go to vibration?

Wait, maybe I need to think about selection rules. For rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. For vibrational, Δv = ±1.

But in the non-rigid rotor model, the states are a combination of rotation and vibration. So perhaps the next state is a combination of both, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the photon has to provide enough energy to overcome both a rotational and a vibrational transition. But that would give a higher energy, which is not the minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the vibrational state transition, not the rotational. But that would require a higher energy.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let's recalculate B.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for B.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is given by (h²)/(8 pi² I), where I is the moment of inertia.

I = mu R^2.

So B = h²/(8 pi² mu R²).

Wait, let me recompute B.

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J²s².

mu is (20*2)/(20+2) amu → 40/22 amu → ~1.818 amu. Converting to kg: 1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.029e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m. R squared is (2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

So denominator: 8 pi² mu R².

8 pi² ≈78.9568.

mu R² =3.029e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.2116e-46 kg m².

Multiply by 78.9568: 78.9568 *1.2116e-46 = approx 9.57e-45 kg m².

So B =4.39e-67 / 9.57e-45 = approximately (4.39/9.57) *1e-22 ≈ 0.458e-22 →4.58e-23 J.

So that's correct. So 2B is 9.16e-23 J.

Now, the photon's energy would be 9.16e-23 J, and its momentum p= E/c = (9.16e-23)/(3e8) = 3.05e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. So 3e-31 is way smaller than that.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the molecule as a rigid rotor, in which case the energy levels are purely rotational. But no, the question says non-rigid rotor, which includes both rotation and vibration.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition is for a vibration, not rotation.

Wait, let's compute the energy required for the first vibrational transition, which is from v=0 to v=1.

The energy difference is (3/2 h w). Because the vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w (1 + 2v), so the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is (3/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) ) = h w.

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. The vibrational energy is E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So the energy for v=0 is (1/2) h w, and for v=1, it's (3/2) h w. The energy difference is (3/2 - 1/2) h w = h w.

So the energy required for the vibrational transition is h w. So E_photon = h w.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

w is 4e14 rad/s.

So E_photon =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Then, the momentum p = E_photon / c = (2.6504e-19 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 8.835e-28 kg·m/s = 8.835e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, D is 1.4e-28. So 8.8e-28 is not exactly matching any, but maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, but wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me compute again:

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) e(-34+14) =26.504e-20 → 2.6504e-19 J. Correct.

p = E/c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 = (2.6504/3 )e-27 →≈0.8835e-27 → 8.835e-28 Ns.

But none of the options match exactly. Closest is option D: 1.4e-28, but that's about half of our value.

Wait, perhaps the transition isn't the vibrational one but another. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the model.

Wait, the problem says it's the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. So the molecule's energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational states, but the selection rules might allow for transitions that change both J and v.

But that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps in this model, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) but any rotational state (J=0,1,2...). So the next state with the lowest energy would be J=1, v=0, which requires 2B as before. But earlier calculation of p=3e-31 Ns is way below the options.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for B. Alternatively, perhaps B is not in Joules but in cm^-1 or some other units. Wait, B has units of energy, so J is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the formula for B.

Alternative approach: perhaps B is in terms of the vibrational frequency.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: let's compute the options' energies and see which one matches.

The options are the momenta. So each p can be converted to energy E=pc.

Option A: p=1.9e-28 kg m/s → E=1.9e-28 *3e8 =5.7e-20 J.

Option B: p=2.3e-27 → E=2.3e-27 *3e8 =6.9e-19 J.

Option C: 1.1e-27 → E=3.3e-19 J.

Option D:1.4e-28 → E=4.2e-20 J.

The energy required for the vibrational transition is E=h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J, which is about 2.65e-19 J. Looking at the options, option C has E=3.3e-19 J, which is close but a bit higher. Option B is 6.9e-19, which is much higher.

Alternatively, the energy for the rotational transition was 2B=9.2e-23 J, which is way too low.

Hmm, none of the options match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the model requires the photon to supply both a rotational and a vibrational transition. But that's unlikely to be the next lowest state.

Alternatively, perhaps I should be looking at the energy for the first excited vibrational state, which is E=h w =2.65e-19 J, so p=8.8e-28 Ns, which isn't an option but close to option D (1.4e-28). Hmm, not close.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mu calculation.

Wait, mu is (Mx*My)/(Mx+My) → (20 *2)/(20+2) →40/22=20/11=1.818 amu.

But perhaps the bond length R is given as 2 angstroms, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the rotational energy as E_rot = B J (J+1), but B is in terms of reciprocal centimeters or some other unit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is given by h c / (8 pi^2 mu R^2), where c is the speed of light. Because sometimes rotational constants are expressed in wavenumbers (cm^-1), which would involve c.

Wait, let me think. B is the rotational constant. The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1) * h c? No, wait.

Wait, the energy levels for rotation can also be expressed in terms of wavenumbers. So B is often given in cm^-1, where B = h/(8 pi^2 mu R^2 c).

Wait, perhaps I should recompute B in terms of cm^-1.

Wait, 1 cm =0.01 m. So 1 m =100 cm. So 1 m^-1 =100 cm^-1.

Wait, let me get the formula correctly.

The rotational constant in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1) is B = h/(8 pi^2 mu R^2 c).

So c=3e8 m/s.

Wait, mu is in kg, R is in meters.

So B (in cm^-1) = h/(8 pi² mu R² c).

Compute that.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

mu=3.029e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

c=3e8 m/s.

Compute denominator: 8 pi^2 * mu * R^2 * c.

8 pi^2=78.9568.

mu R^2=3.029e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2=3.029e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2116e-46 kg m².

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s):1.2116e-46 *3e8=3.6348e-38 kg m²/s.

Multiply by 78.9568: 78.9568 *3.6348e-38 ≈2.861e-36.

So B =6.626e-34 / 2.861e-36 = approx 2313 cm^-1.

Wait, 6.626e-34 /2.861e-36 = (6.626 /2.861) *1e2 → approx 2.31 →231 cm^-1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 6.626e-34 /2.861e-36 is (6.626/2.861)*1e2 → approx 2.31 * 100 =231 cm^-1.

But wait, that would make B=231 cm^-1. So then E_rot would be B J (J+1) in cm^-1. So for J=0→1, the energy difference is 2B * h c.

Wait, because energy in Joules is E = B * J (J+1) * h c.

Wait, no. If B is in cm^-1, then E_rot = B * hc * J (J+1).

Because E_rot (in J) = B (cm^-1) * hc (J·cm) = B hc (J).

So when J changes from 0 to 1, ΔE = B hc (2*1) -0 =2 B hc.

So ΔE=2 B h c.

So B is 231 cm^-1 → B * h c.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

c=3e8 m/s =3e10 cm/s.

So B * h c =231 cm^-1 *6.626e-34 J·s *3e10 cm/s.

Wait, let's compute this.

231 *6.626e-34= approx 231 *6.626e-34 → let's compute 231 *6.626 = approx 231*6=1386, 231*0.626=145. So total 1531 →1.531e3.

Multiply by 1e-34 →1.531e-31.

Multiply by 3e10 →1.531e-31 *3e10 =4.593e-21 J.

So ΔE=2*4.593e-21 =9.186e-21 J.

Wait, now, the photon's energy E_photon must be 9.186e-21 J.

So p_photon=E_photon/c=9.186e-21 /3e8 =3.062e-29 kg·m/s =3.062e-29 N·s.

Still way smaller than the options, which are in 1e-27 to 1e-28 range.

Hmm, I'm getting more confused. I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational transition but in terms of Raman transitions, where ΔJ=±2. But that's a different scenario, and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the vibrational transition, which is higher in energy, but the options suggest that. Let's compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition.

Vibrational energy difference is h w, as before.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p_photon =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, the closest is none, but option D is 1.4e-28, which is about a sixth of that. Hmm, perhaps the problem is thinking of the photon's momentum as p = h bar * something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the model is the rigid rotor, which only considers rotation, but not vibration. But the question says non-rigid, which includes vibration.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the (J=0, v=0) state to the (J=1, v=0) state, which requires 2B, and the photon's momentum is p=2B/c.

Wait, 2B is 9.18e-23 J.

p=9.18e-23 /3e8 =3.06e-31 N·s.

But that's 3e-31, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition where both J and v change. Like, from (J=0, v=0) to (J=1, v=1). Then the energy would be 2B + h w. But that's a higher energy, so wouldn't be the next lowest.

Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing up the selection rules. But I think I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition as a change in the rotational state, but using the wrong formula. Maybe using B= h/(8 pi² mu R²), without the squared R.

Wait, no, that would be incorrect. Oh, wait! Maybe I messed up the formula for B. Let's recheck the formula.

The correct formula for B is B = (h²) / (8 π² I), where I is the moment of inertia, I=mu R².

So B = h²/(8 pi² mu R²).

Yes, that's correct. So I don't think that's the mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the translational energy, but that's unrelated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the wrong model and considering the molecular vibration as a simple harmonic oscillator, where the energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. So the fundamental state is n=0, E= (1/2) h w. The next state is n=1, E=(3/2) h w.

So the energy difference is h w.

So E_photon =h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p_photon = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D:1.4e-28, but that's about a sixth of what we have. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for w. Wait, w is given as 4e14 rad/s. So correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational transition's energy as (1/2) h w, but that's the ground state energy, not the transition.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

The options have p in 1e-27 to 2e-27 range. So E = p c would be in the order of 3e-19 J. Which matches the energy for the vibrational transition.

But earlier calculation for vibrational transition p is 8.8e-28 Ns, which is much smaller than the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps the problem is considering a different approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the photon's momentum is related to the change in the angular momentum of the molecule.

Wait, but for a photon, p = E/c, and E is the energy difference. So I think that approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mu calculation.

Wait, mu is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My 2 amu.

So mu = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

1.81818 amu in kg is 1.81818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.028e-27 kg.

Yes, correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition as a change in vibrational state with v=0 to v=1, which requires energy h w. So E= h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J. So p= E/c= 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns. But none of the options match.

Wait, but the options are about 1e-27 to 2e-27, which is about 1e10 times larger than what I calculated. Did I miss a factor of 1e10 somewhere?

Ah! Wait a second. Bond length R is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Is that correct? Or did I convert it wrong?

Wait, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for B is wrong. Could it be that B is (h²)/(8 pi² mu R^2) * (1/(2)) ?

No, I don't think so. The standard formula is B = h²/(8 pi² I), with I=mu R².

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rotational energy in terms of Raman activity, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's momentum in a different way, such as using the relativistic equation, but that's way beyond our current discussion.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, or I'm misinterpreting it. The question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. So the next state would be the next higher energy, which is either a rotational or vibrational state.

Wait, perhaps the next state is a combination of both, but that would require more energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a harmonic oscillator, where the energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. So the fundamental state is E= (1/2) h w. The next state is n=1, E= (3/2) h w. The energy difference is h w. So the photon's momentum is E/c = (h w)/c.

Wait, that's what I thought earlier, but that gives p=8.8e-28 Ns, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, maybe using the wrong value for Planck's constant.

Wait, h=6.626e-34 J·s. Correct.

c=3e8 m/s. Correct.

Wait, let me compute h w again: 6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) e(-34+14)=26.504e-20 →2.6504e-19 J. Correct.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the energy to be (3/2) h w. Wait, why would that be? Because the vibrational ground state is (1/2) h w, and the next state is (3/2) h w. So the energy difference is h w, not (3/2) h w.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as (3/2) h w. So E=3.975e-19 J.

p=3.975e-19 /3e8 =1.325e-27 Ns. Which is close to option C:1.1e-27, or option B:2.3e-27.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a change in rotational state where J goes from 0 to 2, which would require B*(2)(3)=6B, but that's way higher than J=1.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from J=0 to J=2? No, because that's a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state but in a different way.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let's look at the options again.

If the correct p is around 8.8e-28 Ns, and the options don't have that, perhaps the answer is option D)1.4e-28 Ns, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R. Wait, R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. Correct.

Hmm, I think I've tried all the possible approaches and can't get an option that matches. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that the transition is vibrational. Another possibility is that the question is considering the photon's momentum as related to the change in the molecule's linear momentum, but that's not standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the energy for the transition from J=0 to J=1, which is 2B=9.178e-23 J, and then find p.

p=9.178e-23 /3e8 =3.06e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are close to that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the wrong formula for B, such as B = h/(8 pi² mu R²) instead of h²/(8 pi² mu R²). Let me check what that would give.

If B= h/(8 pi² mu R^2), then B=6.626e-34 / (8 pi² *3.029e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2).

Compute denominator:

8 pi^2=78.9568.

3.029e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.2116e-46 kg m².

Multiply by 78.9568: 78.9568 *1.2116e-46 ≈9.57e-45 kg m².

So B=6.626e-34 /9.57e-45 ≈6.918e9 J.

Wait, but that's a huge value. Which would make 2B=1.38e10 J. Which is way more than the vibrational transition. So that can't be right.

So I think that approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should give up and look for the option that matches the vibrational transition, but I can't find it.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is considering the transition as a change in both J and V. For example, J increases by 1 and V increases by 1. But that would require more energy, so it wouldn't be the next state.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the rotational energy as E_rot = (J (J+1) ) * (h/(8 pi² I)).

But that's the same as B J (J+1), so the approach is correct.

Hmm, I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on the calculations, the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition is about 8.8e-28 Ns, which is close to option D:1.4e-28, but that's much smaller. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option A:1.9e-28, which is about twice that.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate h w.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h w=6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) *1e-34+14=26.504e-20 →2.6504e-19 J.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8346e-28 Ns.

That's approximately 8.8e-28 Ns. The closest option is option A:1.9e-28. No, that's about a fifth of that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Planck's constant, like h=4.135667696e-15 eV·s. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, let me compute it using eV.

E_photon =h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

1 eV =1.602e-19 J. So E_photon =2.65e-19 /1.602e-19 ≈1.654 eV.

p_photon = E_photon /c = (1.654 eV) / (3e8 m/s) * (1.602e-19 J/eV).

Wait, no, that's getting more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in eV, but the options are in Ns.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct approach is to consider the vibrational transition, which gives p_photon=8.8e-28 Ns, but since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option D:1.4e-28 Ns, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the energy difference as (3/2) h w. So E= (3/2)*6.626e-34 *4e14 = 3.9756e-19 J.

p=3.9756e-19 /3e8 =1.325e-27 Ns. Which is close to option C:1.1e-27 Ns.

But why would the energy be (3/2) h w? Because the vibrational energy levels are E= (n + 1/2) h w. So from n=0 to n=1, the change is h w. So why would it be (3/2) h w?

No, that would be the energy of the v=1 state, not the transition. The transition is h w.

So I think the correct approach is to choose the vibrational transition, but the given options don't match. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option A:1.9e-28 Ns, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option B:2.3e-27 Ns, but I can't see where.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the rotational energy again.

h=6.626e-34.

mu=3.029e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

Compute B = h²/(8 pi² mu R²).

h²=4.39e-67.

denominator:8 pi^2 mu R^2=78.9568 *3.029e-27 kg *4e-20 m².

Compute 3.029e-27 *4e-20=1.2116e-46.

78.9568 *1.2116e-46 =9.57e-45.

So B=4.39e-67/9.57e-45=4.58e-23 J.

So the rotational transition gives p=3e-31 Ns, which is way too small.

Given that I can't find a matching option, perhaps the intended answer is option B:2.3e-27 Ns, which corresponds to E=6.9e-19 J, which is 2.65e-19 * something.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should pick the option that matches the vibrational transition, which is around 8.8e-28 Ns. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option D:1.4e-28. But I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition where both J and v change, but that would require a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the vibrational energy as (3/2) h w, which is the energy of the v=1 state. So the photon's energy would be (3/2) h w, which is E=3.9756e-19 J, and p=1.325e-27 Ns. Which is close to option C:1.1e-27.

But the transition is from v=0 to v=1, which requires h w, not (3/2)h w. So I'm confused.

Given the time I've spent and the options, I think the intended answer is option A:1.9e-28 Ns. But I'm not confident.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and the goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The given parameters are:

- Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
- Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reduced Mass Calculation**:  
   The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.029 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

2. **Rotational Constant \( B \)**:  
   The rotational constant \( B \) is given by:
   \[
   B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 \mu R^2},
   \]
   where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Substituting the values:
   \[
   B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 \cdot 3.029 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2}.
   \]
   After calculations, \( B \approx 4.58 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).

3. **Energy for Rotational Transition**:  
   The rotational energy levels are \( E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1) \). For \( J = 0 \to 1 \), the energy difference is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \approx 9.16 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Energy for Vibrational Transition**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are \( E_{\text{vib}} = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \omega \). For \( v = 0 \to 1 \), the energy difference is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

5. **Comparison of Transition Energies**:  
   The rotational transition energy (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \)) is much smaller than the vibrational transition energy (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \)). Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy corresponds to the rotational transition.

6. **Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition**:  
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). For \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.16 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \):
   \[
   p = \frac{9.16 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.05 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}.
   \]
   This value is orders of magnitude smaller than any of the provided options, suggesting a potential mismatch in the problem setup or interpretation.

7. **Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition**:  
   For the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
   \[
   p = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
   \]
   This value is also not directly matched by the options but is closest to **Option D** (\( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)).

### Conclusion:
The analysis suggests that the rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. However, none of the provided options match the calculated rotational or vibrational photon momentum. Based on the vibrational transition, the closest option is **D**, but the discrepancy suggests a possible issue with the problem's framing or units.

ANSWER: D
