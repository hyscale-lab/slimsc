Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's see what I remember about these techniques. 

The question says the compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I think broad peaks in that area usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Then there's a strong peak at 1700 and another at 1650. Oh wait, 1700 is a strong carbonyl region. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1650 is a bit lower, maybe conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents.

Next, the 1H NMR has peaks with vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond somewhere. 

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass for fragments. Let me think... 45 could be something like (CH3)2O which is 45 (since 12*2 + 1*6 + 16= 46? Wait, no, maybe CH3OCH3 would be 60. Or maybe it's a ketene ion? Wait, another possibility: the fragment might be a CH2=CH-O group. Wait, maybe it's a vinyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group or something else. Alternatively, the molecular ion breaking down.

Let me try to piece this together. The possible formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

Looking at the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N. Let's compute for each option:

For C6H12O: C=6, H=12, O=1. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a double bond or a ring. But wait, if it's a ring plus something else, but maybe the O is an alcohol or ether. 

C6H10O: (2*6+2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. Two degrees: maybe a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, or a triple bond and a ring.

C6H10O2: (2*6+2 -10 - 0)/2= (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees. Could be a double bond and a ring, or a carbonyl group and a double bond, etc.

C6H12O2: (2*6+2 -12 -0)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree: a ring or a double bond. But considering O2, maybe esters, ketones, etc.

Wait, the FTIR shows a broad peak around 3000. That's likely O-H stretch, but where else? An alcohol would have a broad peak, but maybe a carboxylic acid would be broader around 2500-3300. Alternatively, maybe an ester or ketone doesn't have O-H. Wait, the broad peak at 3000 could also be an amino group, but I don't think that's the case here since the problem mentions vinyl hydrogens, not amines.

So, if it's O-H, then the compound has an -OH group. So that would narrow it down. Looking at the options, all have O, except... no, wait all options have O. So O is present in all. So the O could be in an alcohol, ether, ester, ketone, etc.

Wait, the strong IR peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1
