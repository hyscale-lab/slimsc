Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

The problem says we need to calculate the eigenvector of the operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are often used for spin operators, and the eigenvectors correspond to spin-up or spin-down states along a particular direction.

Wait, the operator is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So let me write them down.

P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

The operator vector P is the sum of these components multiplied by the direction vector n. So if the direction is along some arbitrary unit vector n = (nx, ny, nz), then P = nx P_x + ny P_y + nz P_z.

But wait, the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane. Oh right, so that means the y-component ny is zero. So n is (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1.

So the operator simplifies to P = nx P_x + nz P_z.

The eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>. Because the eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. So we need to find the eigenvector |v> such that (nx P_x + nz P_z) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, but remember that each P_x and P_z are multiplied by ħ/2. Let me factor that out. So the operator is (ħ/2)(nx σ_x + nz σ_z), where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices. So the equation becomes:

(ħ/2)(nx σ_x + nz σ_z) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to get:

(nx σ_x + nz σ_z) |v> = |v>

So the matrix form of the operator inside is nx [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Let me write that as a 2x2 matrix: [[nz, nx],[nx, -nz]].

The eigenvalues for this matrix are ±1, because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 when combined in this way, scaled by direction components. Wait, nx² + nz² = 1, so the eigenvalues would be ±sqrt(nz² + nx²) = ±1, yes.

So since we want the eigenvalue +1, the equation is (nx σ_x + nz σ_z) |v> = |v>.

Wait, but wait. The matrix equation is (nx σ_x + nz σ_z) |v> = 1 * |v>.

So to find the eigenvector, the matrix is [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]].

Let me denote the eigenvector as a column vector [a; b], so that when we multiply by the matrix, we get [nz a + nx b; nx a - nz b ].

And this should equal [a; b]. So the equations are:

nz a + nx b = a → (nz - 1) a + nx b = 0

nx a - nz b = b → nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0

Let me write these two equations:

1. (nz - 1) a + nx b = 0

2. nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0

Hmm. Let me consider equation 1. Let's solve for a in terms of b or vice versa.

From equation 1:

(nz -1) a = - nx b → a = [ -nx/(nz -1) ] b

Similarly, equation 2:

nx a = (nz +1) b → a = [ (nz +1)/nx ] b

Wait, but for these to be consistent, the two expressions for a must be equal.

So,

-nx / (nz -1) = (nz +1)/nx

Multiply both sides by (nz -1) * nx to eliminate denominators:

-nx² = (nz +1)(nz -1 )

But nx² + nz² = 1, since n is a unit vector. So (nz +1)(nz -1) = nz² -1 = (1 - nx²) -1 = -nx².

So substituting:

-nx² = (-nx²) → which checks out. So the equations are consistent, and we can proceed.

So, let's pick one equation to find the relation between a and b.

From equation 1: a = [ -nx/(nz -1) ] b

Let me express this as a = [nx/(1 - nz) ] b, since I can factor negative signs.

The eigenvector is [a; b], and it should be normalized. So |a|² + |b|² = 1.

But since the system is real? Wait, no, because the operator is Hermitian, so the eigenvectors are real or can be taken as real, but wait the operator here is a combination of σ_x and σ_z, which are Hermitian, so the overall operator is Hermitian. So the eigenvectors can be taken as real or have complex components? Wait, no, in this case, because the operator is real, the eigenvectors can be taken to be real. Or perhaps not, if the direction n has components leading to complex eigenvectors? Wait, actually, I think in this case, since the operator is real and symmetric (since it's a combination of σ_x and σ_z, which are real), the eigenvectors can be taken as real.

Wait, no. Wait, σ_x and σ_z are Hermitian, so any real combination is also Hermitian. So the operator is Hermitian, so the eigenvectors are orthogonal and can be chosen to be real, but it depends on the direction. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to proceed by parameterizing the direction.

Since the direction is in the x-z plane, we can describe it using an angle θ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ. Because in the x-z plane, the unit vector would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), ensuring that n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So replacing nx and nz with sinθ and cosθ, respectively.

So, our operator matrix becomes:

[[ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ].

Wait no, let me recalculate. The matrix is nx σ_x + nz σ_z.

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so nx σ_x is [[0, nx],[nx, 0]]

σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so nz σ_z is [[nz, 0], [0, -nz]]

Adding these, the matrix becomes:

[[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]

Which when nx = sinθ and nz = cosθ, it becomes:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [
