Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, stability constants, right, they tell us about the stability of metal-ligand complexes. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, the problem says the solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are for the complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I remember that β values increase with the number of ligands attached, so higher β means more stable complexes. But wait, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3=63. So the order of stability is β3 > β2 > β1 > β4? Or wait, maybe the numbering is different. Let me think—if β1 is for the first complex, perhaps [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is [Co(SCN)2]^0, β3 is [Co(SCN)3]^- maybe, and β4 is [Co(SCN)4]^2-? Or wait, maybe the numbering goes from lower to higher, like β1 is the first complex, β2 the second, etc.

The blue dithiocyanato complex—dithiocyanato means two SCN ligands. So that would be the [Co(SCN)2]^0 complex, I think. So that's the β2 value of 40. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the numbering. Let's clarify: the stability constants are given in order, so β1 is the first complex, which would have one SCN ligand. So [Co(SCN)]^+ would have a charge of +1 (since Co^2+ plus one SCN^- gives charge +1). Then β2 is the complex with two SCNs: [Co(SCN)2]^0, because 2 SCN^- would neutralize the Co^2+ charge. That's a neutral complex. β3 would be [Co(SCN)3]^–, and β4 would be [Co(SCN)4]^2–.

So the question is asking about the percentage of the β2 complex, the dithiocyanato one. So I need to find the fraction of Co(II) that is in the form of [Co(SCN)
