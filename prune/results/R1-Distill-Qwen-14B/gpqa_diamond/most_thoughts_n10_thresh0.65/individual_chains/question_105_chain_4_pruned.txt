Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

So the question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when we observe the star's brightness over time, it'll vary as the star rotates—this is called rotational modulation. The situation is said to resemble the presence of an exoplanet. The question is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet needed to produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots?

The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm. So I think I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by a planet. Let's break it down.

First, what causes the brightness variation in each case? For the star with spots, the spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears dimmer. As the star rotates, different parts of the surface come into view. The brightness variation is due to the spots blocking the hotter, brighter regions. For a planet, when it transits in front of the star, it blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness. So the amplitude of the dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star.

Wait, but in this problem, the star has spots, and we need to find the planet radius that would cause the same dip in brightness as the spots do. So I need to calculate the fractional change in brightness (ΔF/F) for both scenarios and set them equal, then solve for Rplanet/Rstar.

Let me think about each scenario.

First, the star's spots. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. Wait, wait. The star emits light from its entire surface, so the hemisphere that's spotty is half the star's surface. So the spots cover 20% of half the surface. Let me compute the total area covered by spots.

Wait, no. The filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the spots take up 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2), because a hemisphere's area is (4π R²)/2 = 2π R². So 0.2 * (π R² / 2) = 0.1 π R².

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the fractional area of the star covered by spots. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, which is half the star's surface. So the spots take up 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area covered is 0.2 * (π R² / 2) = 0.1 π R². The entire star's surface area is 4π R², so the fractional area covered is 0.1 π R² / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1 /4 = 0.025, or 2.5% of the star's surface.

But wait, since the star is rotating
