Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the area of a pseudosphere using the given metric. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about pseudospheres and metrics in general relativity or differential geometry.

Wait, the question gives the metric as ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form, but I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. Oh right, and in two dimensions, it's like a saddle shape that extends infinitely.

The question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, but pseudospheres are usually more about hyperbolic geometry. Oh, right! Pseudosphere in this context might refer to a hyperboloid of one sheet, which can represent a surface of constant negative curvature.

Wait, the metric given looks like it's in 2D, because it's only involving dx and dy. So maybe we're working in two dimensions here. The metric is ds² = (32 / (4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, that denominator looks like (4 - x² - y²), which I can write as (r² where r² = x² + y², so 4 - r²). So the denominator becomes 4 - r².

I think the area element in this metric would be the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy. Wait, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy²) dx dy, but since the metric is diagonal here (no cross
