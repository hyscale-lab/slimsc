Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read it again and see what clues I can gather.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 3 degrees above room temperature (since 273 K is 0°C). Oh wait, 277 K is roughly 4°C. But wait, melting points around that area would be substances like water (0°C), but maybe something else. Hmm.

Substance X uses a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Oh, right, like maybe something that has common isotopes. For example, chlorine has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37. Or maybe something else like oxygen or hydrogen? Wait, but X is being used in organic chemistry as a reagent. Hmm, I'm trying to think of common reagents. Maybe something like KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7? Or perhaps something else.

Wait, the product of X with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Keto acid—like maybe a ketone or a carboxylic acid? Wait, a keto acid is a carboxylic acid with a ketone group, but perhaps more simply, when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has two O atoms. Maybe it's adding oxygen? Or maybe it's oxidizing the acid.

The reaction of X with Y produces gas W, whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule of W is something where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. For example, H2O has 8 protons (O) and 10 neutrons (since O is usually O-16, so 8 protons, 8 neutrons). Wait, 8+8=16. But H2O has H (1 proton, 0 neutrons each), so O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, but the molecule as a whole? Wait, the question says gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, let's think of molecules. For example, CO2: C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (for C-12), O has 8 each. So CO2 has 6+2*8=22 protons
