Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and finding their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics because the relativistic effects come into play.

So the problem states that the first astronaut has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the second has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but wait, when they're moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't just the difference, right? Because in relativity, velocities don't add linearly.

I think the formula for relative velocity in relativity is different. Oh right, the formula for the relative velocity u' when two objects are moving at velocities u and v relative to a common frame is given by (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Or wait, is it (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²) depending on the direction? Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed should be the difference of their speeds divided by that factor.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. If the first astronaut is moving at u = 0.6c, and the second at v = 0.5c, and we want the relative speed of the second from the first's frame. So in the first's frame, the second is moving at (v - u)/(1 - v u /c²). Because the second is slower, so the relative speed should be u' = (v - u) divided by that denominator. Wait, no, wait. No, when you're in the first astronaut's frame, the second astronaut's velocity would be (u' - v) / (1 - u' v /c²) = u''. Wait, maybe I should use the velocity addition formula correctly.

Wait, the formula for the relative speed when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Oh wait, but I might be getting the order wrong. Let me double-check. Suppose in the lab frame, object A moves at u and object B at v, both in same direction. Then, from A's frame, B's speed is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Because in the lab frame, B is moving slower than A, so from A's perspective, B is approaching at a lower speed.

So in this case
