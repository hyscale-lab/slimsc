Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay. The setup is a bit detailed, so I need to break it down.

So, Ay is given by c multiplied by matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar, like the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the S matrix here might be similar to the Pauli sigma y matrix. But let me get that straight.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are usually σx, σy, σz. The σy matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], right? So S is exactly σy. So Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices are usually proportional to the Pauli matrices. The spin operator S for spin-1/2 particles is (ħ/2)σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So for the y-component, Sy = (ħ/2)σy. But in this problem, the constant c is h/(4π). Hmm, since ħ is h/(2π), substituting that in, Sy would be (h/(4π))σy. Oh wait, that's exactly what Ay is. So Ay is the y-component of the spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle, like an electron or muon.

So, the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) times σy, which is the same as the spin angular momentum operator in the y-direction. So, the eigenvalues of Sy (and hence Ay) should be ± ħ/2. But wait, let's compute that.

Wait, let me think. The eigenvalues of σy are ±1 because σy is a Pauli matrix. So when we multiply by c, the eigenvalues become c times ±1. So c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait again. Wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±1. So if you have a matrix like a * σy, its eigenvalues are a * 1 and a * (-1). So in this case, a is h/(4π), so eigenvalues are h/(4π
