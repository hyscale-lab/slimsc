Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Let me take it step by step.

The setup is a spherical conductor with radius R, and there's a small cavity inside. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The cavity's radius is r, and r is less than R. So the conductor is uncharged initially, but someone places a small positive charge +q somewhere inside the cavity.

The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. The point P is a distance L from the conductor's center. But wait, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s (the distance between the two centers).

Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out the electric field at point P. Let me recall what I know about conductors and charges in cavities.

When a conductor is neutral, and you place a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's interior and the charges redistribute. I remember that the charges inside the conductor will redistribute such that the electric field inside the conductor (the material part) is zero. Also, the cavity's inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to the placed charge. So if +q is inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have -q. But wait, the conductor is initially neutral, so the outer surface must have +q to balance.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The conductor is uncharged. When you put a charge +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must then have +q. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, so inner surface is -q and outer surface is +q. Wait, no, wait. The conductor's net charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q to make the total zero (-q + +q = 0). Wait, no, I think that's not right. Because the conductor's net charge is zero, the outer surface must have a charge that makes the total zero. Let me clarify:

The conductor is neutral. When you place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (inside the cavity) must have -q to cancel the field in the conductor's material. So the conductor's total charge is the sum of
