Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says X is a meson resonance. They give me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. They're asking for the mean decay distance. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different values in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. So decay distance d is speed v multiplied by the lifetime τ. And τ is the mean lifetime, which is related to the width Γ by τ = ħ / Γ. Oh right, but I have to make sure about the units there.

So the formula for decay distance is d = v * τ. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to find the velocity v of the meson. Since it's a resonance, I guess it's moving relativistically. To find v, I can use the energy and mass relation. The energy E of a relativistic particle is given by E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The momentum p is sqrt(γ² m² c^4 - m² c^4) / c, but maybe there's a simpler way.

Wait, another approach. The velocity v can be found using v = c * sqrt(1 - (m c² / E)^2). Wait, but E is given in GeV and m in GeV/c², so maybe I can compute the ratio. Let me compute the term (m_X c² / E_X)^2.

Wait, but E_X is the energy, so m_X c² is the rest mass energy. So E_X is 8 GeV, and m_X c² is 1.2 GeV. So the ratio (m/E) is (1.2)/(8) = 0.15. So (m/E) squared is 0.0225. Then 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So v is c * 0.9887, which is about 0.9887c.

Wait, but wait. How precise do I need to be here? Because using an approximate value for sqrt(0.9775) might affect the final answer. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute it more accurately. Let me think: sqrt(0.9775) is since 0.9887 squared is about 0.9775. So yeah, v ≈ 0.9887c.

But perhaps I should use exact calculations. Let me compute it precisely. Let me compute 1 - (1.2/8)^2. 1.2 divided by 8 is 0.15. Squared is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. Square root of 0.9775: Let's see, 0.9887² is 0.9775. So v = c * 0.9887.

So v ≈ 0.9887c.

Next, the lifetime τ. Since Γ is the decay width, the mean lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV. I need to convert everything into consistent units.

Let me remember the constants:

ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because ħc is about 197.33 MeV·fm, but maybe I'm mixing up some things. Wait, let me be precise.

So ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Γ is given in MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582
