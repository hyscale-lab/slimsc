Okay, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry, right? I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. The options are triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, a benzo-trifuran compound, and another triphenylene-trifuran compound. Hmm.

Wait, what's C3h symmetry again? I remember that C3h is a type of symmetry in molecules. Let me recall. Oh right, C3h means the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a mirror plane (σh) that includes the axis. So the molecule looks the same after a 120-degree rotation and also has a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, sometimes it's thought of as having a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to the main three-fold axis.

I think to identify which molecule has this symmetry, I should visualize each structure and see if they fit.

Let me start with option C, triisopropyl borate. The structure of triisopropyl borate is like a central boron atom attached to three isopropyl groups. So the molecule is symmetric—each isopropyl is the same. The central boron is the point where all three are attached. So the molecule should have a trigonal planar geometry around boron, which would give it a three-fold rotational symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane?

Wait, when you have a trigonal planar structure, like BF3, it has a C
