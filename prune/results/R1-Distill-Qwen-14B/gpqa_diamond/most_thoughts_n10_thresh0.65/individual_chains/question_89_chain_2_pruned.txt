Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, kind of a cage-like structure with multiple bridgehead carbons. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two of those bridgehead positions.

First reaction: Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. I think this is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. Since KOH is a strong base, it's likely an E2 mechanism. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromoadamantane) react with a strong base, they can eliminate twice to form an alkyne. Wait, but wait—adamantane is a bridged structure, so maybe the elimination leads to a different structure.

Wait, no. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on adjacent bridgehead carbons, right? So when KOH is added, each Br would leave, and the adjacent C-C bonds would form double bonds. But wait, in a bridged structure, maybe the elimination leads to a bridge becoming a triple bond?

Alternatively, wait, perhaps it's a double elimination. The first elimination would form a double bond, but since the structure is rigid, maybe another elimination occurs. So for example, each adjacent Br would eliminate, leading to a triple bond. Because when you eliminate two HX molecules (like two Br with base), you get an alkyne. So the product after KOH would be an adamantane with a triple bond between the bridgehead carbons. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantane-diyne? Or maybe a single triple bond?

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. I remember that alkynes can be yellow, especially terminal ones, but in this case, the alkyne is within a rigid structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone or something else. Wait, the NMR data is given. Let's look at that.

The 1H NMR of product 1: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, IR has a strong absorbance at 1720 cm-1. Wait, 1720 is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. But wait, if product 1 is from an elimination reaction of a dihalide with KOH, that's usually an E2 elimination leading to an alkene or alkyne.

Wait, maybe I got the reaction wrong. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH. Another possibility is that each Br is replaced by an OH group. But that would require more than just elimination; perhaps a substitution? But KOH is a base and a nucleophile. Wait, but in a bridged structure, substitution might not be feasible because the bridgehead is usually not very reactive towards SN2. So more likely elimination.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product isn't an alkyne but something else. Wait, if
