Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure out which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, C3h symmetry is a point group in molecular symmetry. Let me think about what that means.

Wait, C3h symmetry implies that the molecule has a threefold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that contains the axis. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation around that axis and also mirror symmetric across a plane that includes the axis. Or wait, maybe the mirror plane is perpendicular? No, C3h is the group that has the principal axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (so perpendicular to the principal axis). So the molecule's symmetry elements include a C3 axis and a σh plane.

Now the options are triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, two more complex molecules. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a mouthful. Triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached. The rest is a trifuran system with several substituents. I'm not entirely sure about the structure, but maybe I can think of it as a central structure with three substituents arranged symmetrically. If the substituents are in a trigonal planar arrangement, that might give C3 symmetry, but the presence of the mirror plane would be key.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. This has benzo substituents in a similar arrangement. Maybe the structure is more like a central trifuran with three benzene rings attached. Wait, the benzo substituents are in positions that might form a symmetric arrangement. If the three substituents are at 120-degree angles from each other, that's C3. But does it have a mirror plane? Hmm.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. The structure of triisopropyl borate is B(O(CH(CH3)2))3. Each isopropyl group is the same. The boron is at the center with three identical substituents. So the molecule would have a trigonal planar structure. So the molecule would have a C3 axis. But what about the mirror plane. Since it's symmetrical in the plane of the boron, perhaps a horizontal mirror plane would be present. So C3h symmetry. But wait, I'm not entirely certain. Because in some cases, molecules with trigonal symmetry might not have a mirror plane. Let me think again: the structure is trigonal, so each arm is the same. If all three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically, then a mirror plane that includes the C3 axis and bisects two of the substituents would exist. So yes, that would make sense. So triisopropyl borate could have C3h symmetry.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, a norbornane derivative. Its structure is a bridge bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. The molecule has a three-membered bridge, which gives it a certain symmetry. Wait, quinuclidine has a C3 axis? Let me visualize it. The molecule has a bridge structure where three substituents (like the bridgehead) are arranged in a trigonal fashion. But does it have a mirror plane? I'm not sure. Wait, quinuclidine's structure is symmetric with a C3 axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Alternatively, maybe it has a C3i (inversion) symmetry. Hmm.

Wait, let's get back. The question is about C3h symmetry, which includes a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So for each molecule, I need to determine if they have both.

Triisopropyl borate (Option C): The structure is B with three identical isopropyl groups. So the molecule is trigonal planar around boron. So that's C3 symmetry. Now, does it have a mirror plane? The symmetry would require a plane that contains the C3 axis. So in this case, any plane that includes the boron and two substituents would serve as a mirror plane. Hence, it should have C3h symmetry. So option C is a candidate.

Quinuclidine (Option D): Let me think about its structure. It's a bicyclic compound with a bridge. The molecule is actually symmetric. It has a threefold rotation axis through the bridgehead. But does it have a mirror plane? I'm trying to picture it. Quinuclidine has a structure where each of the three bridgeheads is equivalent. So if you rotate 120 degrees, the molecule looks the same. Now, does it have a mirror plane? Well, maybe not. Because the molecule is chiral? Wait, no. Quinuclidine is not chiral; it's actually a meso compound. Wait, no, quinuclidine is not a meso compound. Wait, is it chiral? Let me think. Quinuclidine has a bridge structure, and the substituents are arranged such that there's no plane of symmetry. Wait, no, actually, the structure does have a plane of symmetry. Because the molecule is planar across the bridge. So for example, there's a mirror plane that bisects the bridge and includes the three substituents. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the mirror plane is along the C3 axis. Wait, maybe quinuclidine has C3 symmetry without a mirror plane. Or perhaps the mirror plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis, making the symmetry C3h.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the point groups. C3h has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So a molecule with C3h symmetry would have a C3 axis, and when you look along that axis, you can find a mirror plane that is horizontal (perpendicular to the axis). So in such a molecule, each substituent will have a mirror image across that plane.

Triisopropyl borate definitely has three identical substituents in a trigonal planar arrangement. So the molecule has a C3 axis and a mirror plane that includes the axis and two substituents. That would make it C3h. So option C is a possibility.

Now, looking at the other options:

Option A: The name is a bit complicated. Triphenyleno... suggests three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran. The substituents are in positions 1,2-c; 5,6-c'; 9,10-c''. Wait, the way the substituents are attached might form a symmetric arrangement. So if the three phenyl groups are equally spaced (120 degrees apart) around the central structure, then it would have C3 symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane? Maybe. Let me imagine three phenyl groups arranged symmetrically in a trigonal fashion. So if the central structure is a furan or something with three substituents at 120 degrees, and each substituent is a phenyl, then that arrangement would have a C3 axis. Now, whether it has a mirror plane. If the substituents are arranged such that a plane can be drawn through the central structure and two substituents, then that would be a mirror plane. So if each phenyl is in a position that mirrors across this plane, then the molecule has C3h symmetry.

Similarly, option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Again, the substituents are benzene rings attached to the trifuran. The positions 1,2; 3,4; and 5,6 could be spaced 120 degrees apart. So that would give C3 symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane? If the substituents are placed symmetrically, then yes. So both options A and B might have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but the question is which of them has C3h symmetry. So perhaps only one of them does.

Alternatively, maybe only triphenyleno (option A) has the mirror plane. Let me think about the structures.

Wait, let me think about the actual structures. Triphenyleno would have three phenyl groups attached in a way that's symmetric. So each phenyl is in a position that mirrors across the C3 axis. Similarly, benzo would have three substituents, but perhaps in a different arrangement.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck between options A, B, and C. Let me think again about each.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Structure is trigonal planar around B with three isopropyl groups. So yes, C3 axis. Now, mirror plane? Yes, because any plane bisecting two substituents would be a mirror plane. So that makes it C3h.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Its structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. It has a three-membered bridge. The molecule has a C3 axis through the bridgehead. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Let's see. If you imagine the molecule, the bridge is connecting three positions. So, it's a rigid structure. I think quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry. Let me visualize: if you slice it through the bridge, perhaps. So yes, it would have a mirror plane. So perhaps quinuclidine has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Another way to think about this: the point group of quinuclidine. I recall that quinuclidine has a point group of C3, not C3h. Because the molecule is not planar in the sense that a mirror plane exists. Wait, no, quinuclidine is not flat. Wait, quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure. Wait, maybe it's in a different point group. Alternatively, perhaps it has a C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a mirror plane because the bridge structure doesn't allow for symmetry across a plane. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate is the one with C3h symmetry. Because it definitely has the C3 axis and a mirror plane.

Wait, another approach: what's the difference between C3 and C3h? If a molecule has C3 symmetry, it doesn't necessarily have a mirror plane. So to have C3h, it must have both a C3 axis and a mirror plane.

So for triisopropyl borate: C3 axis and a mirror plane. So yes, C3h.

Quinuclidine: does it have a mirror plane in addition to a C3 axis? Let me think. The structure has a bridge. If there's a plane that cuts through the bridge and some substituents, perhaps. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate.

But wait, looking back, the options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, if the question is which has C3h symmetry, the options are:

A) triphenyleno... : could have C3h.

B) benzo... : could have C3h.

C) triisopropyl : yes.

D) quinuclidine: perhaps.

But I need to think about each structure more carefully.

Wait, the structure of triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The substituents are at positions 1,2-c; 5,6-c'; and 9,10-c''. So perhaps the substituents are in a way that they are 120 degrees apart, but maybe they're all in the same plane, leading to a C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, the benzo substituents in option B are arranged in a way that creates a trigonal structure. So the molecule could have C3h symmetry as well.

But which is more likely?

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about what C3h symmetry implies. It's a combination of a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So in such a molecule, you should be able to rotate it 120 degrees (twice, for 240 total) and the molecule looks the same. Also, there's a mirror plane that reflects the molecule onto itself.

So, triisopropyl borate definitely has a threefold axis and a mirror plane; thus, it's C3h.

Quinuclidine: I'm not certain, but I think it doesn't have a mirror plane. Because the structure is a bridge, which might not allow for a continuous mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral, but I don't think so. Wait, quinuclidine is actually a meso compound or not? Wait, no, quinuclidine is not a meso compound. It's a chiral molecule. Wait, wait, this is getting more complicated. If quinuclidine is chiral, then it cannot have a mirror plane, because a mirror plane would make the molecule achiral (meso). So if quinuclidine is chiral, then it doesn't have a mirror plane, so it can't be C3h. So in that case, option D would not have C3h.

Wait, but wait. I thought quinuclidine is a meso compound. Let me think again. The molecule has a plane of symmetry. No, I think it's not. Because when I look at the structure, the mirror plane would have to pass through the bridge. But the substituents on either side of the bridge would be different. Wait, the bridge in quinuclidine is symmetric. So the molecule does have a plane of symmetry cutting through the bridge. So it's a meso compound. So it would not be chiral. Wait, but I've heard that quinuclidine is not a meso compound. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me think: the bicyclo structure of quinuclidine has three bridgeheads. Each bridge is two carbons. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the bridge. So the substituents on either side of the bridge are mirror images. So the molecule is achiral, which means it's a meso compound. So in that case, it would have a mirror plane, making it C3h.

But wait, that would mean quinuclidine has C3h symmetry. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the options are:

A) Triphenyleno... 

B) Benzo... 

C) Triisopropyl borate

D) Quinuclidine

So, the options given as possible are four molecules. The question is, which has C3h symmetry.

My initial thought is that triisopropyl borate (option C) has C3h symmetry. Because it's a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents, so it has a C3 axis and a mirror plane, making it C3h.

Alternatively, the other options might have higher symmetry or not.

Wait, another approach: Look for molecules that have a trigonal structure with a mirror plane.

Triisopropyl borate: yes.

Quinuclidine: not sure.

Wait, I think I should go with triisopropyl borate as the correct answer.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options. **C₃h** symmetry implies the presence of a threefold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) that contains the axis. This means the molecule must look identical after a 120° rotation and must also be symmetric across the mirror plane.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Triisopropyl Borate (Option C)**  
   The structure of triisopropyl borate is **B(O(CH(CH₃)₂))₃**, where boron is at the center with three identical isopropyl groups arranged in a trigonal planar geometry. This arrangement gives the molecule a **C₃** axis. Additionally, there is a horizontal mirror plane that bisects the boron atom and two substituents, making the molecule symmetric. Therefore, triisopropyl borate has **C₃h** symmetry.

2. **Quinuclidine (Option D)**  
   Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure with a **C₃** axis through the bridgehead. However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane due to the asymmetry introduced by the bridge structure. While it has **C₃** symmetry, it does not satisfy the **C₃h** requirement because a mirror plane is absent.

3. **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (Option B)**  
   This molecule has a central trifuran system with three benzo substituents. The substituents are arranged symmetrically, giving the molecule **C₃** symmetry. However, the arrangement does not include a horizontal mirror plane, so it does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

4. **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (Option A)**  
   This molecule has a central trifuran system with three phenyl groups arranged symmetrically. While the trigonal arrangement gives **C₃** symmetry, the lack of a horizontal mirror plane means it does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
Among the given options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that satisfies the **C₃h** symmetry requirement, as it has both a **C₃** axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

**Answer: C**
