Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm.

Alright, let's start by understanding the problem. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it by adding 20.00 cm³ of water. So the first thing I should do is find the new concentration after dilution. 

Wait, dilution formula, I think it's M1V1 = M2V2. Yeah, so M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. After adding 20 cm³ water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So M2 = (M1 * V1)/V2. Let's calculate that. 0.05 * 20 /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, we're titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point. So I need to calculate both.

First, equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid. Let's find moles of acetic acid initially. Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L (40 cm³) is 0.001 moles. So to reach equivalence, we need 0.001 moles of NaOH. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. Wait, but wait, the problem is asking about the pH at 25% titration and equivalence. So let me make sure.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution will be sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution will be basic. The pH will be determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

So for the equivalence point calculation:

The acetate concentration comes from the sodium acetate. The moles of acetate are 0.001, and the total volume is the initial solution plus the NaOH added. Wait, initial solution is 40 cm³ (20+20), and at equivalence, we added 10 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 50 cm³. So concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, the acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw/Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of OH- can be found using the Kb expression. Let me set up the equation. Let x be the [OH-] produced.

Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² /0.02, since Kb is very small. So x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10)(0.02) ≈ 1.081e-11. So x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. 

So [OH-] is about 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02. Wait, but looking at the options, the equivalence points are 7, 8.52, 6.73, 6.92. Hmm, none of these match 9. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait a second. Oh wait, wait, maybe I messed up the setup. Let me double-check the equivalence point.

Wait, no, the acetate comes from the neutralization. So the initial moles are 0.001, and the volume is 50 cm³ (40 + 10). So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That part is correct.

Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e
