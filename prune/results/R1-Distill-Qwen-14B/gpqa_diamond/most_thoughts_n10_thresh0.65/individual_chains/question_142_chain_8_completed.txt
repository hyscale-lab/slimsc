Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Okay, the question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position. I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I think that's a diagonal matrix. Let me write it out in matrix form to make it clearer. The standard basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are represented as [1, 0]^T and [0, 1]^T respectively.

So, |0⟩⟨0| would be a matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in (2,2). Adding them gives [[1, 0], [0, 1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, multiplying by 1/2, the density matrix ρ becomes [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. 

Now, I'm trying to recall how the density matrix relates to the Bloch sphere. Oh right, any single-qubit state can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. The density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, which corresponds to a vector on the surface of the Bloch sphere. But if the state is mixed, like a completely mixed state, it's represented by a vector at the origin.

Wait, what's a completely mixed state? Oh, right! The maximally mixed state is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, which is exactly what ρ is. So, this state doesn't have a pure state vector; instead, it's a statistical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ with equal probabilities.

In the Bloch sphere representation, the state is a vector r = (x, y, z), where the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, with σ being the Pauli matrices. Let's see: if I expand ρ, which is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]], that's equal to (I + 0·σ)/2. Because if r is (0,0,0), then r·σ is zero. So, I think that means the vector r is at the origin.

Looking back at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which must be the correct choice because the density matrix represents a completely mixed state, which lies at the origin of the Bloch sphere.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this becomes:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit, which corresponds to equal probabilities of the qubit being in the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit is represented as a vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\), where the density matrix can be written as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}),
\]

with \(I\) being the identity matrix and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) the Pauli matrices. For the given \(\rho\), the term \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\) is zero because there are no off-diagonal terms or components along the Pauli matrices. This implies that the vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is at the origin, \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.
