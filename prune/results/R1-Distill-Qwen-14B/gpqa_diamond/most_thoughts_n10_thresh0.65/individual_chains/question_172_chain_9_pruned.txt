Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar atmospheres, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. The energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. We need to find the correct equation relating their temperatures, T1 and T2, assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Wait, right, in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of populations in two energy states. The formula is something like n_upper/n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2. Wait, but is it twice the number in the specific energy level, or twice the excitation? I think it's the ratio of excited atoms in a specific level. So for each star, the number of atoms in an excited state compared to the ground state.

Wait, no, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the excitation is the population in a specific energy level. So for that level, n1 is twice n2. Or wait, the excitation is the ratio between the upper and lower levels. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the ratio of the excited state to the ground state.

Wait, let me get this straight. Let's say for each star, the population in the excited state (n_upper) is compared to star_2's. So n1_upper / n2_upper = 2? Or is it the ratio of n1_upper to n2_lower or something else? Or maybe it's the ratio of the excitation potential in each star. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps it's the ratio of the populations in the same energy level between the two stars.

Wait, no, the problem says that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given. So for both stars, the same energy levels are being compared. So maybe the number of excited atoms in that level is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2.

So the ratio would be (n1_upper) / (n
