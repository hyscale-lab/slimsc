Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy and reaction mechanisms. Let me take it step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI (Hydroiodic) acid reaction, which is a type of acid-catalyzed cleavage. This usually happens with alkenes. The reaction mechanism involves the addition of HI across the double bond, followed by the cleavage of the P-O bond, leading to the formation of alcohols or possibly other products depending on the structure.

But wait, wait. Wait a second. No, when you have red phosphorus and HI, it's the hydroxylation of alkenes, right? Or maybe it's the Hunsdiecker reaction? No, the Hunsdiecker reaction is with halides and metals, maybe. Oh right! The reaction of alkenes with red phosphorus and HI is called the oxymercuration? Or wait, no, that's mercury. Oh, right, the hydroboration reaction uses different reagents. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, I think the reaction of an alkene with red phosphorus and HI is actually the formation of a diiodide, but more accurately, I think it's the acid-catalyzed hydration. Oh wait, no, maybe it's the cleavage. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus and HI are used to cleave alkenes in a process that's sometimes called the oxymercuration, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively
