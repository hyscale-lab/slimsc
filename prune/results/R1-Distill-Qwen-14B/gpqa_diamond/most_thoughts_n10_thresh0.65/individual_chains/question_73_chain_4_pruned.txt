Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Hmm. The question is about finding two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed? So I guess I need to find how fast one astronaut is moving relative to the other. But wait, since they're both moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds, right? Because in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. Oh right, I remember something about the velocity addition formula in special relativity.

So the formula for adding velocities is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is when you have an object moving at speed u in a frame that's moving at speed v relative to another frame. So the speed of the object in the second frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). But wait, in this case, we have two objects moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction. So let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed?

No, wait, no. Wait, sorry, the question is about the relative speed between the two astronauts. So I think I should calculate the velocity of one as seen from the other's frame.

So let's pick one frame. Let's say the frame of astronaut A, who is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab frame. The other astronaut, B, is moving at 0.5c in the same direction as A. So in the lab frame, A is moving at 0.6c, B at 0.5c. But from A's frame, what's the speed of B?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if both are moving in the same direction, B is moving slower than A. So from A's perspective, B is moving backwards? Or slower. Let me think.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. Let me imagine the lab frame. Both astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction. So in the lab frame, A's speed is 0.6c, B's
