Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio problem. Hmm, let me think. The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, and the pp chain is a significant one, especially in regions with higher temperatures.

Wait, the pp-III branch stopping—what does that mean? I think the pp chain produces a lot of high-energy neutrinos. Oh right, the proton-proton chain has several branches, and pp-III is one of the main branches. If it stops, neutrino production from that branch would suddenly cease.

So, neutrinos are produced in the Sun via the pp chain. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing a lot of neutrinos, particularly in certain energy ranges. The question is asking about the ratio of flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to find flux_band1 / flux_band2.

Before the pp-III stopped, all neutrinos were being produced. But now, since it's stopped, the flux from that process is gone. But wait, the problem says all other reactions remained as they were. So other neutrino-producing processes continue.

I remember that the pp chain produces neutrinos in a specific energy range. Let me recall the neutrino energies from different processes. The dominant neutrino production in the Sun comes from the pp chain, specifically the reaction where a boron-8 nucleus decays into carbon-14 plus a positron and a neutrino. Those neutrinos have energies around 1 MeV, I think. So the main neutrino line is around 150 keV—wait, no, wait. No, wait, B-8 has a decay energy of about 15.5 MeV, but the neutrino takes only a small fraction of that, about 1 MeV, right? So the main neutrino line is around 0.3-0.6 MeV (300-600 keV). But wait, the question is about higher energies, around 700-900 keV. So maybe that's from a different branch or another process.

Wait, the pp-III branch—I think that pp-III refers to the branch where a helium-4 nucleus captures a proton to form lithium-5, which then decays into helium-3 and a positron, plus a
