Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two astronauts. Their masses are given as 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each with different values for both speed and energy.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them normally like in classical mechanics. Oh yeah, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. And for energy, I think each object has relativistic kinetic energy, so I should calculate each one and add them up.

Wait, let's break it down.

First, the relative speed. Both astronauts are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed isn't just 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c, because that's the classical approach and we're dealing with relativity here. I remember the formula for relative velocity in relativity is a bit more complicated.

The formula for the relative velocity u' (between two objects moving at u and v) is [ (u - v) ] / [1 - (u*v)/(c²)]. Wait, but wait, I think I have it reversed. Let me think. Oh right, if one observer sees object A moving at u and object B at v (both in same direction), then the speed of B relative to A is [v - u] / [1 - (u v)/c²] ?

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The standard formula is that if frame S' is moving at speed u relative to frame S, then velocities in S' are given by (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/c²). So in this case, if I want the velocity of the second astronaut (moving at 0.5c) as seen from the first (moving at 0.6c), it would be (0.5c - 0.6c) / [1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c² ].

Wait, that would be (-0.1c) / [1 - (0.3c²)/c²] = (-0.1c)/(1-0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7)
