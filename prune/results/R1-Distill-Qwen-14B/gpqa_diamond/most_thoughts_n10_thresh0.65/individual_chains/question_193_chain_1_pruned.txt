Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax is plx, right? So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. 

I remember that parallax (pl) is related to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. That means if distance increases, parallax decreases. 

But in this problem, N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, substituting that in gives N ∝ (d)^5. Wait, because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. 

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, so I think they're asking about the number density in terms of distance. Because as you go further, the number of stars might increase or decrease. 

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars per unit volume might depend on distance. But in this case, the question is about how the number of stars in a region changes with distance. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of stars within a certain range of distance.

Hmm. Let me clarify. The number of stars with a given parallax is varying as 1/plx^5. But if we're looking at
