Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator A_y is given as a matrix, and I need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The problem gives me the form of A_y and a matrix S to work with.

Wait, let me read the setup again. The operator A_y is c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h/4π, which is Planck's constant divided by 4π. I remember that the angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are often proportional to the Pauli matrices or similar structures.

The matrix S is given as: first row (0, -i), second row (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i,  0]]

Wait, that's familiar. Isn't that the structure of the Pauli Y matrix, σ_y? Because the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Let me check. Oh yeah, σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is σ_y.

So A_y = c * σ_y. Since c is h/(4π), that would make A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Now I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. To find eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0.

Wait, but since A_y is proportional to σ_y, maybe I can
