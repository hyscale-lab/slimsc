Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution, and we need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. Hmm, stability constants are given, so I remember that they have something to do with the formation of complexes.

Alright, let me start by recalling what I know. Cobalt can form various complexes with thiocyanate ions (SCN-). The stability constants (β) tell us how stable these complexes are. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So for each complex, the β represents the equilibrium constant for its formation.

The problem gives four stability constants: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, I think these correspond to different complexes. So, Co(SCN)_n^2+ for n=1 to 4? So, β1 is for the monosubstituted complex, β2 for disubstituted, and so on up to β4, which is maybe the tetrasubstituted?

Wait, no, actually, βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. Like, for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^2+, the βn is the equilibrium constant. So, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^2+ (n=1), β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (n=2), etc.

But wait, the question is about
