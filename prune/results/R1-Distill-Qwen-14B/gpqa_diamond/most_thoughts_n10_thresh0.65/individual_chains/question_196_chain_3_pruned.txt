Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a mass attached to a spring, right? The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. But wait, this is relativistic, so I probably can't use the simple formulas from classical mechanics anymore.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A, B, C, D. My task is to figure out which one is correct.

Alright, let me think. In the classical case, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy of a spring is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so I can't just use that formula. Relativistic effects must come into play here.

In relativity, the kinetic energy is different. The total energy E is gamma times mc², and the rest energy is mc². So the kinetic energy might be (gamma - 1)mc². But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, energy is conserved. The total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. Oh wait, but in the relativistic case, the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kx² anymore, I think. Or maybe it is? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem states that the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So perhaps the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy has a relativistic form. So the total energy E would be the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy plus the potential energy. At maximum displacement (x = A), the potential energy is maximum, and kinetic is zero. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the kinetic energy is maximum, but wait, that's when the speed is maximum. So at x=0, all the energy is kinetic.

So when x=0, the energy E is the kinetic energy in relativity terms. So E = K + U, but at x=0, U is zero, so E = K. And when x=A, K is zero, so E is U = (1/2)kA².

Wait, but wait. In the relativistic
