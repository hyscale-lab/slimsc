Okay, so I need to figure out how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Both planets are around stars similar to our Sun, and both have masses similar to Neptune. The method used is the Radial Velocity (RV) method, which detects shifts in the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull.

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift. The star moves towards and away from us because of the planet's orbit. The amplitude of this shift relates to the mass of the planet and the characteristics of the orbit.

The formula I think I need is the one that relates the velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period (P). I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I think it involves Kepler's third law somehow.

Kepler's third law in the context of exoplanets is often written as P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³, where a is the semi-major axis. But since the planet masses are much smaller than the star (Neptune is way less massive than the Sun), the star's mass dominates, so M+m ≈ M. So M is the mass of the star, which is same for both planets since the stars have the same mass as the Sun.

The RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. The formula for K is something like K = (v) = (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ), but I might be mixing some terms here.

Wait, alternatively, I think the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G * P) / (2π c²) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / (M_star)^(2/3) )

But perhaps a simpler approach is to relate the semi-amplitude K to the orbital period and the mass of the planet. Since both planets are around the same type of star, their masses are similar, and the shifts are given, maybe we can relate the velocities.

Wait, the problem states that the stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses to Neptune. So M_p1 ≈ M_p2, and M_star1 = M_star2 = M_sun.

The RV method measures the velocity of the star, which is inversely proportional to the planet's orbital period. Because a longer period means the star moves more slowly in its orbit (since the same gravitational force causes a larger orbit radius, but velocity depends on the balance between force and mass and radius).

Wait, the formula for K (the semi-amplitude) is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( 2π / P )^(1/3) * c,

Wait, no, perhaps better to look for the relation between K and the period. Let me think. Another approach: since the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star. So K is the velocity amplitude.

And the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P)^(1/3) * (1/c) )

Wait, no, I'm mixing up the units perhaps.
