Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the question is about the flux of neutrinos from the Sun, specifically comparing two energy bands. Hmm, I remember that the Sun produces neutrinos through various nuclear reactions, and one of the main ones is the proton-proton chain, which has different branches. The question mentions the pp-III branch stopping, so I need to think about what that implies about neutrino production.

Wait, the pp-III branch—I think that's the branch where two protons fuse to form a deuterium nucleus, a positron, and a neutrino. Oh wait, no, that's maybe the pp-I branch? Or is pp-III a different process? I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I think the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain that leads to helium production. Oh right, the proton-proton chain has different branches. The main one (pp-I) produces a helium-4 nucleus through a series of steps, while the pp-II and pp-III branches involve different pathways, possibly producing different neutrino spectra.

The question says that the pp-III branch stops. So if the pp-III branch stops, I need to figure out how that affects the neutrino flux in different energy bands. The flux is the number of neutrinos per cm² per second. So two bands: 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. The ratio is flux band1 over flux band2.

I think that the pp-III branch might produce neutrinos of a certain energy range. If that process stops, the flux in that energy range would drop. But wait, the Sun's core is where these reactions happen, and neutrinos take about 8-9 minutes to reach Earth, so if the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, we wouldn't notice the change yet in the solar neutrino flux. Wait, no, the question says the pp-III branch stopped in the core 8.5 minutes ago, so the neutrinos from that process wouldn't have reached Earth yet. But since the question is about the current flux, which is the neutrinos that were emitted before the pp-III stopped, perhaps the flux hasn't changed yet. Hmm, no, wait, maybe the question is considering the current neutrinos being produced. Oh, but the flux is the number of neutrinos arriving now. Wait, no, because the neutrinos take about 8 minutes to reach Earth. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago
