Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me think about what I remember from my astronomy classes.

The question says, "Assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. How does the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) change with plx?" The options are various inverse powers of plx, from 1 over plx to 1 over plx to the fourth.

Wait, parallax... I remember that parallax angle is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance, meaning distance d = 1/plx. So when plx increases, the distance decreases because the star is closer.

Now, if the stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density of stars in space is constant. Wait, uniform in space, so for a given volume, you have a certain number of stars. But we're looking at how the number of stars per unit parallax interval changes with plx.

Let me think about how stars are distributed in terms of distance. If the number density n is constant, then the number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d+dd would be n * 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a thin spherical shell is 4π d² dd.

But wait, the parallax is plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that into the expression. So the number of stars in a shell at distance d would be proportional to d², which is (1/plx)². But wait, we want the number per unit of plx. Hmm, because plx is 1/d, a change in plx is related to a change in d.

Let me think about the variables. Let’s say we have a small range in parallax, Δplx. What's the corresponding change in distance? Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, but I'm not sure about the minus sign because plx increases as d decreases. But since we're dealing with absolute numbers, maybe it's okay to ignore the sign.

So, the number of stars in a parallax range from plx to plx + dplx would be the same as the number of stars in the corresponding distance range. The number in that distance shell is
