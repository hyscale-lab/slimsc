Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about matrices and their properties, specifically in the context of quantum mechanics. 

The question lists four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. Each row is separated by a semicolon. And there are four options (A-D), each making a statement about these matrices. I need to figure out which statement is correct.

First, let me recall some concepts from quantum mechanics regarding matrices. I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. Also, the evolution operator (or time evolution operator) is unitary. So any matrix that represents an observable must be Hermitian, meaning it equals its conjugate transpose. Similarly, the evolution operator must be unitary, so when you multiply it by its conjugate transpose, you get the identity matrix.

Another thing is that the exponential of a matrix, like e^X, is used in the time evolution operator, especially when dealing with the Schrödinger equation. So, if X is a matrix used in e^X, then X needs to be such that e^X is unitary. Wait, but wait—actually, the time evolution operator is usually of the form e^(-iHt/ħ), where H is Hermitian. So H has to be Hermitian for the exponential to be unitary. Because the exponential of i times a Hermitian matrix is unitary.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes. 
Hmm. For the norm to change, e^X must not be unitary. Because if a matrix is unitary, multiplying a vector by it preserves the norm. So if e^X isn't unitary, then option A is correct. So I need to check whether e^X is unitary.

But wait, to see if e^X is unitary, it's perhaps easier to see if X is anti-Hermitian. Because if X is anti-Hermitian (i.e., X = -X†), then e^X would be unitary. Let me compute X† and see.

X is given as:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i
