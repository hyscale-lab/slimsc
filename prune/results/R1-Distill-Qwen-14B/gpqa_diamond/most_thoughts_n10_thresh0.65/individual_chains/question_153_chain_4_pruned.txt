Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think about each part of the question.

The first part is reaction A: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH. NaOEt is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates something to form an enolate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a diethyl ester of malonic acid. Its structure is CH2(COOEt)2. When a strong base like NaOEt is present, it can deprotonate the alpha position (the CH2) to form an enolate. The enolate has a negative charge on the oxygen and can attack the beta position of another molecule.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt, but with a substituent on the middle carbon. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt? Or maybe it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OEt? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt. Because position 1 is the ester, 2 is the CH2, 3 is the CH with the substituent. Oh wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me think again. The structure of acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the middle carbon. So it would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt? Or is it CH2=CHCO-OEt with a p-tolyl group on the CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it. The acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt, so positions are 1 (the CH
