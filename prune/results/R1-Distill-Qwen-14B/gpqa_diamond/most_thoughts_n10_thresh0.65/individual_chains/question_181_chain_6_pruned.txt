Okay, I need to figure out this neutrino flux ratio problem. Let's take it step by step. 

So, the question is about the Sun's neutrino production. The scenario is that the pp-III branch suddenly stops about 8.5 minutes ago, and I need to find the ratio of the fluxes between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D, with values ranging from 0.01 to 10. 

First, I should remember what the pp-III branch is. The pp chain is the proton-proton chain, right? There are different branches. The main pp-I branch produces helium-4, and I think the pp-II and pp-III are less significant. Wait, or maybe pp-III is a specific part of the chain. Oh, right, the pp-III branch involves reactions that produce beryllium-7, which then goes on to form carbon and eventually helium. 

If the pp-III branch stops, then the reactions that produce neutrinos from that branch would stop. But wait, what kind of neutrinos are we talking about here? Solar neutrinos are mainly from the pp chain and the CNO cycle. The CNO cycle is more significant in higher mass stars, but the Sun is mostly pp. 

Wait, solar neutrinos come from different processes. The dominant ones are the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle. The pp chain produces neutrinos in two main ways: the pep branch (which is part of the pp-I)
