Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, right? So normally, when the medium isn't moving, the speed would be v_light = c/n. Since c is given as 1 here, v_light = 1/n.

But wait, the glass is moving. So how does that affect the speed observed? Oh, right! This is a case where we have to consider the relative motion between the medium and the observer.

I remember something about the Doppler effect and how the speed of light doesn't change in a vacuum regardless of the source's motion, but in a medium, things might be different. Or wait, no, because in vacuum, the speed is always c. But here, the glass is a medium, so the lightâ€™s speed within it is 1/n. But since the glass is moving, the observer would see the light's speed as a combination of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity within the glass.

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of velocity addition. Like, if the medium (glass) is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame, and the light inside the medium has velocity u relative to the medium. Then, in the lab frame, the
