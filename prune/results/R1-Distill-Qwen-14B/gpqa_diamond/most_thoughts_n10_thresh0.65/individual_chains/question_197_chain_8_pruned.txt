Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might make some mistakes, but I'll try to work it out.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of substitution reaction, maybe a Fries rearrangement or something else. Wait, no, Fries rearrangement is with phenols and things like that. Oh wait, red phosphorus and HI is often used in the hydrolysis of esters, or maybe in the formation of alkenes. Alternatively, I think it's used in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's with ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction, like in the case of alky halides using HI as a nucleophile. Oh right, another reaction I remember is the acid-catalyzed cleavage of ethers, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. Let's look at the spectroscopic data provided.

Starting with the IR data:
- 3400–2500 cm-1: This broad range suggests either an O-H stretch (like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol) or an N-H stretch, but since there's no mention of N in the question, probably O-H. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which usually indicates a carbonyl group. So maybe a carbonyl like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid. Since the O-H stretch is in the 3400–2500 range, which is broad, maybe it's a carboxylic acid? But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, and a strong carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. Another possibility is an ester, which has a carbonyl around 1720, but no O-H. Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720, which could be ester or maybe a ketone. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde? But aldehydes have a higher carbonyl stretch, around 1720 as well, but with a strong absorption around 2820 and 2720 for the al
