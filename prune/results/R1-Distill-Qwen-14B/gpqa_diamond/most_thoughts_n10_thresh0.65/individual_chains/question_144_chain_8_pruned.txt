Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? And resonance has to do with their unstable states. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of this meson X.

The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in meters, so I need to calculate the mean decay length.

Wait, I think the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I remember is something like mean decay distance = c * τ * β, where τ is the mean lifetime, c is the speed of light, and β is the velocity in terms of the speed of light.

But to find τ, I think I need to use the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is related to the lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Right, because Γ is the energy width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

Wait, but Γ is given in MeV. I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Let me think about the units.

First, let's get everything in SI units. ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because when I use GeV and seconds, that might be easier since Γ is given in MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Wait, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So, τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s. Let's compute that.

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, wait. Let me calculate that more accurately. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So yeah, 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

But wait, no. Let me check: 6.582
