Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little bit towards and away from us as the planet orbits, right?

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets, and the shifts in their spectral lines are given. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. The formula used in RV is something like velocity equals (2πG)^(1/3) * (M sin i) / ( (M + m)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula. Or perhaps it's better to think about the relation between the Doppler shift and the orbital period.

I think the Doppler shift (or the semi-amplitude of the velocity) is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (1 / (P^(1/3))) ). Or maybe the velocity K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_s^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ). Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think the key is that the velocity semi-amplitude K depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period.

Wait, but wait, if both stars have the same mass (same as Sun), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like, so same M_p), then maybe K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because if the star's mass and planet's mass are the same, then K ∝ (M_p sin i) / (M_s^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )? Wait, maybe the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p sin i)) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (P/(1 year))^(-1/3) )) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2πG) / (c) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3))

But for circular orbits, e=0, so sqrt(1-e²)=1. Also, since M_p << M_s (because Neptune's mass is much less than Sun's), M_s + M_p ≈ M_s. So the formula simplifies a bit.

So K ≈ ( (2πG) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_s^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but maybe I can think of K as being proportional to (M_p) / (M_s^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p and M_s are the same for both planets, then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, that's a key point. So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) because if all else is equal, the larger P (longer period) would give a smaller velocity shift, because the star moves more slowly in its orbit.

So, in this problem, both planets have the same mass, same star mass. So the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So K1 = (some constant) / P1^(1/3), and K2 = same constant / P2^(1/3).

Given that, the ratio K2/K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3). Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

Wait, let's think again. If K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), then K ∝ P^(-1/3). So K2 = (K1) * (P1/P2)^(1/3) ). Wait, no, because K2 = (const)/P2^(1/3), and K1= const / P1^(1/3). So K2/K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3).

So taking the ratio of the velocities: K2 / K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

But in the problem, the shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstroms. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the problem says that the periodic wavelength shift is given. How is wavelength shift related to velocity?

Oh right, the Doppler effect relates the velocity to the wavelength shift. The formula is Δλ/λ0 = v/c, where v is the velocity, λ0 is the rest wavelength, and c is the speed of light. So the velocity is proportional to the wavelength shift divided by the original wavelength. But in this problem, since the same spectral line is used for both stars, the original wavelength λ0 is the same, so the velocity shift (v) is proportional to Δλ.

So if K is the velocity, then K = (Δλ) / λ0 * c. But since λ0 is the same for both measurements, the ratio of K2 to K1 is the same as the ratio of (Δλ2) to (Δλ1).

Wait, no, because K is the velocity, which is (Δλ/λ0) * c. So K is proportional to Δλ, assuming λ0 is same.

So, in this case, K2 = 7 milliangstroms, K1 =5 milliangstroms. So K2/K1 = 7/5.

So substituting into the previous equation:

(K2)/(K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

But (K2/K1) is (7/5), so (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

We can rearrange to find (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3

Wait, wait P1 is the period of planet 1, P2 is period of planet 2.

Because (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3) => (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So, (P1/P2) = (7/5)^3

P1 = (7/5)^3 * P2

We're asked for how many times longer P2 is than P1. So (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, that's approximately 0.36. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1, meaning it's about 0.36 times as long as P1. So P2 is shorter than P1, so the period of planet 2 is shorter. So the question is: How many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times longer, but that would mean P2 is shorter than P1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me retrace.

We have K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So K1 = const / P1^(1/3), K2 = const / P2^(1/3)

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So, 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3: (7/5)^3 = P1/P2

So P1 = (343/125) * P2 → P2 = (125/343) * P1 → P2 ≈ (0.364) * P1.

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the period of planet 2 is 0.36 times the period of planet 1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Since 0.36 is less than 1, it's shorter. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times longer than planet #1. Wait, that can't be, because 0.36 times is shorter.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of P2/P1. Since P2 = (125/343) * P1, then P2/P1 = (125/343) ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.36 times the period of P1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1. So the question asks, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So it's 0.36 times longer, but that would imply it's shorter. Hmm, perhaps the correct way is that the orbital period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. So the answer would be P2 is about 0.36 times P1, so the ratio is 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer is A.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The semi-amplitude of the velocity shift, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, \( P \), for planets with similar masses and around stars of the same mass. Mathematically, \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \).

Given that Planet #1 has a velocity shift of 5 milliangstroms and Planet #2 has a shift of 7 milliangstroms, the ratio of their velocity shifts is \( K_2/K_1 = 7/5 \). Since \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), the ratio of their periods is related by:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( K_2/K_1 = 7/5 \):

\[
\frac{7}{5} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Raising both sides to the power of 3:

\[
\left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}.
\]

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{343}{125}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

This means the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of Planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of Planet #2 is about 0.36 times longer than that of Planet #1.
