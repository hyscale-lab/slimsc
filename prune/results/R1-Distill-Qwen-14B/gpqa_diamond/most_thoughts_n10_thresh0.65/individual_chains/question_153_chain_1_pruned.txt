Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I remember the basics.

So, the question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactions. I need to figure out the products for each and then match them with the options given.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. I think NaOEt is a base, so this probably is a Michael addition scenario.

Wait, what's the Michael addition? Oh right, it's when a nucleophile (like an enolate) attacks an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. So in this case, dimethyl malonate would be the nucleophile. Let me think... dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The other compound is the acceptor, the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached. Wait, no, maybe it's more like CH2-C(O)OCH3 connected to a p-tolyl group. Let me correct that. Actually, the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but the substituent is on the beta carbon. So the acceptor is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

So when the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the beta position of the acceptor, it would add across the double bond. The enolate has a negative charge, so it attacks the more substituted (beta) carbon since that's where the positive charge is in the double bond.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH-. When it forms the enolate, it's a conjugate base: the negative is on the central carbon. So when it adds to the acceptor, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, it would form a new carbon-carbon bond.

So the structure of the product (A) would have the malonate part attached to the acceptor. Let me draw this in my mind. The acceptor is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl (p-methylphenyl) group attached. Wait, no, I think the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2-CH2 with a substituent? Wait, perhaps the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl on the CH2 group. Wait, maybe it's CH2-C(O)OCH2-CH2-p-tolyl? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the correct structure for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on
