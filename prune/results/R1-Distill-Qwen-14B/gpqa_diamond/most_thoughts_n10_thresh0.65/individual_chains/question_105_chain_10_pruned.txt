Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere of this star has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. The setup is that when you observe this star, its brightness changes periodically because it's rotating, and one hemisphere with spots is facing us, then turns away. The question says this situation can resemble an exoplanet transiting in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness. But if the star had no spots, what size exoplanet would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do now?

Hmm. So the goal is to find the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star (Rpl/Rstar) such that its transit causes the same change in brightness as the spots do.

I remember that the change in brightness (the depth of the transit) is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. But wait, in this case, the spots are causing a dip because they're cooler and darker. So when the star rotates and the spots come into view, the observed brightness decreases. Similarly, when the planet transits, the brightness also decreases because part of the star's light is blocked.

Wait, but the problem is comparing the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots (when the star is rotating) with that caused by the planet transit.

So the first thing is to compute what the brightness variation is due to the spots. Then, find the planet radius that would cause the same variation.

Let me think about the star's brightness. The star's total luminosity (L) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But when there are spots, part of the star's surface is cooler. The spots have a filling factor, which is the fraction of the surface they occupy. So the effective temperature of the star from the observer's point of view is a combination of the unspotted and spotted areas.

Wait, but the question isn't about the star's overall luminosity change due to the spots (like when the star rotates and the spots come into view), but about the periodic brightness variation caused by the rotational modulation. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and
