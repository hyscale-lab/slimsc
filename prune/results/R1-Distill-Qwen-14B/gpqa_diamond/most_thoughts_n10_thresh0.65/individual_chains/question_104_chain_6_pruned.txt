Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both have circular orbits. The RV method detected them. 

So, the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet, or the closer it is to the star, right? Because the star moves in response to the planet.

Wait, the question says Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but the stars are the same mass. Oh, but the question is about the orbital periods of the planets. How does the Doppler shift relate to the orbital period?

I remember that the Doppler shift (wavelength shift) is related to the velocity of the star. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * ( (4π²/P²) )^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the relation between the velocity amplitude and the orbital period.

Alternatively, I think the formula for K is:

K = [ (2π G) / (P c) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_* )
