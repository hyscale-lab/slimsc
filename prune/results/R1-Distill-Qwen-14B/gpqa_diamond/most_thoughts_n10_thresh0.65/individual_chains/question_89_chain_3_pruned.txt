Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and spectroscopy. Let's try to tackle it step by step.

The problem is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break it down.

First, the initial reaction: heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. The ¹H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). There's also an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.

Hmm, what's happening here? KOH is a strong base, so maybe an elimination reaction? But wait, with dibromide, it might be a dehydrohalogenation. Oh, wait, Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework.

So when KOH is used in such reactions, especially with vicinal dihalides, it usually leads to elimination, forming an alkene. Since it's heated, probably an E2 mechanism. The IR peak at 1720 is likely a carbonyl group, but wait, elimination should form an alkene, which would have a peak around 1650-1700 cm⁻¹ for C=C. Oh wait, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? Because the NMR has a peak around 4.79 ppm, which is typical for an epoxide's CH₂ groups. Oh, but KOH in such conditions might lead to an elimination, but wait, what else could produce a carbonyl?

Alternatively, think about the product. If the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, that would form an alkene. But the IR at 1720 is more indicative of a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. Hmm. Wait, wait, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but a substitution. But with KOH and a dihalide, more likely elimination, forming an alkene. But IR at 1720 is a strong carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters. Or perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's for amines. Alternatively, wait, KOH can cause elimination to form a ketone if it's a neighboring group effect or some kind of pinacol-like elimination. Wait, no, pinacol is about vicinal diols eliminating to form ketones. Wait, the starting material is a dihalide, so maybe an elimination to form an alkene, but then why the IR peak?

Wait, maybe the product isn't an alkene. Let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. That's a region where epoxide protons show up. Epoxides typically have two sets of protons if they're symmetric. Wait, but in the NMR, it's 4.79 (2H), so maybe one set. So maybe it's a cyclopropane or an epoxide.

Wait, but how would KOH cause epoxidation? Oh wait, perhaps the reaction isn't epoxide formation but something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a base-induced elimination forming a ketone. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a conjugated diene, but the IR doesn't show a peak in that range. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction, but with excess KOH, elimination is more likely.

Wait, let's think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. The 1,3-dibromo would have two bromines on adjacent carbons in the structure.

If KOH is used, perhaps it's a double elimination, forming a double bond? So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane losing two HBr molecules to form a diene? But then, that would give an alkene. Alternatively, maybe a single elimination to form a mono-ene. But the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, so perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone formed via some mechanism. How? Oh, wait, maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement, but starting from a dihalide. Or perhaps it's a base-induced elimination forming a cyclic ketone. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is leading to an oxidation, but I don't think KOH is an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a diketone. Wait, but how?

Wait, another approach: the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm is 2H as a triplet? Or singlet? The data says 4.79(2H), but the coupling pattern isn't given in the
