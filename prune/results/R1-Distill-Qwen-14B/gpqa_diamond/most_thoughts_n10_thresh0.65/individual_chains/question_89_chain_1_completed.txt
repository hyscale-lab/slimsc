Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's start by breaking down what's given and what's being asked. The question involves a series of reactions leading to product 3, and we need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in its 1H NMR spectrum.

First, let's outline the steps:

1. **Reaction 1:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid (product 1).

2. **Reaction 2:** Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.

3. **Reaction 3:** Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethylsulfide to form product 3.

The question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR.

Let's tackle each step one by one.

**Reaction 1: 1,3-Dibromoadamantane + KOH**

I remember that when a dihalide (like dibromide) reacts with a strong base like KOH, it's likely an elimination reaction, specifically dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of an alkene. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the elimination should form an alkene between the two bromines.

Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is quite rigid. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Eliminating two equivalents of HBr would form an allene (cumulative diene), or maybe a single double bond if it's a vicinal dihalide.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br on carbons 1 and 3. The structure of adamantane is a diamondoid, so carbons 1 and 3 are likely not adjacent. Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me think: in adamantane, each carbon is bonded to three others. So, if 1 and 3 are positions that are two apart, then elimination would lead to a double bond between 1 and 2? Or perhaps between 2 and 3?

Wait, no. Let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The adamantane structure is a cage of connected cyclohexane rings. So, each position is connected to three others. So, positions 1 and 3 are probably not adjacent. So, when KOH is used, it's likely a double elimination. But wait, elimination typically requires adjacent leaving groups (vicinal dihalide). So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane might not be a vicinal dihalide, but perhaps a diegeminal? No, because the two Brs are on different carbons.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the positions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a double elimination but some kind of substitution. But KOH is a strong base, so elimination is more likely.

Alternatively, for adamantane derivatives, when you have two bromines on non-adjacent positions, elimination might form a bridge. Wait, maybe it's a case where each Br is on a bridgehead, so when two are present, elimination would form a double bond across the bridge.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantylene. Let me think: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH would lead to the formation of 1,3-adamantadiene? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide elimination, but 1,3 is non-vicinal.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane: if the Br atoms are on adjacent carbons (vicinal), then elimination would form a double bond between those two. But if they are non-adjacent, elimination might not be possible. Hmm, maybe it's not a simple elimination but a ring-opening, but that seems unlikely with KOH.

Wait, another approach: The product after KOH treatment could be an epoxide? No, because KOH isn't an oxidizing agent that would do that. Or perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but the product is a light yellow solid. Wait, maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but I don't think so because KOH is a strong base, but not a metal.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the NMR data provided for product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 has signals at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which suggests a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or ketone.

Wait a minute, 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 might be a ketone or an ester. But how does that fit with the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH?

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. KOH could cause a double substitution if there's a good leaving group. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms. If each Br is replaced by an OH, then product would be 1,3-dihydroxyl adamantane. But the IR doesn't show a broad peak from OH (like around 3300 cm⁻¹), which would be expected for an alcohol. Instead, it's 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more like an ester or ketone.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If each Br is on a bridgehead, elimination might form a bridgehead double bond. Let me think: adamantane has four bridgehead carbons, each connected to three other carbons. So, if Br is on two bridgeheads, perhaps elimination would form a double bond between those bridgeheads.

Wait, but bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed due to Bredt's rule. So that's not possible. So maybe the product is a bicyclic compound with a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a double substitution, but that would be diol. But why the IR has a carbonyl? Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not substitution but elimination followed by some reaction.

Wait, another angle: maybe the reaction is a Hoffman elimination or a similar process. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double E2 elimination, but again, without adjacent Br, that's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after elimination isn't a simple alkene but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing the formation of an epoxide. Wait, but epoxide would require a dihalide to form an epoxide via an SN2 mechanism with the base. Wait, no, epoxide formation typically involves an elimination, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, from the product's IR: the peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl. So product 1 is likely an ester, ketone, or possibly an aldehyde. But the NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 (2H), which might be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be ten hydrogens, perhaps from a diamondoid structure, and the 1.94 (2H) might be another methylene.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is a dialkyl ketone or ester, but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diepoxide, but again, the IR doesn't support that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, but the product is an enol ether or some kind of carbonyl compound. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, but that seems less likely given the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed via an elimination reaction, creating a carbonyl. Wait, when a dihalide is heated with a strong base, it can undergo elimination to form an alkyne or alkene, depending on the conditions. But how would elimination of HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane lead to a carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps it's a neighboring group participation or some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the KOH isn't just a base but also acts as a nucleophile. Wait, but if the product has a carbonyl, perhaps the reaction is an oxidation. But KOH is a strong base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but instead a substitution where each Br is replaced by an O- group, leading to an oxide. But again, the IR doesn't show OH.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. No, because the IR isn't showing the epoxide's C-O-C stretch around 1250 cm⁻¹. The IR given is 1720, which is more like a ketone or ester.

Wait, perhaps the product is a result of two E2 eliminations, leading to a carbonyl group. Wait, but how?

Hold on, another approach: 1,3-dibromoadamantane may undergo two dehydrohalogenation steps, each losing HBr, to form a conjugated diene. But that's unlikely because of the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, leading to a single elimination (forming a double bond) but in a rigid structure.

But the IR suggests a carbonyl, not a double bond. So maybe the product is an epoxide, but I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. How could that happen?

Wait, maybe the two Br atoms are on the same carbon. But no, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, meaning different carbons.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction yields an ester. How?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the dihalide reacts with KOH to form a glycol via substitution. But the IR doesn't show O-H. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-alkoxide, but again, the IR doesn't show O-H.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what product 1's NMR tells us. The 4.79 (2H) is a singlet, likely an OCH₂ group. Because in the NMR, it's 2H as a singlet. So maybe it's an ether or ester.

Then 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests perhaps a diamondoid structure, as adamantane has a lot of CH₂ groups in specific regions. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH₂ group.

Wait, putting this together: the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. The NMR has an OCH₂ group at 4.79 ppm, so maybe it's an ester (COOCH₂...). But wait, the product would then have a carbonyl group. Alternatively, it's a ketone with an adjacent OCH₂.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether with a ketone, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone, but that doesn't fit the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal di-substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about another reaction of dibromides. When a dihalide reacts with KOH, it can form an epoxide if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane may not have adjacent Brs.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of a Hofmann elimination, but that involves amines, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps the starting material undergoes a double elimination, losing two equivalents of HBr, forming a diene. But that would have a different IR. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ketone. For example, if elimination leads to the formation of a bridge with a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction creates a ketone via a rearrangement, such as a Cope or Claisen rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a ring-opening of the adamantane structure, leading to a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the IR and NMR.

IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ → likely a carbonyl. NMR: 4.79 (2H, probably OCH₂), 2.41-2.23 (10H, possibly CH₂ groups in a rigid structure), and 1.94 (2H, perhaps another CH₂).

So, product 1 could be an adamantyl ester. For example, if each Br is replaced by an oxygen-containing group, but that doesn't quite fit.

Wait, another idea: when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, sometimes an elimination can form a carbonyl. For example, in the case of vicinal dihalides, elimination can form an alkene. But when the dihalide is on a bridged structure, elimination might form a carbonyl group. Wait, perhaps that's the case here.

If 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes two dehydrohalogenation steps, each losing HBr, the two adjacent carbons (if they are in a position that allows) might form a carbonyl. Wait, but forming a carbonyl from two E2 eliminations? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone where the two Brs were replaced by an O and a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone. Let me think: if the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and elimination occurs, perhaps forming a carbonyl group. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by an oxygen group, such as an O- which could then form a ketone after protonation. But that seems a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but again, the IR doesn't support this.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a structure of four cyclohexane rings connected in a diamond shape. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two non-adjacent bridgehead carbons.

Wait, if the base causes each Br to leave, and the adjacent carbons form a double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are not common due to Bredt's rule, so perhaps that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a bridge with a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ketone, with the carbonyl in a bridge position.

Wait, I think I'm stuck here. Let me try to proceed and see if the later reactions can give me any clues.

**Reaction 2: Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3).**

Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 has a carbonyl group, maybe it's undergoing an acylation reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires an aromatic ring.

Wait, but product 1 is 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH. If product 1 is an ester, perhaps with OCH2, then reacting with Al isopropoxide might lead to some acylium ion formation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but earlier reasoning suggests the IR doesn't support that.

Wait, another angle: If product 1 is an adamantane derivative with a carbonyl group, like an ester or ketone, then heating it with aluminum isopropoxide could induce some kind of acid-catalyzed rearrangement or possibly a Friedel-Crafts type reaction if there's an aromatic ring. But adamantane is a polycyclic structure without aromaticity.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and reaction with Al isopropoxide could lead to a pinacol rearrangement, but that requires vicinal diols. Alternatively, another type of carbonyl rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility: if product 1 is a cyclic ketone, then reaction with Al isopropoxide might not do much. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester, and Al is acting as a catalyst for some kind of elimination or substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bromide that went through an elimination to form a carbonyl. Then, product 2 could be the result of a conjugate addition or a Grignard-like reaction.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the next step.

**Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide.**

Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. The reaction conditions (low temperature, DMS) suggest that the ozonolysis is followed by reductive work-up, which typically breaks the ozonides into carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyls.

But if product 2 doesn't have a double bond, perhaps it's a cyclic structure with a bridge that can form a double bond upon treatment.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a diene, which upon ozonolysis would form two carbonyl compounds. But the question is about product 3's NMR.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

Wait, maybe product 3 is a diketone or a dialdehyde, but the NMR shows certain coupling.

But the initial question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. Let's think: in product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. The coupling pattern would depend on neighboring hydrogens.

For example, if a CH₂ group is next to a carbonyl, the H's would be deshielded. If they are adjacent to another CH₂, they might couple with two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet, quartet, etc.

Wait, another possibility: The deshielded H could be part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, which is split by neighboring Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, with coupling to adjacent CH₂ groups.

Wait, let me think about the overall structure.

Going back: Product 1 is likely an ester or ketone, given the IR and NMR. Then, reaction with Al isopropoxide leads to product 2. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a bromo compound that becomes an epoxide, but that doesn't fit with the data.

Hmm. Maybe I should think of the overall transformations.

If product 1 is an ester (OCH₂), then reaction with Al isopropoxide could lead to a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But in adamantane, there's no aromatic ring, so that's not applicable. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening of adamantane with ester groups.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone. Then, reaction with Al isopropoxide could induce some kind of rearrangement, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but the IR doesn't show O-H stretches.

Wait, let's try a different approach. The IR of product 1 shows 1720, which is typical for an ester (around 1740) or a ketone (around 1700-1750). The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be OCH₂. So perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an acyloin, but that's less likely.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the initial reaction forms a ketone via a double elimination. Then, reaction with Al isopropoxide could lead to some kind of carbocation rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether, which would have a double bond.

Wait, if product 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into carbonyls, leading to product 3. The NMR of product 3 would then show signals from the new carbonyl groups and the adjacent hydrogens.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H. So, perhaps in product 3, there's a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, which would split the signal.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH group next to a carbonyl, leading to a doublet of doublets or similar.

Wait, perhaps the ozonolysis cleaves a cyclopropane ring into a ketone, leading to a structure with a CH₂ group next to the carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about the possible structures and their NMR.

Let's think about ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a double bond would cleave it. For example, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. The resulting product would have carbonyls at the cleavage points.

If, for example, product 2 is a cyclopropane ring with a double bond (unlikely), ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Alternatively, if product 2 is a ring with a double bond, the cleavage would give a diketone.

Alternatively, product 2 might be a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond, which after ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups in a rigid structure.

Now, the NMR of product 3: the most deshielded H would be near a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring Hs.

If the H is adjacent to another CH₂ group, it could couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet. Or if it's adjacent to a CH group, it could be a doublet.

Wait, but if the H is part of a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, and the adjacent group is another CH₂, then the H's would split into a triplet (coupling with two Hs from each adjacent CH₂).

Alternatively, if it's a CH group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to a CH₂, then it could have a more complex coupling pattern, like a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but considering the options, the possible answers are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

In the case of a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, and adjacent to another CH₂ group, the coupling would be to two Hs, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ is next to another CH₂ and maybe further away, perhaps a triplet of triplets if each H is coupling with two different sets of Hs.

Wait, another scenario: Suppose the H is a methylene group (CH₂) next to a carbonyl, and each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂. Each H would couple with two Hs on each adjacent CH₂. But wait, that's perhaps a double coupling, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a geminal di-substitution, but that's not likely.

Alternatively, if the H is part of a CH group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH₂, it would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but the most deshielded H would likely be on a CH group next to a carbonyl, and adjacent to a CH₂ group.

If that CH group has two neighboring Hs (from the CH₂), it would be a triplet. But wait, if each H in the CH₂ group is a triplet, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the H is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂ group, each H would couple with two Hs, creating a triplet.

So, putting this together, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is triplet.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and ending with product 3, whose most deshielded hydrogen's coupling pattern in the 1H NMR spectrum is to be determined.

### Reaction 1: 1,3-Dibromoadamantane + KOH
1,3-Dibromoadamantane is treated with excess KOH at 240°C, forming a light yellow solid (product 1). The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group, likely a ketone or ester. The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), suggesting an OCH₂ group, and signals at 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) and 1.94 ppm (2H), consistent with a rigid adamantane-like structure. This suggests that product 1 is likely a ketone derivative, such as 1,3-adamantanone.

### Reaction 2: Product 1 + Aluminum Isopropoxide
Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in reactions involving carbonyl compounds. This reaction likely induces a rearrangement or transformation of the ketone in product 1, forming product 2. A plausible outcome is the formation of an enol ether or a related structure containing a double bond.

### Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of Product 2
Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, converting them into carbonyl groups. If product 2 contains a double bond, ozonolysis would produce product 3, which is a carbonyl-containing compound. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would likely be near a carbonyl group.

### Analysis of the Coupling Pattern
In product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. This CH₂ group would couple with the hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern. The splitting arises from the interaction with two equivalent hydrogens on the neighboring CH₂ group, leading to a triplet.

### Conclusion
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet.

Answer: A
