Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem involves cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay, I remember that stability constants relate to the formation of complexes. The beta (β) values indicate how stable each complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable because the formation constant is larger.

So, the complexes in question here are probably different forms of Co(II) with thiocyanate ligands. The problem mentions "dithiocyanato," which I think refers to complexes with two SCN- ions. Wait, no, the term might vary. Let me think: the blue color is typically associated with the [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ complexes. Wait, I think the blue is for the hexathiocyanato complex, like [Co(SCN)6]^3−. But the question is about dithiocyanato, which would be [Co(SCN)2]^something. Or wait, maybe it's a different nomenclature. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^
