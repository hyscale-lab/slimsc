Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. Let me see what the target molecule is and how I can get there.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, the main structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (-CHO). Then, attached to that ring at position 1 is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, it's like a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH2-OH group to the cyclohexane ring that has the aldehyde.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond). So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Wait no, ethynyl is -C≡C-CH2-? Or is it -C≡CH attached directly to the cyclohexane? I think it's the latter: cyclohexane with a triple bond to a CH2 group. Wait, no. Ethynyl is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is a substituent, so it's cyclohexane attached to a carbon that's triple bonded to another carbon. So it's cyclohexyl-C≡CH.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Ethynyl is the substituent, so ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by C≡CH. So it's probably cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached to one carbon.

So the plan is to take ethynylcyclohexane and perform some reactions to get to the target molecule. Let's think about the steps needed.

The target has an aldehyde group, a hydroxyl group attached via a CH2 group, and a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the CH2OH. Hmm, but wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexane ring has a carbaldehyde group, and on carbon 1 (probably adjacent), there's a CH2 group that's connected to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out. But I can't, so I'll visualize. The cyclohexane ring has a CHO group at position 1. Then, another substituent at position 1, which is a CH2 group. That CH2 has two substituents: an OH group and a cyclohexyl group. So, it's a branch at position 1 of the cyclohexane ring.

So, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl,
