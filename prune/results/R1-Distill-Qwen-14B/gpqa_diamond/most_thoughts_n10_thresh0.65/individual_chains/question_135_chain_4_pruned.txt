Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, right, so the interaction term here couples the boson X to fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Wait, kinematical allowed means that the decay products' masses must be less than the mass of X, right? Because conservation of energy says the rest mass of the parent must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. But wait, since particles are being produced, perhaps the rest mass of X must be greater than or equal to twice the mass of each fermion involved, because you're producing a pair.

Looking at the Lagrangian, the interaction term is -(λf) ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. So that's like a Yukawa coupling. Oh wait, the Yukawa interaction is usually something like g ψ φ ψ, where φ is a scalar. So here, X is the scalar field, and the fermions ψ_f are the ones interacting with it. The mass term would come from the v term, but I'm not sure if v is the vacuum expectation value or just a constant here. Probably, since the question is about the decay, the important part is that X couples to various fermions.

So the X boson can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it can couple to. But the fermions must be light enough so that 2m_fermion <= m_X.

The mass of X is 6 GeV, so I need to find all fermions where the mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV each. Because 2m_f = m_X implies m_f = 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, real-world fermion masses are much lower than that. Let me list the known fermion masses.

Quarks: up (u) and down (d) are the lightest, around a few MeV. Then strange (s) is about 100 MeV, then charm (c) around 1.5 GeV, bottom (b) around 4.5 GeV, and top (t) is way heavier, like 173 GeV. But top quarks are way beyond any possible decay here because 4.5 GeV is already over 3 GeV. Wait, wait, 4.5 GeV is more than 3 GeV, so if X is 6 GeV, can it decay into b quarks?

Wait, wait. The mass of the X is 6 GeV. For X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, each fermion's mass must be less than or equal to m_X/2. So m_f <= 3 GeV.

So let's list the fermion masses:

Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV << 3 GeV.

Mu (μ): ~105.7 MeV <<3 GeV.

Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV. So 1.78 GeV is less than 3 GeV. So τ pairs are allowed.

Quarks:

u: ~2-5 MeV <<3 GeV.

d: ~3-7 MeV <<3 GeV.

s: ~95-105 MeV <<3 GeV.

c: ~1.2-1.5 GeV. So 1.5 GeV is still less than 3 GeV. So c quarks are allowed.

b quark: ~4.1-5 GeV. So 4.5 GeV is more than 3 GeV. So X cannot decay into b quarks, because 2 * 4.5 GeV is 9 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV. So that's not allowed.

Top quark is way
