Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, which are Earth-like. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

So, the key here is figuring out which planet has a higher transit probability. Transit probability depends on a few factors, right? From what I remember, the main factors are the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. Oh, and also the star's size because a larger star makes the transit less likely.

Wait, thinking back, the probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a/(2R_s))^2 + ... )? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing something up. Alternatively, I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_p/R_s)^2 multiplied by a term that depends on the alignment, but since we don't know the exact inclination, maybe that's why the RV method gives some info.

Wait, no, RV method tells us about the mass and the period but not the inclination, except that it gives a minimum mass. But for transit probability, we need the probability that the orbital plane is edge-on enough. So the probability is higher if the planet's orbit is more likely to be aligned with our line of sight.

Another factor is the size of the star. A smaller star has a higher probability because a planet is more likely to block the starlight when the star is smaller.

Wait, the formula for transit probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s + R_p) / a )^2 * (something else?), but I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, I remember that for a circular orbit, the probability of transit is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 - eÂ²))^(1/2), but since both have circular orbits (e=0), that term is 1. So maybe that's not a factor here.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is approximately (R_p)^2 / (a^2), but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's more about the ratio of the planet's orbital distance and the star's size. Wait, the transit occurs when the
