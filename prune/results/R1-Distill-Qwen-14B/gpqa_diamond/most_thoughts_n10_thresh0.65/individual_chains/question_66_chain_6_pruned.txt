Okay, so I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The options given are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators, but these operators have to respect certain symmetries.

Wait, wait, what's the deal with these symmetries? Let me think. Lorentz symmetry is a big one because it's about how physics looks the same in all inertial frames. So all terms in the Lagrangian must respect Lorentz symmetry; otherwise, you’d have different physics depending on your frame, which isn't allowed. So that's a must for SMEFT operators.

Poincaré symmetry is a bit trickier. Poincaré includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's the combination of rotations, boosts, and translations in spacetime. But wait, when you have an effective theory like SMEFT, the operators are classified by their dimension. For example, dimension-6 operators come with coefficients that have mass dimension. But do they have to respect Poincaré symmetry? I think that the SMEFT is constructed in a way that respects the underlying symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Poincaré. But wait, in SMEFT, the operators can have higher derivatives, which might affect some symmetries. Or maybe the operators are written in a way that preserves Poincaré. Alternatively, perhaps Poincaré is automatically respected because the SM respects it, and the SME
