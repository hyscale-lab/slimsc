Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to tackle it step by step. The question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state of a system is described by a vector in a Hilbert space, and operators correspond to observables.

Alright, let's read the problem again. We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, proportional means it's equal to some constant multiplied by that vector. But since we're dealing with probabilities, the normalization is important. Oh right, so I need to normalize this state first.

The first part asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i != j and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-up and spin-down states. Let me write it out.

So the matrix for operator A would be:
[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Wait, no, because for a 2x2 matrix, when i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2. So rows and columns are 1 and 2. So A is:

Row 1: [0, hbar/2]
Row 2: [hbar/2, 0]

Hmm, this looks familiar. Oh wait, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A = (hbar/2) * σ_x.

So the eigenstates of A would be the eigenvectors of σ_x. I recall that the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. The eigenvalues are ±1, so for A, the eigenvalues would be ±hbar/2.

Wait, but the question is to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of operator A. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates. But maybe there's an easier way.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the eigenstates of A and then calculate the inner product with |alpha> to get the amplitudes, then square them for probabilities.

Alternatively, since A
