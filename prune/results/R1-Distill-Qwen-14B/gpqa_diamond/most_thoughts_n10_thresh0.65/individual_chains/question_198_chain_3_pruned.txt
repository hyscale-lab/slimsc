Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

So the question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We're supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait. I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. Higher β means more stable. The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ where n is 1 to 4. The dithiocyanato would be n=2, I guess. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, blue complexes... I think the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. Because I remember that the different complexes have different colors, and the hexaaquachromium is pink, but wait no, that's Cr. For Co, I think [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is the blue one. Or maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? I'm a bit confused. Wait, but the question specifies the blue dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- per Co^2+? So, perhaps [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Or maybe [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is tetra, but dithiocyanato would be two. Hmm, maybe I should just focus on the math first, and then see which complex corresponds.

Wait, the problem gives four stability constants: β1 through β4. So each β corresponds to the complex with n=1,2,3,4 SCN- ligands. Stability constant βn is for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2+ - n?), because each SCN- is -1. So for Co^2+ with n SCN-, the charge would be 2+ -n*(-1)? Wait, no. Each SCN- is -1, so for n SCN-, the complex would have a charge of 2+ - n*(–1) ??? Wait no, wait. Wait, Co^2+ is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So when you have n SCN- attached, the complex is [Co
