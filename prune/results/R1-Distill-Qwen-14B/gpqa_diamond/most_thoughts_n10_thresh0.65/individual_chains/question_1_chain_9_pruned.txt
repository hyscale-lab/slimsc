Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the energy difference is too small compared to their uncertainties, you can't tell them apart—they'll blur into each other.

So the condition for distinguishability is ΔE > (ΔE1 + ΔE2) / 2 or something? Or perhaps the sum because each has their own uncertainty. Wait, maybe the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the individual energy uncertainties. Because each state's energy is uncertain by their respective ΔE. So the difference between E1 and E2 must be more than the sum of their uncertainties to make them resolvable.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The energy difference ΔE between the two states (E2 - E1) should be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. Because each state's energy is uncertain, and if the separation is smaller than the sum
