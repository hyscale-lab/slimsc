Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, 2e? Oh right, because e is the elementary charge, about 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each particle has a charge of 2 * 1.6e-19 C, which is 3.2e-19 C. But wait, I'll probably need to think about that more carefully.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at P. So, I'm picturing twelve charges arranged around a central point P, each at a distance of 2 meters. And the thirteenth is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. The system's total energy... I remember that the potential energy between point charges is what's important here. Because the energy of the system comes from the electrostatic potential energy between the charges.

But wait, the problem says it's an isolated system, so I think that means we're considering only the potential energy between these charges, not any external fields or anything else.

Wait, but the setup is a bit confusing. So the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away. So those 12 are
