Okay, so I've got this question here about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A through D, each with different exponents.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right! Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So if a star has a parallax of, say, 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away. If it's 0.5 arcseconds, that's 2 parsecs away. So parallax decreases as distance increases.

Now, the question assumes stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution in space would mean that the number density of stars is constant. Wait, but how does that translate when we consider them in terms of parallax?

Let me think about the volume of space for a given parallax. Parallax (p) is 1/d, where d is distance. So for a small range of parallax, like from p to p+dp, what is the corresponding range in distance?

p = 1/d → d = 1/p. So if parallax increases by dp, the distance change would be dd. Let's see, differentiating both sides: dp = - (1/p^2) dd. Hmm, so the change in distance dd is -dp * p². The negative just indicates direction, but I guess we're considering absolute values here.

So for a given dp, the corresponding change in distance is proportional to p². That is, the range in distance is larger for smaller p (since p is smaller, p squared is smaller, wait no—wait, if p is small, like 0.1, then p squared is 0.01. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let's think in terms of the volume. The number of stars in a shell between distance d and d+dd depends on the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars would be proportional to r² dr, since the number density is uniform (n stars per volume).

But r is distance, which is 1/p. So substituting r=1/p, the volume element becomes 4π (1/p)^2 dr. Wait, dr is the change in distance, but we need to express it in terms of dp. Let me see.

We have p = 1/d → d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp. So dr = (1/p²) dp, because the negative just indicates the direction. So substituting into the volume:

Volume element dV = 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp) = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. The volume element for a shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd. But d is 1/p, so d² is (1/p²). And dd is (1/p²) dp. So:

dV = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in that shell is number density (n) times dV, which would be n * (4π / p^4) dp.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax
