Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves an electron state and some operator. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum, but let's try to break it down.

Alright, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, I think that means |alpha> is a linear combination of the up and down spin states along the z-axis. But wait, the coefficients are complex numbers. I remember that in quantum states, the coefficients can be complex, representing probability amplitudes. But since the state is only given as proportional, maybe I need to normalize it first. Oh right, because the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients should equal 1 for a properly normalized state.

So the first step is to find the normalization constant. Let's calculate the squared magnitudes of each coefficient. The first term is (1+i), the magnitude squared is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. The second term is (2 - i), so magnitude squared is (2^2 + 1^2) = 4 +1 =5. So adding these, 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because when you square it, you get 1/7, which will make the state have a norm of 1. So the normalized |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator is given as A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. Oh, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix has 0s on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. So the operator A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x.

But wait, the eigenstates of sigma_x are not the same as |up> and |down>. So the operator A has eigenstates that are different. Let me think. The eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because sigma_x is the spin in the x-direction. So the eigenstates are
