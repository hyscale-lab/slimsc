Alright, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is given as h/(4π), right? And S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I need to figure out the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Hmm, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenvalues are related to the spin. Since it's a muon, which is a lepton, it has spin-1/2. So the possible eigenvalues for the components should be ± ħ/2. Wait, but the operator here is c times S. Let me compute c first.

c is h/(4π). I think h is Planck's constant, which is 2πħ. So substituting, c becomes (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. Oh wait, no, because h = 2πħ, so h/(4π) would be (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. So c is ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) * S.

Wait, but S is a matrix. Let me write down what S looks like. The matrix S is:

Row 1: 0   -i
Row 2: i    0

Wait, that's the structure. So S is a 2x2 matrix. Now, I know that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, each multiplied by ħ/2. So S must be the σy matrix, right? Because the σy matrix is:

0   -i
i    0 

Which matches S. So S is actually σy, the Pauli Y matrix. So then Ay = (ħ/2) * σy. But wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±ħ/2, but in this case, since Ay is (ħ/2)σy, what are its eigenvalues?

Wait, the eigenvalues of σy are ±i, because σy has eigenvalues ±i. Let me think. The Pauli matrices are all traceless and have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, no
