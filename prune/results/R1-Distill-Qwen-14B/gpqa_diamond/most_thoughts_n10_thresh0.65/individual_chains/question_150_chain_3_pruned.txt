Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then it undergoes a series of reactions. The question is about identifying the final product from the given options.

First, I'll try to analyze the NMR data to determine the structure of the starting compound. The NMR spectrum shows:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, and they're typically deshielded. But in some cases, like conjugated systems, they might be split differently. Hmm.

- 6.98 ppm: a doublet of 2H. This could be aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted aromatic rings since the doublet suggests two equivalent protons, each coupling with one neighbor.

- 6.51 ppm: another doublet of 2H. Also aromatic, possibly in a different environment. Wait, maybe part of a para-substituted benzene ring as well.

- 6.27 ppm: a broad singlet of 2H. Broad signals are often due to exchange with protons, like hydroxyl groups, but in this case, it's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe allylic protons or something else. But wait, the molecular formula includes an N, so perhaps an amide or something else. Hmm.

- 3.66 ppm: a doublet of 2H. This is probably a methylene group adjacent to something electronegative. Maybe an oxygen, like an ether or ester, or perhaps a carbonyl group.

Putting this together, the structure might have a benzene ring with substituents, perhaps a side chain containing another benzene ring or a conjugated system. The aldehyde group is a possibility because of the 9.72 ppm peak.

Wait, another thought: the 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet. Aldehydes usually are split if adjacent to something. So if the aldehyde (CHO) is connected to a CH2 group, that could explain the triplet. Like, the aldehyde proton couples with the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So maybe the structure is something like R
