Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state chemistry, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, right. Let me think.

First, I remember that the interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is given by the formula involving the reciprocal of the lattice parameters. But wait, rhombohedral crystals are a bit tricky because all the edges are the same length and all the angles are equal. Oh right, the general formula for the interplanar distance in a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), where a is the lattice parameter and (hkl) are the Miller indices. But wait, this is for a cubic system. Rhombohedral is a bit more complex because the angles aren't 90 degrees.

So I think the general formula for any crystal system is d = 1 / sqrt( (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) + 2*(hk cosγ)/(a b) + 2*(kl cosβ)/(b c) + 2*(hl cosα)/(a c) ) )? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I think the formula uses the unit cell parameters and the angles between them.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance formula for a general crystal is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of terms involving the Miller indices and the direction cosines. Or perhaps it's better to use the formula that involves the structure factor and the metric tensor.

Alternatively, I remember the formula for d-h spacing is d = (a^2 (b c sin γ))^(1/2) ) / ( sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 h k cos α - 2 k l cos β - 2 h l cos γ ) )

Wait, no, maybe the formula is d = (1/√(h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos α + 2 kl cos β + 2 hl cos gamma )) ) multiplied by something. No, not exactly. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the correct formula is d = (a^2 (b c sin γ))^(1/2) ) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 h k cos α - 2 h l cos gamma - 2 k l
