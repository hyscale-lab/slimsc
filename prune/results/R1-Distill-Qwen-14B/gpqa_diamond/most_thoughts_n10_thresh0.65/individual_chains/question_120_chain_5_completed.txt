Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax value. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

Parallax is a measure of how much a star shifts its position in the sky relative to background stars as the Earth orbits the Sun, right? And the formula I remember is that parallax (in parsecs) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/distance. Wait, no, actually, it's plx (in arcseconds) = 1/distance (in parsecs). So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. The options suggest different power laws, so I need to figure out the relationship between the number of stars and the parallax.

Assuming stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density of stars in space is constant. So, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on that volume. But how does that volume change with parallax?

Let me think in terms of distance. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So higher parallax means closer stars. If I consider a thin shell at a distance d, the volume of that shell would be the surface area times the thickness. The surface area of a sphere is 4πd², and the thickness is a small change in distance, say dd. So the volume is 4πd² dd.

But since we're looking at parallax, let me express this in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dd = (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, let's compute that: d = 1/plx ⇒ dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx). Hmm, but when plx increases, d decreases, but I'm more interested in the positive change. Anyway, substituting d=1/plx into the volume expression.

The volume of the shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx). Wait, because d = 1/plx, so dd is the change in distance, which is (d plx) in terms of parallax? Wait no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Let me think of the range of parallax, say from plx to plx + d plx. Each star contributes to a parallax around that value. So the number of stars in a parallax range would relate to the number of stars in that shell, which in turn depends on the volume of the shell and the density.

Since the star density (number per volume) is uniform, say n stars per cubic parsec, the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is n * 4πd² dd.

But we want to express this in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So substituting, the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx). Wait, wait, what's dd in terms of plx?

Because d = 1/plx, so if plx changes by a small amount (d plx), then the change in d is dd = - (1/plx^2) d plx. But since we're considering a small range, maybe the negative sign doesn't matter because we're taking the magnitude. So, the volume at a given parallax is proportional to (1/plx)^2 * d plx.

Wait, substituting, the number of stars per unit parallax range (d plx) would be n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx). Because the stars are uniformly distributed, n is a constant.

So, the number of stars per unit parallax (let's think of it as stars per (d plx)) would be proportional to (1/plx^2) * (d plx) / (d plx). Wait, no. Wait, the number of stars in a certain range of plx (say, from plx to plx + d plx) is n * volume. So the number per unit plx is (n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx)) ) / (d plx). Oh, because the width is d plx, so when we take per unit plx, we divide by d plx. So the stars per unit plx is (n * 4π (1/plx)^2 ) * (d plx) ) / (d plx) → simplifies to 4π n (1/plx^2).

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if I have N stars in a range d plx, then per unit plx is N/(d plx). So substituting N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx), then N/(d plx) = n *4π (1/plx^2). So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx².

Wait, but that would suggest the number of stars per unit parallax interval (like per 0.1 parsec in parallax) increases as 1/plx². Because as plx increases (distance decreases), there are more stars in that interval.

Wait, but wait. If plx is small, meaning the stars are far away, then 1/plx² is small, so fewer stars per unit plx. But stars are uniformly distributed, so in a larger volume, more stars. But wait, the number per unit plx isn't just about the volume, but how the volume changes with plx.

Wait, but the way we derived it, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx². So looking at the options, option B is ~1/plx². But wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of how the number of stars in a certain range of parallax depends on the distance.

The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + d plx is the number of stars in the shell at distance d, which is n * 4π d² * (d d). But d =1/plx, so d² = 1/(plx)^2. Also, d d is the change in distance, which is (d plx) / plx². Because d =1/plx, so dd = - (d plx)/ (plx)^2. So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx)/(plx^2) ) → 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let's re-examine.

Wait, the shell's thickness is dd, the change in distance. So the volume is 4π d² dd.

In terms of parallax, since d =1/plx, then dd = - (d plx)/(plx^2). Because plx =1/d → d plx = - d (d^2)? Wait, maybe I'm mixing variables. Let me use p for parallax.

p = 1/d → d = 1/p.

Differentiating both sides: dp = - (1/d²) dd → dd = - d² dp → d² = 1/p².

So dd = - (1/p²) dp.

The volume is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/p²) * ( - (1/p²) dp ) → 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But since we're talking about the number of stars in a range of parallax, dp, the volume is proportional to (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but the number of stars in that volume is n * volume → n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number per unit parallax (dp) is n *4π (1/p^4). So the number of stars per unit parallax interval is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, that would suggest the answer is option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

But wait, how? Because when plx is small (large distance), the number of stars per unit plx is higher according to 1/p^4, meaning more stars in each small parallax step. But in reality, more distant stars would have lower parallax, and if they're uniformly distributed, there are more stars at larger distances, so more stars would be found in each small parallax bin as plx decreases. So, the number per unit plx would increase as plx decreases, which would mean the number is proportional to 1/(plx)^4.

Wait, but that seems counterintuitive. I thought the number of stars per unit volume is constant, so as you go further, you have more volume, hence more stars, but how does that translate to the number per unit parallax?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.

The number of stars per unit volume is n. So, the number in a shell of thickness dd at distance d is n * (4π d² dd).

Expressing in terms of p (parallax):

d =1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp.

So, the number of stars in a shell with parallax between p and p + dp is n *4π (1/p)^2 * ( - (1/p²) dp ) → n *4π (1/p^4) (-dp).

But since we're considering a positive change, we can take the absolute value, so dp → the number is n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

Thus, the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but is there another way to think about it? Maybe considering the solid angle and flux. No, wait, the problem says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, so it's a uniform spatial distribution.

So in space, the number density is n. The volume element in spherical coordinates is dV = 4π d² dd. So as d increases, the volume per unit distance increases. But when you look in terms of parallax, since p =1/d, a small change in p corresponds to a change in d.

So considering how many stars fall into a small change in p, the number is n * dV. But dV =4π d² dd. And since dd = (1/p²) dp.

So substituting, dV =4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp) =4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in a parallax interval dp is n *4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the answer should be option A: ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 1/plx^2. What's the confusion here?

Ah, perhaps I was mistaken in the earlier reasoning. Let me think again. The volume element in terms of parallax.

Another approach: since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in a volume V is N = n * V.

If I consider stars with parallax between p and p+dp, the corresponding distance is d=1/p to d=1/(p+dp). Wait, that's not a thin shell but a range of distances. Hmm, maybe I need to think of it as a thin shell at distance d=1/p, with thickness dd. Then the number of stars in that shell is N = n * 4π d² dd.

Expressed in terms of p, d =1/p, so N = n *4π (1/p)^2 * (dd).

But dd = (1/p²) dp, so N = n *4π (1/p^2) * (1/p²) dp → n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number per unit parallax (dp) is N/dp = n 4π (1/p^4).

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the relationship between parallax, distance, and the number of stars in a thin shell at a given distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density \( n \) is constant.

Expressing the volume in terms of parallax, we use \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), so \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx}) \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) into the volume expression, the volume becomes \( 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx})\right) \), which simplifies to \( 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d(\text{plx}) \). The number of stars in this volume is proportional to \( n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d(\text{plx}) \).

To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by \( d(\text{plx}) \), resulting in \( n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

This matches option A, which states that the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).
