Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. The options are A through D, each listing different fermion-antifermion pairs.

Wait, from what I remember, in particle physics, the decay of a boson into fermions depends on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions involved. The rule is that the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the boson. But wait, or is it that each fermion's mass must be less than half the boson's mass? Because in a decay like X → f f̄, each fermion gets some energy, but the rest mass must be less than the available energy.

Oh right, the condition for a decay to be kinematically allowed is that the total energy of the decay products must be at least their rest mass. But since the boson is at rest when it decays, the center-of-mass energy is just the boson's mass. So for the decay X → f f̄ to happen, the sum of the rest masses of f and f̄ must be less than the mass of X.

Wait, no, actually, the rest mass of each fermion must be less than half the mass of X. Because in the rest frame, each fermion would get some energy and momentum. The minimum energy each would need is their rest mass. So for each f, m_f ≤ M_X / 2. Because if each gets m_f, then 2m_f = M_X, so m_f ≤ M_X /2.

So X is 6 GeV. So m_f must be ≤ 3 GeV each. Because two fermions (each of mass m_f) sum up to 2m_f, which must be ≤ M_X. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because in the rest frame, the total energy is M_X, and each fermion must have energy at least m_f. So the sum is E1 + E2 = M_X. And E1 ≥ m_f, E2 ≥ m_f. So the minimal sum is
