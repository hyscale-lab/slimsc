Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question says.

The question is about the Sun's neutrino production. It says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, the Sun's core reactions... Right, the proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. The pp-I, II, III branchesâ€”I remember that pp-III is the dominant process, producing a lot of neutrinos. So if that stops, what happens?

The question is about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, the ratio is flux1/flux2.

Hmm, what do I know about neutrino production? Neutrinos are produced in the Sun through various processes, mainly the proton-proton chain. The pp-III branch is the main one, producing a lot of neutrinos via the reaction that emits a positron and a neutrino. Oh wait, when two protons combine, one turns into a neutron, emitting a positron and a neutrino. So these neutrinos have a certain energy distribution.

If pp-III stops, what other processes are there? Well, I think there's also the pp-I and pp-II branches, but I'm not sure. Also, the CNO cycle produces neutrinos too, but I think that cycle contributes less. So if pp-III stops, the main neutrino source would be the other branches and the CNO cycle.

Wait, but the problem says all other reactions remain as they were except for stopping pp-III. So the other processes continue as usual. So the neutrinos come from both the continuing processes and any leftovers from pp-III?

Wait no, if pp-III stops, then any neutrinos from other processes would still be there. But neutrinos from pp-III have a certain energy spectrum. So the question is about the flux in two specific energy bands.

So first, I should think about the energy of neutrinos from different processes.

The pp-III branch emits neutrinos with energies around a few hundred keV. Wait, no, I think the neutrinos from the main pp process (like the pp-III) have energies in a certain range. Let me recall: the main neutrino emission in the Sun is from the pp-III branch, which emits neutrinos with a peak around
