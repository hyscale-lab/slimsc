Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each represented as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, right. So the operator P is a vector operator, and the problem is about finding its eigenvector when measured along a specific direction, which is arbitrary but lying in the x-z plane. That probably means the direction can be expressed using an angle θ from the z-axis, and direction n would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero. Wait, no, wait. If the direction is in the x-z plane, then φ would be 0 or π, so maybe the vector n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because φ is the angle around the y-axis. So n is in the x-z plane, so the direction is determined by θ from the z-axis and φ=0.

Wait, but the problem says it's in the x-z plane, so the direction vector n is ( sinθ, 0, cosθ ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So the operator P along direction n would be P · n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ, because Py is zero since the direction is in the x-z plane, so the y-component of the direction vector is zero.

Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, the operator P is a vector, so when we take P along direction n, it's the dot product of the operator vector P and the unit vector n. So P_n = P · n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

But in this problem, the direction n is in x-z plane, so n_y = 0. So P_n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

So I need to find the eigenvector of this P_n operator corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But wait, the problem says that the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So I can't compute
