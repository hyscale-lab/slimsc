Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula for parallax (plx) is plx = 1/distance (d), where d is in parsecs. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther, the parallax decreases.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution in what sense? Like, the same number of stars in each region of space? Or maybe uniformly spread out in all directions. I think it means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So in any volume, there's the same number of stars per unit volume.

I'm trying to relate this to parallax. So parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d. So as d increases, plx decreases.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So, if I have a range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Wait, since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. But the volume at a certain distance isn't a sphere, because we're considering a thin shell at a particular distance. Let me think about the volume of a spherical shell. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4πr² dr. So for a thin shell between r and r+dr, the volume is about 4πr² dr.

But wait, parallax plx
