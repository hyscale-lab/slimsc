Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the solution step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a star whose properties change when it has spots. When the surface isn't covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They're looking at the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levelsâ€”level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I remember that in stellar atmospheres under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (or degeneracy) of each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, wait. So the ratio n1/n2 depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels. If the temperature changes, this ratio changes as well.

In the problem, when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature decreases. But wait, the spots are cooler regions, right? But the question says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the star's average Teff goes down.

But how does this affect the photosphere's temperature? Wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So the temperature of the photosphere (the layer where the emission comes from) is now lower.

Wait, no, wait. The star's photosphere without spots has Teff 6000 K. When spots cover 40% of the surface, the effective temperature drops to 5500 K. So the overall brightness (or the effective temperature) is lower because spots are cooler. But the photosphere, wait, does the presence of spots affect the photospheric temperature? Or does the photosphere
