Okay, so I have this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let's try to break this down step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, when a star is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the populations of different energy levels are determined by the Boltzmann equation.

So the Boltzmann distribution formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Here, n_i is the number of atoms in energy level i, g_i is the statistical weight, E_i is the energy, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

In this case, we're considering the same transition for both stars. So the energy difference E between the two levels is the same for both stars. Let me assume that E_i is the higher energy level, so E_i - E_j is positive. If the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, that means the population of the higher energy level (n_i) is twice that of the lower level (n_j) in star_1. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the question says the atoms are twice as excited. Maybe n_i for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or maybe the ratio between the excited and unexcited states is twice as high in star_1. Hmm.

Wait, let me rephrase. The problem states that
