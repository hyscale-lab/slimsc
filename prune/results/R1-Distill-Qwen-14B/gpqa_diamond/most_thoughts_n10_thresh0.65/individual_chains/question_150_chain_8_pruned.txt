Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reaction mechanisms can get tricky. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and after a series of reactions, we need to identify the final product. The options are A to D.

First, let me parse the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at:
- 9.72 ppm, a triplet (t) integrating to 1H.
- 6.98 ppm, a doublet (d) with 2H.
- 6.51 ppm, another doublet (d) with 2H.
- 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet (bs) with 2H.
- 3.66 ppm, a doublet (d) with 2H.

Hmm, okay. Let's think about each part. The peak at 9.72 is probably an aldehyde proton since those are usually around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehydes are usually deshielded and appear as singlets because there's only one proton. Oh wait, maybe it's an alpha proton to the aldehyde. Or perhaps another scenario. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated system.

Wait, let me think. The triplet at 9.72 could be a vinyl proton adjacent to an aldehyde. Hmm, or maybe another functional group.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.98 and 6.51 are both doublets each with 2H. That's reminiscent of a para-substituted aromatic ring. Typically, in para substitution, you get two doublets each integrating to two protons. So, maybe two substituents on a benzene ring, each in the para position relative to each other. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: if there's a benzene ring (6 carbons), then the remaining 2 carbons must be in another group. The formula also includes an N and an O.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, X is 0. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees: one from each benzene ring (3 double bonds or one ring and two double bonds?), but wait, benzene has three degrees (3 double bonds). Wait, a benzene ring is 3 degrees, an aldehyde is another, maybe a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet around 9.72, which might be an aldehyde proton, but it's a triplet, which is confusing because aldehyde protons are usually singlets unless in some special coupling scenario, like being part of a conjugated system.

Wait another thought: maybe the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents. Let me think about the possible structure.

The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to something deshielded. Maybe an oxygen? Like an O
