Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The operator is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, the operator is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Oh right, because the operator P is a vector operator, so it's the sum of these components multiplied by the respective unit vectors. But wait, direction n is in the x-z plane, so the direction vector n would have components (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 90 degrees or something? Wait, no, wait. Actually, in the x-z plane, the angle φ (azimuthal angle) would be either 0 or π/2, but maybe I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, since it's in the x-z plane, the direction vector n can be represented as (n_x, 0, n_z). But perhaps it's better to parameterize it using an angle θ from the z-axis. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle.

So the operator P is along n, so P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the operator is in the direction n, so it's P · n hat. So P = (n_x
