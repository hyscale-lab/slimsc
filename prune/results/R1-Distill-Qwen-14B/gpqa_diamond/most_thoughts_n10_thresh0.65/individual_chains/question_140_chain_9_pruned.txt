Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully and break it down step by step.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. There's also some information about a keto acid reacting with X and producing a product with two oxygen atoms. Plus, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. The goal is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's start by identifying each component. I think I'll tackle each part one by one.

First, let's consider the reaction between substance X and liquid Y. The reaction is violent, so maybe it's a strong acid reacting with something. The gas released, W, has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Wait, that's interesting. For a molecule, each atom contributes protons and neutrons. But if the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons overall, the sum of the protons (which is the atomic number) must equal the sum of neutrons in each atom.

Wait, no, the molecule as a whole has the same number of protons and neutrons. So maybe the molecule is something like H2O, but let me think. Alternatively, perhaps it's CO2 or something else. Wait, H2O has 10 protons (each H has 1, O has 8) and 10 neutrons (each H has 0, O has 8). Oh, wait, no. O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in its most common isotope. So H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and 1 O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons: 2 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: 0 +8 =8. That doesn't match. So H2O is 10 protons, 8 neutrons. Not equal.

Wait, the gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So the sum of protons in the molecule equals the sum of neutrons.

What gases are produced in such reactions? Common ones might be CO2, H2, O2, NH3, maybe. Let's see:

CO2: Each molecule has 12 (6 from C,
