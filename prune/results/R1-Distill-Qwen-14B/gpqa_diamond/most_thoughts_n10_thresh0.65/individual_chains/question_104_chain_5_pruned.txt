Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Let's read through the question carefully.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits, and they were detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. 

The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the star's wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet, or the closer it is, or the shorter the orbital period? Hmm, I think the amplitude of the shift depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period. Wait, maybe it's the velocity of the star that matters.

Let me think. The RV method detects the velocity of the star's movement towards and away from us. The formula I remember is something like v = (G * M_planet * sin i) / (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 / (1 + (M_planet/M_star)^(1/3))) ) ) ... Wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Alternatively, the semi-amplitude K of the RV is given by a formula that includes the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period.

Wait, the formula I recall is K = ( (2πG) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) ... But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star (like Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_star + M_planet ~ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit.

But wait, the problem states that both planets have masses similar to Neptune, and the stars are similar to the Sun. So M_planet is the same for both planets, and M_star is the same as well. So the only varying factors in the RV method would be the orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis (a), but since the orbits are circular, a is the same as the radius.

Wait, but for a circular orbit, the semi-major axis is the radius. So if the stars are the same, and the planet masses are the same, the RV semi-amplitude K should depend on the orbital period. How so?

Wait, K (the velocity semi-amplitude) is given by:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c^
