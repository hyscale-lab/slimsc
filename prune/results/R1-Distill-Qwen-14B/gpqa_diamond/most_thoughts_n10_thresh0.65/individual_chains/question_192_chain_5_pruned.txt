Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to picture it. There's an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity, which is also spherical, with radius r. The centers of the conductor and the cavity are separated by a distance s. So, imagine the big sphere is the conductor, and inside it, towards one side, there's a smaller cavity. The center of the cavity is s units away from the center of the conductor.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both larger than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. So, the setup must involve some geometry with these distances and angles.

Wait, I remember something about conductors and charges. When a conductor is neutral, and you put a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was uncharged initially. Oh right, the cavity is inside the conductor, so the conductor's electrons would move to the inner surface. But wait, the charge inside the cavity is positive, so the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced -q charge, and the outer surface would be neutral because the total conductor was uncharged before adding the charge.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is initially neutral, so when you place +q
