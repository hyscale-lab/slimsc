Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

First, let me break down each technique's information.

Starting with the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of either O-H (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or N-H (amines), but since the options don't have nitrogen, it's likely O-H. But wait, the question says "very broad absorption," which is typical for O-H in alcohols or maybe a carboxylic acid. But looking further, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Oh, 1700 is a strong peak, which often indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl or possibly an aromatic ring (C=C stretching in conjugated systems, like in a conjugated carbonyl group or an aromatic ring). Alternatively, 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an ester or a ketone with some conjugation.

Wait, but if there are two strong carbonyl peaks, that might suggest two different kinds of carbonyl groups. But that's a bit unusual. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else, like an aromatic ring's C=C. Let me think. Other possibilities for 1650: maybe an aromatic ring's stretching, as benzene rings can have C=C stretches around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹. But 1650 is a bit higher, which might suggest conjugation. Alternatively, it could be an amide I band, but I don't think that's the case here because the options don't have nitrogen. Hmm.

Moving on to the 1H NMR: several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound likely has a double bond somewhere, perhaps an alkene or
