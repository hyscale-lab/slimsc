Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about the decay modes of a boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is provided, but I'm not sure how that directly affects the decay options. Maybe it's more about the particles the boson can decay into based on their masses.

First, I remember that when a particle decays, the total energy of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So for each possible decay channel, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of X.

Wait, but wait. X is a boson, so it's a spin-0 particle? I think so. The decay modes are into fermion-antifermion pairs. So the possible decay products would be particles like quarks, leptons, etc.

The options given include various quark and lepton pairs. Let me list what each option includes.

Option A: bb̄, ss̄, uū, dd̄, τ+τ-, ee+-

Option B: cc̄, ss̄, uū, dd̄, τ+τ-, μ+μ-, ee+-

Option C: cc̄, ss̄, uū, dd̄, tt̄, τ+τ-, μ+μ-, ee+-

Option D: bb̄, ss̄, uū, dd̄, τ+τ-, μ+μ-, ee+-

Wait, the decay products must have each fermion pair's combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So I need to check the masses of each fermion. Let me recall the masses:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV, negligible compared to 6 GeV.
- Down quark (d): around 4.7 MeV, also negligible.
- Strange quark (s): about 95 MeV, way below 6 GeV.
- Charm quark (c): approximately 1.5 GeV.
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.7 GeV.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, like 173 GeV. So if X is 6 GeV, it can't decay into top quarks because 2*173 GeV is way more than 6 GeV.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): 0.511 MeV, negligible.
- Muon (μ): about 105.7 MeV.
- Tau (τ): around 1.78 GeV.

So for each fermion pair, the sum of their masses must be less than 6 GeV.

Let's go through each possible pair:

1. b b̄: Each b is about 4.7 GeV, so two of them sum to ~9.4 GeV. But X is 6 GeV, so that's too heavy. So X can't decay into b b̄? Wait, but wait—does X have enough energy? Oh, but wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. For fermion pair production, their combined mass should be less than or equal to X's mass. So for b b̄, 2*m_b ≈ 9.4 GeV which is way above 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄. Hmm, but looking at the options, some include bb̄. Maybe I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of pair production. For the boson X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the rest mass of each fermion must be less than or equal to half of X's mass. Because each fermion would have energy at least m_fermion, and since they are a pair, 2*m_fermion must be ≤ m_X.

So m_fermion ≤ m_X / 2.

So X's mass is 6 GeV. So m_fermion ≤ 3 GeV.

So checking each fermion:

- u: 2.2 MeV → yes.
- d: 4.7 MeV → yes.
- s: 95 MeV → yes.
- c: 1.5 GeV → 1.5 <3 → yes.
- b: 4.7 GeV → which is greater than 3 GeV. So no; can't decay into b b̄.
- t: way too heavy, as before.
- e: 0.5 MeV → yes.
- μ: ~0.1 GeV → yes.
- τ: 1.78 GeV → which is less than 3 GeV. So τ+τ- is allowed.

So which fermions can X decay into?

u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ.

But not b or t.

Wait
