Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again carefully.

The question is about a star whose properties change when dark spots cover 40% of its surface. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). Observations show that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can use the Boltzmann equation here.

Hmm. Let's think about what affects the ratio of atoms in two energy levels. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states to the temperature. The equation is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of atoms in levels 2 and 1, respectively.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

The ratio R = n2/n1. But wait, when the star has spots, does the overall temperature change affect this ratio? Because the spots cause the effective temperature of the photosphere to drop from 6000 K to 5500 K.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, 40% of its surface is covered. So, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But when we're talking about the photosphere, each region (spot or non-spot) might have its own temperature. However, the problem says to assume LTE. Hmm, but how does the presence of spots impact the photospheric conditions where the Ti atoms are?

Wait, perhaps the spots
