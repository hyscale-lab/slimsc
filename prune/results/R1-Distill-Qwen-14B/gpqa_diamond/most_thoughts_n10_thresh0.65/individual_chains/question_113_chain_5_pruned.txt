Alright, let me try to work through this problem. Okay, so the question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectral data. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let me look at the data given.

The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak in that region usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch, maybe from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be another carbonyl group but maybe conjugated or it might be an aromatic ring or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but the problem doesn't mention any N-containing info, so probably not that. Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester?

The 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means they're attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has some double bonds. So maybe there's an alkene group in the molecule.

The mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm. I need to think about what fragments have a mass of 45. Common fragments include CH3CO (43?), but wait, 45 would be maybe (CH2O) or something else. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight. Let's calculate: 45 is 12+2*1 +16*2 = 45? Wait, 12 (C) + 2*(H) is 2, then O is 16, another O. So 12 + 2 + 16 + 16=46? No wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the fragment could be from a ketone group or an ester. Wait, another approach: 45 is the molecular ion of something. Let me think: C3H7O would be (12*3)+(7*1)+(16)=36+7+16=59. No. Wait, maybe 45 is the molecular ion of something else.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a common one. Let's think of common ions. For example, the (CH3)2O+ ion would be 45? Let's compute: CH3-O+ would be 15 (CH3) + 16 (O) + 1 (H from somewhere? Or maybe not. Alternatively, another fragment. Oh, wait, 45 is the mass of (CH3)2CO+? No, that's more than 45. Or, maybe it's a smaller fragment. Like, the O=C-O- as part of an ester. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion or something else. Another thought: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO (which is acetone, but that's 58). Wait, no. Maybe the fragment is a CH2CO+ group. Let me compute: CH2CO+ would be (12*2) + (2*1) + 16 = 24+2+16=42. Not 45. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a CH2O group. CH2O has molecular weight 30. Not 45. Wait, 45 could be (CH2)2O. That would be (12*2)+(2*2*1)+(16)=24+4+16=44. Close, but not 45. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something else. Wait, another possibility: 45 could come from a fragment like CH2COOH, but that's more than 45. Or perhaps it's a group like COOCH3, but that's 60. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible formulas given: the options are C6H12O, C6H10
