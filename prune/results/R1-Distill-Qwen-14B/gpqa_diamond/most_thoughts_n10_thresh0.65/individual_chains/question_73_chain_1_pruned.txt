Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds... that means I have to use special relativity equations, right?

The problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, astronaut A is 2m at 0.6c, and astronaut B is 3m at 0.5c. Wait, but the question is about their relative speed and the total energy. 

First, I think I should tackle the relative speed. I remember that in relativity, you can't just subtract speeds like in classical mechanics. The formula for relative velocity is a bit different. Let me think. Oh right, the formula for the relative velocity u' when two objects are moving at velocities u and v relative to each other is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²))

Wait, but wait. Which way is the relative speed? So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, from A's frame, what's B's speed? Or from B's frame, what's A's speed? Oh, right, because velocity is relative. So let me pick one frame. Let's say we're calculating the speed of B as seen from A's frame. Or maybe the other way around. Oh, but the problem says "relative speed," which is the same regardless of direction because it's just the magnitude. So I can compute one and take the absolute value.

So, let me set u as 0.6c (A's speed) and v as 0.5c (B's speed). Wait, no, in relativity, the velocity addition formula is from one frame to another. So if frame S is the rest frame of astronaut A, and frame S' is moving at u = 0.6c relative to S, then the speed of B in S' would be (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²). Wait, but wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Actually, the formula for the relative speed when object B is moving at v and object A is moving at u is given by:

v_rel = (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²))

Wait, but in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6
