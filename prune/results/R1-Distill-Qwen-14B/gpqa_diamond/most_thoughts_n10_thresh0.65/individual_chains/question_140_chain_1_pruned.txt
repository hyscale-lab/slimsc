Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, let's read through the question carefully.

So, the question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Oh, and there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I think I'll figure out what each part is referring to.

Starting with the reaction between X and Y. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the molecule must be something like H2O, NH3, or CH4? Wait, no, because H2O has 2 protons and 2 neutrons in each molecule? Wait, no, the molecule as a whole. Wait, no, the molecule's atoms. Let me think again.

Wait, each molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. So, for example, if it's a molecule of H2O, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (if H-1), while O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. But the entire molecule? Or each atom within the molecule?

Wait, the question says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So I think it's that the molecule's total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons. Let's say W is H2O. H2O has 2 H atoms (each with 1 p) and 1 O (8 p). So total protons: 2+8=10. Neutrons: each H has 0, O has 8, so 8. So 10 protons and 8 neutrons. Not equal. So that's not it.

Another option: maybe CO2? Let's see. C has 6 protons, O has 8 each. So CO2: 6 + 2*8 =22 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8 each. So 6 + 2*8 =22. So protons equal neutrons. Oh, wait, that's 22 each. So CO2 would fit. But wait, what's the reaction here?

Wait, but what else? Maybe NH3? Let's see: N has 7 p, H has 1 each. So NH3: 7 + 3*1 =10 p. Neutrons: N has 7 (since N-14 is common), H has 0. So 7. So 10 p vs 7 n. Not equal. So doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the gas is CH4? Let's calculate. C has 6 p, H has 1 each. So 6 +4=10 p. Neutrons: C has 6, H has 0. So 6. 10 p, 6 n. Not equal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe something else. Oh, maybe CO. So C has 6 p, O has 8 p. Total p: 6+8=14. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8. So 6+8=14. So protons and neutrons both 14. So CO would fit. Wait, but is CO a common gas released in such reactions? Maybe, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Wait, another thought: He (helium) has 2 p and 2 n. So He would fit. But that's a noble gas, maybe not the product of an acid-base reaction or something else.

Wait, but the reaction is violent between X and Y, so maybe it's a strong reaction, like an acid reacting with a carbonate or something. Hmm.

Wait, the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B has a melting point near 277 K. Let me check: 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. So what solid has a melting point around 4Â°C
