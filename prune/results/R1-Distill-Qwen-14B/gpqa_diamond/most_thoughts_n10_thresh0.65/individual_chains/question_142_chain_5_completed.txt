Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about the density matrix of a qubit. Hmm, I remember that the density matrix is used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states. But wait, this question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit fuzzy on that part.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me think about what this represents. Oh, right! This looks like a classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. Because each term has a coefficient of 1/2 when multiplied by 1/2 outside, so each term contributes 1/2 to the density matrix. So ρ is a mixed state, specifically a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

Wait, but what's the geometrical position? I'm trying to recall about the Bloch sphere representation. I remember that pure states are represented as points on the surface of the Bloch sphere, while mixed states are inside. The density matrix for a pure state can be written as |ψ><ψ|, and for a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture.

The general form of a single qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in three-dimensional space. Oh, right! Because the Pauli matrices correspond to the x, y, z components. So if r is (x, y, z), then that formula represents the density matrix in terms of that vector.

In the given ρ, let's compute it. So ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let's expand |0><0|. The |0> state is (1,0) in the computational basis, so |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (1/2) * I, since I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

So ρ equals (I)/2. Now, using the general form, (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2 when r·σ is zero. So r·σ must be zero. That implies that r is the zero vector (0,0,0). Because if r is zero, then the entire term is zero.

Therefore, the geometrical position in the Bloch sphere is r=(0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically a completely mixed state for a single qubit. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is a vector in three-dimensional space. For the given \(\rho\), expanding \(\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right|\) and \(\left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right|\) shows that their sum is the identity matrix \(I\). Thus, \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), which implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This means \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).

Therefore, the geometrical position of this density matrix in the Bloch sphere representation is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). Among the options provided, the correct answer is:
