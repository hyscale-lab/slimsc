Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me try to think this through. 

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So any changes in the Sun's core would take that long to be observed here. But neutrinos move at nearly the speed of light, so they wouldn't be delayed. So if the pp-III stopped, the neutrinos we detect now would be from before the stoppage, right?

But wait, the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux ratio F1/F2.

I remember that the pp chain is responsible for a lot of the Sun's energy, and the pp-III branch is part of that. The pp chain produces neutrinos through the proton-proton reactions. Specifically, the main pp reaction (pp-I) produces a positron and two neutrinos, but the pp-II and pp-III branches are part of that too. 

Wait, how do the neutrino energies relate to the reactions? The main neutrinos from the Sun are the electron neutrinos, and their energies are determined by the reactions. The pp chain produces lower energy neutrinos, in the MeV range, I think. Like, around
