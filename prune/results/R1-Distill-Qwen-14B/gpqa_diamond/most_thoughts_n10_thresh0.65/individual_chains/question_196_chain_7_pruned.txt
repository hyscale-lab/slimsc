Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. The setup is a 1D oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, so F = -kx. We need to find v_max, the maximum speed.

Wait, in the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², so the maximum speed v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m), right? That's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so things are different.

In special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore because as speeds approach c, the relativistic effects become significant. The total energy of a relativistic particle is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But here, we're dealing with an oscillator, so the total energy should be the sum of kinetic and potential, but even that gets a bit tricky.

Wait, in the classical case, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential, which is (1/2)kA² for both. So in that case, the maximum kinetic energy is (1/2)kA², leading to v_max as I thought. But in relativity, the energy isn't split into KE and PE the same way.

Wait, maybe
