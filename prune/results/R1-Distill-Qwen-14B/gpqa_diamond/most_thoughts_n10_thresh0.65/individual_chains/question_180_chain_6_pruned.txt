Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me think. The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs, right?

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system. Oh wait, the particles must be arranged in some way, but maybe the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, which is 2 meters. So the 12 charges are each 2m away from the 13th which is fixed at P.

Wait, but the problem says it's an isolated system, so the charges can't move except as constrained. So their positions must be fixed except for the 12 at 2m distance, but wait, the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So does that mean all 12 are located on a sphere of radius 2m around P? Or maybe they're arranged in some other way, but each is 2m away from P.

But wait, in terms of potential energy, I think I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair of charges. Because potential energy in a system of point charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P. The other 12 are each at a distance of 2m from P. So each
