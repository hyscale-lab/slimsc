Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question gives the density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including both the state and any possible statistical mixture. 

Wait, what does the density matrix look like for a qubit? Oh right, a qubit can be represented as a vector in a 2D Hilbert space. The standard basis states are |0> and |1>, which correspond to the vectors [1; 0] and [0; 1] respectively. 

So, the density matrix ρ here is the average of |0><0| and |1><1|. Let me write this out. Each term |0><0| is a matrix with a 1 in the (0,0) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has a 1 in (1,1). So adding them together would give a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal. But then it's multiplied by 1/2, so each diagonal element becomes 1/2.

So ρ is a 2x2 matrix:
[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Wait, but what about the geometry here? I remember something about the Bloch sphere. Oh right, any single-qubit state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. For a pure state |ψ>, the density matrix is |ψ><ψ|, which lies on the surface of the Bloch sphere. But when you have a mixed state, like a classical mixture of states, the density matrix lies inside the Bloch sphere.

In this case, the density matrix ρ is a diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal. That's equivalent to the completely mixed state for a qubit. So where is that on the Bloch sphere?

The Bloch vector r for a density matrix is given by the expectation values. For a qubit, the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space. So if I rearrange that, I can find r by looking at the off-diagonal terms and the diagonal terms.

Wait, the diagonal terms of ρ are (1/2
