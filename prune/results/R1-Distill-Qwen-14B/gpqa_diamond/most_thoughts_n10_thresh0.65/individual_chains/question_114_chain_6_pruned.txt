Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Let me think through this step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, what's happening here? I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's usually via a nucleophilic addition, right? So butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN is providing the cyanide ion as a nucleophile. But maybe the reaction isn't straightforward because typically, the cyanide would add to the carbonyl, forming some kind of cyanohydrin.

Wait, but in the product, there's a hydroxyl group and a nitrile attached to the same carbon. So that's exactly what a cyanohydrin formation looks like. The cyanide adds to the carbonyl carbon, the oxygen becomes an -OH group, and the other part becomes the nitrile group. But how does this happen? I think the mechanism involves the cyanide attacking the carbonyl, forming an intermediate which then gets protonated. Oh wait, but here, maybe the NaCN is acting as a source of CN- and the reagent A is a proton source or something else.

Wait, no, but in the reaction conditions, sometimes when you form a cyanohydrin, you use an acid as a catalyst. Because the carbonyl is activated by protonation, making it more electrophilic. So A might be an acid like H3O+ or something else.

So looking at the options, the first part of the reactions uses A as either H3O+ or NaHSO3. So for the first reaction, the reagent is probably H3O+ because that's a typical acid catalyst. Because H3O+ would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic towards the cyanide attack.

Let me think about the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. And when it reacts with B (in the presence of H2O), it becomes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile group (-CN) is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). So what reagents are used for oxidizing nitriles to carboxylic acids?

I remember that the typical reagents for oxidizing nitriles are strong oxidizing agents. For example, KMnO4 under acidic or basic conditions, or maybe other oxidizing agents like H2O2 with a catalyst. Wait, but the problem states that reagent B is used with H2O. Oh, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction. Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to form different products. 

Wait, in acidic conditions, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids. In basic conditions, they hydrolyze to amines or ammonium salts, but under strong acidic conditions, you get the acid. So, if the nitrile is in a molecule that already has a hydroxyl group, which is the case here, maybe the nitrile is being hydrolyzed.

Wait, but the product is a carboxy
