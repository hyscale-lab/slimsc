Okay, so I have this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to break it down.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I remember that the metric describes the geometry of spacetime, and in this case, it seems to be for a two-dimensional space since there are only dx and dy terms.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature, right? Or maybe it's a term used in some specific context. Alternatively, I think a pseudosphere might be a two-dimensional surface embedded in three-dimensional space, but in this case, maybe we're dealing with some sort of 2D hyperbolic space.

Looking at the metric, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So 4 is 2 squared, which is r=2. So the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which would be zero when x² + y² =4. That suggests that the radius here is 2 because when x² + y² =4, the denominator becomes zero, so the metric blows up. So the region of valid coordinates is where x² + y² <4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, but the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). That looks similar to the metric of a hyperbolic space. The standard Poincaré disk model for hyperbolic geometry has a metric like (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk. Comparing that to our given metric, perhaps it's in similar form, but scaled differently.

Wait, the given metric is for two dimensions, so it's a 2D hyperbolic space. So the area of a pseudosphere in this context might refer to the area of the hyperbolic plane, but that's an infinite area. But wait, the options suggest a finite answer, so maybe I'm off track.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about a two-dimensional surface with this metric and what its area is. But pseudosphere of radius 2—what does that mean?

Wait, in the Poincaré disk model, the radius of the disk is R, and the curvature is related to R. The metric is usually written
