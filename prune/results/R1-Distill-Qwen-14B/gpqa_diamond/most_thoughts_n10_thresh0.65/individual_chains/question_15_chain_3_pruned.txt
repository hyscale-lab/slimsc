Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter. So Planet_1's orbital period is P1, and Planet_2's is 3P1. Both have circular orbits, so that's good because eccentricity might complicate things, but here it's circular.

The stars: Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting because usually more massive stars are larger, but maybe Planet_1's star is evolved or not. Oh, wait, the question says the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, so Planet_1's host is not evolved but more massive. So their radii are the same. So R1 = R2, where R1 is Planet_1's star radius, R2 is Planet_2's.

Transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, I think. Wait, more precisely, the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by another factor related to the orbital distance.

Wait, I remember the formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / R_s), but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk, multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet transits. 

Wait, the geometric probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (e sin i)), but wait, no, for circular orbits, e is zero, so that's not right. I think the actual geometric probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (a cos i)) )? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Let me correct myself. The geometric probability for a planet to transit is (R_p + R_s) / a, but that's not quite right either. Alternatively, I think the geometric probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability
