Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I know that luminosity is related to a star's radius and temperature. The formula I remember is Luminosity (L) equals 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh right, and that's the black body radiation formula.

So the problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Wait, but I'm not sure how mass relates here. Hmm. I think mass might not directly affect luminosity, unless we're considering other factors like if the stars are of different types (like main sequence stars where mass relates to luminosity), but the question says to assume they radiate as black bodies. So maybe the mass part is a red herring, or perhaps it's used in another way. Wait, but the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Oh, wait—radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight, right? But how does that tie into the problem?

Wait, the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because T = b / λ_max. So T1 = T2. Oh, that's a crucial point.

So, if both stars have the same temperature, then we can calculate their luminosities. Since L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is the same for both, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)². Because T cancels out since they're equal. So R1 is 1.5 R2. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. Oh, that would be option A, which is ~2.25. But wait, the options have A as 2.25, but let's make sure I'm not missing anything.

Wait, but wait a minute—the problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect things? Hmm. Oh wait! Because if a star is moving towards or away from us (radial velocity), there's a Doppler shift in the observed wavelengths. But the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed wavelengths are the same, which would imply that the Doppler shift affects the peak emission.

But wait, wait. The peak wavelength emission of each star is determined by their temperature. If the stars have the same T, then their intrinsic peak wavelengths are the same. But when we observe them, if they
