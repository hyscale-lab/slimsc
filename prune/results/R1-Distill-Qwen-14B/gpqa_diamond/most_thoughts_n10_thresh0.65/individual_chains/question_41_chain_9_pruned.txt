Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but let me think this through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer.

Wait, the options are given as A, B, C, D. Hmm. I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, but the glass is moving. Does that affect the speed of the light as observed?

I'm a bit confused. I think there's a thing called the Doppler effect when dealing with moving sources or observers, but that's usually for sound. Does it apply to light too? Or maybe it's about relativistic velocities here? But the problem doesn't specify that v is a significant fraction of c, so maybe we're dealing with non-relativistic speeds.

Wait, no, the glass is moving, but the light is in the medium. So the speed of the light within the glass is normally c/n, regardless of the glass's motion, right? Because the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties, not on the medium's velocity through the lab frame. Or does it?

Wait, no, that's when the medium is at rest. What if the medium is moving? Because the glass is moving, does that change the speed of light as observed from the lab?

Alternatively, maybe I should think about
