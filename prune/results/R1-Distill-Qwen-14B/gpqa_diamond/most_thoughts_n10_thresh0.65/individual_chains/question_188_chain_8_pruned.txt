Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using a specific formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Let me think about what I know.

Rhombohedral crystal systems have all sides equal, but the angles are not necessarily 90 degrees. Oh wait, in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral structure with a = interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, rhombohedral usually has a, b, c equal but maybe not... Wait, no, in a rhombohedral system, all edges are of equal length 'a', and all angles are equal. So yeah, a, b, c are all 10 Angstrom in this case.

The formula for interplanar distance (d) is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (2hk cos α) - (2hl cos β) - (2kl cos γ) ) ), but wait, I think I might be mixing up the formula. Alternatively, I remember that for a general crystal system, the formula is d_{hkl} = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )) ). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe it's (h² + k² + l²) - (hk
