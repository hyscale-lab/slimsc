Okay, so I need to tackle this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually an enolate ion, right?

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each being a different reaction. I'll need to figure out the products for each and then match them with the options given.

Let's start with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. I think the structure of this is a substituted acrylate with a p-tolyl group. So the acrylate is CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl) connected to an ester group (methyl).

In a Michael addition, the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. So the enolate would deprotonate the malonate to form an enolate, which then attacks the acrylate.

So the acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl)-O-Me. The β-carbon is the CH2=CH- part. Wait, no, the α is the carbonyl adjacent. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the carbonyl is at carbon 3. So the β is at carbon 1 (the CH2 part next to the double bond).

Wait, maybe I should draw it out. The acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me. The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the carbonyl is at carbon 3. So the β position is the CH2 on carbon 1. So the nucleophile (enolate from malonate) will attack the β carbon (CH2 part).

The enolate from dimethyl malonate would have a negative charge on the alpha position. When it attacks, it adds to the β carbon of the acrylate. So the malonate's enolate adds to the CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me.

Wait, but malonate is CH2(COOR)2. When deprotonated, the enolate would be at the central carbon. So the enolate would attack the β carbon (CH2) of the acrylate, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond.

So the product would be a combination of the two. Let me think about the connectivity. The enolate (from malonate) will add to the β position, so the structure becomes attached to the acrylate.

Wait, after adding, the product would have the dimethyl malonate's part connected to the acrylate. So the acrylate's CH2 would be connected to the malonate's CH(COOEt)2.

So
