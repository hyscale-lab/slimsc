Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

Alright, the first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. Wait, that's the same carbon where the ketone was. So, ketone to something else... Oh, wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction.

NaCN is a nucleophile. In a ketone, the carbonyl group is a good electrophile. So maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, under what conditions does that happen? Oh right, the formation of cyanohydrins. Cyanohydrin formation is when a ketone reacts with CN- to form a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group on the same carbon.

But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so the product would have the OH and CN on the same carbon as the carbonyl. So, the reaction is adding CN- to the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydrin. That reaction usually requires an acid catalyst. Oh, because the acid helps in protonating the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, so the CN- can attack.

So in the first step, the reagent A would be an acid. Options for A are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid (like HCl or H2SO4 in aqueous solution), while NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and also HSO3^- which is a weaker acid.

So if the first reaction uses NaCN and an acid, which one would it be? Well, for cyanohydrin formation, you need an acid catalyst. So either H3O+ or HSO3^- would work. But wait, in the options, A could be H3O+ (like option A or B) or NaHSO3 (options C and D). NaHSO3 would supply H+ and HSO3^- as the
