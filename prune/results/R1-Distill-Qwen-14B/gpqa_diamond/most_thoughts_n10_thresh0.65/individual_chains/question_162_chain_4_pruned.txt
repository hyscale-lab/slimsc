Okay, so I've got this question about a pseudosphere and calculating its area using a given metric. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? But wait, how do I approach this with the given metric?

The metric provided is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Oh wait, that looks like it's in 2D, maybe using coordinates x and y. So perhaps this is a 2-dimensional space, and the metric is defined in terms of these coordinates.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. I remember that for a pseudosphere, which is a surface in 3D, the area is given by something like 4πr², but wait, pseudospheres are hyperbolic. Oh wait, no, the standard pseudosphere is a surface of revolution, but perhaps the area is calculated differently.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle (which would correspond to a sphere in spherical geometry) would be different. But wait, this is a 2-dimensional space, so the area of a "pseudosphere" here might be similar to the area of a sphere but in hyperbolic space.

Wait, wait, the metric given here looks like it's in conformal form. Because ds² is expressed as E(dx² + dy²), where E is a function of x and y. So maybe this metric is conformally flat, which could imply that it's easier to compute areas in this coordinate system.

The area element in such a metric would be E dx
