Okay, so I've got this question about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Hmm, let's see. The options are four different chemical formulas. I'll need to go through each clue step by step.

First, the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups. Like alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a broad peak because of the -OH. But another peak at 1700 and 1650. Oh, those are important. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to carbonyl groups. Maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. The 1650 cm^-1 could be another carbonyl, but maybe from a conjugated system, like an aromatic ring or maybe an amide? But wait, the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not an amide.

Wait, the 1700 is higher than 1650. So maybe the 1700 is an ester or ketone, and 1650 could be an aromatic ring because of conjugation. Or maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl in an aromatic system, like in an aromatic ester or ketone.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means they are on a double bond, so the compound has some unsaturated structure, like an alkene. So the molecule has a double bond. That might also affect the carbonyl absorption if it's conjugated.

The mass spectrum has a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about possible ions. The molecular ion would break down into fragments. For example, in an ester, a common fragment is the cleavage of the ester group. For example, in an ester like R-O-CO-R', the loss of the R-O group would give a fragment with the CO-R' part. Wait, but 45 is a specific mass. Let me think of the possible fragments.

The formula of the options are all C6H something O something. Let's see the molecular formulas:

A) C6H12O2
