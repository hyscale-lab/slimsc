Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

Alright, the question is about a star's photosphere and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. I remember that the photosphere is the visible outer layer of a star, and dark spots are cooler regions on its surface. 

The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, but when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, wait. No, waitâ€”hold on. I think I might have misread that. Wait, the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So, the star's average temperature is lower because spots are cooler. But wait, how does that work exactly? Because spots are cooler regions but the rest is hotter?

Wait, no, probably the star's overall emission is lower when spots are present. But in this scenario, when the spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Hmm, but wait, in reality, the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So maybe the star's average temperature is dropping because the spots are making a significant portion of the surface cooler. But in this problem, the Teff is given as 5500 K when spots are present. So the star's overall emission is now lower.

But the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels when spots are present versus when they are not. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when there are spots, the ratio is lower. The problem asks for the factor by which this ratio changes. So, the factor is the ratio when no spots (normal state) divided by the ratio when spots are present.

Wait, the ratio of level 1 to level 2 (n1/n2) is decreasing when the star has spots. So normal ratio is higher, spot ratio is lower. So the factor is (n1/n2)_normal / (n1/n2)_spots.

But why would the ratio change?
