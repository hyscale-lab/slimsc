Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, so that would make it Li-6, right? Because Li typically has 3 protons, and with 3 neutrons, the mass number is 6.

So, I need to find the energy of the ion. But wait, in particle accelerators, the energy is usually given as the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. I think RHIC's energy refers to the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, no, actually, I remember that in high-energy physics, when they talk about the energy of a particle in a collider, it's often the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy plus kinetic. So I have to be careful here.

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0*c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The speed v is given as 0.96c, so let's compute gamma first.

Calculating gamma:

v = 0.96c
v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 0.28.

Gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, 0.28 is exactly 7/25, so 1/(7/25) is 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the nucleus is Li-6. The atomic mass of Lithium-6 is needed. I think the atomic mass unit (u) is involved here. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus can be found using the periodic table. The atomic mass of Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but wait, that's for Li-7, I think. Wait, no—Li has several isotopes. Li-6 has a mass of around 6.015 atomic mass units, maybe? Let me think. Oh wait, the exact value might be crucial here. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and 6 nucleons in total.

So the mass of the nucleus is m = (3 * m_p) + (3 * m_n). But wait, wait,
