Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ℏ/2π) for the uncertainty product. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation is often presented as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that's the key.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the two states won't be distinguishable because the uncertainty in the energy would be larger than the difference, making it impossible to tell them apart. 

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. Oh, wait, the lifetimes are the lifetimes of the states. So, each state has a certain lifetime, and from that, we can calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state.

Wait, but wait. The energy uncertainty for each state is related to its lifetime. The formula I remember is ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt), where Δt is the lifetime of the state. Because the lifetime is the time during which the system is in that state before it decays or changes. So if a state has a longer lifetime, the energy uncertainty is smaller, meaning the energy is more precisely known.

So, for each state, the energy uncertainty would be ΔE1 = ħ/(2Δt1) and ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt2). But wait, maybe we're considering the uncertainty in the energy measurement, so the energy difference between the two states must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, or something like that.
