Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me think. I've studied titration before, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem says that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. They're asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I guess I need to calculate both pH values and match them.

Alright, first, let's recall what happens when you dilute a solution. The concentration of the acid will decrease because you're adding more solvent. Oh right, using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. 

So the initial volume is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) and concentration 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). Let me calculate the new concentration.

M1 = 0.05 M, V1 = 0.02 L, V2 = 0.04 L.

M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid solution is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid initially present. Let me find out how much NaOH is needed for that.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. Let's find the volume needed for equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M * V = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Because volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). Wait, no—wait, wait. Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³, right? So 0.04 L * 0.025 M = 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 moles. Volume of NaOH needed: moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

But wait, the problem mentions 25% titration. So at 25% of the equivalence point, that's 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. But wait—if the equivalence point is 10 cm³, 25% is 2.5 cm³. So, let's note that.

Now, let's tackle each part: first, the pH at 25% titration, and then at equivalence.

Starting with 25% titration. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form acetate ions.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 moles. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH. So, the moles of CH3COOH remaining are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 moles.

But wait, after adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the total volume of the solution is 40 cm³ +
