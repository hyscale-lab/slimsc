Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking, what is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab?

Wait, since the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction, I think we're dealing with some kind of relative velocity situation. But I'm a bit fuzzy on how the index of refraction and motion affect this. Let me think.

I remember from school that the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So in the glass, the speed of light should be 1/n, since c is 1 here.

But wait, the glass is moving. So the speed observed in the lab frame would be the speed of the light in the medium plus the speed of the medium itself? Or is it more complicated than that? Oh right, because of relativity, velocities don't just add up that simply when you're dealing with significant speeds. But wait, the problem doesn't specify if v is small compared to c, so maybe we can ignore relativistic effects and just use Galilean addition.

Galilean addition says that the velocity of an object in a moving medium is the velocity of the medium plus the velocity of the object relative to the medium
