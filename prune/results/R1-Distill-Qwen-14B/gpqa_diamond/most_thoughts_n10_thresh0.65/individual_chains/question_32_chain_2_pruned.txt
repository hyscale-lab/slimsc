Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, but I'm not super familiar with the specifics.

Wait, the nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. So Li is lithium. Let me think, lithium typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make it lithium-6 because 3 protons +3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6. So the mass of the nucleus would be based on the mass of lithium-6.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. Since the speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty close to the speed of light, relativistic effects are definitely important here. I remember that in relativity, the total energy is given by gamma times the rest mass energy.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. V is 0.96c. So v squared over c squared is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Subtract that from 1: 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 (because 0.28 squared is 0.0784). So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me make sure: 1 divided by 0.28 is indeed about 3.5714. So gamma is roughly 3.5714.

But wait, I should calculate it more precisely. Let me do the steps again. 

v = 0.96c → (v/c)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - (v/c)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly because 0.28*0.28=0.0784.

So gamma = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... Let me double-check: 1 divided by 0.28. 0.28 * 3 = 0.84, 0.28 * 3.5 is 0.98, so 3.5714 is correct.

Now, the energy of the nucleus is gamma multiplied by its rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is m*c². So I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, but wait. The nucleus is made of protons and neutrons. Each proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c², and each neutron is about the same, around 939 MeV/c². But wait, the exact masses might matter here. Alternatively, sometimes people use the atomic mass unit, but since the question is in GeV, I'll stick with MeV and then
