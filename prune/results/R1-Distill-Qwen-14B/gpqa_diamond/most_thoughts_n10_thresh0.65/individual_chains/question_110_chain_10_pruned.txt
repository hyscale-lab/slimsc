Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these instruments have different capabilities, especially regarding the brightness of the stars they can observe. 

The question gives me five stars with various parameters. I need to figure out for each star whether it's bright enough to be seen by both spectrographs. Let me go through each star step by step.

First, I should probably recall the key points. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, the question says "brighter than 17 mag." Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. Oh right, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So ESPRESSO can see stars down to about 17 mag. Because lower magnitude numbers are brighter, right? So if a star is brighter (lower magnitude), it's easier to see. So stars with V â‰¤17 are observable by ESPRESSO.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, the apparent V magnitude should be less than or equal to 16 mag. Because anything brighter (lower mag) than 16 is okay.

Wait, no, wait. The wording is: "stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait. Oh, no
