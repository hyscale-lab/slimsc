Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem involves two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the given options. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (with H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. I think I'll tackle each reaction separately.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is methylacetone) reacting with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butanone reacting with cyanide. Oh right, I think this is a nucleophilic substitution or addition reaction. But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. So, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (like from NaCN), it's probably a nucleophilic addition. In ketones, the carbonyl group is attacked by the nucleophile. So the mechanism would involve the cyanide adding to the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin.

So the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, suggests that the cyanide added to the carbonyl, and then the oxygen got a proton, leading to the hydroxy group. Wait, but the structure: the butanenitrile part and the hydroxy on the same carbon. So that makes sense for a cyanohydrin formation.

So the reagents involved in the first step are NaCN (which provides CN-) and some acid. Because I remember that the formation of cyanohydrins typically uses an acid catalyst. Like H3O+ or maybe something else. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, and after some steps, we get the product.

So for reagent A, it's probably H3O+ or another acid. Looking at the options, A is either H3O+ in options A and B, or NaHSO3 in C and D.

Wait, but wait. Another
