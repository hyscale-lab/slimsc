Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to work through it. 

The question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I think Li is lithium, right? So, lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So X is Li-6 or something like that. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

Wait, but when they talk about the energy of the collider, I think they mean the total energy per ion. So each ion is accelerated to a certain energy. The formula for relativistic energy is gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But I need to find that energy given the speed is 0.96c.

Right, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that first. v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². So 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 0.28 is 28/100, which is 7/25. So 1/0.28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714. Now, the energy is gamma * m0 * c². But wait, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. What's the mass of a Li-6 nucleus? The mass number is 6, so approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). But I need to convert that into kilograms or use it in a way that works with the units given.

Wait, I remember that 1 u is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Alternatively, I can use the energy in terms of u, but perhaps it's easier to compute using the rest mass energy in GeV.

Wait, the rest mass energy m0c² for one u is about 931.5 MeV. Because I remember that 1 u ≈ 931.5 MeV/c², so when you multiply by c², you get 931.5 MeV. So for 6 u, it's 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is 5.5
