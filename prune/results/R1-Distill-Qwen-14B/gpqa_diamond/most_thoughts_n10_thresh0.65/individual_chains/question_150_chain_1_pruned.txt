Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it undergoes a series of reactions. I need to figure out what the final product is.

Hmm, the reagents are: first, NaNO2 and HCl. Then H2O, followed by aqueous KOH and heat.

Let me start by analyzing the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H).

I remember that a triplet around 9.7 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So that's one group.

Looking at the other protons: the 6.98 and 6.51 as doublets each suggest two protons each. That might be from two aromatic rings, perhaps para-substituted. Because in para substitution, each set of protons would be a doublet. Wait, but if it's para, the coupling is usually with two adjacent protons. Or wait, maybe each is a substituent on a benzene ring and they are in a trans configuration or something.

The 6.27 peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad singlet could be an enol proton or maybe some exchangeable protons like an -OH group. But wait, if it's an enol, that's when a proton is alpha to a carbonyl group. Or maybe it's a di-substituted aromatic ring with some substituents causing the protons to be equivalent and perhaps deshielded.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That usually suggests something like a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom or group. Maybe an oxygen adjacent, like an OCH2 group. Or perhaps it's adjacent to a carbonyl? Wait, 3.66 is a bit lower than typical OCH3 (which is around 3.3), but maybe it's OCH2.

Putting this together, the structure might have an aldehyde group (from the triplet at 9.72), two aromatic rings (from the doublets at 6.98 and 6.51), an enol group (from the 6.27), and a CH2 group next to an oxygen (3.66).

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count: aldehyde (CHO), two benzene rings (each C6H5 but maybe they are connected as substituents), and then the rest.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 =10/2=5. So five degrees: likely two benzene rings (each contributes 4, but wait, each benz
