Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the spectroscopy yet, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. We need to identify the final product from the given options. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably indicating O-H or N-H stretches. But since it's a carbonyl reaction later on, maybe it's an ester or something else. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks might be from aromatic C=C bonds or possibly conjugated carbonyls. Those could be part of an aromatic ring, so maybe the compound is an aromatic ester or a ketone.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. Let's break it down.

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a pretty high chemical shift. Broad singlet. Could be an aldehyde proton, but more likely an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid or an ester. Wait, but wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI is typically used to hydrolyze esters into carboxylic acids. Or maybe it's for elimination reactions? Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure of Compound X first.

The NMR peaks:

- 10.5 ppm (1H, broad): Maybe an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it's an acidic proton like -COOH, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton would be around 10-12 ppm, but as a broad peak. But if it's an aldehyde, maybe that's it. Alternatively, it could be an enol or something else.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is typical for an ester (about 1735-1740 for esters, but maybe lower if conjugated). Alternatively, a ketone is around 1700, but that's a bit lower. So maybe an ester?

Looking at the other peaks:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted because doublets could indicate coupling with two adjacent protons. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Also aromatic, maybe another set of protons in the ring. So, if you have two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H, that suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring with two different substituents. For example, a substituent at position 4 and another at position 1, but wait, no, maybe it's a substituent in one position and another substituent elsewhere?

Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that has two different groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene where the substituents are in the para positions. For example, maybe a substituent at position 1 and another at position 4, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group that has two different types of protons, like a vinyl group or a branched chain.

Wait, but looking at the other parts of the NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to something else. Or perhaps a CH group in a branched structure.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons, perhaps part of a CH2 next to a branching point or a carbonyl group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H as a doublet, which usually suggests a methyl group adjacent to a CH that's near something else. Wait, a doublet for 3H would be a methyl group attached to a CH which is next to another group. Like in an isobutyl group: CH(CH2CH3)2. Wait, no, an isobutyl group would have a CH with two CH2CH3 groups. Alternatively, maybe a geminal group.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet for 3H, probably a methyl group at the end of an ethyl chain. So, like CH2CH3.

Putting this together: The aromatic signals suggest a para-substituted benzene. The substituents might be an ester group and a branched alkyl group. Let me try to visualize this.

The substituent on the benzene could be an ester group, like OCO-R, but then other parts of the structure. Let's think about the aliphatic protons.

The 10.5 ppm peak is likely an aldehyde proton, but wait, if the compound is an ester, perhaps it's a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha proton to a carbonyl group. Wait, but the IR shows a strong C=O at 1720, which is more in line with an ester than a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid chloride, but the IR would have higher wavenumbers for that.

Wait, but if the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, that's typically used to hydrolyze acid chlorides to carboxylic acids, but sometimes esters as well. Or maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation for elimination. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Wait,
