Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to unpack it. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. And the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

The question states that the photospheres are in LTE, which I remember stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, in LTE, the distribution of particles (like electrons or atoms) among energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. That's the key here.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number densities of the energy levels, g is the statistical weight, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant. 

Wait, the problem says that the iron atoms are twice as excited in star_1. So for the same transition, say from a higher energy level to a lower one (but wait, the energy difference is given, so we need to be careful about which level is higher). The ratio is n_upper / n_lower. But in star_1, the excitation is higher, meaning more atoms are in the excited state compared to star_2.

Let me thinkâ€”star_1 has twice the excitation. So if we take the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) for star_1 as 2, and for star_2 as 1 (assuming star_2 is the reference), then the ratio between them would be 2/1. 

Wait no, wait. The question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So for a specific energy level, say level i, the population in star_1's photosphere is twice that in star_2's. So n_i1 = 2 * n_i2. 

But wait, I think the ratio is more about the excitation relative to another level. Maybe the question is about the ratio of populations in the same energy level between the two stars. Or is it about the excitation relative to a lower level?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is comparing the ratio of the populations of two energy levels in each star. Let me clarify: The energy difference is 1.
