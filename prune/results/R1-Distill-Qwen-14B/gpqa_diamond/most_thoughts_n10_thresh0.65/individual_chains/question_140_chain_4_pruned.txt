Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

So, the problem is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of it.

Hmm. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A to D, which are numbers like 35, 25, etc.

Let me break this down into parts. First, identify what substance X is. The hints about its analog being used as a reagent in organic chemistry make me think of something like NaOH or KOH. Wait, but wait, the first part says X incorporates a heavier isotope. So maybe it's a metal with a common isotope, but one of its elements is a heavier isotope.

The reaction with Y is violent. Let's think of common violent reactions. For example, metals reacting with acids. If Y is an acid, then X might be a metal. Let's think about metals reacting with acids to produce hydrogen gas. Oh, because the gas W has equal protons and neutrons. Wait, the same number of neutrons and protons in the moleculeâ€”so the molecule must be H2, because each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. Wait, but how? Or maybe it's another gas. Alternatively, maybe it's H2O? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, if W is a gas with the same number of protons and neutrons in each molecule. Let me think: possible molecules. Let's see, for a molecule, each atom contributes. If the molecule is H2, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So each H has same number, but the molecule has 2 atoms. So total protons: 2, neutrons: 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Wait, wait, another possibility: O2? Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in the most common isotope. So O has 8 each. So the molecule O2 would have 16 protons and 1
