Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which forms complexes with metal ions. Calcium and EDTA form a complex, and the formation constant (K) tells us how strong that complex is. A high K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

So the problem is about the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex is CaY^2-, where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion. The dissociation would be something like:

CaY^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + Y^4-

The formation constant Kf is given, but wait, K for the complex is the formation constant, right? So K = [Ca^2+][Y^4-]/[CaY^2-]. Alternatively, sometimes people use K as the dissociation constant, but I think K here is the formation constant because it's given as KCa-EDTA.

Wait, the formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the equation would be:

Ca^2+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY^2-

And Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]).

But in this problem, we're given the concentration of the complex, [CaY^2-] = 0.02 M. We need to find the concentration of Ca^2+.

So, if the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that the dissociation is minimal (because K is so large, 5e10), we can think that very little of the complex dissociates. So the concentration of free Ca^2+ and Y^4- would be small compared to the complex.

But wait, the K is 5e10, which is a huge number, implying the complex is very stable. So, the reverse reaction (dissociation) doesn't happen much. So the concentration of free Ca^2
