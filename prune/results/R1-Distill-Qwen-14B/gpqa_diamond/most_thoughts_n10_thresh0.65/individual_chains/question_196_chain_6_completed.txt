Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is the relativistic version, so I guess I have to consider effects from special relativity here.

The question is asking for the maximum speed, v_max, of the mass in such a system. The options are A through D, each with a different formula. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let's recall some basics. In a classical (non-relativistic) harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max², which gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so that might not hold anymore.

Relativistically, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² because of the gamma factor. The total energy E of a particle is gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the kinetic energy would be E - mc² = (gamma - 1) mc².

In a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. In the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic is (1/2)mv_max². But relativistically, the potential is still (1/2)kA² because it's a function of position, not velocity. However, the kinetic energy now includes the relativistic correction.

So the total energy E should be (1/2)kA² plus the relativistic kinetic energy. Wait, but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, perhaps when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x = A), all the energy is potential, and at the equilibrium point (x=0), all is kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy can't be treated the same as in the classical case.

Wait, another approach: in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the equation of motion is different. The force is F = -kx, but the momentum isn't just mv because of relativistic effects. The momentum p is gamma m v, and F is dp/dt. So F = d/dt (gamma m v).

But maybe for the energy, the total energy in the system is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. So at maximum displacement, x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. At the equilibrium point, x=0, the potential is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum.

So the total energy E is (1/2)kA², which equals the maximum kinetic energy. Wait, but in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So at maximum speed, E = (gamma - 1) mc².

So setting (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc². Let me write that equation:

(1/2) k A² = (gamma - 1) mc².

I can solve this for gamma. Let me rewrite:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

gamma = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)] = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²).

Hmm, let's square both sides to make it easier.

gamma² = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]² = 1/(1 - v_max²/c²).

So, 1/(1 - v_max²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

Taking reciprocal on both sides:

1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

Wait, no, because 1/(gamma²) would be 1 - v^2/c^2. Let me double-check. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so gamma squared is 1/(1 - v²/c²). So 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma².

So, rearranging:

v_max²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma².

Substituting gamma from earlier:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as term B for simplicity.

Wait, but wait, that's:

gamma = 1 + B, where B = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So 1/gamma² = 1/(1 + B)^2.

So v_max²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + B)^2.

Simplify the right-hand side:

1 - [1/(1+B)^2] = [ (1 + B)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + B)^2.

Expanding (1+B)^2 = 1 + 2B + B². So numerator is 1 + 2B + B² - 1 = 2B + B².

So v_max²/c² = (2B + B²)/( (1+B)^2 )

Factor numerator: B(2 + B).

Denominator: (1 + B)^2.

So v_max² = c² * [ B(2 + B) ] / (1 + B)^2.

Hmm, but B is (k A²)/(2 m c²), so let's substitute that.

B = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So 2 + B = 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [4 m c² + k A²]/(2 m c²).

Wait, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of B. Let me try to express v_max in terms of B.

v_max² = c² * [ B (2 + B) ] / (1+B)^2.

But I'm not sure if this helps. Let's rearrange v_max in terms of B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find v_max from gamma.

We have gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = 1 + B.

So gamma = 1 + B.

Expressed as:

gamma = (2 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²).

Wait, because (k A²)/(2 m c²) is B, so 1 + B = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [2 m c² + k A²]/(2 m c²).

So gamma = [2 m c² + k A²]/(2 m c²).

So 1/gamma² = [2 m c²/(2 m c² + k A²)]².

Then, v_max² = c² (1 - 1/gamma² ) = c² [1 - (2 m c²)^2/(2 m c² + k A²)^2 ].

Hmm, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the expression for velocity. Let's go back.

We have gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [ 2 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c² )

So gamma^(-1) = (2 m c²) / (2 m c² + k A² )

So 1 - v_max²/c² = 1/gamma² = [ (2 m c²)^2 ] / [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ]

Thus,

v_max² = c² [ 1 - [ (2 m c² )^2 / (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ] ]

= c² [ ( (2 m c² +k A²)^2 - (2 m c²)^2 ) / (2 m c² +k A²)^2 ) ]

Expanding numerator:

= [ (2 m c²)^2 + 2 * 2 m c² * k A² + (k A²)^2 ) - (2 m c²)^2 )

= 2 * 2 m c² *k A² + (k A²)^2

= 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4.

So,

v_max² = c² [ (4 m c² k A² + k^2 A^4 ) / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 ]

Factor numerator:

k A² (4 m c² + k A² )

Denominator: (2 m c² + k A² )².

So,

v_max² = c² [ k A² (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c² +k A² )^2.

Hmm, but this seems complicated, and perhaps not matching any of the options directly. Let's look at the options again.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Wait, let me compute 1 - 1/(something squared).

Wait, earlier I had v_max^2 = c^2 (1 - 1/gamma^2 ), where gamma is 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/ [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ] )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) )^2 ] )

Which simplifies to option D? Let me check.

Option D says:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Which is exactly what I have here. So option D.

Wait, but another option is option B, but let me look.

Option B is v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) )) 

Hmm, that seems different. So my conclusion is option D is correct.

But let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, in the beginning, I assumed the total energy is the sum of the potential and kinetic energies. But in the relativistic case, perhaps the potential energy is no longer (1/2)kA² because the force is F = -kx and the force law is relativistic. Or wait, no, the potential energy in the harmonic oscillator is derived from the force, which in the non-relativistic case is (1/2)k x². But in the relativistic case, since F = -dU/dx, and F = -kx, then U(x) would still be (1/2)k x². Hmm, wait, but relativistically, is F = -k x valid? Or does the force change because of relativistic effects?

Wait, no, the problem states it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law (F = -k x). So the force is F = -k x, as before. So the potential energy is the integral of F dx, which would be (1/2)k x², regardless of relativity considerations. So the potential energy is indeed (1/2)k A² at maximum displacement.

So at x=0, all the energy is kinetic, which is relativistic. So, total energy E is (1/2)k A², which equals the relativistic kinetic energy (gamma - 1) mc².

Wait, but wait, in the relativistic case, does the potential energy contribute to the total energy in a way that affects gamma? Or is the potential energy just (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc², which comes from the work done by the force?

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is the sum of the rest energy, potential, and kinetic.

Wait, no. The total energy E is the sum of the rest energy (mc²) plus the kinetic energy (K), plus the potential energy (U). So, E = mc² + K + U.

Wait, that might be the correct approach. Let me think again.

In the non-relativistic case, K = (1/2)m v^2 and U = (1/2)k A². So when x=0, U=0, K is maximum, and E = (1/2)k A² + (1/2) m v_max², but in that case, E is the sum of rest energy plus kinetic plus potential.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Because in the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy at x=0 is (1/2) m v_max². So the total mechanical energy is (1/2)k A² + (1/2) m v_max^2. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc².

Wait, perhaps I need to set the total energy E as the sum of the rest energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy.

Wait, but in the case of the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k x², which is a function of position. So at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero. At x=0, the potential is zero, and the kinetic is maximum.

So E = U_max + K_max.

But E is the total energy, which in relativity includes the rest energy and the kinetic energy. Wait, no, the rest energy is mc², and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So the total energy is E = gamma mc².

Wait, perhaps E = mc² + K, where K is kinetic. But K is (gamma -1) mc², so E = gamma mc².

But in the oscillator, the mechanical energy (U + K_mech) is (1/2)k A², where K_mech is the non-relativistic kinetic energy. Hmm, perhaps in relativistic cases, the K_mech is not the same as the relativistic kinetic energy. So this approach might not hold.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the system's energy as E = gamma mc², which equals the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy in the oscillator.

So at x=0, U=0, K is maximum, so E = gamma mc² = (1/2)k A² + K_mech.

But K_mech is the non-relativistic kinetic energy, which is (1/2) m v_max^2.

Wait, that might not be correct either because when considering relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc².

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me think about the conservation of energy.

In the system, the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy, the kinetic energy, and the potential energy. So E = mc² + K + U.

At x = A, the potential energy U is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy K is zero. So,

E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

At x = 0, U is zero, and K is maximum. So,

E = mc² + K_max.

Thus,

mc² + K_max = mc² + (1/2)k A² => K_max = (1/2)k A².

But wait, that's the same as the non-relativistic case. But in reality, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc², so (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which brings us back to the same equation as before.

So the maximum speed occurs when gamma is at its highest, which is when v is maximum.

So, from gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²), we have:

gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2)) )

So,

1/(sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2)) ) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me solve for v_max.

Let me denote k A²/(2 m c²) as B for simplicity.

So,

gamma = 1 + B.

So,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1/(1+B).

Square both sides:

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1+B)^2.

Rearranged:

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1+B)^2.

But B is k A²/(2 m c²).

Let me compute 1/(1+B)^2:

1/(1 + B)^2 = [2 m c²/(2 m c² + k A²)]^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A²)^2 - (2 m c²)^2 ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

Wait, wait, let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + B)^2.

1 - 1/(1+B)^2 = [ (1+B)^2 - 1 ] / (1+B)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2B + B²) - 1 = 2B + B².

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2B + B²)/(1 + B)^2.

Substitute B back in:

B = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ] / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 m c²)^2 to eliminate denominators:

Numerator: 2 * k A² * (2 m c²) + (k A²)^2.

Wait, no, that's perhaps complicating. Let me compute each part.

Let me compute numerator:

2B = 2*(k A²)/(2 m c²) = (k A²)/(m c²).

B² = (k A²)^2/(4 m² c^4).

Denominator (1+B)^2: [ (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c²) ) ]².

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A²/(m c²)) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2/(4 m² c^4) ) ]

Wait, denominator is [ (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c²) ) ]^2, which is ( (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 ) / (4 m² c^4).

So, v^2/c^2 = [ (k A²/(m c²)) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] * [4 m² c^4) / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 ]

So,

= [ (4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 ]

Factor numerator: k A² (4 m c² + k A² )

Denominator: (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how this helps. Let me think if I can simplify it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express v_max in terms of the gamma expression.

We have v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)), and gamma is (1 + B), where B is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + B)^2 )

Which is the same as option D.

Wait, looking at option D:

D) v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have.

So the correct answer would be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system's energy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Considerations**:  
   The total energy \( E \) of the system is the sum of the rest energy \( mc^2 \), the relativistic kinetic energy \( K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), and the potential energy \( U \). At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy is zero. At \( x = 0 \), the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum.

   Thus, the total energy is:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]

2. **Relating Total Energy and Gamma**:  
   The relativistic factor \( \gamma \) is defined as:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]
   At maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \), the total energy is entirely kinetic energy plus rest energy:
   \[
   E = \gamma mc^2
   \]
   Equating the two expressions for \( E \):
   \[
   \gamma mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

3. **Solving for \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \) into the expression for \( \gamma \), we solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]
   Squaring both sides:
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2
   \]
   Rearranging:
   \[
   1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]
   \[
   v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option D**:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
