Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. The question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Lithium normally has 3 protons, right? So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Wait, no, Li-6 is actually 3 protons and 3 neutrons, but wait, Li can also have 4 neutrons as in Li-7. But the question says X has 3 neutrons, so X is Li-6. That makes sense. So the mass number A is 6 (3 protons +3 neutrons).

Next, I think I need to find the energy of the RHIC when it accelerates these Li-6 nuclei to 0.96c. Energy in particle physics often refers to kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. Wait, in colliders, they usually talk about the kinetic energy, but sometimes the total energy (which includes rest mass) is what's considered. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the formulas.

The energy given in particle accelerators is typically the kinetic energy, but relativistic energy calculations involve gamma, the Lorentz factor. Oh wait, no, wait. The total energy is gamma times the rest energy. So the energy of the particle is E = gamma * m0c². But in accelerators, the energy they quote is often the kinetic energy. Wait, no, sometimes the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m0c². So I need to clarify which one the question is asking for.

The question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So I think they're asking for the total energy, which includes the rest mass. Or maybe it's the kinetic energy. Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Well, in any case, I'll proceed with the calculation and see.

So the first thing I need is the velocity v = 0.96c. The Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. Let's see, v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly. So 1/0.28 is about 3.57142857... So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a nucleus is roughly the sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons
