Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it again. Two astronauts, their masses are 2m and 3m, and they're moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that in relativity, adding speeds isn't as simple as just adding them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. Let me think about that. The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving at u and v relative to the same inertial frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Oh wait, wait, no. Because both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference, but adjusted for relativity.

So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. From the perspective of astronaut 1, what's the speed of astronaut 2? Wait, or is the other way around? Let me get it right. The problem says the relative speed—so it's the speed of one as seen from the other. So if astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then in astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) ). Let me compute that.

Wait, u is
