Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it. Alright, the problem says we have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle that's moving along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second, wave functions in quantum mechanics are usually complex, right? But the real part is a / sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. Or is it? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Oh, wait, the way it's written is as a single expression: (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So that's like a complex number where the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function should be square-integrable, meaning the integral of the absolute square over all space should be finite. Because that's the normalization condition. So, the integral of |ψ(x)|^2 dx from -infinity to infinity should equal 1. But in this problem, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Oh, wait, when they measured the position, none were found outside 1 and 3. So the wave function must be zero outside that interval, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So maybe that's just the part of the wave function where it's non-zero, between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the wave function can't just be zero outside; that's the measurement result. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, and inside that interval, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But that doesn't make sense because the wave function must be continuous. Or maybe the given wave function is only valid in the region x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. Oh, but in that case, the wave function would have to be zero outside, but the given expression isn't zero. Hmm, maybe the given expression is correct in the region where the particle exists (x between 1 and 3), and zero outside. But then the wave function inside would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, and zero otherwise.

Wait, but the wave function's modulus squared is |ψ|^2 = (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 because the real part squared plus the imaginary part squared. Because when you square a complex number, (a + ib)^2 is a^2 + b^2? Wait no, wait, no. The square of the absolute value is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So |ψ(x)|^2 = [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

But wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) ) + (-0.5)i. So the modulus squared is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2.

Wait, integrating that from x=1 to x=3 should give 1, because that's where the particles are found. But wait, the question says that when measuring, none were found outside of x=1 and x=3, which suggests that the wave function is zero outside that region. So the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere.

But the given ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, which is non-zero in that interval. So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for 1 ≤x≤3, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but wait, the normalization condition requires the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from -infty to infty to be 1. Since ψ is zero outside 1 and 3, the integral becomes the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|^2 dx = 1.

So let's compute |ψ(x)|^2:

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i

So |ψ(x)|^2 = [a / sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5)^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, that's not correct. Because |ψ(x)|² is the square of the absolute value of ψ(x). So ψ(x) is a complex number, so |ψ(x)|^2 is (Re(ψ))² + (Im(ψ))². So yes, that's (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral.

Breaking it into two parts: integral from 1 to3 of a²/(1+x) dx + integral from 1 to3 of 0.25 dx = 1.

The first integral: integral of 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3. Let me make a substitution u = 1+x, so du = dx. When x=1, u=2; when x=3, u=4. So integral from u=2 to u=4 of (1/u) du = ln(u) evaluated from 2 to4. So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first integral is a² * ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So putting it all together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that numerically.

ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.72196.

So a = sqrt(0.72196) ≈ 0.85.

Wait, but the options are given as A)1.1, B)0.85, C)0.35, D)0.6.

So 0.85 is option B. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the integral.

Wait, the integral of a^2/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 is a^2 [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a^2 ln(2), as I did before. The other part is 0.25*(3-1)=0.5.

So equation: a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1 => a² ln(2)=0.5 => a²=0.5/(ln2) ≈ 0.5 /0.6931 ≈0.7219.

sqrt(0.7219)= approx 0.85. So a is approximately 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \) for \( 1 \leq x \leq 3 \), and zero elsewhere. The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over all space equals 1. Since \( \psi(x) \) is zero outside \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \), the normalization condition simplifies to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

The modulus squared of \( \psi(x) \) is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Substituting this into the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking this into two integrals:

1. \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx \):  
   Using the substitution \( u = 1+x \), \( du = dx \), the limits change from \( x=1 \) to \( u=2 \) and \( x=3 \) to \( u=4 \). The integral becomes:

   \[
   a^2 \int_{2}^{4} \frac{1}{u} \, du = a^2 \ln(u) \Big|_{2}^{4} = a^2 (\ln(4) - \ln(2)) = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \):  
   This is straightforward:

   \[
   0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7219.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7219} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
