Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful, but let's break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure. Benzene rings with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So position numbering: let's imagine the ring. Let me sketch it mentally. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, wait. Wait, the numbering in the target is 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro? No, wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So the substituents are in the ortho, meta positions relative to each other.

But wait, wait. Let me think about the numbering. If the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3, that's three adjacent positions. So substituents are at 1, 2, and 3 in a row. So it's a meta arrangement? Or perhaps in a way that each is adjacent to two others.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible reactions. The starting material is benzene. The target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups.

The synthesis steps involve electrophilic substitution reactions. The order of adding substituents matters because each substituent directs the next substitution.

I remember that substituents can be activating or deactivating. Nitro groups are strong meta directors, deactivating. Ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an electron-donating group via the ether oxygen), so it's an ortho/para director. Tert-butyl is a bulky group, but since it's an alkyl group, it's an activating, ortho/para director.

Wait, but adding substituents in what order? Because the order will affect where the next substituents go.

Let me think about the target structure again. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, the benzene ring must have substituents in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. But that would imply adjacent positions, which is a bit tricky since in electrophilic substitution, each substituent directs the next.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that each is adjacent to the others but in a way that each substituent was added in the correct position based on the previous groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, the substituents are adjacent in a 1-2-3 arrangement around the ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 4 (nitro). But that's not
