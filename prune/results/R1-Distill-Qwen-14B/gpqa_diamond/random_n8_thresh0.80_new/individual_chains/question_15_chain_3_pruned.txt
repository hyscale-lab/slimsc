Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting in front of their stars. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things a bit.

The host stars are also different. The star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Hmm, that's interesting. So, same radius but different masses. I remember that more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe in this case, Planet_2's star is slightly evolved, which might affect its radius. Oh, wait, the question says both have the same radii. So, same size but different masses.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the higher probability of transiting. So I need to figure out which planet has a higher transit probability.

I recall that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the relative sizes of the planet's orbit and the star. Specifically, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a)^2, where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the semi-major axis (which, for circular orbits, is just the orbital radius). Wait, but wait, I think there's more to it. Oh right, the transit probability also depends on the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. Oh, right. The formula for the geometric probability is (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2), but actually, since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, R_p can be approximated as R_star. Wait, no, actually, the formula is more like the area of the star compared to the area of the planet's orbit. So the probability is roughly (R_star / a)^2 multiplied by some factor involving the inclination, but I might be mixing details.

Wait, the exact formula for the transit probability is (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + m_star / m_planet)), but no, that's not right. Alternatively, the probability is given by (R_star / a) * (1 / (sin i)), but I'm getting confused. Oh wait, no, the transit probability P is roughly
