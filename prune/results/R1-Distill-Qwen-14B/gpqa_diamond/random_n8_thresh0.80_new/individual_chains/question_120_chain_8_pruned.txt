Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, parallax is a concept I've heard about before, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think about what I know.

Parallax, if I remember correctly, is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The closer a star is to us, the larger its parallax. So the formula for parallax (plx) is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), right? Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, parallax is in arcseconds, and the distance in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax. So if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs.

Now, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniform distribution implies that the number density of stars is the same throughout space, I guess. But how does that translate when we observe their parallax?

So we're looking at how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (like per parsec of parallax) changes with plx. So for a given range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there?

Wait, let's model this. The number of stars per unit volume in space is uniform. So the number density (n) is a constant. The volume of a spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd.

But parallax plx is inversely proportional to d. So d = 1/plx. Therefore, d^2 is (1/plx)^2, and dd would be the change in d, which in terms of plx would be related to the change in plx. Let me think about that.

So, if plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. How does dd relate to dplx? Let's see, d = 1/plx → plx = 1/d. Taking derivative, d(plx) = - (1/d²) dd. So dd = - (d²) d(plx). But since d=1/plx, d² is (1/plx)^2. So, dd = - (1/(plx)^2) d(plx).

Hmm, so the number of stars in a shell with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is n * 4πd² dd. But wait, when plx increases, d decreases. So, perhaps I should express everything in terms of plx.

Let me re-express d in terms of plx. So, d = 1/plx. Then, d² = 1/(plx^2). And dd is the change in d, which is related to the change in plx. From above, dd = - (1/(plx^2)) dplx. But since we're talking about a small change in plx (dplx) leading to a small change in d (dd), the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, which makes sense.

So the number of stars in a shell with parallax plx is N = n * 4π
