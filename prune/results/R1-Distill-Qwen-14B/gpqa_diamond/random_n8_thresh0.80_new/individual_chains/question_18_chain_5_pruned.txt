Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I need to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

So, the question says that we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I'm not sure if their masses are directly relevant here. The problem seems to be more about their elemental abundances.

The data given is about their elemental ratios using the EW method. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex. And for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. 

Wait, what do these brackets mean? Oh right, [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y)_star / (n_X / n_Y)_sun )

So, for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0. That means the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Same for Star_2's [Mg/H] being 0. So Mg in Star_2 is same as in Sun compared to H.

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, n_Si_1 / n_Si_2.

Wait, no, the ratio is Star_1's silicon to Star_2's silicon. So we need (n_Si1 / n_Si2) = ?

How do I compute that? Let's see.

First, let's figure out the [Si/Fe] for Star_1. [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. That means (n_Si1 / n_Fe1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) = 10^0.3. Because [X/Y] = log10( (X/Y)_star / (X/Y)_sun )

Wait, no, [X/Y] = log10( (n_X/n_Y)_star / (n_X/n_Y)_sun )

So [Si/Fe]1 = 0.3 â†’ log( (n_Si1/n
