Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativistic mechanics, but let's try to work through it. The problem is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Alright, so the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The options give possible values for the relative speed and the total energy. Hmm.

First, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. I think it's something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Wait, wait, so if both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be (v1 - v2) divided by 1 minus (v1*v2)/(c squared). Okay, let me plug in the numbers.

So v1 is 0.6c, and v2 is 0.5c. So the numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 minus (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let's compute that denominator. (0.3c²)/(c²) is 0.3. So 1 - 0.3 is 0.7. So the relative velocity v_rel is (0.1c) / 0.7. Which is (1/7)c. Wait, 1/7 is approximately 0.1428c, so about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c.

Now, what about the total energy? I think the total energy of each astronaut includes their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy. But wait, in relativity, the total energy is given by gamma times mc squared. So for each astronaut, I need to calculate their gamma factor and then multiply by their rest mass energy.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The problem says "the total energy of the system." Since the system consists of both astronauts, I need to find the sum of their individual energies.

So astronaut 1 has mass 2m and speed 0.6c. His gamma factor is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v is 0.6c, so (v²/c²) is (0.36c²)/c² = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. The square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma for astronaut 1 is 1/0.8 = 1.25. Therefore, his energy is gamma * m_rest * c². His m_rest is 2m, so 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Similarly for astronaut 2: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. So v = 0.5c, so v²/c² is 0.25. 1 -0.25=0.75. Square root is sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.866. Gamma is 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547. So his energy is 1.1547 * 3m * c². Let me compute that. 1.1547 *3 is approximately 3.464. So about 3.464 mc².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². Which is approximately 5.96 mc².

Now looking at the options, option C has v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option B has E=4.96, which is lower. Hmm. So that would imply option C is correct.

Wait a second, but wait. Could there be another factor I'm missing? Like, do I need to consider the energy in the center-of-momentum frame or something else? I think not, because the problem just asks for the total energy of the system, which would simply be the sum of the energies of each astronaut in their respective frames. Or wait, no, because they're moving in the same direction. Wait, no, each is moving in the same direction relative to the rest frame. So in the rest frame, you just calculate each energy and add.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rest frame where one astronaut is at rest, but I don't think that's the case. The question is about the system's total energy, so sum each in their own frame. Wait, but wait, actually, the system's
