Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it. The question involves two reactions with different reducing agents, and I need to figure out the starting materials A and B that lead to specific products. 

Alright, the products given are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, looking again: the first reaction gives (R) and the second gives (S). Oh wait no, no—no, the first one is A + LiBH4, which gives (R)-4-ethyl... and the second is B + BH3, giving (S). Or wait, no, the products are the same? No, the products are the same structure but different enantiomers because of the R and S configurations. Wait, no, wait: the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but in the first case, it's R configuration, and in the second case, S.

Wait, but wait a second. Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic hemiacetal structure, right? Or wait, no, pyranone is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, so the structure is similar to a cyclic ester maybe. Wait, or is it an acetal? Hmm. So when you have a ketone group in a six-membered ring, it's a cyclic ketone. So 4-ethyl would be a substituent on the ring.

But how do you get that from the starting materials? Oh, wait, the starting material for each reaction is an ester maybe. Because LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce esters to alcohols. But wait, LiBH4 is also used for other reductions, like ketones to alcohols, but if the starting material is an ester, then LiBH4 would reduce it to an alcohol. Alternatively, BH3 is another reducing agent, often used in hydroboration reactions, but wait, for esters, maybe it's different.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think. So, in the first reaction, A is treated with LiBH4 and H+. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent—it can reduce esters, amides, ketones, etc. So if A is an ester, like an acyl ester, then LiBH4 would reduce it to a primary alcohol. Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm. Alternatively, if the starting material is a cyclic ketone itself, but that doesn't make sense because LiBH4 would reduce it to an alcohol. So maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting materials are epoxides? No, because LiBH4 usually doesn't open epoxides under standard conditions. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are hemiacetals or acetals. Hmm.

Wait, wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic hemiacetal, maybe. No, wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. So it's a cyclic ketone—like a cyclic acetal perhaps? Or maybe a cyclic ester, but more likely a ketone.
