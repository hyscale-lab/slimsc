Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, and the photospheres are in LTE, which I think means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, the question is about finding the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2.

Wait, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution. Oh right, the probability of a particle being in a certain energy state is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)). So, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels depends on temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The problem states that in star_1, the level is twice as excited as in star_2. So, the ratio N1/N2 = 2, where N1 is the population for star_1 and N2 for star_2. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around? No, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, so the population in the higher energy state is higher for star_1. So, for the same energy level, the number in star_1 is higher.

Wait, no, wait. The question says the energy difference is fixed. Let me think. Let's denote the two energy levels as E_high and E_low. The energy difference ΔE = E_high - E_low is 1.38e-23 J.

In LTE, the ratio of the populations is given by the Boltzmann factor: (N_high / N_low) = exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. No, I think the ratio is N_high / N_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Because higher energy states have lower populations. So if the energy difference is positive, the exponent is negative, making the ratio less than 1.

But in this problem, for star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So, they're in a higher energy level. So maybe N_high1 / N_low1 = 2 * (N_high2 / N_low2). Or maybe not. Wait, the question says in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Oh wait, perhaps it's the fraction of atoms in a particular energy level
