Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a Pi(+) pion is at rest and decays into a muon(+) and a neutrino. The given masses are Pi+ is 139.6 MeV and mu+ is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D with different KE values.

Wait, I remember that when a particle is at rest and decays, the energy and momentum have to conserve. Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before decay is zero, so the products must have equal and opposite momenta. Oh right, so the muon and neutrino must have the same magnitude of momentum but opposite directions.

The total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the Pi+, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino. But the neutrino is massless, right? Or does it have a rest mass? I think in these problems, neutrinos are considered massless unless stated otherwise. So the neutrino's energy would just be its kinetic energy, but wait, no—neutrinos have energy from their momentum. Wait, no—wait, the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its total energy is just the magnitude of its momentum times c squared, but since c is 1 in these units, the neutrino's energy E_nu is p*c, which for units where c=1, E_nu = p. So for the neutrino, E = p.

The muon's energy, though, is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. So E_mu = m_mu * c^2 + K_mu. But again, since c is 1, it's E_mu = m_mu + K_mu.

So the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu. Which should equal the initial energy, the rest mass of Pi+.

So, 139.6 MeV = (105.7 + K_mu) + E_nu.

But also, because momentum has to be conserved. The pion is at rest, so the total momentum after decay is zero. So the momentum of the muon (p_mu) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the neutrino's momentum (p_nu). So p_mu = - p_nu. But the magnitudes are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Wait, so the muon's momentum is p, the neutrino's is p in opposite direction. So for both particles, their energies depend on their momenta.

The energy of the muon is given by the relativistic energy formula: E_mu^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2. Since c=1, E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2. Similarly, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p_nu, because m_nu ~ 0.

So we have two equations:

1. 139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + E_nu
2. E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + (105.7
