Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a multi-step synthesis question, and I'm a bit nervous because these can get complicated. Let me take it step by step.

The starting material is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. I remember that cyclohexenone derivatives often undergo various additions and reactions. Let me think about each step.

Step one: treatment with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine. I think that's a silylation step. Silylating agents like TBDMSCl typically protect hydroxyl groups. So the hydroxyl on the cyclohexenone would be replaced with a TBS group. Since it's a ketone, the hydroxyl is a secondary alcohol, so it should react. So product 1 would have the TBS group attached where the OH was. The structure would be 4-TBS-cyclohex-2-en-1-one.

Wait, wait, the starting material is 4-hydroxy, so the silylation would protect that. So the ketone is at position 1, the double bond is between 2 and 3, I think. So product 1 is TBS-protected at position 4.

Next, product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, then benzyl bromide. Hmm, Ph2CuLi is a Gilman reagent, which is used in conjugate additions. The starting material after silylation is a cyclohexenone with the TBS group. So the conjugate addition would add a benzyl group to the alpha position.

Wait, the starting material after step 1 is 4-TBS-cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The enone system is the cyclohexenone. So when Ph2CuLi is added, it would perform a 1,4-addition. But wait, waitâ€”the enone is in 2-en-1-one position. So positions 1 (keto), 2 (double bond), 3 (CH2), 4 (TBS-O-), and so on.

In a conjugate addition, the reagent would attack the beta carbon (position 3), right? Because the alpha is position 2. Wait, no, the enone is 1-2 double bond? No, the structure is cyclohex-2-en-1-one. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the ketone is at C1. So the enone is 2-en-1-one. So the positions are 1 (keto), 2 and 3 (double bond), 4 (TBS-O-).

So when Ph2CuLi is used, it does a 1,4-addition. So the organocopper would add to the carbonyl carbon (C1), but wait, no. Wait, in a conjugate addition, the copper adds to the alpha position (C3), and the lithium ends up on C2. Then when the benzyl bromide is added, it would substitute at the other position.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The enone is in 2-en-1-one. So when Ph2CuLi does a conjugate addition, the copper would add to the alpha carbon (C3), and the lithium would be on the beta (C2). Then, the benzyl bromide, as an alkylating agent, would add to the lithium site. So the benzyl group would add to C2.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a 1,2-addition? No, I think in the case of enones, conjugate additions are more typical. So the Gilman reagent adds to C3, and the other part (Ph2Cu-) goes to C2. Then, when treated with benzyl bromide, the benzyl group would add to the copper-bearing carbon, which is C3.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure. Ok, cyclohex-2-en-1-one: the ring is six-membered, with the ketone at C1, the double bond between C2 and C3. The 4-hydroxy is at C4, which is now protected as TBS-O-.

So when Ph2CuLi is added, the organocopper (Ph2Cu-) will attack the alpha position, which is C3. So the addition would be to C3, making a new bond between C3 and the copper. The lithium would end up at C2.

Then, when benzyl bromide is added, it's a good electrophile. The benzyl group would attack the lithium center at C2, leading to substitution. So the benzyl group adds to C2. So product 2 would have a benzyl group at C2.

Wait, but the starting material had a hydroxyl at C4. So after silylation, that's now a TBS-O group. So in product 2, the structure would have a benzyl group at C2, a TBS-O group
