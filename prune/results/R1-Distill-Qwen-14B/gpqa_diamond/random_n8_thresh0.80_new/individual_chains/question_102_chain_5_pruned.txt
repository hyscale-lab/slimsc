Okay, so I need to figure out why there's no green signal when they looked under the confocal microscope. Let's start by breaking down what the experiment is about.

So, the setup is about a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. They're using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions, right? So the vector has two ORFs: ligand and receptor.

The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. The receptor has an IRES upstream, which is a type of internal ribosome entry site. IRES elements allow for the translation of a second ORF after the first in a bicistronic mRNA.

Between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I remember that loxP and lox2272 are loxP variants used in recombination. LoxP is recognized by Cre, and lox2272 is recognized by another recombinase, maybe Flp? Or is it the other way around? Wait, wait, loxP is Cre-specific, and lox2272 is Flp-specific, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, maybe they're using different systems here.

So, the vector is designed so that when Cre is present, it will recombine the loxP sites, allowing the stop cassette to be excised. So for the ligand, the stop is between ligand and mCherry, so if Cre is present, that stop is removed, allowing both ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. Similarly, for the receptor, the stop is after the receptor, so when Cre is used, that stop is removed, allowing receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but the vector is called a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So perhaps the stop cassettes are flanked by loxP and lox2272, which are different recombinase targets. So, for example, the ligand's stop cassette is between ligand and mCherry, and it's flanked by lo
