Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Let me read the question again. 

The problem says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Hmm, I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light within it as observed from outside can be affected by the medium's motion. But wait, I'm a bit confused about how exactly that works. 

I think about the basic concepts. The speed of light in a medium is generally v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But when the medium itself is moving, does that affect the observed speed? 

Wait, in special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the observer's motion. But this is about light in a medium, not a vacuum. So maybe the rules are different here. 

I also recall something about the Doppler effect when a source is moving towards an observer. But in this case, the medium itself is moving, not just the source. Hmm, not sure if that's directly applicable.

Let me think about the setup. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is towards the observer. So the glass is moving towards the observer with speed v, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass within the glass. 

Wait, from the lab frame, the light's speed in the glass would depend on the glass's motion. So the
