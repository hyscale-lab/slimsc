Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles after a pion decays. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is stationary, which probably means it's at rest when it decays. The rest masses are given: the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. I think the neutrino's mass is negligible, right? Because neutrinos are super light, almost massless. So that's something to remember.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on decay problems. I remember that in such cases, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to keep the total momentum zero. Oh wait, but the neutrino's mass is negligible. So maybe that affects how we calculate its momentum.

Wait, the mass of the neutrino is close to zero, so its energy is approximately equal to its momentum times c, but since c is a constant, perhaps we can treat it as E ≈ p for the neutrino. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think.

The system starts with the pion at rest, so initial energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy since its mass is negligible.

So, energy conservation: m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu.

But E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, units might be a bit tricky here. Alternatively, maybe in natural units where c=1, it's easier. Since the problem gives masses in MeV/c², perhaps we can set c=1 to simplify.

So, in natural units, m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV. E_pi_initial = m_pi = 139.6 MeV. E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p_nu (since m_nu is approx 0).

Since momentum is conserved, the pion is at rest, so p_mu + p_nu = 0. So p_mu = -p_nu. The magnitudes are the same, p_mu = p_nu = p.

So, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

So the equation becomes sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.

Let me write that down numerically:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)²) + p = 139.6

Hmm, this looks like an equation I can solve for p. Let me denote 105.7 as m and 139.6 as M for simplicity.

So: sqrt(p² + m²) + p = M.

Let me rearrange this. Subtract p from both sides:

sqrt(p² + m²) = M - p.

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + m² = (M - p)^2 = M² - 2 M p + p².

Simplify: the p² terms cancel out.

m² = M² - 2 M p.

Then, solving for p:

2 M p = M² - m².

So, p = (M² - m²) / (2 M).

Plugging in the numbers:

M = 139.6 MeV, m = 105.7 MeV.

M² = (139.6)^2 ≈ 139.6 * 139.6. Let me calculate that.

139^2 is 19321. 0.6^2 is 0.36. 2 * 139 * 0.6 is 166.8. So (139.6)^2 = (139 + 0.6)^2 = 139² + 2 * 139 *0.6 + 0.6² = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19488.16 approximately.

Similarly, m² is (105.7)^2. Let me compute that.

105^2 is 11025. (0.7)^2 = 0.49. 2 * 105 * 0.7 = 147. So 105.7^2 = 105^2 + 2*(105)*(0.7) + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So M² - m² is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

Then, 2 M is 2 *139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ ?

Let me compute that division.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2. Let me approximate.

279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 29.8 would be 279.2 *29.8 = ?

Wait, wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me see:

We can compute 279.2 * 29 = 8100- let's see: 279.2 *30 = 8376, so 279.2 *29 is 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

But 8315.67 is more than 8096.8. The difference is 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

So 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So p ≈ 29.783 MeV/c.

Wait, wait, more accurately:

8315.67 ÷ 279.2 = ?

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.78 = ?

Wait, let's do it as:

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

279.2 *0.78 = ?

0.78 *279.2: 279.2 *0.7= 195.44, 279.2 *0.08=22.336. Sum is 195.44 + 22.336 = 217.776.

So 29.78 *279.2 = 8096.8 + 217.776 = 8314.576.

Which is very close to 8315.67. So 29.78 gives M² -m² product of about 8314.576, which is just a bit less than 8315.67. So 29.78 gives 8314.576. The difference is 8315.67 - 8314.576 = 1.094.

So how much more do we need? Let's see, 1.094 / 279.2 ≈ 0.00392. So p ≈ 29.78 + 0.00392 ≈ 29.7839 ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Now, the momentum of the muon is about 29.78 MeV/c. The neutrino's momentum is the same, 29.78 MeV/c, but in the opposite direction.

Now, the energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute that.

First, 29.78^2: 30^2 is 900, subtract (0.22)^2 and 2*30*0.22 = 13.2. Wait, 29.78 is 30 - 0.22.

So (30 - 0.22)^2 = 30² - 2*30*0.22 + (0.22)^2 = 900 - 13.2 + 0.0484 = 886.8484.

m_mu^2 is 105.7^2 = 11172.49 as before.

So E_mu = sqrt(886.8484 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.34) ≈ ?

What's sqrt(12059.34)? Well, 110^2 is 12100, which is just a bit more than 12059.34. So sqrt(12059.34) is about 109.81 MeV.

Wait, 109.81^2 = (110 - 0.19)^2 = 110^2 - 2*110*0.19 + (0.19)^2 = 12100 - 41.8 + 0.0361 = 12058.2361. Close enough. So E_mu ≈ 109.81 MeV.

But wait, we have E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2 ) = sqrt(29.78^2 + 105.7^2) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

The neutrino's energy E_nu is p_nu = p = 29.78 MeV.

So total energy is E_mu + E_nu ≈ 109.81 + 29.78 = 139.59 MeV, which is close to 139.6 MeV. Good, checks out.

Now, the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

And the neutrino's kinetic energy is E_nu = 29.78 MeV, which is all KE since its rest mass is negligible.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check:

Option D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That looks very close to our calculations.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the p calculation.

Earlier, I had p = (M^2 - m^2)/(2M) = (139.6² - 105.7²)/(2*139.6).

Wait, is that correct?

Yes, because when we had M² - m² = 8315.67, 2M is 279.2. So 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV/c. So p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

So E_nu = p ≈ 29.78 MeV, which is the neutrino's KE, and the muon's KE is E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's very close.

Wait, but why isn't the neutrino's KE higher? Because the muon's mass is significant compared to the pion's rest mass. Hmm, but the numbers make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_mu. Let me double-check.

p = 29.78 MeV/c.

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Calculating each term:

29.78^2 ≈ 886.8,

105.7^2 = 11172.49.

Adding them gives 12059.29.

sqrt(12059.29) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So E_mu = 109.81 MeV.

Kinetic energy of muon: 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

Neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV.

So 4.11 and 29.78. The options have D as 4.12 and 29.8. Close enough, considering the approximations.

Other options:

Option B: 7.2 and 32.8. That would suggest higher KE, which doesn't fit.

Option A: 2.84 and 26.8. Lower.

Option C: 3.52 and 20.8. Hmm, not matching.

So the correct answer is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary positively charged pion, **π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν**, using conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as follows:  
- Rest mass of π⁺: \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \)  
- Rest mass of μ⁺: \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)  
- The neutrino's mass is negligible (\( m_{\nu} \approx 0 \)).

### Key Equations and Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved. Initially, the energy is just the rest energy of the pion:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = m_{\pi}.
   \]  
   The muon's energy is given by \( E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} \), where \( p_{\mu} \) is its momentum. The neutrino's energy is approximately equal to its momentum (\( E_{\nu} \approx p_{\nu} \)) since its mass is negligible.

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before the decay is zero. After the decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]  

### Solving for Momentum
From energy conservation, we have:  
\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p_{\mu} = m_{\pi}.
\]  
Let \( p = p_{\mu} \). Rearranging and squaring both sides:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = m_{\pi} - p.
\]  
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (m_{\pi} - p)^2.
\]  
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p + p^2.
\]  
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p.
\]  
Solving for \( p \):  
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 m_{\pi}}.
\]  
Substituting the given values:  
\[
m_{\pi}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2, \quad m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2.
\]  
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV/c}.
\]  

### Calculating Energies
1. **Muon's Energy**:  
   Using \( E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} \):  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2} = \sqrt{886.8484 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.34} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   The muon's kinetic energy is:  
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  

2. **Neutrino's Energy**:  
   Since \( E_{\nu} \approx p_{\nu} \), the neutrino's kinetic energy is:  
   \[
   KE_{\nu} = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \( 4.11 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. Comparing with the options:  
- **A)** \( 2.84 \, \text{MeV}, 26.8 \, \text{MeV} \)  
- **B)** \( 7.2 \, \text{MeV}, 32.8 \, \text{MeV} \)  
- **C)** \( 3.52 \, \text{MeV}, 20.8 \, \text{MeV} \)  
- **D)** \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \)  

The closest match is **Option D**.
