Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about reactions involving reducing agents and determining the starting materials based on the products and the reagents used.

Alright, the problem says a chemist did two reactions. Each reaction used a different reducing agent. The products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but their configurations are R and S respectively. The starting materials are compounds A and B, each reacting with LiBH4 and BH3, respectively, under acidic conditions.

Wait a second, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions. Oh wait, but in some cases, BH3 can also be a reducing agent, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. Oh right, BH3 is more commonly used in hydroboration-oxidation, but when it's used with something like ketones, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, no. Wait, LiBH4 is a borohydride reducing agent. It's used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but the product is a pyranone. Hmm, pyranones are cyclic ketones, right? So are they talking about reducing a carbonyl group?

Wait, but the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That structure has a cyclic ketone. So maybe the starting material is an ester or a ketone, which upon reduction gives a diol or something else. Wait, that doesn't make sense.
