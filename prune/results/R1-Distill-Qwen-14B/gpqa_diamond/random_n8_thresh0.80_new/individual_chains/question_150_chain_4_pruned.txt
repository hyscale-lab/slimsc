Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The reagents used are NaNO2 and HCl, followed by H2O, and then aqueous KOH with heat. The NMR data is provided, and the options are four different aldehydes or related compounds. I need to figure out what the final product is.

First, I'll look at the NMR data. Let's list the signals:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift. Aldehydic protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, so that's a strong hint that there's an aldehyde group here. But wait, wait, sometimes other protons like those in an aromatic ring can be deshielded, but 9.72 is more indicative of an aldehyde. So maybe this is the aldehyde proton.
  
- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. This could be aromatic protons, possibly on a substituted benzene ring. The doublet suggests coupling with one adjacent proton, so maybe para-substituted.

- 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Another set of aromatic protons. Wait, if I have two doublets each integrating for 2H, maybe they're part of two different aromatic rings? Or perhaps one aromatic ring with adjacent substituents. Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene where each pair is in a certain coupling.

- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad signals could be due to exchange with protons, like OH groups. But wait, 2H as a singlet. Maybe it's an enol proton? Or possibly two hydroxyl protons, but that's less likely because hydroxyls are usually broad singlets but as singlet of 1H each. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted aromatic with some coupling, but I'm not sure.

- 3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. This seems like a CH2 group adjacent to something electronegative. Maybe an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. Alternatively, it could be a methylene next to a carbonyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has an aldehyde group (from 9.72 ppm), a benzene ring (the 6.98 and 6.51 doublets), and another ring or substituent. The 3.66 ppm doublet might be a CH2 connected to something, maybe a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative. Let's think about the molecular formula: C8H9NO. The molecular formula can help figure out the structure. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation. For C8H9NO:

Degrees of unsaturation formula: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, more accurately, it's (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0 (since no halogens), N=1. So:

(2*8 +2 -9 -0
