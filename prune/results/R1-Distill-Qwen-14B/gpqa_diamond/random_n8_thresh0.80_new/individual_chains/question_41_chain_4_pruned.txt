Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? The speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Hmm, I'm trying to remember what I know about the speed of light and moving media. I think the key here is to consider how the medium's movement affects the observed speed of light within it.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is usually given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum and n is the refractive index. So in this case, the speed of light in the glass should be 1/n, because c is 1. But wait, the glass itself is moving. So does the movement of the glass affect the observed speed of the light inside it?

I remember something about Galilean relativity, where velocities add up in a certain way. But wait, Maxwell's equations don't have Galilean invariance; they have Lorentz invariance. Oh wait, but maybe for non-relativistic speeds, we can approximate the velocities. Or perhaps since the glass is moving at a constant velocity, maybe we can treat it using the velocity addition formula from classical mechanics.

Wait, the velocity addition formula in special relativity is different, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to use the relativistic velocity addition formula, but perhaps for small velocities, we can approximate it with the classical approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more about the medium's motion relative to the observer. Let me think: when the medium is moving, how does that affect the light's speed in the medium as seen by an observer outside.

Wait, the light is moving through the glass, and the glass itself is moving towards the observer. So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, in the frame of the glass, the light is moving at velocity v_light = c/n (which is 1/n here, since c=1). But the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So to find the velocity of the light as observed in the lab frame, perhaps we can add the velocities.

Wait, no, because in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed 1/n. But the
