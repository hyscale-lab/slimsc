Okay, I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. So I need to check each of the given compounds for that.

Let's look at the options one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can sometimes have axial chirality because of the way the two phenyl rings are connected. Especially if there are substituents that make the two sides non-superimposable. The dinitro and dicarboxylate groups are in positions 6 and 2 on each ring. Wait, the biphenyl has substituents on both rings. Since they're in the 6 and 2 positions, maybe the arrangement around the central bond could create a plane of symmetry. Or not? Oh wait, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would have optical isomerism. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think: the substituents are meta (position 2 and 6) on each ring. If the substituents on each phenyl are in positions that make the molecule asymmetric, then the biphenyl could have a possibility of being a chiral axis. So this might have optical isomers.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is like CH3-C(OH)O-O-C-OCH3? Wait, wait, the formula is 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COO- but with the hydroxy on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is (CH3)CH(OH)COO-. Wait, maybe it's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be O
      |
CH3-C-O-OCH3
      |
      OH

Wait, no, the structure should be propanoate: CH2CH2COO- but with the hydroxy on the second carbon. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-; 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxy on the second carbon. So it's CH3CH(OH)COO- as the anion. Then, the methyl ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Now, does this have a chiral center? The carbon where the OH is attached: let's see, the groups attached would be CH3, COOCH3, OH, and the adjacent CH3? Wait, no. Let me draw it out. The central carbon is attached to:

- CH3 (from CH3CH(OH)...)
- COOCH3 (the ester group)
- OH
- and the other CH2 group? Or wait, in 2-hydroxypropanoate, it's CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- OH
- and the other group is H? Wait no, wait, the structure is CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, wait, the propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but with the hydroxy on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: The molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with OH) has four different groups: CH3 (from CH3CH(OH)...), COOCH3 (the ester group), OH, and H? No, wait. Wait, no: the central carbon is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. If it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxy is on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH3-CHOH-COOH, but as the methyl ester, it becomes CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- OH
- and the adjacent CH group? Wait, perhaps it's CH2 attached to the OH? No, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the carbons in order: Carbon 1: CH3-, Carbon 2: CH(OH)-, Carbon 3: COOCH3. So Carbon 2 is the OH-bearing carbon. What's attached to it?

- Carbon 1: CH3
- Carbon 3: COOCH3
- OH
- and another group? Wait, no, the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (2nd) is connected to:

- CH3 (Carbon 1)
- COOCH3 (Carbon 3)
- OH
- And what else? The central carbon is CH, so it's attached to four groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and the other CH from the same carbon? No, wait, each carbon can only have four bonds. So the central carbon has:

- One bond to Carbon 1 (CH3)
- One bond to Carbon 3 (COOCH3)
- One bond to OH
- One bond to another CH2? No, wait, because in propanoate, the chain is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH(OH), attached to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, I'm probably getting this wrong. Maybe the correct way is:

The molecule is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is bonded to:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- and another H.

So four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Wait, that would make it a chiral center because all four groups are different. So yes, this compound has a chiral center and thus can exhibit optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. That's (Ph)2CO. Structure is two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. Benzophenone is symmetric because both phenyl groups are identical and attached to the same carbon. So it's symmetric, thus no chiral centers. So no optical isomerism here.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. The structure is (Z)-butenedioic acid. When esterified with methanol, it becomes dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate has a double bond with two ester groups on either end. The structure is CH2=CH(CO2Me)2. Wait, no: fumarate is trans, so the substituents are on opposite sides. Wait, no: fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So when you esterify both ends, you get dimethyl fumarate. Now, this compound has an E geometry double bond. But does it have stereoisomerism?

Wait, the molecule has
