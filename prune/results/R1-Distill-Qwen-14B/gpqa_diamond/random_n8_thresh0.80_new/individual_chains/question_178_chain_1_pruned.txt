Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Let me start by recalling what I know about Lagrangians and renormalizability.

First, the given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. 

Hmm, I remember that to find the mass dimension of a coupling constant, I need to look at the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (since it's integrated over spacetime, which is dimensionless). So each term in the Lagrangian must be dimensionless as well.

Wait, but wait, actually, the action S is dimensionless, because it's the exponential in the path integral. The Lagrangian density has units of [mass]^4 in 4D spacetime because the integral is ∫d^4x L, and the action must be dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian, like L_int here, must have mass dimension 4. So we can write the equation for the dimensions: [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ_{μν}] + [ψ] + [F^{μν}] = 4.

Wait, no, wait. No, the Lagrangian is the sum of terms, each of which is an operator. Each term's mass dimension must be 4, because the integral of the Lagrangian (d^4x) gives a dimensionless action. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So for L_int, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ, ψ, F. Let's break down each part.

First, the fermion fields ψ and ψ̄. For a Dirac spinor in 4D, the mass dimension is 3/2. So [ψ] = 3/2, [ψ̄] = 3/2.

Next, σ_{μν}. Let me see, σ is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The gamma matrices γ are dimensionless, right? Because they're just matrices. So [γ_μ] = 0. So the commutator [γ_μ, γ_ν] also has dimension 0. Therefore, σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So [σ] = 0.

Then, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. Let's see, F is defined as ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, where A is a vector potential. Since A has mass dimension 1 (because the field strength F is part of the term in the Lagrangian, which is dimension 4, and the A fields come with derivatives maybe). Wait, wait, more accurately: in 4D, the gauge field A has mass dimension 1. Because the kinetic term for A is like (∂μ Aν)^2, which is (∂μ has dimension 1, Aν has dimension 1), so each term is dimension 2, squared gives 4, which fits into the Lagrangian (dimension 4). So F^{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each ∂μ brings dimension 1, and Aν brings 1, so F has dimension 2.

Wait, wait: [F^{μν}] = [∂μ Aν] = [∂μ][Aν] = 1 + 1 = 2.

So now, putting it all together.

The term in the Lagrangian is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

So each factor's dimension:

[κ] (unknown)
[ψ̄] = 3/2
[σ] = 0
[ψ] = 3/2
[F] = 2

Wait, but wait: σ is a tensor (like F), but in terms of dimensions, since σ is built from γ matrices which are dimensionless, so [σ] = 0. So each instance of σ in the term is dimensionless.

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F will have dimensions:

(3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 + 3/2 = 3; plus 2 gives total of 5.

Wait, but that can't be right because the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the entire term is κ multiplied by these fields, so:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = 4.

So [κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 4.

Adding those: 3/2 + 3/2 =3, plus 2 is 5. So [κ] +5 = 4 → [κ] = -1.

Wait, that's strange. So the mass dimension of κ is -1. Hmm.

Wait, but I'm getting [κ] = -1. Let me double-check.

Each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F must have dimension 4.

So [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] =4.

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2. σ is 0. F is 2.

So 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. F is 2. So 3+2
