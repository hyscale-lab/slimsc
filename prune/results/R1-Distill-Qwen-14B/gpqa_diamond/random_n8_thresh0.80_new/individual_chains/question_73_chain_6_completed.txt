Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let me think.

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but relative speed isn't just the difference because we're dealing with relativity here. Oh right, in classical mechanics, you'd subtract the speeds, but relativistically, it's more complicated.

I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. It's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Let me plug in the values. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So numerator is 0.1c, denominator is 1 - (0.6*0.5)c²/c². That 0.6*0.5 is 0.3, so denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7) c, which is approximately 0.1428c, so about 0.14c. Oh, that matches one of the options.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, so E = gamma * mc². Wait, but each has a different mass. So astronaut 1: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v is 0.6c. So gamma for 2m astronaut is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) which is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Astronaut 2: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 is about 5.964 mc². So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc², which matches option C: E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c.

Wait, let me make sure. The options are A, B, C, D. Option C is v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower. So yes, option C must be the correct choice.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic formulas.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
