Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities for two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to choose which one to observe because they have limited time, and they want the one with the highest chance of transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance.

Let me go through the details. Both planets have the same mass, detected via the RV method. So their masses are known, but that doesn't directly affect the transit probability. Wait, the orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since it orbits faster. The host stars have the same radius, but Planet_1's star is more massive. Oh, because more massive stars are usually larger, but here both stars have the same radius. Interesting.

Transit probability depends on the relative sizes of the planet and star. But wait, since both are Earth-like, their radii are similar. So the main factors are the star's size and the orbital distance. The probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on to us, which is a function of the star's size and the distance. The formula I recall is roughly (R_star / a) where a is the semi-major axis (distance), but maybe it's more precise.

Wait, the transit probability (p) can be approximated by the formula p ≈ (R_p / R_*)^2 * (R_* / (a (1 - e²)^0.5)) ), but since both have circular orbits (e=0), it simplifies. So p ≈ (R_p^2) / (R_*^2 a) ) * something? Wait, maybe it's simpler. The geometric probability is (R_*/a)^2, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, correction: The probability of a transit is given by the ratio of the star's diameter to the distance, considering the planet's orbital distance. So p = (R_p / R_*)^2 * (R_* / a) )? Hmm, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability is actually the ratio of the size of the star to the distance between the planet and the star, in the plane of the sky. That is, it's the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such
