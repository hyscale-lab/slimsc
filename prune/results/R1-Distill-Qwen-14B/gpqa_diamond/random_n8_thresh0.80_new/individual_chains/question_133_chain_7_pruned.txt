Okay, I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, the problem says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in this solution. The temperature is 25°C, and they've given the Ka values for H3PO4 as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12.

Hmm, I think I remember that orthophosphate is HPO4^2- which is the second dissociation state of phosphoric acid. So, I'll need to consider the equilibrium of H3PO4 dissociating stepwise.

Wait, but in this solution, we have two different phosphate salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I think these are the first and second salts of phosphoric acid. So, the first salt is K H2PO4, which would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- (since KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate). The second salt is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, the solution is a buffer solution containing both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. So, it's a buffer involving the second dissociation of H3PO4, since H2PO4^- is the first deprotonated form and HPO4^2- is the second.

Wait, the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-. So, I need to find [HPO4^2-] in the solution.

But wait, the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, these are two different salts. Let me think about their dissociations.

KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^- 

Na2HPO4·2H2O → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- + 4 H2O. Well, the water part is just from the hydrate, but in solution, it's just the ions.

So, in the solution, the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present. These two will form a buffer system. So, the pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, using the pKa2 value, because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pKa = pH + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So, the buffer equation would be:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

But wait, we don't know the pH yet. So maybe we need to find the pH first using the given information, and then find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the moles of each salt and then determining the ratio of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- in the solution.

Let me calculate the moles of each salt.

First, for KH2PO4: Mw is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00734 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: Mw is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00560 mol.

Wait, but wait, Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. When it dissociates, each mole gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So, from each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O, we get one mole of HPO4^2-.

So, the moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O is 0.00560 mol.

Similarly, KH2PO4 gives moles of H2PO4^-: 0.00734 mol.

Wait, but wait: when you have a solution of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can interconvert. So, the solution will have both ions, and their concentrations will depend on the pH.

But since the solution is a mixture of a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, using the amounts (moles) of each.

Wait, but Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log ( [base]/[acid] )

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So, the ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = (moles of HPO4^2- )/(moles of H2PO4^- ) ) * (volume) / (volume) → since volume is same for both, it's just the ratio of moles.

So, [HPO4^2-] is 0.00560 mol, [H2PO4^-] is 0.00734 mol. So ratio is 0.00560 / 0.00734 ≈ 0.762.

So, pH = pKa2 + log(0.762).

What's pKa2? Ka2 is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) → wait, no. pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

So pH = 7.208 + log(0.762).

What's log(0.762)? Let me think. Log(0.75) is about -0.1249. 0.762 is slightly higher, so log(0.762) ≈ -0.116.

So pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.116 ≈ 7.092.

Hmm, but wait, maybe it's better to calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should set up the equation more precisely.

But wait, wait. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is correct here because we have a buffer solution. So, using the moles, because the volume is same for both, the concentration ratio is same as the moles ratio.

So, the pH is pKa2 + log (n_HPO4 / n_H2PO4 )

n_HPO4 = 0.00560 mol.

n_H2PO4 = 0.00734 mol.

So, the ratio is 0.00560 / 0.00734
