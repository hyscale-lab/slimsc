Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia solvent. I need to figure out how many possible organic products are formed. The options are A to D, with numbers 1 to 4.

Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base and is often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially in aromatic systems. Wait, but wait—what's the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, wait, perhaps I misread that. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene or something like that. Or is it 2-dimethylamino-1-bromobenzene?

Wait, no. The formula might be 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. So, in benzene, position 1 has a bromine, position 2 has a dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2).

So the molecule is para-substituted? Wait, no. Benzene is a six-membered ring. If position 1 is bromine, then position 2 is the dimethylamino group. So they are adjacent. So the substituents are in the ortho positions.

Now, the reaction with NaNH2 in ammonia. I think this is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond—so elimination to form a benzene ring with a double bond where the Br was.

Wait, but benzene is already fully conjugated. Oh wait, wait. Wait, no, perhaps the reaction is an aromatic elimination. Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts type? No, wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe it's an elimination reaction leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond, like a benzene ring with an adjacent substituent and a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: when a benzene ring has a substituent which is a good leaving group (like Br), and another strong activating group (like NMe2, which is a strong activating group, since it's an amino group), perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond, releasing HBr.

Wait, so if I have 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, and I treat it with NaNH2, which is a strong base. The base would abstract a proton. Where would that be? The amino group is a strong activating group—it can donate electrons, so the ring is activated for electrophilic substitution. But wait, in this case, perhaps it's not substitution but elimination.

Wait, considering the structure: Br is at position 1, NMe2 is at position 2. The ring is activated, so maybe the base induces dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. But benzene is already a conjugated system with delocalized electrons. Hmm, maybe it's more about forming a diene or something else.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the mechanism. NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, typically used for deprotonation. In aromatic systems, especially with activating groups, it can lead to elimination reactions. For example, in ethylbenzene, NaNH2 might deprotonate to form a benzylide anion, which then loses H2 to form a triple bond (like in the formation of phenylacetylene). But that's more for aliphatic positions.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are in adjacent positions—Br at 1 and NMe2 at 2. So perhaps the base abstracts a proton that's adjacent to Br, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond.

Wait, so the Br is at position 1; the adjacent position is position 2, which already has NMe2. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3 or position whatever, maybe that's not adjacent.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from the ring, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, releasing HBr. So the Br is at C1, and the amino group is at C2. Deprotonation at C3 maybe
