Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about using Grubbs catalyst on racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organometallic reactions, but let's try to work through this.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis means the redistribution of alkyl groups in alkenes. So, Grubbs catalyst facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of the two enantiomers. But since it's a symmetrical compound, maybe the enantiomers are actually the same thing? Wait, 3-methylpent-1-eneâ€”let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, right? But with a methyl group on the third carbon. Oh wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2? No, wait, pentane has five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Structure: CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, no, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Adding a methyl on carbon 3 would make it CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no. Let me count again. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. The third carbon is the one next to the double bond. So adding a methyl there would make it CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write it as CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Oh wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, pentane is five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Or maybe CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2? No, wait, that would be five carbons. Let me write it:

The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's six
