Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The starting material is benzene, and I need to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the given options A, B, C, or D.

First, I'll try to understand the target molecule. Let me draw its structure mentally. Benzene ring with three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, but wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering could be tricky. Let me clarify the positions. So, if position 1 has the ethoxy, position 2 has the tert-butyl, then position 3 must be the nitro group. So in the ring, substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, with the substituents being ethoxy (OEt), tert-butyl (t-Bu), and nitro (NO2), respectively. Or wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's more about their relative positions. Let me think: when you have three substituents on benzene, their positions determine the structure.

The key here is to figure out the order of substituent addition. Since benzene is symmetric, the order in which substituents are added affects the positions due to the directing effects of the substituents.

Each substituent will direct incoming groups to specific positions. For example, nitro groups are meta directors, ethoxy (ether) groups are ortho/para directors, and tert-butyl (a bulky alkyl group) is a para director because alkyl groups are activating and ortho/para directors, but in this case, since it's a bulky group, it's more likely to direct incoming groups to the para position, but let me think.

Wait, actually, tertiary alkyl groups like tert-butyl are strong activating groups. They are ortho/para directors. But because of their bulkiness, they may favor the para position more than ortho when possible, but in electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituent directs based on its nature regardless of steric effects, but steric effects can sometimes influence where substitution occurs.

Wait, no, the directing effect is primarily based on electron-donating or withdrawing. So, for t-butyl (a strong activating, alkyl group), it's an ortho/para director. So when adding a new substituent, it will enter ortho or para with respect to the t-butyl group.

Similarly, nitro is a strong deactivating, meta director. So any substituent added after nitro will go meta to it.

The ethoxy group is an activating, ortho/para director. So when ethoxy is present, incoming substituents will go ortho or para to it.

So the target molecule has ethoxy (OEt), tert-butyl (t-Bu), and nitro (NO2). Let me think about their positions. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let me pick a position 1 for ethoxy. Then position 2 is t-Bu, and position 3 is nitro. So that would
