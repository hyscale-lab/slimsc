Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and figuring out the ratio of silicon atoms between two stars. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, let me read the question carefully. So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But wait, the question is about their elemental abundances, so maybe the masses don't directly impact the calculation. Or do they? Well, since the question is using LTE and the EW method, which are about measuring abundances, perhaps the mass is just background info and not needed for the calculation. So I can probably ignore the masses for this problem.

The given data: 
For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5

Wait, but we need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars. So the question is asking (nSi in Star_1) / (nSi in Star_2). Or maybe it's the other way around? Let me see the exact wording again: "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." I think it's Star_1 over Star_2.

So, to get the silicon abundance in each star relative to hydrogen, we'll probably need the [Si/H] for each. Then, using the solar abundances, we can find the ratio.

Let me think about how [X/Y] notation works. The [X/Y] is log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y] = log10((nX/nY)_star / (nX/nY)_sun).

Alternatively, [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3. So:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(nSi/nFe)_1 - log10(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log10(nFe/nH)_1 - log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 0 → log10(nFe/nH)_1 = log10(nFe/nH)_sun → nFe/nH for Star_1 is same as Sun.

Wait, but the Sun's [Fe/H] is what? Well, the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero by definition because it's the reference point. So yeah, Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, meaning its Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.

So for Star_1, nFe/nH = nFe,nH_sun.

Now, since Star_1's [Fe/H]=0, so nFe in Star_1 is same as Sun relative to H.

Now, let's compute [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So, log (nSi/nFe)_1 - log (nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

But nFe/nH for Star_1 is same as Sun. So, let's express nSi in terms of H.

nSi = (nFe)_1 * (nSi/nFe)_1.

But wait, perhaps it's better to find [Si/H] for Star_1.

Because [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe]

Wait, wait. Let me think: [Si/H] = log10(nSi/nH) - log10(nSi/nH)_sun.

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, perhaps we can write [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1.

Wait, no. Let me see: [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_sun.

But [Fe/H] is the log(nFe/nH) - log_sun.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express [Si/H] in terms of the given [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H].

Let me recall that [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H].

So [X/Y] = ([X/H] - [Y/H]).

So for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1.

Given that [Fe/H]_1 is 0, [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1.

So [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

So the silicon abundance in Star_1 relative to hydrogen is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun. So log10(nSi/nH)_1 = log10(nSi/nH)_sun + 0.3.

So nSi/nH in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.

Wait, but what is the Sun's nSi/nH?

The Sun's data isn't directly given for Si, but we can compute it from the other data. Since for the Sun, we have nFe/nH and nMg/nH.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=10^-5.

But what about Si in the Sun? Hmm. We don't have a direct [Si/H] for the Sun, so perhaps we need to find it from the given data.

Wait, maybe using the [Mg/Si] ratio in Star_
