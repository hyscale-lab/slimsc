Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when dibromides react with a strong base like KOH, it's usually an elimination reaction, especially if it's heated. So, probably an E2 mechanism here. Since there are two bromine atoms on the adamantane structure, which is a diamondoid, elimination would form an alkene. 

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... upon dehydrohalogenation, it would lose two HBr molecules. Adamantane is a pretty rigid structure, so the elimination would form an allene? Or maybe a more substituted alkene. Hmm. Oh wait, wait. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2) undergo elimination, they form alkenes. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a geminal dihalide? No, wait, no. Wait, 1 and 3 are positions on adamantane. Oh wait, the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid, so 1 and 3 would be two positions that are probably not adjacent. So maybe the two bromines are on adjacent carbons? Wait, no, 1,3 positions on a diamondoid might not be next to each other. Wait, maybe I should think about the structure.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. That makes me think of something like an epoxide, but wait, no. Wait, another possibility: when dihalides react with a base, sometimes they can form ethylene or ethylene-type structures. Alternatively, considering that the product has an IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe the product is a ketone.

Wait, but from dibromide to ketone? How? Oh, wait, maybe it's an example of a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement. Or perhaps it's a Fittig reaction? No, that's for aryl halides. Maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, but KOH is a base and a nucleophile. If it's a dihalide, perhaps the two bromides are on adjacent carbons, making it a vicinal dihalide. But 1,3 positions might not be adjacent. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the structure allows for the formation of a carbonyl group. Oh wait! Maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement? No, pinacol rearrangement is for 1,2-diol elimination to form ketones, but here it's dihalide. Alternatively, a dehydrohalogenation with elimination of HBr to form an alkene, but then maybe another reaction.

Wait, another thought: when a dihalide (vicinal) is treated with a strong base in a dehydrohalogenation, it usually forms an alkene. But if the base is in excess and under certain conditions, perhaps it can form a ketone. No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternative approach: looking at the IR spectrum. The product has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the product is a ketone. So, the initial reaction must have converted the dibromide into a ketone.

How does that happen? Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of ring formation. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of the formation of a cyclic ether via elimination, but that doesn't fit with the carbonyl peak.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a benzil-like reaction, but that's for dialdehydes. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial structure is such that upon elimination, it forms a carbonyl group. Let me think. For example, if the two bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons, elimination of HBr would form a double bond, but if the structure is such that elimination leads to a conjugated diene or perhaps a ring contraction that forms a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But dihalides usually undergo elimination more readily than substitution, especially with a strong base like KOH.

Wait, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it's a double elimination to form an alkene, but the IR doesn't show a peak for an alkene (which would be around 1650 cm-1 for C=C). So the product has a C=O instead.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that when KOH is added, it forms a ketone via some kind of rearrangement. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the NMR data provided for product 1.

The 1H NMR of product 1 shows:
- 4.79 ppm (2H)
- 2.41-2.23 (10H)
- 1.94 ppm (2H)

The IR has 1720 cm-1, so a ketone is present. Let's think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably an -OCH2- group or perhaps a CH2 next to an electronegative atom. Wait, 4.8 is around where an epoxide's protons would be, but the IR doesn't show an epoxide peak (which would be around 1250 cm-1 for the C-O-C stretch). Alternatively, maybe it's an ether or an alcohol.

Wait, if it's a ketone, then where do the protons go? Let me think about the structure. Let's imagine that after forming the ketone, the molecule has a certain symmetry. Product 1 is 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH. So, perhaps the bromines are eliminated, and the ring structure adjusts to form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantane with a ketone group. Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons. If two of them were brominated, maybe eliminating HBr leads to a bridgehead double bond, but that's not possible due to Bredt's rule. So perhaps the structure rearranges.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction forms a cyclopropane or some other ring structure with a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a tertiary alcohol, but the IR shows a carbonyl, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of the formation of a ketone via a Dieckmann condensation, but that requires esters. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case where the dihalide is dehydrohalogenated to form an alkyne. But that doesn't fit the IR either.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible structures. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group. But with a ketone group elsewhere.

Wait, for example, maybe the structure is a cyclohexanone derivative. But given the starting material is adamantane, the product is likely a substituted adamantane with a ketone group.

Wait, perhaps the product is an adamantanone. Adamantane with one ketone group. Let me imagine the structure: a bridgehead carbon with a carbonyl group. Then, the NMR would show certain signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a secondary or tertiary alcohol, but again, the IR doesn
