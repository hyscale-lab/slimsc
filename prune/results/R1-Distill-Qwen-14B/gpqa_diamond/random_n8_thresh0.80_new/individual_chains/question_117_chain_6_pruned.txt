Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, meaning they're not superimposable on their mirror images. So the molecule isn't symmetrical in a way that would make the mirror image the same as itself.

Let me look at each option one by one. The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each combining some of these.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings are connected by a single bond, right? So the two phenyl rings can rotate. Wait, but does that create any stereoisomerism? I think biphenyls can have different conformations, but for optical isomers, we need a chiral center or some kind of asymmetry that leads to non-superimposable mirror images. Let me visualize this. The substituents are at 2 and 2' positions on each ring, and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. Are there any chiral centers here? The molecule has two ester groups, each is OMe. Wait, but each ester is on a different ring. So each ring is attached to the central bond. If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule chiral, then it can have optical isomers. Wait, maybe the arrangement leads to a plane of symmetry? If the two substituents are symmetrical, then the molecule might not be chiral. But if they are not symmetrical, then it can be chiral. Let me think: the molecule has two ester groups at 2 and 2' positions, and two nitro groups at 6 and 6'. So the substituents are opposite each other on each ring. So maybe the molecule is symmetrical? If the two rings are arranged so that substituents mirror each other, then the whole molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But wait, if the arrangement is such that the two substituents on each ring are in positions that don't mirror each other, then maybe it's chiral. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl system itself can have different configurations. Wait, if the two substituents on each ring are in ortho positions (2 and 6), maybe the rings are connected in a way that the substituents are on the same side or opposite, leading to different isomers. Oh wait, but diphenyl compounds can have E and Z isomers if the substituents are in positions that allow for that. Wait, but optical isomerism is about chirality, not geometric isomerism. So I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should come back to this one.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see, that's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure would be OMe attached to the ester oxygen, connected to a CH2CH(OH)COO- part. Wait, wait, the formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is CH3O-CO-CH(CH3)OH? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2COOH. So the
