Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So, natural lithium has different isotopes. Oh wait, the problem says Li with 3 neutrons. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3, so if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, because 3 protons and 3 neutrons sum to 6. So the nucleus is lithium-6.

Alright, the problem is about relativistic energy. So I think I need to use the relativistic energy equations. The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC, which accelerates these nuclei to a certain speed, and we need to find the energy when speed v is 0.96c.

So, I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Wait, let me think. The formula for gamma is correct. So when v is 0.96c, let's compute gamma.

Let me compute that. Let's plug in v=0.96c. So v²/c² would be (0.96)^2, which is 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.28 times 3.5714 is approximately 1. Because 0.28 * 3 = 0.84, 0.28 * 0.5714 is about 0.1
