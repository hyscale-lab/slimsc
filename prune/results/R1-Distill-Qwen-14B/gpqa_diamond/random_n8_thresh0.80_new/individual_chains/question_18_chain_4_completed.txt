Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again and take notes.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. The question is about elemental abundances, specifically silicon (Si) in both stars compared to each other.

The elemental abundance data given are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is provided as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2).

Hmm, I remember that the notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So, for example, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of the ratio of iron abundance relative to hydrogen compared to the Sun.

Let me jot down the variables:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(Si/Fe)_1 - log(Si/Fe)_sun = 0.3
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(Fe/H)_1 - log(Fe/H)_sun = 0 → log(Fe/H)_1 = log(Fe/H)_sun
Which means Fe/H in Star_1 is the same as the Sun's. So Star_1 has solar Fe abundance.

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(Mg/Si)_2 - log(Mg/Si)_sun = 0.3
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → log(Mg/H)_2 - log(Mg/H)_sun = 0 → log(Mg/H)_2 = log(Mg/H)_sun → Mg/H same as Sun.

I think I need to find the silicon abundance in each star relative to the Sun, then find their ratio.

Let me think about the Sun's abundances first.

For the Sun:
log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
Similarly, nMg/nH = 10^(-5) because log(nMg/nH) = (7-12)= -5.

Wait, wait, no. The Sun's data is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) = 3.16e-5.

Similarly, nMg/nH is 10^(-5) because 7 - 12 is -5. So nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But I'm not sure if I'm getting this right. Let me double-check. The formula is 12 + log(nX/nH) = value. So to get log(nX/nH), subtract 12.

So, for the Sun, log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) = about 3.16e-5.

Same for Mg: 7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Now, for Star_1:

[Fe/H] is 0, so Fe/H is same as Sun. So, nFe_1 / nH_1 = 3.16e-5.

[Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So, [Si/Fe] = log(Si/Fe)_1 - log(Si/Fe)_sun = 0.3.

So, log(Si/Fe)_1 = log(Si/Fe)_sun + 0.3.

What's the Sun's [Si/Fe]?

Wait, I don't have that directly. But from the Sun's nFe/nH and nMg/nH, maybe I can find nSi/nH.

Wait, I don't have info on Si in the Sun directly. Hmm. I think I might need to find the ratio of Si to Fe in the Sun to compute [Si/Fe]_sun.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe] in terms of [Mg/Si], but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this step by step.

Let me find the [X/H] for each element in each star.

Alternatively, another approach: for each star, express n_X in terms of H, then compute the ratio.

But perhaps to find [Si/H] in each star, I can use [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H], since I know [Fe/H] is 0 for Star_1.

Wait, yes. Because [Fe/H] is 0, so [Si/H] can be computed.

In Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(Si/Fe)_1 = log(Sun's Si/Fe) + 0.3.

Wait, but I don't know Sun's [Si/Fe]. Hmm. Maybe I can compute it.

Wait, what's Sun's [Si/Fe]? Let me think. The Sun's [X/H] is given for Fe and Mg, but not Si. So I can't directly compute [Si/Fe]_sun unless I have more info.

Wait, perhaps I can make an assumption based on solar abundances. Wait, but that's risky because I don't know the actual solar [Si/Fe]. Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express nSi in terms of nFe for each star.

Wait, let's try that.

For Star_1:

log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) = [Si/Fe]_1 + log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun)

Because [Si/Fe] is the logarithm of the ratio relative to the Sun.

Wait, yes. The formula [X/Y]_star = log(nX/nY)_star - log(nX/nY)_sun.

So log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = [Si/Fe]_1 + log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

But I don't know log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun). Hmm. Because I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe].

Wait, but perhaps I can find it from the given Sun's data.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is given indirectly. Oh, wait no, the Sun's data is given as 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7, and same for Fe.

Wait, but I don't have [Mg/Si]_sun. Oh wait, perhaps I can compute it.

Because for the Sun:

log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg = nH * 1e-5.

Similarly, log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe = nH * 3.16e-5.

But to find [Mg/Si]_sun, I need nMg/nSi.

Hmm, but I don't have nSi for the Sun. So maybe I can't compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps the [Mg/Si]_2 is given, and the [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so maybe I can find [Si/H]_2 in a similar way.

But maybe it's better to approach each star separately.

Let me start with Star_1.

Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe_1 / nH_1) = log(nFe_sun / nH_sun) → so nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

So nFe_1 = nH_1 * (nFe_sun / nH_sun) → but nH_1 is the hydrogen in Star_1, nH_sun is solar hydrogen.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio is nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun).

But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to work with the logarithms.

Let me think in terms of ratios.

Let me denote:

For Star_1:

log(nSi_1 / nH_1) = [Si/H]_1 + log(nSi_sun / nH_sun)

Wait, no. The definition is [X/H] = log(nX / nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun.

So [X/H]_1 = log(nX_1/nH_1) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun).

So, log(nX_1/nH_1) = [X/H]_1 + log(nX_sun/nH_sun).

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So log(nFe_1 / nH_1) = log(nFe_sun / nH_sun) → which we already know.

For [Si/Fe]_1, it's 0.3. So log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) + 0.3.

Because [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) = 0.3 → so log(nSi_1 /nFe_1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

But I don't have log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun), which is [Si/Fe]_sun.

Wait, but perhaps I can find [Si/Fe]_sun using the Sun's [Mg/Si]_sun.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is not given, but for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3.

Wait, but Star_2's [Mg/Si] is 0.3, so it's higher or lower than the Sun's? I don't know the Sun's [Mg/Si] so I can't directly compare.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the ratios.

Alternatively, maybe I can express the ratio of Si in each star relative to the Sun.

Let me think about Star_1 first.

Star_1:

nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun) → because [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Wait, not quite. Because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun / nH_sun). So nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

But nH_1 is the hydrogen in Star_1. But without knowing the total density, perhaps it's better to think in terms of relative abundances.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate nSi_1 in terms of nFe_1.

From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) + 0.3.

So nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But since nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1, and nH_1 is the same for all elements in the star.

Wait, perhaps I can express nSi_1 in terms of nH_1.

nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

→ nSi_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Simplify this:

nSi_1 = (nH_1) * (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * 10^0.3.

But [Si/H]_1 is log(nSi_1 /nH_1) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun) = log( (nH_1 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *10^0.3 ) /nH_1 ) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun)

= log( ( (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * 10^0.3 ) ) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun )

= log( nSi_sun/(nH_sun) * 10^0.3 ) - log(nSi_sun/(nH_sun) )

= log(a * 10^0.3) - log(a) where a = nSi_sun/(nH_sun)

= log(a) + 0.3 - log(a) = 0.3.

Wait, so [Si/H]_1 would be 0.3? But wait, that can't be right, because I started with [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 and [Fe/H]_1 =0.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-express this.

Wait, alternatively, since [Fe/H] is 0, Star_1 has the same Fe/H as the Sun. So, nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun).

Then, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 → log(nSi_1 /nFe_1 ) = log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) + 0.3.

So, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) * 10^0.3.

Substituting nFe_1 from earlier:

nSi_1 = (nFe_sun * nH_1 / nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) ) * 10^0.3.

Simplify:

nSi_1 = (nH_1 / nH_sun ) * nSi_sun * 10^0.3.

So, nSi_1 /nH_1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * 10^0.3.

Taking the log, [Si/H]_1 = log( (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^0.3 ) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun ) 

= log( a * 10^0.3 ) - log a = 0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

Wait, that's interesting. So Star_1 has [Si/H] of 0.3, meaning more Si relative to H than the Sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, I can compute [Si/H]_2.

Wait, how?

Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg_2 /nSi_2 ) = log( nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) + 0.3.

Also, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → log(nMg_2 /nH_2 ) = log(nMg_sun /nH_sun ) → so nMg_2 = nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun ).

So, let's find nSi_2.

From [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3:

log(nMg_2 /nSi_2 ) = log( nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) + 0.3.

So, nMg_2 /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) * 10^0.3.

We can express nMg_2 as:

nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) * nH_2.

So substituting into the equation:

( (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) * nH_2 ) /nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) * 10^0.3.

Rearranging for nSi_2:

nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) * nH_2 * (nSi_sun /nMg_sun ) ) / 10^0.3.

Simplify:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 / nH_sun ) * nSi_sun / (10^0.3).

So,

nSi_2 /nH_2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) / (10^0.3).

Taking the log:

[Si/H]_2 = log( (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) / (10^0.3) ) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun )

= log(a / 10^0.3 ) - log a = log( a ) - log(10^0.3 a) ?

Wait, no. Wait, more accurately:

[Si/H]_2 = log( (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) / (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) )

= log( (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) ) - log( nSi_sun /nH_sun )

From earlier, nSi_2 /nH_2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) / 10^0.3.

So, log(nSi_2 /nH_2 ) = log( (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ) - 0.3.

So,

[Si/H]_2 = [ log( (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ) - 0.3 ] - log( nSi_sun /nH_sun )

= -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3. That means Star_2 has 0.3 dex less Si than the Sun.

Wait, so now I have [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 is (nSi_1 /nH_1) / (nSi_2 /nH_2) ) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

Because [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi_1/nH_1) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun )

Similarly for [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi_2/nH_2) - log(...).

So, the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

Which is 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} } = 10^{0.6}.

What's 10^0.6? Let me think, 10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, which is around 3.98, so approximately 4. So the ratio is about 4. So Star_1 has about 4 times more silicon atoms per hydrogen than Star_2.

Wait, but the question asks for the ratio of Silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So, n_Si,1 /n_Si,2.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, I've just found the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) = 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

But the actual ratio of silicon atoms between the two stars is (nSi_1 / nSi_2 ) = [ (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) ] * (nH_2 / nH_1 ) )

But wait, no. Because:

nSi_1 = (nSi_1/nH_1) * nH_1

nSi_2 = (nSi_2/nH_2) * nH_2

So,

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = [ (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) ] * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

Wait, but unless the hydrogen densities are the same, which they aren't, this complicates things. But wait, the problem statement doesn't give any information about the overall metallicity or H content of the stars. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres is (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) multiplied by (nH_2 /nH_1 ), but unless we know nH_1 and nH_2, we can't proceed.

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that the total number of particles is the same, or that the H abundance is the same, but I don't think that's given.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I made an error earlier.

Wait, let's re-examine the problem. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

So, the ratio is (n_Si,1) / (n_Si,2).

But n_Si,1 = (n_Si,1 /n_H,1) * n_H,1.

Similarly, n_Si,2 = (n_Si,2 /n_H,2) * n_H,2.

So,

(n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 ) = [ (n_Si,1/n_H,1) * (n_H,1) ] / [ (n_Si,2/n_H,2) * (n_H,2) ]

= [ (n_Si,1/n_H,1) / (n_Si,2/n_H,2) ] * (n_H,1 / n_H,2 )

So,

= [10^{[Si/H]_1} ] / [10^{[Si/H]_2} } ] * (n_H,1 / n_H,2 )

But without knowing the H abundance ratio, I can't compute this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of H is the same as the ratio of Fe, because [Fe/H] is 0 for Star_1. Wait, no, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which implies [Fe/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_sun.

Wait, [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe_1/nH_1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) ) = 0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun ) → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

But I'm not sure if this helps with the H ratio between the two stars.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of Star_1 and Star_2 having the same mass as the Sun but different masses. Wait, no, their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses, but I don't see how that affects the abundance ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of n_H in each star's photosphere is the same, but I don't think that's given.

Wait a minute, perhaps the problem is assuming that the H abundance ratio is 1, meaning that n_H,1 = n_H,2. Because the problem doesn't mention any difference in H between the stars, maybe it's assumed that n_H is the same. But wait, that's not necessarily true.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the same log scale for H, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can proceed under the assumption that the H abundance in each star is the same as the Sun. But that can't be right, because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which implies that Fe/H is the same as the Sun, but H could be different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed in a way that the H ratio cancels out. Let me think.

Wait, earlier I found that [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

If I take the ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2, it's 0.3 / (-0.3) ) → no, that's not correct. Wait, the ratio of their abundances is 10^[Si/H]_1 / 10^[Si/H]_2.

Which is 10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3} } = 10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

So, the ratio of their [Si/H] is about 3.98.

But wait, the ratio of their silicon abundances would be (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) = 10^{0.6}.

But without knowing nH_1 and nH_2, this is the ratio of their silicon to hydrogen. But the actual silicon ratio between the two stars would be (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2) ), but this would equal (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) * (nH_2 /nSi_2 ) = (nSi_1 *nH_2) / (nH_1 *nSi_2).

Wait, but unless I know the ratio of H in each star, I can't proceed.

Hmm, perhaps the problem assumes that the H abundance is the same in both stars, i.e., nH_1 = nH_2. But that's not stated.

Alternatively, perhaps each star's H abundance is solar, but that might not be the case.

Wait, let me think again. The problem gives [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for each star, but not [H/Fe] or anything else.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of H in each star relative to the Sun.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

But without knowing anything else, I can't find nH_1 or nH_2 in terms of the Sun's.

But wait, maybe I can assume that the H abundance in each star is the same as the Sun, which would make the ratio nH_1/nH_sun = nH_2/nH_sun =1.

If that's the case, then nH_1 =nH_sun, and nH_2 =nH_sun.

Then, the ratio of silicon atoms would be:

(nSi_1 /nH_sun ) / (nSi_2 /nH_sun ) ) = (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) * (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * (nH_sun /nH_2 ) ) * (nH_2 /nH_1 ) )

Wait, no, that's getting too tangled.

Wait, if nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun, then:

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^0.3 *nH_sun → nSi_1 = nSi_sun *10^0.3.

nSi_2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * (1 /10^0.3 ) *nH_sun → nSi_2 = nSi_sun / 10^0.3.

So, nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (nSi_sun *10^0.3 ) / (nSi_sun /10^0.3 ) ) → (10^0.3 )^2 = 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

So the ratio would be about 3.98, which is approximately 4. So the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is ~4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

So the answer should be A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the logarithmic abundance notation. The key steps are as follows:

### Star_1:
- **[Fe/H]_1 = 0**: This means the iron-to-hydrogen abundance in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Thus, \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
- **[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3**: Using the definition of logarithmic abundance ratios:
  \[
  \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Fe,1}}}\right) = \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}\right) + 0.3
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \), we find:
  \[
  \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}\right) = \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}}\right) + 0.3
  \]
  This implies:
  \[
  \left[\frac{\text{Si}}{\text{H}}\right]_1 = 0.3
  \]

### Star_2:
- **[Mg/H]_2 = 0**: This means the magnesium-to-hydrogen abundance in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun. Thus, \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
- **[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3**: Using the definition of logarithmic abundance ratios:
  \[
  \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}}\right) = \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}}}{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}\right) + 0.3
  \]
  Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \), we find:
  \[
  \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}\right) = \log\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}}\right) - 0.3
  \]
  This implies:
  \[
  \left[\frac{\text{Si}}{\text{H}}\right]_2 = -0.3
  \]

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}\right)}{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}\right)} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}
\]
Assuming the hydrogen abundance ratio \( n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,2}} \) is 1 (not explicitly stated but implied by the problem), the ratio simplifies to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{10^{\left[\frac{\text{Si}}{\text{H}}\right]_1}}{10^{\left[\frac{\text{Si}}{\text{H}}\right]_2}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}
\]
Approximating \( 10^{0.6} \), we find:
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
