Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. That means the ring has two substituents attached to it. The molecular formula options are given, so I need to figure out which one it is based on the spectral data provided.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for an ester group. Esters typically have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1740-1700 cm^-1. So, the compound has an ester functional group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Let's break them down.

- Two aromatic H signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents could be in different positions. If the substituents are para, then each substituent would have symmetrical H's, but if they are ortho or meta, the symmetry would change. But wait, the aromatic signals are two, which suggests maybe two sets of aromatic protons. Hmm, maybe the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two different sets of equivalent protons. Like if one substituent is in the ortho position relative to the other, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

- Two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are usually on double bonds, like in alkenes or in aromatic rings. Wait, but the ring is aromatic and conjugated, so vinyl H's might be part of a substituent, perhaps an ester group. Esters have R-O-CO-O-R structures? No, wait, esters are R-O-CO-R. Oh, right. So maybe the substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R? Wait, no, wait: ester is R-O-CO-R', where R and R' can be different.

Wait, but the substituent on the aromatic ring could be an ester group. So the structure would be something like Ph-O-CO-R, where Ph is the aromatic ring. But that would make the ester substituent with an oxygen and a carbonyl.

Alternatively, the substituent could be an alkyl group with a double bond, like maybe an acetyl group or something else.

Wait, but thinking about the NMR signals: the vinyl H's. So perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, like an allyl ester. So maybe the substituent is something like CH2CH2CO-O- attached to the ring? No, wait, that's not right. Or maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, say, O-CO-O-R, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the ester is O-CO-O-R wouldn't make sense. Wait, ester is usually R-O-CO-R', where R is attached to the oxygen, which is connected to the carbonyl, which is connected to R'. So perhaps the substituent is O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. That would make sense.

But wait, the
