Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus with HI is used in the hydrolysis of certain functional groups, maybe esters or something similar.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. Let's look at the spectral data.

The IR data: The peaks are in the regions of 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or maybe N-H stretch. But considering the other peaks, 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be from aromatic C=C stretching. So, putting that together, the compound might have an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Broad usually means it's an exchange process, like an -OH proton, but wait, if it's a carbonyl group, maybe it's not an -OH. Wait, could it be a carboxylic acid? Because the OH in a carboxylic acid is usually around 10-12 ppm and broad. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 could be a carboxylic acid (which has a lower wavenumber, around 1700). Alternatively, an ester or ketone could also be around there. Hmm.

Let me look at the other NMR signals:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two doublets, each integrating for two protons. So that suggests a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. The coupling in each case would imply they're para to each other.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet. This might be a CH group adjacent to something else, maybe an oxygen or a carbonyl. Or perhaps it's a CH in a chain next to a branching point.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, integrating for two protons. Maybe part of a CH2 group attached to something, perhaps another CH group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet, which is a CH3 group attached to a CH that's split into a doublet. So maybe a CH(CH3) group.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, which is a CH2CH3 group. So a terminal ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent in para position. Let's think of the substituent as a chain.

The 10.5 ppm could be an -OH, but if the IR has 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, if the compound is a benzoic acid derivative, the carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl and an -OH.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet and broad. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the OH would exchange rapidly and appear as a broad peak. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid, but let's see.

But wait, the 1720 cm-1 in IR is a strong peak. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1. This is a bit higher, which might suggest an ester or maybe a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, which could lower the wavenumber.

Wait, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and
