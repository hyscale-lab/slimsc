Okay, so I've got this question about detecting planets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star, causing a dip in brightness. But the probability of that happening depends on the planet's orbital distance and the star's size, right?

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because according to Kepler's laws, the orbital period is related to the distance from the star. The formula I recall is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³, but since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate P² proportional to a³. So if P1 is 1/3 of P2, then a1 should be (1/3)^(2/3) times a2. Wait, let me calculate that. Let's see, (1/3) is about 0.333, and 0.333 to the power of 0.666 is roughly 0.69. So a1 is about 0.69 times a2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

Now, the stars: Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting. Because more massive stars usually have larger radii, but in this case, same radius. So same size, but different masses.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The transit probability depends on the size of the star and the relative size of the planet's orbit. The formula for the probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by (1 / (a (1 - e²)^0.5)), but wait, no. Wait, the probability is actually proportional to (R_star / a)^2, or is it (R_star / a)? Wait, I think the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is more likely to align with our line of sight. The probability is given by (R_star / a)² * (1/(1 - e²)) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero. So the probability simplifies.

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. The geometric probability for a transit is (R_star / a
