Okay, so I've got this science question here about a mouse model study involving the GADD45G protein. Hmm. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

So, the scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G gene is overexpressed in an inducible manner. Their goal is to study the role of this protein in SARS-CoV-2 infection, specifically looking at interactions with other proteins after infection. 

They modified the gene's coding sequence to include a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. So, this is probably so they can purify the protein later using an antibody against hemagglutinin. Makes sense because that's a common approach for protein purification.

They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine. Then they selected antibiotic-resistant colonies and tested the expression level. But they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. So, something went wrong in the construct.

Looking at the problem, the provided DNA sequence is the plus strand. I need to check for any issues in this sequence that would prevent proper expression.

The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about each.

Option A: The antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So, if the HA sequence was mutated, the protein might not get properly expressed or might not be recognized for purification. But the question is why the protein isn't overexpressed. If the HA is messed up, maybe it's not expressed, but I'm not sure if that would cause no expression or just inability to purify.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon in the mRNA. If the DNA has an early stop codon, the protein would be truncated and possibly not functional. But in the given DNA, I should check for any in-frame stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA). Let me scan the sequence.

Looking through the DNA sequence, I can look for TGA, TAG, or TAA triplets as they are stop codons in DNA. Let me parse through the sequences in triplets. 

Wait, looking at the DNA sequence, it's the coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA would be complementary to this. So the mRNA would have the same sequence as the plus strand, except T becomes U. So the mRNA would have the same sequence, with T's as U's.

Wait, in DNA, the coding strand has the same sequence as the mRNA (except T instead of U). So the plus strand is the same as the mRNA. So any TGA in the DNA would be TGA in the mRNA, which is a stop codon (as TAG is also a stop).

Looking through the DNA:

Let me go through the sequence and look for any TGA, TAG, or TAA codons. Let me break the sequence into triplets.

The sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC AAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC CGG CGG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG ACC CCC GAC AA TGT GAC CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGG TGA GGAGGAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTA CGC TGA CCA GGC TTT CTG CTG CGA GAA CGA CAT CGA CAT AGT GCG CGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC AAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GCC T TGG AGA AGC TAG CCC TGG AGA AGCTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA 3'

Wait, wait, the sequence is a long string, so perhaps I should break it into triplets without the spaces. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the stop codons.

Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA. Let me scan through.

Wait, looking through the sequence:

I see the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC AAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC CGG CGG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG ACC CCC GAC AA TGT GAC CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGG TGA GGAGGAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTA CGC TGA CCA GGC TTT CTG CTG CGA GAA CGA CAT CGA CAT AGT GCG CGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC AAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GCC T TGG AGA AGC TAG CCC TGG AGA AGCTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA 

Wait, in the middle, I see TGA at positions (let me count):

Looking for TGA in mRNA; in DNA, it's TGA. So looking for TGA in the sequence.

I see 'TGA' appears in a few places. For example, near the beginning, there's "TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC..." and then later, looking for TGA:

Looking for any triplet of T-G-A.

Looking through the sequence:

At one point, I see 'TGA' in the middle: ...AGCTGAACGTGG... So that would be TGA in the mRNA, which is a stop codon. Oh, wait, but where? Let me see:

Looking at the part after 'TACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'  So the last part ends with TGA.

Wait, the entire sequence ends with ...GAGTGA3'.

So the last codon is TGA. Because the last few nucleotides are GAGTGA. The last triplet is T-G-A.

Wait, the sequence ends with ...GAGTGA3'.

So in the DNA, the last triplet is TGA. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So the gene ends with TGA, which is a stop codon.

But wait, the construct is supposed to be the coding sequence for GADD45G with an HA tag at the N-terminus. So the construct should end
