Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, but I'm not sure if the masses matter here because the question is about elemental abundances and the ratio of silicon. Maybe the masses are just extra info unless it's about something like metallicity affecting the star's evolution, but the problem doesn't seem to involve that.

The given data are the elemental abundances using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. The data points are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So the abundance of silicon relative to iron in Star_1 is 0.3 higher.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Magnesium relative to silicon in Star_2 is 0.3.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So the iron abundance relative to hydrogen in Star_1 is the same as the Sun. Oh wait, [Fe/H] is the metallicity. So Star_1 has solar metallicity for iron.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Similarly, for Star_2, magnesium relative to hydrogen is solar.

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^-4.5.
Wait, wait, wait. The notation is 12 + log10(nX/nH) = value. So for the Sun, for Fe, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Same for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7. So log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5. So nMg/nH=10^-5.

The question is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, so (nSi_1 / nSi_2).

Hmm. So I need to find the silicon abundance in each star relative to H, and then take the ratio.

Wait, but how?

I think the [X/Y] notation is logarithmic, where [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. Alternatively, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y] = log( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun / nY_sun) ) )

Alternatively, sometimes it's defined as log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun, so [X/Y] = log10( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun / nY_sun) )

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1
