Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the correct formula for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Hmm, let's see what information I've been given.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows peaks for an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an ether-like linkage. So the structure must have an ester functional group somewhere.

Then, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Two of them are aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the aromatic protons would typically show as two sets of signals. Wait, di-substituted benzene can have different substitution patterns. Like para, meta, or ortho. For example, in para substitution, you'd have two sets of equivalent protons, each as a singlet. But if the substituents are different, like in ortho or meta, the splitting would be different. Wait, but the question says two signals for aromatic-H, so maybe it's para substitution with identical substituents? Or maybe the substituents are different but in a way that symmetry causes two signals. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I'll come back to that.

Next, two signals correspond to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on a double bond, so maybe this is from an ester group. Esters have an R-O-CO-O-R structure, but wait no, esters are RCOOR'. Oh, right, so if there's an ester, like ArCOOR, then the OR part would have protons, but if the R is an alkyl group, those would be simple. Wait, but the NMR has vinyl protons, which are on a double bond. Oh, perhaps the ester is part of a conjugated system. Like maybe it's an aromatic ring with a substituent that's an ester, and maybe a vinyl group attached elsewhere.

Wait, the structure could be something like an aromatic ring with an ester substituent and another substituent that's a vinyl group. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with one substituent as an ester and another as a vinyl group. Wait, but the NMR says two signals for vinyl-H. So maybe the vinyl is part of a group that's attached to the ring, like an ethenyl group (CH₂CH₂COO?), but that doesn't seem right. Or maybe it's an allyl group attached somewhere.

Wait, considering the ester group, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. Like, for example, if one substituent is an ester (like OCOOR) and another is a vinyl group (like CH₂CH₂?), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the substituent might be a vinyl ester. Wait, like CH₂CH₂COO something?

Another thought: the ester group is in an ortho position, and the other substituent is a vinyl group, perhaps as part of a side chain. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester attached to another group with vinyl protons.

Wait, let's think about the NMR details. The vinyl-Hs: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That suggests coupling with adjacent
