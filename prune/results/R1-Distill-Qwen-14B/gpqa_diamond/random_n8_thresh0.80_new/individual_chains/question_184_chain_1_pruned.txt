Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let's break that down.

First, I need to figure out the structure. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, actually, numbering them: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So, the substituents are at the 1, 2, and 3 positions. Wait, but benzene is a ring, so the positions are relative. Let me draw this out.

So, if it's 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro, that's like a meta arrangement between ethoxy and nitro, but adjacent to the tert-butyl. Alternatively, maybe the numbering is such that the substituents are adjacent in a certain way. Well, perhaps the key is the order in which substituents are added, because the order can affect the positions due to directing effects.

Benzene is the starting material. The substituents we're adding are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups.

Let's think about the reactivity of the substituents. Nitro groups are meta directors, while ethoxy is an ortho/para director. Tert-butyl is a bulky group, but it's an alkyl group, so it's an ortho/para director as well.

Wait, nitro is meta, ethoxy is para/ortho, and tert-butyl is also para/ortho. So, when adding substituents, the order will determine where each group ends up.

Let me plan the steps. I need to add three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. But wait, the target has all three. So, the synthesis steps must involve adding each group in a specific order, using the correct directing.

But how?

Let me think about the possible steps. The options given are various sequences of reactions. Each option lists a series of reactions, so I need to see which sequence leads to the correct product.

Looking at the options, each starts with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3, which is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, wait! Friedel-Crafts alkylation tends to give the most stable carbocation, which can lead to rearrangements. Also, tert-butyl chloride is a good alkylating agent because it's bulky, but in Friedel-Crafts, it's more likely to form the t-butyl carbocation directly, so no rearrangement.

So, step i) in all options is tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3. That's an electrophilic substitution: benzene reacts with t-butyl chloride in the presence of AlCl3 to form t-butyl benzene.

So after step i, we have t-butyl benzene.

Next, each option does different steps. Let's look at the target. We have ethoxy, t-butyl, and nitro groups. Nitro is a strong meta director, ethoxy is ortho/para.
