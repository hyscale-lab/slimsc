Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slowly.

The question says that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

First, I think I should find out the concentrations after dilution and then during the titration.

Wait, let's start with the initial dilution. When you mix equal volumes of acid and water, the concentration halves, right? So original volume is 20 cm³, 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (20 cm³ * 0.05 M) / 40 cm³ = (1) / (40) = 0.025 M. So, the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So, for each mole of NaOH added, a mole of CH3COOH is neutralized to form the acetate ion.

At 25% titration, how much NaOH is added? Wait, what's the volume of NaOH at 25%? Wait, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So let's compute moles of acetic acid first.

Moles of acetic acid initially: volume (L) * Molarity. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles.

Wait, wait, but after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M in 40 cm³. So the moles are same as before, because dilution doesn't change moles, just concentration. So 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 moles.

So, to find the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence: moles = Molarity * Volume → Volume = moles / Molarity. So 0.001 / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

25% titration: that's 25% of the way to equivalence. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no. Wait, 25% of the required NaOH volume. So 25% of 10 is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So, moles of acetic acid that have reacted: 0.00025. So remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of acetate ion formed: 0.00025.

But wait, the total solution volume at this point is original diluted volume (40 cm³) plus NaOH added (2.5 cm³). So 42.5 cm³ total. Hmm, wait, but maybe it's easier to compute concentrations and use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

Wait, but what is pKa? Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1/1.85) + 5 → log(0.5405) +5 ≈ (-0.269) +5 = 4.731.

So pKa is approximately 4.73.

At 25% titration, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (n_A-)/(n_HA) = (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) = 4.253. Hmm, about 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me think about the dilution again. Wait, the initial solution is 0.025 M acetic acid in 40 cm³. Then, when adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume becomes 42.5 cm³.

Wait, but for the Henderson equation, I used the mole ratio, which is the same as concentration ratio because the same volume is present in both (since they're in the same solution). So yes, the ratio is 1/3, so the calculation is correct.

So pH at 25% is around 4.25, so option A is 4.26, which is very close. But let me proceed to check the equivalence point as well.

At equivalence point: all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, wait, that's a very small Kb, which should give a slightly basic solution. Wait, but wait, that Kb is 5.4e-10, which is a very weak base, so pH should be just above 7.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid (acetic acid), so it's a weak base. So when it's in solution, it will hydrolyze, making the solution slightly basic. So the pH should be around 8 or so.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it accurately.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.001 moles) has been converted to acetate ion. The total volume is 40 cm³ (original) + 10 cm³ (equivalence point volume) = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

So using Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-], we can set up:

Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02, since Kb is very small.

So x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x^2 = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-1
