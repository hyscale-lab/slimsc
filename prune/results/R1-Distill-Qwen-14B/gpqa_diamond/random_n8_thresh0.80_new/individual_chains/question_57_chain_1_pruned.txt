Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the optical theorem or something like that. Let me try to recall. The scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics and phase shifts. But since the question is about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, maybe we're looking at the forward direction, which is when θ is zero degrees.

Oh, right! In the case of elastic scattering, the scattering amplitude in the lab frame can be written using the partial wave expansion. The general form is f(θ, φ) = sum over l ( (something with phase shifts δ_l) times Y_{l,m}(θ, φ) ), where m is the azimuthal quantum number. But since the problem is about the forward direction, θ is 0, so for each l, the spherical harmonic Y_{l,m}(0, 0) would be... Well, I think for m=0, Y_{l,0} at θ=0 is sqrt( (2l +1)/(4π) ) * something. Wait, no, more precisely, Y_{l,0}(θ, φ) is sqrt( (2l+1)/(4π) ) * P_l^0 (cosθ), where P_l^0 is the Legendre polynomial. So at θ=0, cosθ is 1, so P_l^0(1)=1 for all l. So Y_{l,0}(0,0) is sqrt( (2l+1)/(4π) ) * 1.

But the scattering amplitude's imaginary part in the forward direction is given by (k/(2m)) times the sum over l of (sin(2δ_l)) * something... Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the formula.

Oh right, the scattering amplitude for spin-0 particles (like electrons in this case? Wait, no, electrons are spin-1/2, but maybe the problem is simplified. Or perhaps we're assuming the spin is integrated out or something.) Anyway, the general formula for the imaginary part of the amplitude is (k/(2m)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ sin(2δ_l) * (2l +1)/(4π). Wait, no, I think the formula is (k/(2m)) * (1/(2π)) * sum_{l=0}^\infty sin(2δ_l) * (2l +1), because the cross-section formula involves |f|^2, but here we're just looking for the imaginary part. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the differential cross-section is given by (|f|^2) = (1/(k^2)) * sum_{l} |f_l|^2, where f_l is the partial wave amplitude, which is given by e^{2iδ_l} (something with (k/(2m)) * something else). Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should approach this step by step. The scattering amplitude f is given by the partial wave expansion: f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ sum_{m=-l}^l f_{l,m} Y_{l,m}^*(θ, φ). For spin-0 particles, the amplitude would be purely real or have some phase shifts. But electrons are spin-1/2, so I'm not sure if the phase shift approach applies directly. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem says "ignore the rest of the phase shifts," which probably means we're only considering the given phase shifts and not others beyond δ_4.

Wait, the phase shifts given are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°. So l=0 to 4. The question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0°, so the forward direction.

I think the formula for the imaginary part of the amplitude in the forward direction is Im f(0) = (k/(2m)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ sin(2δ_l) * (2l + 1). Wait, I'm not sure about the factors. Let me try to derive it.

The partial wave expansion for f(θ, φ) is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ sum_{m=-l}^l (2l+1) (i^l) (sin δ_l) (something) ... Wait, no, perhaps I should refer to the general form.

Another approach: The scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ [ ( (2l +1)/(4π) )^{1/2} ( e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) ] P_l (cosθ),

where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. So, for θ=0, cosθ=1, and P_l(1)=1. So f(θ=0, φ) becomes sum_{l=0}^∞ [ sqrt( (2l+1)/(4π) ) ( e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) ].

But I'm interested in the imaginary part. So let's compute Im f(0,0). So that's the imaginary part of each term summed.

Each term is sqrt( (2l+1)/(4π) ) multiplied by (e^{2iδ_l} - 1). Let's compute the imaginary part of (e^{2iδ_l} - 1). 

e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, so e^{2iδ_l} = cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). So e^{2iδ_l} -1 = (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l). The imaginary part of this is sin(2δ_l).

So Im f(0,0) is sum_{l=0}^∞ [ sqrt( (2l +1)/(4π) ) * sin(2δ_l) ].

But wait, the problem is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So perhaps the formula is Im f = (k/(2m)) * sum_l [ sin(2δ_l) * (2l +1) )/(4π) ) ] multiplied by something. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the relation between the phase shifts and the scattering amplitude. For each partial wave l, the amplitude f_l is given by f_l = (k/(2m))^{1} (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )/(2l +1). Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the partial wave amplitude is defined as f_l = ( (k/(2m)) ) * e^{2iδ_l} - 1, but I'm not sure about the exact expression.

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude f is related to the phase shifts by the formula:

f(θ, φ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ sum_{m=-l}^l [ (2l +1) ( e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) ( Y_{l,m}^* ) ]

But for the forward direction, θ=0, so Y_{l,m}(0,
