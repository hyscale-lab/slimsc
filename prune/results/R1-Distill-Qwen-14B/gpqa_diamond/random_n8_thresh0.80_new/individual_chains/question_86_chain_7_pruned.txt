Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the question says a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, looking again. Oh, no, actually, the products are each for A and B. Wait, let me read that again.

The first reaction is A treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The second reaction is B treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S)-4-ethyl... same product, but S configuration.

Hmm. So, the compounds A and B must be the same except for their stereochemistry, right? Because they're being reduced with different reagents to get enantiomers.

Wait, but let me think about the reactions. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used for reducing esters, ketones, and maybe other carbonyl groups. BH3 is typically used for hydroboration, which is a way to reduce alkenes to alcohols, but I think it can also be used in other reductions, maybe like ketones? Wait, no, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Wait, or is it the other way around? Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that
