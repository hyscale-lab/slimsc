Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident in this area, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are given, but I think the masses might not directly affect the calculation here. The important data are their elemental abundances. The given values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, and the photospheric composition of the Sun is provided: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find [Si/Star_1]/[Si/Star_2], which would be (n_Si1 / H1) / (n_Si2 / H2) = (n_Si1/n_Si2) * (n_H2/n_H1). Wait, wait. No, wait. Because the ratio is (n_Si1 / n_H1) divided by (n_Si2 / n_H2), which is (n_Si1/n_Si2) * (n_H2/n_H1).

Hmm, but wait, for both stars, they might have the same H, but no, the problem doesn't say that. Wait, no, the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are given, but I'm not sure if that's the same as [H] in the star. Wait, the [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun. Oh, right, [X/Y] = log10( (n_X/n_Y)_star / (n_X/n_Y)_sun ). So if [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means (Fe/H)_1 is equal to (Fe/H)_sun. Same for [Mg/H]_2=0, so (Mg/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_sun.

Wait, but if [Fe/H] is 0, then Fe abundance is the same as solar. So for Star_1, [Fe/H] = 0, so (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun.

But wait, H is the same as for the Sun in that ratio? Or is it the actual number of H atoms in the star? I think [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe abundance relative to H in the star) divided by (Fe/H in the Sun). So [Fe/H] = log( (Fe/H)_star / (Fe/H)_sun ). So if [Fe/H]_1 is 0, then (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun. So Fe is at solar abundance in Star_1.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the ratio of silicon atoms, so probably I need to find (n_Si1 / n_H1) divided by (n_Si2 / n_H2 ), but
