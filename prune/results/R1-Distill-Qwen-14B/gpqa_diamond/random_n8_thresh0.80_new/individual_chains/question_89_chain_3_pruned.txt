Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me think about each step and what's happening.

First step: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are provided. The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I remember is around the range for ketones (C=O stretch). So product 1 is likely an adamantane derivative with a ketone group.

Looking at the 1H NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), probably a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe oxygen since the IR suggests a ketone. The 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) is a big multiplet, which makes me think of the adamantane structure—adamantane typically has multiple equivalent quaternary carbons, but I'm not exactly sure how the splitting works here. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be another CH₂ group, perhaps part of a bridge or another structure.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so when KOH is used, it's probably an elimination reaction. Two bromides would lead to a dehydrohalogenation, but in this case, since it's a dihalide, maybe it's a double elimination. Alternatively, KOH could cause an E2 elimination, removing two bromide groups and forming a double bond. But wait, with two Br atoms, perhaps it forms an allene or a diene? But adamantane is already a pretty rigid structure.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of dehydrohalogenation to form an epoxide or a ketone. Wait, if each Br is adjacent to a CH₂ group, and KOH removes them, maybe it's a pinacol-type rearrangement. Wait, no, pinacol is when vicinal diols lose water to form ketones. Hmm.

Wait, KOH is a strong base. Maybe it's an elimination reaction forming a conjugated diene? Or perhaps the elimination leads to formation of a ketone. Let me think. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes elimination, maybe it loses two equivalents of HBr, leading to a structure with a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: when a dihalide like 1,3-dibromopropane is heated with KOH, it can undergo elimination to form propene. But in adamantane's case, the structure is more complex. So perhaps the two Br atoms are in positions that, upon elimination, form a ketone. Like, if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a quaternary carbon, then elimination would form a double bond. But wait, the IR suggests a ketone. So maybe each Br is on a CH₂ group, and when KOH removes them, each elimination forms an alcohol, but then perhaps it undergoes further reaction.

Wait, or maybe KOH is causing a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a ketone. Let me think: Structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions would be two of the bridgeheads. So if each has a Br, when KOH is added, each Br could be eliminated with a neighboring H. So elimination would form a double bond, but in the structure, perhaps leading to a bridge structure with a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the product is a diketone, but the IR would show two C=O peaks, but the IR only shows one at 1720 cm⁻¹. Alternatively, maybe it's a single ketone group.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of the formation of an epoxide. But epoxide IR would have a peak around 1250 cm⁻¹ for the C-O stretch, but here we have 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So probably not an epoxide.

Alternatively, maybe the
