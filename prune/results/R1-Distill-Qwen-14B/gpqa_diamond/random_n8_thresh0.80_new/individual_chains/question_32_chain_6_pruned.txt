Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of the collider when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out what exactly is being asked. The question is about finding the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the isotope would be Li-6 because lithium normally has 3 protons and adding 3 neutrons makes it 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the gamma factor, which is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Since v is 0.96c, let me calculate that part first.

So v is 0.96c. Let's compute v²/c²: (0.96)^2 is 0.9216. So 1 minus 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is what? Let me think—since 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me compute that accurately. 1 divided by 0.28 is roughly 3.571428... So about 3.5714.

Now, the energy of a relativistic particle is given by the total energy, which is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So the formula is E = gamma * m c². But wait, what's the rest mass here? It's the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Let me find the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. I think the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.013 atomic mass units (u). Because I remember that each proton is about 1.007 u and each neutron is about 1.0087 u. Let me check: 3 protons would be 3 * 1.007 ≈ 3.021, and 3 neutrons would be 3 * 1.0087 ≈ 3.026. Adding these gives 6.047, but wait, this can't be right because I've heard Li-6 is around 6.013 u. Hmm, maybe I'm missing the binding energy? Oh wait, the actual mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of its parts due to mass defect, so the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 u.

So the rest mass energy of the nucleus is m c², where m is 6.013 u. I need to convert this into GeV because the options are in GeV. I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.013 u would be 6.013 * 931.5 MeV. Let me compute that: 6 * 931.5 is 5589, and 0.013 *931.5 is about 12.11, so total is approximately 5601.11 MeV, which is 5.60111 GeV.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 6.013 * 931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6 *931.5 = 5589
0.013 *931.5: 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.003 *931.5=2.7945. So 9.315 +2.7945=12.1095. So total is 5589 +12.1095 =5601.1095 MeV, which is 5.6011095 GeV.

So m c² is approximately 5.6011 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma times m c². Gamma was 3.5714. So E = 3.5714 *5.6011 GeV.

Let me compute that:

3.5714 *5.6011.

Hmm, 3 *5.6011 is 16.8033.
0.5714 *5.6011: Let's compute 0.5 *5.6011=2.80055, 0.0714 *5.6011≈0.401 (since 0.07 *5.6=0.392, 0.0014 *5.6≈0.00784 → sum ~0.400). So sum for 0.5714 is about 2.80055 +0.400 ≈3.20055.

So total E ≈16.8033 +3.20055 =20.00385 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the calculation more accurately. Let's compute 3.5714 *5.6011.

Another approach: 3.5714 ≈35714/10000.

So 35714 *56011 = ?

Wait that's a big number. Maybe I should do it step by step.

Alternatively, 3.5714 *5.6011.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5 =17.857, 3.5714 *0.6 =2.14284, 3.5714 *0.0011= approx 0.00392854.

Adding them: 17.857 +2.14284=20.0 (exactly 19.99984) plus 0.003928 is approximately 20.003768 GeV.

So about 20.0038 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I approximated gamma too roughly. Let me recalculate gamma more accurately.

Wait, v =0.96c. So v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2=0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857...

So E = 3.57142857 * 5.6011095 GeV.

Let me compute that with more precision.

5.6011095 *3.57142857.

Let me compute it as:

3.57142857 is exactly 25/7. Because 3.57142857 is approximately 25/7, which is 3.57142857. Because 25 divided by 7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So,

E = (25/7) *5.6011095 GeV.

Let me compute 5.6011095 *25 = 140.0277375.

Divide by 7: 140.0277375 /7 ≈20.0039625 GeV.

So about 20.00396 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. Option A is 18.475, B is 23.069, D is 21.419. Hmm, but I'm getting about 20.004 GeV, which isn't exactly any of the options. The closest option is C at 20.132, which is higher. But wait—maybe I made a mistake in calculating the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps I should be more accurate with the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me double-check the exact value.

The exact mass of Li-6 isotope: Using the standard atomic mass of Li-6, which is about 6.01304 amu. So 6.01304 u. Then multiply by 931.5 MeV/u to get the rest mass energy.

So 6.01304 * 931.5 = ?

Calculating that:

6 *931.5 =5589.
