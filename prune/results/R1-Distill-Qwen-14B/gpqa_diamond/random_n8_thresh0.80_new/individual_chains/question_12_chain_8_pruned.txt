Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay reaction. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. The pion is stationary, which probably means its initial velocity is zero. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the products, which are the muon and the neutrino.

Hmm, wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, almost zero. But in particle physics calculations, do I consider their mass? I think in many cases, especially for light particles like neutrinos, their rest mass is negligible compared to other particles in the system. So I might assume the neutrino's mass is zero here. But I'm not entirely sure; maybe I should proceed without assuming that and see where it leads.

So the problem is a decay at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum here. The initial energy is just the rest mass energy of the pion since it's stationary: E_initial = m_pi * c². But since c is 1 in these units (because we're using MeV and MeV/c²), E_initial is just 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy will be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. So E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

But wait, the neutrino's energy would be its kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy. But if its mass is zero, then E_nu = K_nu. Similarly, E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is its rest energy plus kinetic energy: E_mu = m_mu * c² + K_mu.

But wait, the muon is a product, and the pion is at rest, so the muon must have some kinetic energy, and the neutrino as well. But since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

So let me formalize this.

Conservation of momentum:

p_pi_initial = 0 = p_mu + p_nu.

So p_mu = -p_nu, meaning their magnitudes are equal, and directions opposite.

Conservation of energy:

E_pi_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

Since E_pi_initial is just m_pi c², which is 139.6 MeV.

But E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c², but wait, in units where c=1, E = sqrt(p² + m²). Similarly for the neutrino, E_nu = sqrt( p_nu² + m_nu² ). But if m_nu is zero, E_nu = |p_nu|.

Wait, but perhaps I should write the equations in terms of variables.

Let me denote:

m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c²

m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²

m_nu = 0 (approximation)

Since the pion is at rest, initial momentum is zero. So:

p_mu = -p_nu → |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

So the magnitudes of their momenta are equal.

Now, energy conservation equation:

m_pi c² = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + sqrt( (p_nu c)^2 + (m_nu c²)^2 )

But since m_nu is zero, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p_nu c.

And since p_mu = p_nu = p (in magnitude), we can write:

m_pi c² = sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) + p c.

Let me divide both sides by c² to make it easier:

m_pi = sqrt( p² + m_mu² ) + p (c^2 units, so perhaps I should be careful with units. Wait, if I'm using units where c=1, then E is in MeV, m in MeV/c², p in MeV/c. So perhaps I should adjust the equation accordingly.)

Wait, let's make sure. Let me write everything in units where c=1. Then:

E_pi = m_pi.

E_mu = sqrt(p_mu² + m_mu²).

E_nu = p_nu.

And since p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude, opposite direction), let's call this p.

So the energy equation becomes:

m_pi = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p.
