Okay, so I've got this Lagrangian given here, and I'm supposed to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of coupling constants is important because it tells us about the renormalizability of the theory.

The Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Wait, σ_{μν} is given as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], right? Oh right, those are the antisymmetric products of gamma matrices. But I think for the purpose of finding the mass dimension, the specific form might not matter too much. What matters is the type of fields involved and the terms in the Lagrangian.

So first, I need to figure out the mass dimension of each field involved. Let me recall the mass dimensions for the standard fields. In four spacetime dimensions (since the question is about renormalizability, which is typically in 4D), the conventions are:

- Spinor fields ψ have mass dimension 3/2. Because the action is dimensionless, and the Lagrangian density has dimension 4 (since [L] = [Mass]^4 in four dimensions), then the term ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ must be dimension 4. ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ∂_μ has dimension 1, and ψ has 3/2. So 3/2 + 1 + 3/2 = 4, which works.

- The field strength tensor F^{μν} for a gauge field (like in electromagnetism) has dimension 2. Because the field tensor comes from the derivative of the gauge field A, which has dimension 1. So ∂μ Aν has dimension 2, and F^{μν} being derivatives of A, should have dimension 2.

Now, let's look at the term in the Lagrangian. L_int is proportional to κ times ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each of these components contributes to the dimension. So I need to calculate the mass dimension of the product.

First, let's compute the dimension of ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ. The σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ is essentially a product of two spinor fields and a dimensionless object. So each ψ has 3/2, so two of them make 3.

So ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ has dimension 3. Then F^{μν} has dimension 2. So the whole term (without κ) has dimension 3 + 2 =5.

But the Lagrangian L must have dimension 4 because it's integrated over four-dimensional spacetime, and the action is dimensionless. So the product of the term and κ must have dimension 4.

So [κ] + [ψ̄ σ F] = 4. But [ψ̄ σ F] is 5, so [κ] = 4 -5 = -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That would correspond to options A or C.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constants. In four dimensions, a renormalizable theory requires that the coupling constants have mass dimension ≤ 0. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension ≤ 4 to be renormalizable because the Lagrangian has dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension ≤4. So if the term has higher dimension, it's nonrenormalizable.

Wait, but wait. The coupling constants are usually in front of terms. So the term is κ times some operators. So the operator part must have a dimension ≤ 4 minus the dimension of κ. Because the entire L_int term must have dimension 4.

Wait, no. Let's think again. Each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So any interaction term in the Lagrangian is an operator of dimension 4. So in the term L = κ (operator), the operator must have dimension [L] =4 - [κ].

Wait, no, that's not right. The Lagrangian term has to have dimension 4. So if the operator part has dimension D, then κ must have dimension 4 - D so that when you multiply κ by the operator, the total is 4. So for the term to be renormalizable, the operator must have dimension ≤4. So unless the operator is of dimension D ≤4, the term could be nonrenormalizable.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the coupling constant's dimension. In four dimensions, a coupling constant with positive mass dimension makes the term nonrenormalizable because the term would have a higher dimension.

So the term in the Lagrangian is [κ][operator] =4.

The operator here is ψ̄ σ F. Which has dimension 5 as we found. So the term has dimension [κ] +5=4. So [κ] = -1.

For renormalizability, the mass dimension of the coupling must satisfy [κ] ≥ - (4 - D), where D is the spacetime dimension. Or wait, I think I'm mixing up the criteria.

Another approach: in four dimensions, a Lagrangian term is renormalizable if the dimension of the coupling constant is ≥0. Because a coupling with negative dimension would make the term have a higher dimension than 4, making it nonrenormalizable.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The term in the Lagrangian has to have dimension 4. So when the coupling has a negative dimension, that implies that the operator has a higher dimension than 4. Because [Coupling] + [Operator] =4. So if [Coupling] is negative, [Operator] must be greater than 4. Therefore, the term is nonrenormalizable.

In our case, [κ]=-1. So [Operator] =5. So the term is dimension 5, which is higher than 4. So the term is nonrenormalizable.

Wait, but wait. The operator in the Lagrangian (the term without the coupling) is ψ̄ σ F, which has dimension 5. But in the Lagrangian, it's multiplied by κ, which has dimension -1. So κ times that operator is 5 + (-1) =4. So the term itself is dimension 4. So why is it nonrenormalizable?

Wait, no. Because the term is dimension 4, but the operator (the part without the coupling) has dimension higher than 4. So the term is allowed in the Lagrangian, but the coupling would have negative mass dimension, which would imply that it's a nonrenormalizable interaction.

Because in renormalizable theories, coupling constants must have non-negative mass dimensions. Because if the coupling has a positive mass dimension, you can have superficially divergent loops that can be renormalized. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this reversed.

Actually, the renormalizability depends on the superficial degree of divergence. A term is renormalizable if the coupling has a dimension ≤ (4 - D), where D is the dimension of the operator. Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, the general rule is that in 4D, any interaction term in the Lagrangian must have a dimension ≤4. So the operator ψ̄ σ F has dimension 5. Therefore, the term is nonrenormalizable because the operator is of higher dimension.

Wait, but the term in the Lagrangian is κ ψ̄ σ F. The operator is 5, and κ is -1. So the term is 4, which is allowed. But the fact that the operator itself is of higher dimension (5) implies that the interaction is nonrenormalizable.

Because, for a term to be renormalizable, the dimension of the coupling must satisfy [κ] ≥ - (number of fields in the term) + (mass dimension in 4D). Hmm, perhaps more accurately, the term is renormalizable if the coupling has a mass dimension ≥0.

Wait, here's another approach: the mass dimension of a coupling in a renormalizable theory must be ≥0. Because, the coupling's mass dimension determines the scaling of the interaction with energy. If the dimension is negative, the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies, making the theory nonrenormalizable. Because you can't have a finite number of terms to absorb all the divergences.

So in this case, [κ]=-1. Negative, which means the interaction is nonrenormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ]=-1, and the theory is not renormalizable. So the correct option is C.


To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of fields
In four spacetime dimensions:
- The spinor field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}$ must have mass dimension 4 in four dimensions. The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ involves two spinor fields and a dimensionless $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$, so its mass dimension is:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi]_M = [\psi]_M + [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3.
\]
Including $F^{\mu\nu}$, the mass dimension of the operator $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ is:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 3 + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must have mass dimension 4, we find:
\[
[\kappa]_M + [\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
In four dimensions, a theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. This implies that the interaction term is nonrenormalizable because the coupling constant grows with energy, leading to uncontrollable divergences at high energies.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
