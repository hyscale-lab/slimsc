Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step.

The question has two parts, reactions A and B, and I need to choose the correct major products from the options given. Each part has different conditions, so I should probably tackle them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So, what kind of reaction conditions are these? Oh right, when a ketone reacts with an enolate, maybe an aldol addition or something similar. But wait, ethyl acrylate is an ester with an alpha, beta-unsaturated group. Oh, right, that's a Michael acceptor. So maybe this is a Michael addition.

Wait, but the starting material is a ketone. Could this be a conjugate addition? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is undergoing some enolate formation, which then attacks the Michael acceptor. Wait, but Michael addition is when a nucleophile (like an enolate) attacks the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So ethyl acrylate is that, so the enolate from the ketone would attack it.

Alternatively, sometimes when a ketone is treated with a strong base, it can form an enolate, which then could undergo a conjugate addition. So maybe this is a cross-aldol or some kind of addition.

Wait, the starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me visualize that structure. So the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1 (so the carbon 1 is the carbonyl). Then at position 2, there's an ethyl group, and both position 2 and 6 have methyl groups. So the structure is like a cyclohexane ring with the ketone on C1, a big substituent on C2 (ethyl and methyl), and a methyl on C6.

When I form the enolate, the base (t-BuOK) would deprotonate alpha to the carbonyl. The alpha carbons are positions 2 and possibly others adjacent. Wait, in this case, the carbonyl is at C1. So the alpha carbons are C2 and maybe others? Let me think: in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at C1, and the alpha carbons are C2 and C6 (since they're adjacent in the ring). So in this case, the substituents on C2 are a methyl and an ethyl, which makes it quite bulky.

So when t-BuOK deprotonates, it would abstract a proton from the less hindered position. But wait, the substituents on C2 are a methyl and an ethyl, so that's a lot of bulk. So the base would prefer to abstract a proton from a less hindered position, perhaps at C3, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, because the alpha protons are only on C2 and C6 for the ketone.

Wait, but the molecule is 2-ethyl-2,6-d
