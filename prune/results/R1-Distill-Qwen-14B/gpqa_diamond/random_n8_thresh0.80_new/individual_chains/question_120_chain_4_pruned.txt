Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let's think through this. The question says stars are uniformly distributed, so I'm picturing them spread out evenly in all directions. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various inverse powers of plx.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. I remember that parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, and so on. Oh right, the formula is distance = 1 / parallax.

But how does this relate to the number of stars in a given parallax range? So, the number of stars per unit parallax. Wait, the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So, for example, how many stars are there between plx and plx + dplx, where dplx is a small change.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (number per volume) is constant. So the total number of stars in a certain volume would be proportional to that volume. But wait, how does parallax relate to volume?

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, for a given parallax plx, the distance is d = 1/plx. But wait, in 3D space, the volume up to a distance d is (4/3)πd³. So, if I consider a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume of that shell is approximately 4πd² dd.

Now, since parallax is plx = 1/d. Let's make a substitution. Let me express everything in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx. Then, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. But since we're dealing with small dplx, the negative sign indicates direction, but for the volume, the magnitude is what matters.

So the volume of the shell at parallax plx with a small change in plx (dplx) would be 4π (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, let me compute that step by step.

The shell's volume is 4π d² * dd. Substituting d = 1/plx, so d² is (1/plx)^2. And dd is the change in d. Since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/(plx)^2) dplx
