Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering might matter here. Let me imagine the benzene ring: if position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are on adjacent carbons in a sort of meta arrangement? Wait, no, because 1, 2, and 3 are consecutive positions. So they're adjacent, but each substituent is in an ortho or para position relative to each other.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So on the benzene ring, positions 1, 2, and 3 each have substituents. So positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So that's like 1-OCH2CH3, 2-C(CH3)3, 3-NO2. So these are all in the ortho and para positions relative to each other. 

Now, the question is about the sequence of reactions needed to get there starting from benzene. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each with a series of
