Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 grams of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate. The temperature is 25°C. We're asked to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄^3-) in the solution. The dissociation constants Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 for H3PO4 are provided as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12 respectively.

Hmm, right. I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. H₃PO₄ is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The different species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

The solution contains KH₂PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me write down their formulas. KH₂PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O would be sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate; when it dissolves, it should dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, along with the water molecules, but I think for the purposes of calculating concentration, the water doesn't matter because it's a solvent.

Wait, so we have a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. I think this forms a buffer solution because they are adjacent species in the phosphate dissociation series. So the pH of the solution will determine the ratio of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. How does that come into play? PO4^3- is the fully deprotonated form, which is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-. So HPO4^2- can donate another proton to become PO4^3-.

Hmm, but in this solution, do we have any HPO4^2- that will deprotonate further? I think the concentration of PO4^3- will depend on the pH of the solution. If the solution is basic enough, more HPO4^2- will deprotonate to form PO4^3-.

Wait, but first, maybe I should calculate the concentrations of each salt in the solution. Let's calculate the molarity of each component.

The solution volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

For KH₂PO4:
Mass = 1.00 g
Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol
Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007344 mol
Concentration = moles / volume (L) = 0.007344 / 0.2 ≈ 0.03672 M

So [H2PO4^-] is approximately 0.03672 M.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O:
Mass = 1.00 g
Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol
Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005612 mol
Concentration = 0.005612 / 0.2 ≈ 0.02806 M

So [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.02806 M.

Now, since both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, this is a buffer solution. The pH can be determined using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But which Ka do we use here? Because H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H3PO4). Similarly, HPO4^2- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become PO4^3-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H2PO4^-).

Wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation typically applies to a pair of a weak acid and its conjugate base. So in this case, H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (acid), and the conjugate acid of HPO4^2- (base). So when we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the relevant Ka would be Ka2, because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-.

So, to find the pH of the solution, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-])

Ka2 is given as 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) → wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

Now, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02806 / 0.03672 ≈ 0.764.

Taking the log of 0.764: log(0.764) ≈ -0.115.

So pH = 7.208 + (-0.115) ≈ 7.093.

So the pH of the solution is approximately 7.09.

Now, since we're looking for the concentration of PO4^3-, we need to consider the deprotonation of HPO4^2- to PO4^3-.

The reaction is: HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+

The Ka for this reaction is Ka3, which is given as 1.8e-12. So, the expression for Ka3 is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But [H+] can be found from the pH. pH is 7.09, so [H+] = 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. pH = 7.09 → [H+] = 10^(-7.09) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.09) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.821 ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

So now, plugging the numbers into the equation for PO4^3-:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12
[HPO4^2-] = 0.02806 M
[H+] = 8.21e-8

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.21e-8)

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = (1.8 * 0.02806) * 1e-12 ≈ 0.050508 * 1e-12 = 5.0508e-14.

Then, divide by 8.21e-8:

5.0508e-14 / 8.21e-8 = (5.0508 / 8.21) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.615 * 1e-6 = 6.15e-7 M.

Wait, that's approximately 6.15e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the pH part.

Wait a second, maybe I should recheck the pH calculation because it's critical for getting [H+]. Let's redo that part.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Ka2 is 6.2e-8 → pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8)

Calculating pKa2:

log(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8) → log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02806 / 0.03672 ≈ 0.764.

log(0.764) ≈ -0.115.

So pH = 7.2076 - 0.115 ≈ 7.0926.

So [H+] is 10^-7.0926 ≈ let me calculate that more accurately. 

10^(-7.0926) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0926) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.821 → 8.21e-8 M.

So the earlier calculation of [PO4^3-] was approximately 6.15e-7 M. But option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. Hmm, but perhaps I should consider more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact pH with more precise numbers. Let me compute the ratio again.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02806 M, [H2PO4^-] = 0.03672 M.

Ratio = 0.02806 / 0.03672 ≈ 0.764.

log(0.764) = Let me compute that more accurately. Using a calculator approach:

log(0.764) ≈ let me think. Log(0.7) is about -0.1549, log(0.76) is about -0.1170, log(0.764) is around -0.115.

Wait, perhaps a calculator would give a more precise value. Alternatively, maybe I should use the natural logarithm and then convert.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a more accurate approximation. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed with the initial calculation and see if any of the options match.

Wait, in the calculation, I got [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.15e-7 M. But the options include A) 6.24e-7, which is 6.24e-7. That's pretty close. But let me recheck all the steps for any possible miscalculations.

Wait, let's recalculate the exact [PO4^3-].

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Ka3 = 1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02806 M

[H+] = 8.21e-8 M.

So:

(1.8e-12 * 0.02806) = 5.0508e-14.

Divide by 8.21e-8:

5.0508e-14 /8.21e-8 = (5.0508 /8.21) * (1e-14 / 1e-8) = 0.615 * 1e-6 = 6.15e-7 M.

Hmm, so that's 6.15e-7. But option A is 6.24e-7, which is a bit higher. Could I have made a mistake in the concentration calculations?

Wait, let me recheck the moles and concentrations.

KH₂PO4: 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol → 1/136.09 ≈ 0.007344 mol in 0.2 L → 0.03672 M. Correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol → 1/177.99 ≈ 0.005612 mol in 0.2 L → 0.02806 M. Correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the actual pH is slightly different because the solution is a mix of two salts and the buffer might have a more precise pH calculation.

Wait, Henderson-Hasselbalch is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

So, let me compute the ratio more accurately.

Ratio = 0.02806 / 0.03672 = let's compute this precisely.

0.02806 ÷ 0.03672 = ?

0.02806 / 0.03672 ≈ 0.764 (as before). Let me compute it exactly.

Compute 0.02806 ÷ 0.03672:

= (2806 ÷ 3672) × 1e-4 / 1e-4 = 2806/3672 ≈ 0.764.

Wait, maybe I can compute it more accurately with exact division.

2806 ÷ 3672: Let's compute 2806 ÷ 3672.

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 1403 ÷ 1836.

Hmm, perhaps 1836 × 0.764 = let's see.

But perhaps it's easier to compute log(0.764) more precisely.

Using a calculator, log(0.764) is approximately -0.1153.

So pH = 7.2076 - 0.1153 = 7.0923.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0923) → let me compute this more accurately.

Since 10^(-7) is 1e-7. To find 10^(-0.0923), let's compute it.

We know that log(0.82) ≈ -0.086 → so 10^(-0.086)=0.82.

But 0.0923 is a bit higher, so 10^(-0.0923) ≈ 0.814.

So [H+] is approx 8.14e-8 M.

Then, using [H+] as 8.14e-8,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.14e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.

Divide by 8.14e-8: 5.0508e-14 /8.14e-8 = (5.0508 /8.14) * 1e-6.

5.0508 ÷8.14 ≈ 0.6198.

So 0.6198e-6 → 6.198e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.20e-7 M. The option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. Could the slight discrepancy be due to rounding in the initial steps?

Alternatively, perhaps I should not approximate [H+] so roughly but use more precise calculations.

Wait, let's compute [H+] accurately using pH =7.0923.

[H+] = 10^(-7.0923) → Let me compute that more precisely.

The exponent is -7.0923.

Compute 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0923).

10^(-7) is 1e-7.

10^(-0.0923) can be computed using logarithm tables or a Taylor series. Let me think: ln(10^x) = x ln(10), but maybe it's easier to use an approximate value.

Alternatively, since ln(2)≈0.693 and ln(10)=2.3026, but perhaps it's easier to remember that 10^(-0.09) is about 0.8123, and 10^(-0.0923) would be a bit less.

Wait, let's compute it using the formula:

10^x ≈ 1 + x * ln(10) when x is small, but x is negative here.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach, but I don't have a calculator here. Alternatively, I can use the exact value from the pH.

Wait, maybe I can use the relation that 10^(-0.0923) = 1/(10^0.0923). So let's compute 10^0.0923.

0.0923 ln(10) ≈ 0.0923 * 2.3026 ≈ 0.2126.

So e^0.2126 ≈ 1.237.

So 10^(-0.0923) = 1/1.237 ≈ 0.808.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.808 ≈ 8.08e-8 M.

Now, using [H+] = 8.08e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / 8.08e-8.

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.

Divide by 8.08e-8: 5.0508e-14 /8.08e-8 = (5.0508 /8.08) * 1e-6.

5.0508 ÷8.08 ≈ 0.6258.

So [PO4^3-] = 0.6258e-6 → 6.258e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.26e-7 M.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) 6.24e-7 M.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps I should consider the activity coefficients or other factors, but I think for this problem, we can ignore that and proceed with the approximation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution is using the exact Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation but with more precise values.

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation of [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] is correct. Let me consider if there's any other factor, such as the contribution of H+ from other sources, but I think that's negligible because the solution is buffered by these two ions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the actual concentration of HPO4^2- is lower because some of it may have deprotonated to PO4^3-.

Wait, no, because the calculation for [PO4^3-] is based on the amount of HPO4^2- present and the current pH. So I think that approach is correct.

So, putting it all together, the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.24e-7 M, which is option A.

But wait, the options provided are:

A) 6.24x10^-7 M

B)5.48x10^-7 M

C)2.81x10^-7 M

D)3.97x10^-7 M

But wait, I just recalculated and got approximately 6.26e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7). So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but when I first calculated with [H+] as 8.21e-8, I got 6.15e-7, which is a bit lower than option A. The more precise [H+] gave 6.26e-7, which is very close to option A.

But perhaps I need to recheck the calculations again.

Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in the approach. Let me think another way: perhaps the solution is not considering that the HPO4^2- can donate a proton to form PO4^3-, and that the presence of H2PO4^- affects this.

But I think the approach is correct. The HPO4^2- exists in solution, and the extent to which it deprotonates to PO4^3- depends on the pH. Since the pH is around 7.09, which is higher than pKa3, more deprotonation will occur.

Wait, pKa3 is 1.8e-12 → pKa3 is about 11.74 (since pKa = -log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74). So since the solution's pH is 7.09, which is lower than pKa3, the solution is more acidic than the pKa3. Therefore, HPO4^2- would not deprotonate much, and PO4^3- concentration would be low.

Wait, wait a minute, that's a crucial point. Wait, the pH is 7.09, and pKa3 is about 11.74. So since pH < pKa3, the solution is more acidic than the pKa3, so the major species would be HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

Wait, no, wait: the reaction HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+ has a pKa3 of ~11.74. So if the pH is 7.09, which is less than 11.74, the solution is more acidic than the pKa3. Therefore, the equilibrium would favor the acid form, meaning most of HPO4^2- remains as HPO4^2-, and PO4^3- would be minimal.

Wait, but in that case, the [PO4^3-] would be very low. So why did my earlier calculation get 6.2e-7 M? Because the pH is much lower than pKa3, so the extent of deprotonation is minimal, but the presence of some [H+] would allow a small amount of PO4^3-.

Wait, but my calculation gives [PO4^3-] as about 6e-7 M, which seems low but possible.

Wait, but another way to think about it: the concentration of PO4^3- can be determined using the formula:

[PO4^3-] = [HPO4^2-] * Ka3 / [H+]

Yes, so that's correct.

Given that, and with the numbers I used, that gives 6.2e-7 M, which is option A.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because if the pH is lower than pKa3, the concentration of PO4^3- should be low, but perhaps it's not zero. So the calculation seems correct.

Another point: when I calculated the pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, I considered the ratio of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- to find the pH. But perhaps the solution's pH is influenced by other factors, like the autoionization of water, but I think that's negligible here.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is option A) 6.24e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the given data and perform the following steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the concentrations of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O
The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The masses and molar masses of the compounds are provided:

- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Mass = 1.00 g, Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007344 \, \text{mol} \)  
  Concentration = \( \frac{0.007344}{0.2} \approx 0.03672 \, \text{M} \)  
  Thus, \([H_2PO_4^-] \approx 0.03672 \, \text{M}\).

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Mass = 1.00 g, Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005612 \, \text{mol} \)  
  Concentration = \( \frac{0.005612}{0.2} \approx 0.02806 \, \text{M} \)  
  Thus, \([HPO_4^{2-}] \approx 0.02806 \, \text{M}\).

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, forming a buffer. The relevant equilibrium is:  
\[
\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \leftrightarrow \text{HPO}_4^{2-} + \text{H}^+
\]  
The \(K_a\) for this equilibrium is \(K_{a2} = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}\), so:  
\[
\text{p}K_{a2} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208
\]  
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_{a2} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]}\right)
\]  
Substitute the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log\left(\frac{0.02806}{0.03672}\right)
\]  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log(0.764) \approx 7.208 - 0.115 \approx 7.093
\]  
Thus, the pH of the solution is approximately 7.09.

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻
The equilibrium for the deprotonation of HPO₄²⁻ to PO₄³⁻ is:  
\[
\text{HPO}_4^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{PO}_4^{3-} + \text{H}^+
\]  
The \(K_a\) for this equilibrium is \(K_{a3} = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}\), so:  
\[
K_{a3} = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO}_4^{3-}]}{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}
\]  
Rearranging for \([\text{PO}_4^{3-}]\):  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{K_{a3} \cdot [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]  
From the pH, \([\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.08 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\).  
Substitute the values:  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02806)}{8.08 \times 10^{-8}}
\]  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{5.0508 \times 10^{-14}}{8.08 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Final Answer:
The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution is approximately **6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M**.  
**Answer: A**
