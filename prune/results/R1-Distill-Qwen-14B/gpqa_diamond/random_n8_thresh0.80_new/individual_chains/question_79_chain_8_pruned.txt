Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction product's NMR data. Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in epoxide ring-opening reactions, especially under certain conditions. Oh wait, right! It's often used for acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but I'm not sure about the exact details here. 

So, the product's NMR data is given. Let me look at the 1H NMR first. The signals are: δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), then some aromatic protons. The aromatic region seems a bit complex. Let's see: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). Wait, that's a lot of doublets. Maybe it's part of a substituted benzene ring with some substituents causing splitting?

The 13C NMR shows carbons at 21.3 and 28.4, which are probably methyl groups. Then a bunch of carbons in the 125-145 region, which are likely aromatic carbons, and a carbonyl at 197.7, which is probably an ester or ketone, but wait, epoxide rings typically don't have carbonyls. Hmm, maybe that's not right. Oh wait, wait! Maybe the product is an epoxide that's been opened, but the reaction conditions—could it be something else?

Wait, the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a base, I think. Or is it used for acid catalysis? No, wait, actually, that reagent is often used in epoxide ring-opening under basic conditions. Or maybe it's more about the ring-opening via a different mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, and the reaction is some kind of ring-opening to form a different structure.

Wait, but the product's NMR shows a carbonyl at 197.7. That's a high chemical shift, which makes me think of an ester or a ketone, or maybe an amide. But in the context
