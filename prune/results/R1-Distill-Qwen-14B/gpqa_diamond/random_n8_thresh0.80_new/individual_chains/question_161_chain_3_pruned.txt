Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy question. Hmm, let's see. The setup is about Mike designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules because that's better for electron microscopy—probably because fewer gas molecules mean less scattering of electrons, right?

But despite the vacuum pumps, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detected them. Mike found the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, I remember that. The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. Oh wait, or is that something else? Maybe I should think about the factors that affect the mean free path.

So, when the electron beam is turned on, Mike notices that the mean free path changes. It's now λ2 instead of λ1. But the temperature is the same, so the same T. So why would λ change?

Wait, the mean free path in a gas depends on the pressure and temperature. Lower pressure means longer mean free path because the molecules are less dense, so fewer collisions. Higher pressure, shorter mean free path. But the initial state is already a vacuum, so why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on?

Oh, perhaps the electron beam is causing some effect. Maybe the gas molecules are ionized or their behavior changes when the beam is active. Or, does the electron beam somehow cause gas molecules to scatter more?

Wait, when the electron beam is on, it could be that the electrons interact with the gas molecules. Perhaps the gas is partially ionized, which affects how the electrons scatter. Or maybe the electron beam causes some heating, but the problem says the temperature remains the same. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the pressure in the system. But wait, the initial pressure was already very low. Oh, but maybe the electrons are causing the gas molecules to move or collide more, effectively changing the mean free path.

Wait, wait. The mean free path λ is calculated based on the average distance between collisions. If the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be more likely to scatter electrons, but does that affect the gas's own collisions? Or maybe the effective pressure changes because the
