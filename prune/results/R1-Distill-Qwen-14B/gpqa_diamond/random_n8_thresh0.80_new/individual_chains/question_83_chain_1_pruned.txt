Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see what's being asked.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. So, the setup is that we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it by adding 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm. Let me think about what each part involves.

First, I'll probably need to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Then, when titrated with NaOH, I can find out how much NaOH is added at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Then, using that information, I can calculate the pH for each situation.

Wait, so let's start with the initial step: diluting the acetic acid. The initial volume is 20.00 cm³, and we add 20.00 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. So, the concentration after dilution can be found using the dilution formula C1V1 = C2V2.

C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L (20 cm³). The new volume V2 is 0.04 L (40 cm³). So C2 = (C1 * V1)/V2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04.

Calculating that: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, since we're adding equal volumes, the concentration is halved. 0.05 M divided by 2 is 0.025 M. Yep, same result.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, the mole ratio is 1:1.

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid present in the diluted solution.

So, let's compute the initial moles of acetic acid. The diluted solution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) of 0.025 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

So, the equivalence point occurs when 0.001 moles of NaOH are added.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, the volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration =
