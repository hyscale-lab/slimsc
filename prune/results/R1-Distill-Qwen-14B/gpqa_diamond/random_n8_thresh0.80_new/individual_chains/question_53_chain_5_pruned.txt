Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, that means it's a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester groups, which makes sense because esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an ether linkage (O). The presence of an ester group probably means there's an ester functional group in the molecule.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Let's break down each part. First, two signals correspond to aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents might be in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two sets. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, but if they're ortho or meta, it could be different. But the NMR shows two signals, so maybe there are two types of aromatic protons. Like, each substituent is in such a position that the aromatic ring has two distinct sets of protons.

Next, the NMR has two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on a double bond, like in an ester group. Esters have a structure like R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, actually, noâ€”esters are usually R-O-CO-R. Wait, no, the structure is RCOOR', where R and R' can be different. So, if the substituent on the benzene is an ester group, perhaps it's something like O-CO-O-R. Hmm, maybe the substituents are ester groups?

Wait, but if it's a di-substituted benzene with two ester groups, that could make sense. Alternatively, maybe one of the substituents is an ester, and the other is something else. But the IR shows an ester, so at least one ester group is present. Maybe both substituents are esters? Or perhaps one is an ester and another is something else that doesn't interfere with the ester IR peak.

Wait, but the NMR has two types of vinyl protons. Vinyl protons are typically in an environment like a double bond. So, maybe one of the
