Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem starts with Compound A. Its proton NMR has two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting (multiplicity) tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet (four peaks) means each is next to three others.

Wait, but also, the number of protons each signal represents can give clues about the structure. Let's think: 6H as a triplet. That sounds like two sets of three Hs, each next to another set of two Hs? Or maybe it's a methyl group attached to something that's next to another CH2 group. Because a triplet for 6Hâ€”maybe two CH3 groups next to a CH2.

Wait, the triplet is 6H. So each of the two CH3 groups has 3H, and they are next to a CH2 group (which would be 2H). Because when a CH3 is next to a CH2, the CH3 protons would split into a quartet (since each H in CH3 is next to two Hs in CH2?), wait no. Wait, the splitting comes from neighboring equivalent protons. So if a CH3 is next to a CH2, each H in CH3 is adjacent to 2 H's in CH2. So the CH3 would be a quartet. But the first signal is a triplet, so maybe it's a group of 6H as a triplet. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, let's think about ethyl groups. An ethyl group has a CH2CH3. The CH3 would typically be a triplet because it's next to the CH2 (which has two Hs). But wait, no, the CH3 would be a triplet because each H in CH3 is next to two Hs in CH2. So the CH3 in an ethyl group is a triplet. And the CH2 in an ethyl group is a quartet because each H is next to three Hs (the three in the CH3). Wait, no, wait, the CH2 is next to the CH3. Each CH2 H is adjacent to three Hs (from CH3), so the CH2 becomes a quartet.

But
