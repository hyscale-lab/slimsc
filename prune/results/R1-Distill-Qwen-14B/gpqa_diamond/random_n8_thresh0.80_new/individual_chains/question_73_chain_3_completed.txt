Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed and the total energy of the system.

First, I need to find the relative speed. Oh right, when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them normally because of the Lorentz factor. The formula for relative velocity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)).

So let's plug in the values. v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So v_rel = (0.6c -0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.6c -0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) → 1 -0.3 = 0.7. So the denominator is 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 → which is (1/7) c ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as v_rel.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma * m c². So I need to calculate each of their energies and sum them.

Let me calculate gamma for each. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²)/(c²)).

First astronaut: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c.

v = 0.6c → v² = 0.36c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 -0.36=0.64 → sqrt(0.64)=0.8 → gamma =1/0.8=1.25.

So his energy is gamma * mass *c² → 1.25 *2m *c²= 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c.

v =0.5c → v²=0.25 c².

1 - v²/c² = 0.75 → sqrt is sqrt(0.75)= approx 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.866 ≈1.1547.

So his energy is 1.1547 *3m *c² = approx 3.4641 mc².

Adding the two energies: 2.5 +3.4641 =5.9641 mc². That's about 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B has E=4.96, which is lower. So option C matches the E calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check the energy calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in gamma calculations.

Gamma for first astronaut: 1.25 is correct. 2m*1.25=2.5 m. Second astronaut: 1.1547 *3m = about 3.464 m. Sum is about 5.964 m c².

Yes, that seems correct. So the total energy is about 5.96 mc². And the relative speed is 0.14c. So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 - \frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
\]

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut
Mass \(= 2m\), velocity \(= 0.6c\):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

Energy:

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut
Mass \(= 3m\), velocity \(= 0.5c\):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

Energy:

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.4641mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.4641mc^2 \approx 5.9641mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\), and the total energy is \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: C**
