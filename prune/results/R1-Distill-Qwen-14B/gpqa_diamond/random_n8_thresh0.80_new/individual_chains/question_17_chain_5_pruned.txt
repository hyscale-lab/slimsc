Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex is usually written as CaY²- where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. The formation constant, Kf, is given here as 5e10. Oh wait, but wait, the problem says K is given as KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10. I think that's the formation constant, Kf. So Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

The solution has a 0.02 M concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex. Since it's stochiometric, I think that's the concentration of the complex, [CaY²-], which equals 0.02 M. The question is asking for [Ca²+].

So, the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaY²-. The Kf is 5e10.

Assuming that the solution is ideal, maybe we can assume that the concentration of free EDTA is negligible compared to the complex, or maybe we can make an approximation here.

Wait, but wait, how does the concentration of the complex relate to the concentrations of the individual ions? Let me think.

The
