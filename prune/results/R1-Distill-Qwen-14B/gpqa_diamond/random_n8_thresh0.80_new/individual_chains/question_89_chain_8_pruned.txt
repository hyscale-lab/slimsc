Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on. 

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically forming an alkene via an E2 mechanism. So, heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH should give an alkene. The product is a light yellow solid, which makes sense because alkenes are often less polar and solids at room temperature, especially if they're strained or have a rigid structure like adamantane.

Looking at the NMR spectrum of product 1: The peaks are at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which usually signifies a carbonyl group. Wait, that's a bit confusing because I thought elimination would give an alkene, not a carbonyl. Oh, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? No, epoxides have different NMR features, like a triplet around 3.5â€“4.5 ppm. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone or an ester, but that would require more than just elimination.

Wait, wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH. If it's a vicinal dihalide, elimination would form an alkene. But maybe the KOH isn't just eliminating; perhaps it's a substitution reaction? No, because substitution would require a good leaving group, but with two leaving groups nearby, elimination is more likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But no, epoxidation usually involves an peracid, not KOH. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, which is a strong base, maybe it's not elimination but rather a dehydrohalogenation leading to a carbonyl. Oh, wait! Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the reaction. Let me think again. When you have a dihalide, and you eliminate two molecules of HX, you get an alkene. So product 1 should be an alkene.

But wait,
