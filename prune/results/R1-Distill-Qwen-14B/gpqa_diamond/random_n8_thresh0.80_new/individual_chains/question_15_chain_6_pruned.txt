Okay, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Both planets are Earth-like and have the same mass. But their orbital periods and the host stars' properties differ.

Let me think. The transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our perspective, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the planet's orbit.

Wait, the formula for the probability of a transit is something like (R_planet / R_star)², but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's more about the orbital plane's alignment. Oh right, the transit probability depends on the size of the star and the planet, and the size of the planet's orbit.

I remember that the transit probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)² * (a/(2R_s)) ), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, another approach: the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a)), but I'm not certain. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the orbital inclination. For a transit to occur, the planet's orbit must align edge-on relative to us. The probability is higher when the star is larger relative to the planet's orbital distance, because there's a higher chance the planet's path will cross our line of sight.

Another thought: The transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a)) * something else. Wait, maybe I should look up the formula, but since I can't, I'll try to derive it.

The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star that the planet can block, when projected onto the sky, compared to the area of the planet's orbit as seen from Earth. So, the probability P is (Area of star) / (Area of planet's orbital plane at Earth's perspective). Wait, no, that's not exactly right because the planet's path is a circle, and the observer's position affects the chance of alignment.

Wait, more accurately, the probability that a randomly oriented orbit will result in a transit is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. Because the planet's orbit is a circle, and the transit occurs only when the planet's orbital plane is such that it passes in front of the star. So the probability P is (d_star) / (d_orbital), where d is the diameter.

So, d_star = 2 * R_s
