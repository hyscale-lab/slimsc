Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think this through step by step.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Oh wait, I remember that in a star's photosphere, under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms depends on the temperature. The higher the temperature, the more excited the atoms are because thermal energy is higher.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that number looks familiar. Oh, 1.38 is the Boltzmann constant times something? Let me recall—the Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, right! So the energy difference ΔE is k*T, maybe? Or wait, no, the energy difference is a given value, so perhaps it's related to the excitation energy.

Wait, the problem says the energy difference is about 1.38e-23 J. So that's probably equal to k*T, but how? Because k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so if ΔE = k*T, then T would be ΔE / k. Wait, but ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which would make T = (1.38e-23)/(1.38e-23) = 1 K? That seems too low for a star. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking about this the wrong way.

Wait, perhaps the excitation of the atoms is about their ionization or electron transitions, which depend on temperature. The excitation is the population of higher energy levels relative to the lower ones. So the fraction of atoms in an excited state is given by the Boltzmann factor: n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ).

So the ratio of excitation in star_1 to star_2 is 2:1. So for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2.

Let me denote the ratio as n1/n2 = 2. So,

n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Because n_upper is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), so for star 1, it's exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star 2, it's exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So the ratio (n1/n2) = exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) )

Wait, no, let me redo that step. Let me write it correctly.

n1/n2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] 

Which simplifies to exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Factor out ΔE/(k):

n1/n2 = exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

We know the ratio n1/n2 is 2, so:

2 = exp( ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] )

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) )

Let me rearrange that:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

Wait, because 1/T2 -1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So, substituting that:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

But wait, what's ΔE/k? Since ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE/k is (1.38e-23)/(
