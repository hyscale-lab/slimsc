Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. Hmm, I remember that cyclohexenones are common in organic synthesis. The substituents here are a hydroxyl group on carbon 4 and the ketone on carbon 1. The configuration is S, which I need to keep in mind because stereochemistry is probably going to play a role here.

Step 1: This compound is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine. I think this is a protection reaction. Triethylamine is a base, so it likely deprotonates something. tert-BDMS is a silylating agent, so it probably protects the hydroxyl group. So product 1 would be the silyl ether of the starting material. The hydroxyl on C4 becomes a silyl ether, like O-TBDMS. So the structure now has a TBS group where the hydroxyl was. The rest of the molecule remains the same, including the ketone.

Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide. Ph2CuLi is a strong base, a Gilman reagent. I remember that when you have a ketone, especially in a cyclic system like a cyclohexenone, the base can abstract a proton alpha to the carbonyl. The position alpha here would be the carbons next to the ketone, which are C2 and C6. But wait, wait. The starting material is 4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. So the ring is cyclohexene with the ketone on C1 and the enone system. So the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the alpha positions are C2 (since C1 is the ketone) and C6. But with the enone, the double bond is C2-C3, so C2 is adjacent to both the ketone and the double bond.

Wait, but when using Ph2CuLi, which is a strong base, it's going to deprotonate the most acidic alpha hydrogen. In enolates, the alpha protons are acidic. But with the ring structure, the positions might influence where deprotonation occurs. Alternatively, maybe the silyl ether is in a position that directs where the base acts.

Let me think. The starting material after silylation is 4-TBS-cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The Ph2CuLi will abstract a proton alpha to the carbonyl. The possible alpha positions are C2 and C6. But the enone is at C2-C3, so C2 is already in conjugation with the carbonyl. Deprotonating C2 would form an enolate, but wait, the double bond is between C2 and C3, so C2 is already spÂ² hybridized. Hmm, maybe the base abstracts a proton from C3 instead? Wait, because the enone system can have some conjugation, so the alpha protons are at C2 and
