Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the Pz operator. Hmm, let's see. I remember from my studies that the uncertainty principle relates the variance of an operator to the expectation values. So the uncertainty ΔPz is the square root of the variance, right?

The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, so measuring Pz would give me one of its eigenvalues.

Wait, I need to find ΔPz. The formula I think is ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²). Since the state is a vector, I'll need to compute the expectation values of Pz and Pz squared.

So first, let me write down the matrix for Pz. Oh right, the matrix for Pz is diagonal because it's in its eigenbasis. It looks like:

Pz =
[ ħ   0    0
  0   0    0
  0   0  -ħ ]

The state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. I should check if this is normalized. Let me compute the sum of the squares: (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2; 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Okay, normalized.

Now, to find ⟨Pz⟩, I need to compute ψ† Pz ψ. Since Pz is diagonal, this should be straightforward. Each component of ψ is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of Pz and then summed.

So, the components of ψ are ψ1 = -1/2, ψ2 = 1/√2, ψ3 = -1/2.

⟨Pz⟩ = ψ1* * P_z11 * ψ1 + ψ2* * P_z22 * ψ2 + ψ3* * P_z33 * ψ3.

Wait, P_z22 is 0, so the middle term drops out.

So,
⟨Pz⟩ = (-1/2)* ħ * (-1/2) + (1/√2)* 0 * (1/√2) + (-1/2)* (-ħ) * (-1/2)
Let me compute each term:
First term: (-1/2)(-ħ/2) ? Wait, no, wait. Wait, P_z11 is ħ. So first term is ( (-1/2) ) * ħ * (-1/2 ). That would be ħ*(1/4) = ħ/4.

Third term: (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = (-1/2)(1/2) ħ → (-1/4) ħ.

So adding them: (ħ/4) + (-ħ/4) = 0. So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero. Interesting.

Now, ⟨Pz²⟩. Since Pz is diagonal, Pz² is just the square of each diagonal element:

Pz² =
[ ħ²   0    0
  0    0    0
  0    0   ħ² ]

So ⟨Pz²⟩ is ψ† Pz² ψ.

Again, same process. Each component squared:

ψ1² * ħ² + ψ2² * 0 + ψ3² * ħ².

Wait, no, actually, it's |ψ1|^2 * (P_z11)^2 + |ψ2|^2 * (P_z22)^2 + |ψ3|^2 *(P_z33)^2.

Because Pz² is diagonal with entries (ħ², 0, ħ²).

So,

|ψ1|² = (
