Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration. Hmm, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand the setup.

Alright, we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, so first I should probably find out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. Let me think about that.

The initial volume is 20 cm³ and it's 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the new volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration is moles / new volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. 20 mL of 0.05 M is 1 mmol (because 0.05 M is 0.05 mmol/mL, times 20 mL is 1 mmol). Diluted to 40 mL, so concentration is 1 mmol / 40 mL = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's correct.

Next, the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. So the equivalence point will be when moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution are 1 mmol (0.001 mol). So, moles of NaOH needed for equivalence point is 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 1
