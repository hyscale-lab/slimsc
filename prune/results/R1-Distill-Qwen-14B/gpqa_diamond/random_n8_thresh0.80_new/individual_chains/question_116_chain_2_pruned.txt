Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me break it down step by step. 

So, the question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum. The NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm integrating for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the integration tells us about the number of protons. So 6H as a triplet and 4H as a quartet. 

What kind of structure would give that? Well, a triplet could be something like two sets of equivalent CH3 groups. Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted something where each group has three protons. Like perhaps two CH3 groups adjacent to a CH2. Because a triplet suggests each of the neighboring protons is next to two others. Or wait, in a triplet, each proton is split by two neighboring protons. So maybe it's a CH2 group next to a CH3. Let me think: if you have a CH3 connected to a CH2, the CH3 would be a triplet because each H on CH3 is next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. And the CH2 would be a quartet because each H on CH2 is next to three Hs from the adjacent CH3. Wait, no, that would actually be a quartet for the CH3 and triplet for the CH2. Wait, noâ€”maybe I got that reversed. Let me think again.

Wait, the triplet is at 0.9, which is typically a CH3 group attached to something else. So if you have two CH3 groups attached to a CH2, that could explain it. Because each CH3 would be adjacent to the CH2. So each CH3 group's protons would be split into a triplet by the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So for each CH3, the triplet would integrate to 3H each, so two CH3 groups would make 6H as the triplet. Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm is 4H. That would be the two CH2 groups, each with two Hs. Wait, but a quartet suggests that each H is next to three others. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a di-substituted something else.

Wait, another possibility is that the quartet is from a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. For example, if you have a CH2-CH2 group, each CH2's protons would be a quartet because each is next to two Hs on each adjacent CH2. Wait, no, wait. If a CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, each CH2's Hs would be split into a triplet. Because each H is next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So that would be a triplet for each. Hmm, maybe I should think of a different structure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the quartet is from a CH2 group adjacent to a CH3. So if you have CH2-CH2-CH3, the middle CH2 would be adjacent to another CH2 on one side and a CH3 on the other. Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the quartet is from a CH2 group that's next to a CH2 group with three Hs? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's think of a common structure with two signals
