Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. In the classical case, it's F = -kx. But wait, this question is relativistic, so I can't just use the classical equations of motion; I need to consider how relativity affects the solution.

The problem asks for the maximum speed of the mass. I think in the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², so the kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv², which would equal (1/2)kA². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), so option C. But wait, that's the classical case, and this is relativistic, so I probably have to adjust that.

In relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic energy but total energy. The total energy of the oscillator would include both the kinetic and potential energy. But wait, in relativity, things get a bit more complicated because kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)m v²; it's (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So I think the maximum speed would occur when the potential energy is at its maximum, which is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is also at its maximum. But wait, the total mechanical energy in the classical case is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, energy considerations are different. Let's think about the energy conservation.

At maximum displacement A, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. When the mass passes through the equilibrium position, the velocity is maximum, so all the energy is kinetic. But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy is a part of the total energy. So the total energy would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, but the problem states that it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law. Hmm, I'm not too familiar with the exact relativistic form of the oscillator's equation. I think the potential energy in a relativistic context might still be (1/2)kx², but the equations of motion would involve relativistic mass or use the relativistic form of momentum.

Alternatively, maybe the approach is to consider the energy and set the total energy equal to the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy when the mass is at maximum displacement. Wait, no: when the mass is at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy would be just the rest energy plus the potential energy.

Wait, no. In relativity, the total energy E is γmc², which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So at maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, so E = mc² + (1/2)kA². But wait, that can't be right because (1/2)kA² is the potential energy. Hmm, maybe the potential energy is (1/2)kA², so the total energy is (1/2)kA² + mc²? Or perhaps the system's total energy is the sum of rest energy and the potential energy.

Wait, maybe I should consider the conservation of energy in the relativistic scenario. The total energy at maximum displacement would be the rest energy plus the potential energy. At the equilibrium position, the velocity is maximum, so the energy is all kinetic plus rest energy. Wait, but that's not right. Because in the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy would be just kinetic plus rest.

Wait, no, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². So when x = A, potential energy is (1/2)kA². At that point, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA² + rest energy (mc²?), but I think that's not right because in classical mechanics, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², but in relativity, the total energy would include mc² as rest energy plus kinetic. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let me think again. The total mechanical energy in classical terms is (1/2)kA², which is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, mechanical energy is different. The rest mass energy is mc², and then the oscillator's energy comes into play.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is still (1/2)k x², but the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the oscillator's potential plus kinetic energies. No, that can't be right because the rest mass is a separate concept.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the total energy E of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy and the mechanical energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA², because at maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)kA² and kinetic is zero. So when the mass is at the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is the rest energy plus the kinetic energy.

But wait, that would imply that:

At x = A, E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At x = 0, E = γ mc² = mc² + K, where K is the kinetic energy.

So equate the two:

γ mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Which gives γ = 1 + (1/(2 mc²)) (k A²).

So, γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, that makes sense. Because when the system is at maximum displacement, it's at rest, so γ is 1, and the rest energy is mc². The potential energy is (1/2)kA², so the total energy is mc² + (1/2)kA².

But wait, I'm not sure if this is the correct way to model it. Because in relativity, the potential energy might not just add to the rest energy. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is part of the total energy, but the rest mass is separate. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of conservation of energy, total energy, including rest mass.

Wait, considering that the system's total energy when the mass is at position x is the sum of its kinetic energy and the potential energy due to the spring, plus its rest mass energy. So, E_total = K + U_spring + mc². But wait, that might not be correct. Because in relativity, the potential energy may be considered as part of the total energy, but perhaps the rest mass energy is already accounted for.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the system's energy as E = γ mc² + (1/2) k x², treating the potential energy as part of the system's energy. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's think about the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator. The force is F = -k x. But relativity introduces complications into the equation of motion because the mass increases with velocity. The equation of motion might be more complex than the classical F = m a.

In special relativity, the momentum p is γ m v, where γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The force F is dp/dt. So F = d/dt (γ m v) = m d/dt (γ v). But F is also given as -k x. Hmm, that's a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use energy considerations. The maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, but in a relativistic context.

Wait, but in the classical case, the maximum speed is achieved when all the potential energy is converted to kinetic, which is option C. But with relativity, the kinetic energy increases as γ increases. So the maximum speed would be less than the classical case? Or maybe not, because the problem includes a square root with a c term.

Wait, but let's think again about the energy. At maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. The potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy E is (1/2)kA² plus the rest mass energy mc², because E includes all forms of energy.

At the equilibrium position (x=0), the potential energy is zero, so all the energy is in kinetic energy and the rest mass. So E = γ mc². Setting them equal:

γ mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc².

Subtract mc² from both sides: γ mc² - mc² = (1/2)kA².

Factor out mc²: mc² (γ - 1) = (1/2)kA².

So γ -1 = (k A²) / (2 m c²).

But γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, let me write that down:

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but that may not make sense because (k A²)/(2 m c²) could be a large number, making γ larger than 1. But for small amplitudes, where k A² is small, γ approaches 1, which is correct.

So, solving for v_max. We know that γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1 / sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as term D, so D = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

1 / sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2/c^2) = 1 + D.

Take reciprocal on both sides:

sqrt(1 - (v_max^2/c^2)) = 1 / (1 + D).

Square both sides:

1 - v_max^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + D)^2.

Rearranging,

v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - [1/(1+D)^2] = [ (1 + D)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + D)^2.

Expand numerator:

(1 + 2D + D² - 1 ) = 2D + D².

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * (2D + D²) / (1 + D)^2.

But D is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), which is small for typical cases (since c is large), but let's proceed.

Wait, but let's compute (2D + D²)/(1 + D)^2.

Factor numerator and denominator:

(2D + D²) = D(2 + D).

Denominator: (1 + D)^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ D (2 + D) ] / (1 + D)^2.

But D is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ]

Hmm, that looks complicated. Let me see if I can simplify it.

Let's factor out (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) from numerator and denominator.

Let me denote E = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ E (2 + E) ] / (1 + E )^2.

Expanding the numerator: E(2 + E) = 2 E + E².

Denominator: (1 + E)^2 = 1 + 2 E + E².

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (2 E + E²) ] / (1 + 2 E + E² )

= c^2 * [ E (2 + E) ] / (1 + E)^2.

Hmm, but perhaps I can factor this differently.

Let me write it as:

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ E (2 + E) ] / (1 + E )^2.

= c^2 * [ E (2 + E) ] / ( (1 + E)^2 )

Maybe I can write this as c^2 multiplied by [ E (2 + E) ] / (1 + E)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the expression to match one of the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m) )^2 )

Wait, but that expression inside the square root seems more complicated. Let me compute 1 - (k A²)/(2 m).

Wait, but in our earlier equations, D = (k A²)/(2 m c^2), so (k A²)/(2m) would be D c².

So, 1 - (k A²)/(2 m) = 1 - D c².

But that seems different from what we have in the options.

Looking at option B:

v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. When I set up the equation:

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Which I can write as 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + D, where D = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + D)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + D)^2.

= [ (1 + D)^2 -1 ] / (1 + D)^2.

Which simplifies to [ 1 + 2D + D² - 1 ] / (1 + D)^2.

= (2D + D²) / (1 + D)^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2D + D²) ) / (1 + D) )

= c * sqrt( D (2 + D) ) / (1 + D )

Hmm, but I don't see that in the options. Let's look back.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my energy approach. Let me try another angle.

In the relativistic case, the potential energy of the oscillator is still (1/2) k x². The total energy of the oscillator includes the rest energy and the kinetic energy. So at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential and rest mass. At equilibrium, all the energy is kinetic and rest mass.

Wait, but then the total energy would be E = mc² + (1/2)kA². At equilibrium, E = γ mc².

So setting them equal:

γ mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

So,

γ = 1 + ( (1/2)k A^2 )/(mc² )

Which is D = (k A^2)/(2 m c²), so γ = 1 + D.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 )

Hmm, but perhaps I can express v_max in terms of gamma.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / gamma = 1 / (1 + D )

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + D)^2.

Which gives,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + D)^2.

= [ (1 + D)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + D)^2.

= [ 1 + 2 D + D² -1 ] / denominator.

= (2D + D² ) / (1 + D)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * (2D + D²) / (1 + D)^2.

But D is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Hmm, let's plug that back in.

v_max = c * sqrt( (2D + D²) / (1 + D)^2 )

= c * sqrt( D(2 + D) ) / (1 + D )

But none of the options seem to match this exactly. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2m)) )^2 )

Wait, let me compute the denominator inside the square root:

1 - (k A^2/(2m)) is 1 - ( (k A^2)/(2m) )

Which would be a big term if k A^2/(2m) is large. But in reality, for the oscillator to be non-relativistic, k A^2/(2m) would be small.

But looking at option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Hmm, not matching.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy setup. Maybe in the relativistic case, the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kA². Another approach might be needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the effective potential and use the equation of motion in terms of relativistic momentum.

The equation of motion for the oscillator is F = -k x.

But F is dp/dt, where p is the relativistic momentum, p = γ m v.

So,

d/dt (γ m v) = -k x.

This is a second-order differential equation, which might be more complicated than I can handle right now.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to find the maximum velocity by considering when the force is zero, but that's when x is zero, which is when the velocity is maximum. But that doesn't help directly.

Wait, but let me think about the energy again. So, the maximum velocity occurs when the potential energy is zero and all the energy is kinetic. So, the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy.

E = mc² + K.

But K is (γ -1) mc^2.

So E = γ mc^2.

At the same time, when the mass is at maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero. So,

E = mc^2 + (1/2)k A^2.

So,

γ mc^2 = mc^2 + (1/2)k A^2.

Which gives:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ).

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2 ) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Let me denote D = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so gamma = 1 + D.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 + D.

Take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1/(1 + D).

Square both sides:

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + D)^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + D)^2.

= [ (1 + D)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + D)^2.

= ( 1 + 2D + D² - 1 ) / (1 + D)^2.

= (2D + D^2)/(1 + D)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ 2D + D^2 ] / (1 + D)^2.

Hmm, but looking at the options, perhaps I can rewrite this expression.

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: D(2 + D).

Denominator: (1 + D)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ D (2 + D) ] / (1 + D)^2.

Now, let me expand D:

D = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) (2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ]

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated, but perhaps simplifying.

Let me factor out (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) from numerator and denominator.

Let me write this as:

v^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) (2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ]

= c^2 * [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ] [ (2 + D) ] / (1 + D)^2.

Wait, but perhaps I can factor out 2 from the (2 + D) term.

Alternatively, maybe I can write this as:

v = c * sqrt( D(2 + D) ) / (1 + D )

But I'm not sure if this matches any of the options.

Looking back at the options, let's see:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, that's not matching. Let me compute what's inside the sqrt.

1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) = [ (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) + 1 ] / [1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

= [ 2 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ] / [1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ].

Hmm, not matching.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m ))^2 )

Wait, no, because the denominator is (1 - (k A^2/(2 m )) )^2.

But in our case, the denominator is (1 + D)^2, where D is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ).

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a trick here. Let me try to manipulate the expression for v.

From earlier,

v_max^2 = c^2 (2D + D^2 ) / (1 + D)^2.

Let me write this as:

v_max^2 = c^2 [ (2D + D^2) ] / ( (1 + D)^2 )

= c^2 [ D (2 + D) ] / ( (1 + D)^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

c^2 * [ D (2 + D) ] / (1 + D)^2.

= c^2 * [ (2 + D) / (1 + D) ) * D/(1 + D) ]

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (2D + D^2 ) ] / (1 + 2D + D^2 )

= c^2 * [ D (2 + D) ] / ( (1 + D)^2 )

= c^2 * [ D (2 + D) ] / (1 + D)^2.

But the options don't seem to have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a fraction under a square root. Let me think about the given options again.

Wait, looking at option D:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm, the expression inside the square root would be 1 - [1/(gamma -1 )^2 ] or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can invert the expression I have.

Wait, in our case,

v_max^2 / c^2 = [2D + D^2 ] / (1 + D)^2.

Let me factor numerator and denominator.

= [ D (2 + D) ] / (1 + D)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as D (2 + D) / (1 + D)^2.

Let me compute 2 + D = 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )).

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as 2 + D = 2 [ 1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2) ].

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can write (2 + D) = (1 + D) + 1.

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, another approach: perhaps it's easier to compute v_max in terms of gamma.

We have:

gamma = 1 + D.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which can be rewritten as:

gamma = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / ( 2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2 )

Which is,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

But then,

gamma^2 = (2 m c^2 + k A^2)^2 / (4 m^2 c^4 )

Hmm, but perhaps this doesn't help.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the maximum speed can be found using the relativistic virial theorem, but I'm not familiar with that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use a binomial expansion for small (k A^2)/(m c^2 ), but that doesn't seem to be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look back at the options and see which one could be correct.

Option C is the classical solution. But since the question is about a relativistic oscillator, option C is likely incorrect.

Options A, B, and D involve c in a more complex way.

Looking at option B:

v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, let me compute the term inside the square root.

1 + 1/(1 - x ), where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

= [ (1 - x ) + 1 ] / (1 - x )

= (2 - x ) / (1 - x )

Hmm, so option B would be:

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 - x)/(1 -x ) )

But in our case, the expression is sqrt( [2 x + x² ] / (1 + x )^2 )

Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing the connection here.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my initial energy assumption. Maybe the potential energy in relativity includes a different form. Another possibility is that the potential energy isn't (1/2)k x², but perhaps that's part of the problem setup.

Wait, the problem states that the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, so F = -k x. So the potential energy should be U = (1/2)k x². So, that part seems correct.

Wait, another thought: maybe the energy conservation equation is different. Perhaps the rest mass energy is separate from the oscillator's energy, but when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², so the total energy E would be E = mc² + (1/2)k A². Wait, that can't be right because mc² is the rest energy, and the oscillator's energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. So perhaps the correct equation is E = mc² + K + U, but that would make the total energy E larger than mc², which doesn't make sense because in relativity, the rest mass is part of the total energy. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to treat the oscillator's energy as (1/2)k A², and then relate that to the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, the kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma - 1) mc². So, when the velocity is maximum, the potential energy is zero (x=0), so all the energy is kinetic. So,

(1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) mc².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

Which brings me back to the same point as before.

So, from that, I can find v_max.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c² ) = [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )]^2.

Take reciprocal:

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )]^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

= [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

Hmm, this is the same as before. Let me compute the numerator:

(1 + a)^2 -1 = 2a + a^2, where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v²/c² = (2a + a² )/(1 + a )^2.

But wait, perhaps I can factor this as:

(2a + a² ) = a (2 + a )

Denominator: (1 + a )^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ a (2 + a ) ] / (1 + a )^2.

But a is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so:

v_max = c * sqrt( a (2 + a ) ) / (1 + a )

= c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ] * [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ] ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

Hmm, trying to simplify this expression.

Alternatively, let me factor out (1/(2 m c^2 )) from the terms inside the square root.

Wait, maybe I'll try to write this expression as:

sqrt( [ (k A^2) (2 * 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] ) / [ 2 m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ]

But this seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ] ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

Let me factor out (1/(2 m c^2 )) from the numerator's square root.

= c * sqrt( [ (k A^2) * (2 m c^2 + (k A^2)/2 ) ] ) / [ (2 m c^2 ) (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ) ]

Wait, perhaps that's getting me somewhere. Let me compute the numerator inside the square root:

k A^2 * (2 m c^2 + k A^2/2 ) = k A^2 ( (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / 2 )

= (k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )) / 2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )) / ( 2 * (2 m c^2 )^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) )

Wait, perhaps this isn't leading me anywhere. Let me think about the options again.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/( 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) )

Hmm, 1 + 1/(1 - x ) = (1 - x +1 )/(1 -x ) = (2 - x )/(1 - x )

Which would be sqrt( (2 - x )/(1 - x ) )

But in our expression, the square root is sqrt( (2 a + a² ) )/(1 + a ), where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, perhaps I can manipulate this expression.

Let me compute (2a + a^2 ) = a(a + 2 )

So,

sqrt( a(a + 2) ) = sqrt(a) * sqrt(a + 2 )

Hmm, but that doesn't seem to help.

Wait, perhaps I can write the expression as:

v_max = c * sqrt( a (a + 2) ) / (a + 1 )

= c * sqrt( a (a + 2) ) / (a + 1 )

= c * sqrt( [ a (a + 2) ] ) / (a + 1 )

= c * sqrt( [ a (a + 2) ] ) / (a +1 )

Hmm, but I don't see how this would match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should factor a out of the numerator.

= c * sqrt( a (a + 2) ) / (a +1 )

= c * sqrt( a ) * sqrt(a + 2) / (a +1 )

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can consider this as:

sqrt( a (a + 2) ) = sqrt( a^2 + 2a )

= sqrt( (a + 1 )^2 - 1 )

Because (a +1)^2 = a² + 2a + 1, so a² + 2a = (a +1 )^2 -1.

So,

sqrt( a^2 + 2a ) = sqrt( (a +1 )^2 -1 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (a +1 )^2 -1 ) / (a +1 )

= c * sqrt( [ (a +1 )^2 -1 ] ) / (a +1 )

= c * sqrt( (a +1 )^2 -1 ) / (a +1 )

Factor under the square root:

= c * sqrt( (a +1 - 1)(a +1 + 1) ) / (a +1 )

= c * sqrt( a (a + 2 ) ) / (a +1 )

Wait, that's the same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as:

v_max = c * sqrt( (a +1 )^2 -1 ) / (a+1 )

= c * sqrt( [ (a+1 )^2 - 1 ] ) / (a+1 )

= c * sqrt( (a+1 -1)(a+1 +1) ) / (a+1 )

= c * sqrt( a (a + 2) ) / (a +1 )

Hmm, same as before.

I'm stuck trying to match this to any of the given options. Let me go back to the options.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm, let me compute the term inside the square root.

1 - [1/(1 + x )^2 ] where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

= [ (1 + x )^2 -1 ] / (1 + x )^2

= (1 + 2x + x² -1 ) / (1 + x )^2

= (2x + x² )/(1 + x )^2

Which is exactly what I have for v^2 / c^2.

So,

v_max^2 / c^2 = (2x + x² )/(1 + x )^2 = [2x + x^2 ] / (1 + x )^2.

Which is the same as in option D.

Wait, but option D says:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(1 + x )^2 ] )

Which is exactly v^2 = c^2 * [ 1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 ].

Wait, but this is the same as what I have. Because from earlier,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + x )^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 )

Which matches option D.

Wait, but option D says:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is exactly what I have. Because x = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So yes, option D is the correct expression.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option D was:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is what I have for v_max.

So, the correct answer is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy of the system is conserved and includes the rest energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential:  
   \[
   E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum, and all the energy is kinetic:  
   \[
   E = \gamma mc^2
   \]  
   Equating the two expressions for total energy:  
   \[
   \gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   Subtracting \( mc^2 \) from both sides:  
   \[
   \gamma mc^2 - mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   Factoring out \( mc^2 \):  
   \[
   mc^2 (\gamma - 1) = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   Solving for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   The Lorentz factor is defined as \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]  
   Taking the reciprocal:  
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( v_{\text{max}}^2 \):  
   \[
   \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

3. **Matching with the Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
