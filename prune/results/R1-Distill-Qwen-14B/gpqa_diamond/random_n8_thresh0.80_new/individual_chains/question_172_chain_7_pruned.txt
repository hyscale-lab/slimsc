Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh, right, when atoms are excited, they're in higher energy levels. The energy difference between these levels is given as about 1.38e-23 J. And we're told the photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So the usual rules of statistical mechanics apply.

Wait, in LTE, the excitation of atoms depends on the temperature. So the number of atoms in a particular energy level is given by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula I remember is something like N_upper/N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, g's are the degeneracies, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

In this problem, the energy levels are the same for both stars—same ΔE. So for each star, the ratio of excited atoms depends on the temperature. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as N1 and star_2 as N2.

Given that N1 = 2 * N2. So, N1/N2 = 2.

But wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, so the ratio N1 (excited) to N2 (excited) is 2:1. Or maybe it's the other way around? Wait, no, star_1 has twice as excited as star_2. So N1/N2 = 2.

But using the Boltzmann equation, each N is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). So for each star, N = (g) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), assuming the same g for both, since it's the same element. So the ratio of the excited states would be (exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))) / (exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, the ratio N1/N2 would be equal to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) because:

N1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))
N2 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))
