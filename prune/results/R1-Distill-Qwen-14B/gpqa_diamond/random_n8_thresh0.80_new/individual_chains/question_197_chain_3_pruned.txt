Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. So, the question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The IR shows strong peaks. The broad peak between 3400-2500 cm-1 probably indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But since the options don't have amines, maybe it's an O-H from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches around 2500-3300, which fits here. Oh, but wait, another possibility is an alcohol, but let's keep that in mind.

Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids typically have C=O around 1700-1725 cm-1. So that supports the idea of a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be an ester or ketone, but the O-H in the IR suggests more towards a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR spectrum has several signals. The first peak is at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The broadness is because the acidic proton exchanges quickly on the NMR timescale.

Next, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets with 2H each mean that the substituents are in the para positions, like two substituents opposite each other on the benzene ring. So, maybe something like a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let me think about what this could be. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) is likely a methyl group attached to a CH2, like a CH2CH3. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) is probably a methyl attached to an adjacent carbon, maybe a CH(CH3) group. The multiplet around 1.7 ppm for 2H suggests perhaps a CH2 connected to another CH or something, and the 2.9 ppm (1H) could be a CH that's next to a carbonyl group.

Putting it all together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent in the para position that's a carboxylic acid and another substituent which is an isobutyl group. Wait, or maybe the substituents are a carboxylic acid group and another group like a side chain.

Wait, the IR has a C=O, which could be from a substituent other than a carboxylic acid. Let's think again. If it's a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and an isopropyl group, for example. Or perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group attached to the benzene.

Wait, looking at the NMR: the 10.5 ppm is the COOH proton. Then, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which suggests that the substituents are in para positions. So the benzene has two substituents, one at position 4 and the other at position 1, but since it's para, maybe they are opposite each other. Or perhaps one substituent is at position 4, and another at position 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). So, that suggests a para-disubstituted benzene, with each substituent causing the neighboring protons to split into doublets. So, the substituents are in para positions.

Now, the substituents: one is the carboxylic acid group (from the 10.5 ppm peak). The other substituent must be something that gives the NMR signals for the other protons.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H). This looks like a chain. Let's see: the triplet at 0.9 is probably a methyl (CH2CH3) group. So, the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to a CH. The 2.9 ppm is a CH connected to something else. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl attached to a CH.

So, the substituent would be a chain like (CH2)2CHCH2CH3? Wait, perhaps it's something like (CH(CH2CH3)) attached to the benzene. Alternatively, it's a propyl group but with a branch.

Wait, the NMR signals indicate a possible isobutyl group. Let's think about it. An isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, isobutyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, isobutyl is (CH2CH(CH3)).

Wait, the NMR data could be for a substituent like -CH2CH(CH2CH3), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. Let me draw it out mentally.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, that is, the structure is -CH2-C(CH3)2. Wait, no. Wait, the substituent would be attached to the benzene as a side chain. So, if it's a propyl group with a branch, perhaps it's something like -CH2CH(CH3)2? Or maybe -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-?

Wait, another approach: The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, because the splitting is from neighboring H. So, perhaps structure like CH(CH3)CH2CH2... No, wait, the 1.4 is a doublet, so maybe it's a methyl attached to a CH that has two other H's adjacent. So, like CH(CH3)CH2- something.

Wait, let's try to reconstruct the substituent. Let me think about the NMR signals:

The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH2. So, perhaps CH2CH2CH3? Wait, more accurately, that's a CH2CH3 group, where the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 or CH group. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be a CH2 next to a CH. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a CH that's next to a carbonyl or another group.

Putting it together: The substituent on the benzene could be a group like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH? Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Or perhaps it's a propyl chain attached in a way that
