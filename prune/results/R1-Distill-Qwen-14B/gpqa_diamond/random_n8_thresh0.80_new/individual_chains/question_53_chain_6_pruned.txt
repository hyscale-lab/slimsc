Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about identifying a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. That means it's something like benzene with two substituents attached. The options given are all variants of C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, and C12H14O2. So the substituents are probably introducing oxygen and adding more carbon and hydrogen atoms.

The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an oxygen in the ester linkage. So the structure likely has an ester functional group somewhere. Ester groups usually show a strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹ in IR, which matches the data.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Let me list them out. There are two aromatic H signals, two vinyl H signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two CH3 signals. No CH2 groups, so the structure doesn't have any -CH2- parts.

Wait, let me think about what each part means. Aromatic H signals would come from the substituents. If it's a di-substituted benzene, there are two substituents, which can be in para, meta, or ortho positions. But the NMR shows two signals for aromatic H, which suggests the substituents are either in the para position or one is in a position that leads to two distinct sets of Hs.

Vinyl Hs—those are protons attached to a double bond. So maybe one of the substituents is an ester with a vinyl group, like maybe an acrylate? Or perhaps a substituent with a double bond adjacent to the ester.

Wait, the ester group could be part of a substituent like an acyl group attached to the ring. For example, maybe the substituent is an ester like -OOCR, where R is an alkyl or another group with a double bond.

Let me think about the structure. Since we have two substituents, perhaps one is an ester and the other is something else. Or both substituents could be ester groups. But wait, di-substituted, so two substituent groups on the benzene ring.

Looking at the NMR again: two aromatic H signals. Let's say the substituents are in the para position. That would cause the two Hs opposite each substituent to be equivalent. But wait, if the substituents are different, maybe that's not the case. Hmm.

Wait, the aromatic Hs could also be in a meta arrangement. But no, for a di-substitution, the most common would be para or ortho. But two signals would make sense if they are in the para position because the two H environments would be identical. But wait, no, if substituents are identical, then the Hs would be equivalent. If the substituents are different, then perhaps the Hs are in different environments.

Wait, but the question says "di-substituted", so two different substituents? Or could be same. The problem doesn't specify. Hmm.

But the NMR shows two signals for aromatic Hs. Let me think. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two same substituents, the Hs would be in two sets: the two Hs adjacent to substituents and the two Hs across. Wait, no, in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other, so the Hs would be in two sets of two each. Wait, that might give two signals if the substituents are the same. Or maybe not. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in the ortho positions, that would lead to more complex splitting. For instance, if substituent A is at position 1 and substituent B is at position 2, the Hs in positions 3 and 4 would be different than those in positions 5 and 6. No, that might lead to more signals. So perhaps it's para substitution with identical substituents leading to two sets of equivalent H
