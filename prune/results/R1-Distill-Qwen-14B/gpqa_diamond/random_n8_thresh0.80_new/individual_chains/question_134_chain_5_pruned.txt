Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem states: we're mixing 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change when these are neutralized. The options are given, but I'll tackle it without looking at them first.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization... I remember that's usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but this might be a bit different because of the specific amounts and types of acid and base here.

First, I think I need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- ions in each solution. Because when they mix, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other to form water. But wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid, but it's diprotic, right? So each molecule can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base as well; each formula unit gives two OH- ions.

Let me list out the steps:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl.
2. Calculate moles of H+ from H2SO4.
3. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.
4. Find the total H+ and OH- to see which is in excess.
5. Determine the limiting reagent (the one that runs out first).
6. Calculate the total moles of H+ or OH- that react, whichever is the limiting.
7. Multiply by the enthalpy per mole of H+ (assuming the enthalpy is per mole of H+ neutralized).

Wait, wait. Enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ or OH-? I think it's per mole of H+ neutralized. So each mole of H+ reacting with a mole of OH- releases about -57 kJ, but the exact value might vary based on concentration and other factors—though the problem might assume the standard value.

But the problem doesn't specify the enthalpy per mole, so maybe I need to calculate based on the amounts given.

Alternatively, perhaps it's using the standard value of 57 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized. But wait, wait. Wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually given as the heat released per mole of acid reacting, but in some contexts, it's per mole of H+ ion. Let me clarify.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is the enthalpy change when one mole of an acid reacts with one mole of a base to form one mole of water. For strong acids and bases, it's about -57 kJ/mol. But H2SO4 is a strong acid, but it can donate two H+ ions. So each mole gives two H+.

So first, find the moles of H+ from each acid.

HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). Wait, wait, the solution volumes are in mL, so I need to convert.

500 mL HCl is 0.5 L. 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

H2SO4 is 0.3 M × 0.3 L (300 mL is 0.3 L) = 0.09 moles. Since it's diprotic and a strong acid, each mole gives two H+. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

Then, Ba(OH)2 is a base. Each mole gives two OH- ions. The concentration is 0.5 M in 200 mL
