Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty of P_z given a specific state. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the variance formula. Let me think about the steps I need to take.

First, I should probably write down what I know. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). And the operator P_z is given as a matrix. I think the matrix for P_z is diagonal because the basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z. So each diagonal element corresponds to an eigenvalue.

Wait, looking at the P_z matrix, the first row is (ħ, 0, 0), so the eigenvalue for the first basis vector is ħ. The second row is (0, 0, 0), so maybe the eigenvalue is 0 for the middle state? And the third row is (0,0,-ħ), so eigenvalue is -ħ for the third basis vector.

The state is a vector in this basis, right? So the components are the amplitudes for each eigenstate. So the state |ψ> can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors |e1>, |e2>, |e3> where each corresponds to P_z eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ.

The state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me check the normalization. The sum of squares should be 1. So (-1/2)^2 is 1/4, (1/√2)^2 is 1/2, and (-1/2)^2 is 1/4. Adding them: 1/4 + 1/2 +1/4 = 1. Yep, it's normalized.

Now, to find the expectation value of P_z, which is <ψ| P_z |ψ>. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward. The expectation value <P_z> is the sum of each component squared multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

So, the first component is (-1/2), so the square is (1/4) multiplied by ħ (since the eigenvalue is ħ for the first basis). The middle component is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2 multiplied by 0, which is zero. The third component is (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 multiplied by (-ħ). 

Calculating each term:
(1/4)*ħ + 0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = [ (1/4) - (1/4) ] ħ = 0. So the expectation value <P_z> is zero.

Wait, that's interesting. So the average of P_z is zero. But I need the uncertainty, which is the square root of the variance. Variance is <P_z²> - <P_z>². Since <P_z> is zero, the variance is just <P_z²>.

So I need to compute <P_z²>. Let's think about this. The operator P_z is diagonal, so P_z squared will also be diagonal, with each diagonal element being the square of the eigenvalues.

The eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, -ħ. So the squares are ħ², 0, ħ².

Therefore, <P_z²> is the sum of the squares of the components multiplied by the squares of the eigenvalues. 

So each component is:
First component: (1/4) * (ħ)^2
Second component: (1/2) * 0^2 = 0
Third component: (1/4) * (-ħ)^2 = (1/4) ħ²

Adding them together: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So the variance is (1/2) ħ², and the uncertainty is the square root of that, which is sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, let me double-check
