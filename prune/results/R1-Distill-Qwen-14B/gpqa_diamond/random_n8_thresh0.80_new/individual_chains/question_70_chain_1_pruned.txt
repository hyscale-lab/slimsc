Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see, the question is about identifying the molecular symmetry group of a product E. The options are A to D, each representing a different molecular symmetry group. 

First, I'll try to parse all the given information. The question describes a series of reactions, so I need to figure out what each compound is. Let me list out the reactions:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out what each of these compounds is, starting from the reactions. Let's break it down.

Starting with the first reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red). What solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 ratio? Maybe an oxide reacting with a diatomic gas? Let me think. For example, if B is oxygen (O2), but 8 equivalents would mean 4 O2 molecules. Alternatively, maybe B is a halogen, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the reaction where a solid metal reacts with a gas. Maybe a metal reacting with chlorine or sulfur. Alternatively, perhaps it's a metal oxide reacting with another gas. 

Looking at the third reaction: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. So when C reacts with water, it's hydrolyzing into A and two acids. That suggests that C is some kind of salt, perhaps a sulfide or nitride, but more likely something that can hydrolyze into acids. Alternatively, if C is a metal oxide, maybe it forms a metal hydroxide, but that would produce only one acid. Wait, but F and G are two different acids. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a nitride, like a metal nitride. For example, when magnesium nitride reacts with water, it forms magnesium hydroxide and ammonia (a weak acid) and maybe another acid? No, wait, magnesium nitride plus water gives Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But that's only one acid. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a more complex salt.

Alternatively, considering reaction 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents include water, ethanol, maybe others. But if B is a gas, like H2O? Or maybe B is H2O? Wait, no, because D reacts with B (gas) to form H, which is a solvent. So if B is O2, then D would be something like H2 (but that's a gas too). Alternatively, perhaps D is NH3 and B is HCl? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, reaction 4: D + B → H. H is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc. If B is a gas, say, H2O is a gas? Well, at room temperature it's a liquid, but maybe in the reaction conditions, it's gaseous. Alternatively, B could be O2, and D could be something else.

Wait, let's think about reaction 1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form C. Let's imagine that A is a metal, and B is a diatomic gas. For example, suppose B is Cl2. Then 8 equivalents would be 4 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. So maybe A is a metal that forms a +2 or +3 charge.

Wait, but 8 equivalents would imply 4 moles of B per mole of A, because diatomic gas would contribute two atoms. Hmm, perhaps A is aluminum (Al). If B is Cl2, then 4 moles of Cl2 would react with 2 moles of Al to produce 2 AlCl3. But that's 2 AlCl3,
