Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me think. So, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square of the operator minus the square of the expectation value of the operator. The formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

But wait, since the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, does that tell me anything about the expectation values of P_z? Oh right, because the state is an eigenstate of P_x, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of P_z. So the expectation values of P_z can be calculated using that state.

Let me look at the given matrices. The operator P_z has a matrix with elements:
First row: (ℏ, 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, -ℏ)

Wait, so the matrix for P_z is diagonal, which makes sense because it's given that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So each diagonal element is the eigenvalue for the corresponding basis vector.

The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me write that as |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ].

Since P_z is diagonal, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is just the sum of each component squared multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue. Because each basis state is an eigenstate of P_z, the expectation value is straightforward.

Wait, but how? Let me think. The expectation value ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ is the sum over the basis states of |c_i|^2 multiplied by the eigenvalue λ_i, where c_i are the components of the state vector.

So the eigenvalues of P_z are ℏ, 0, and -ℏ, corresponding to the three basis states. The state vector has components c₁ = -1/2, c₂ = 1/√2, c₃ = -1/2.

So |c₁|² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly, |c₂|² is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2, and |c₃|² is also 1/4.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ℏ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ℏ) = (1/4 ℏ) - (1/4 ℏ) = 0. Oh, that's zero.

Now I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just each eigenvalue squared along the diagonal. So the eigenvalues squared would be ℏ², 0, and ℏ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4)*(ℏ²) + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(ℏ²) = ( (1/4 + 1/4 ) ) * ℏ² = (1/2) ℏ².

So ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2 ℏ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( (ℏ²)/2 ) = ℏ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, B is ℏ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value of $P_z$
The operator $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the three basis states. The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^3 |c_i|^2 \lambda_i,
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ are the squared magnitudes of the components of $|\psi\rangle$, and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$. The components of $|\psi\rangle$ are $c_1 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $c_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $c_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$. Thus:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\lambda_1 = \hbar$, $\lambda_2 = 0$, and $\lambda_3 = -\hbar$. Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of $P_z^2$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^3 |c_i|^2 \lambda_i^2.
\]

Substituting the eigenvalues $\lambda_i^2 = \hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$, and the probabilities $|c_i|^2$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
