Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's start by understanding what's given. The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. For C8H9NO, the formula is C8H9NO. 

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation can be found by (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is zero, so:

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a benzene ring (which is 3), a double bond or ring (another 1 or 2), and maybe an aldehyde group or something else.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm triplet, 1H. That sounds like an aldehyde proton, because aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But wait, a triplet? Aldehyde protons are usually singlets, so maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha proton to a carbonyl, like in an enal or an enamine. Alternatively, maybe a phenol proton with some coupling?

Wait, 9.72 is a triplet. Maybe an aldehyde with some coupling? Or perhaps it's a benzylic proton adjacent to an oxygen, like in a phenol aldehyde structure?

Wait, another thought: maybe the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system, which could cause splitting. Or perhaps it's an acidic proton, like a phenol.

Wait, the triplet at 9.72 could be an aldehyde proton with adjacent coupling. Another possibility is that it's a vinylogous proton. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone next to something else, but 9.72 is more typical for aldehydes or possibly an enol.

Looking at the rest of the NMR:

6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's probably aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted.

6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Also aromatic. So if I have two doublets, symmetric, perhaps the molecule has two para-substituted aromatic rings. Like two phenyl groups attached at some position.

6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests exchange, like an -OH proton. Or maybe it's adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. Wait, but the molecular formula includes an O, so maybe a hydroxyl group or an aldehyde.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, if we have two benzene rings, that's 6 carbons, 5 hydrogens (each benzene has 5 H if mono-substituted?), but wait, the NMR shows 2H as doublets, so perhaps each aromatic ring has two substituents.

Wait, maybe each aromatic ring is para-substituted. So for each benzene, two substituents in para positions. But let's think about the structure.

Another part of the NMR is 3.66 ppm, a doublet, 2H. That's probably a CH2 group attached to something electronegative, maybe an oxygen. So perhaps a CH2-O group.

Putting this together: the molecule has two aromatic rings, each para-substituted, perhaps with substituents at the 4 positions. Also, a CH2-O group, and an aldehyde group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms. Each benzene ring is C6H5, but in this case, each benzene would have two substituents, so perhaps each is C6H4... but in the formula, we have C8, so two benzene rings would take 12 carbons, which is more than 8. Wait, no, wait: wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO.

Wait, perhaps each benzene is substituted with a group. Let's think about the substituents. The overall formula is C8H9NO.

So, let me think: the structure could be a benzaldehyde
