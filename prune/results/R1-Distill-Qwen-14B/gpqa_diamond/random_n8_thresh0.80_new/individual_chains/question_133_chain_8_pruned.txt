Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's a bit tricky, but let's try to work through it step by step. I'm not super confident about this, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution contains two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both are 1 gram each in 200 cm³ of solution. The temperature is 25°C, and we're given the Ka values for H3PO4.

First, I remember that orthophosphate (H3PO4) can act as a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. But wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions. Hmm, I think orthophosphate is in its fully deprotonated form, which would be PO4^3-.

Wait, but no. Let me think again. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, right? But when it dissociates, it can lose protons. So the different species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. So orthophosphate would be H3PO4, but maybe the question is referring to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate? I'm a bit confused here. Or perhaps it's the species present in solution when both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O are present.

Wait, the problem says "orthophosphate ions." Oh, wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, so the ion would be H2PO4^-? Or is it PO4^3-? Hmm, maybe I should double-check. Oh wait, no. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and when it loses three protons, it becomes PO4^3-. But in solution, it can exist in different forms based on pH. 

Wait, but the salts given are KH2PO4 (which is K+ and H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4·2H2O (which is 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus two water molecules, but water doesn't affect the ion concentration much).

So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Depending on whether the solution is acidic or basic, these will shift.

Wait, but when you mix H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the solution is probably a buffer because they are conjugate acid-base pairs. H2PO4^- is the acid (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base. So the buffer system is H2PO4^- / HPO4^2-.

The pH of the solution will determine which form is more prevalent. But how do I find the pH here?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2- (which is the orthophosphate ion?), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the problem specifies "orthophosphate ions," and orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's more likely that the phosphate species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the term "orthophosphate" refers to the HPO4^
