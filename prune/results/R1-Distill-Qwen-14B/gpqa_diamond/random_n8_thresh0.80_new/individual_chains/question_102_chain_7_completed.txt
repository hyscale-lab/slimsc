Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology techniques, specifically involving vectors and Cre-lox systems. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it.

The question is about a bicistronic vector, which means it has two ORFs (open reading frames) in one construct. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. So the vector has two genes: ligand and receptor.

Looking at the setup: ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, I think. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. I remember that IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so maybe the receptor is expressed as a separate protein, but I'm not entirely sure how that works in bicistronic vectors. Oh wait, in bicistronic vectors, the two ORFs are arranged in a way that the second gene is expressed either via an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) or a 2A peptide. Here, it's IRES, so the receptor might be expressed after the ligand.

Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. So when Cre is introduced, it would excise this stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed along with the ligand. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is used, it'd remove that stop, letting eGFP be expressed with the receptor.

But in the experiment, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then, they cross it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development, so the Cre is probably expressed in neural crest cells or derivatives like Schwann cells or melanocytes.

The offspring's visualization under the confocal shows no green signal. Green is from eGFP. So the question is why the eGFP isn't showing up.

Let me look at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Hmm, paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But how does that affect expression in the vector? Not sure. If they're secreted, maybe, but the vector is for expression in the same cell. If it's paracrine, perhaps ligand isn't produced in the same cells as the receptor? But in this case, the vector is a single construct, so both should be expressed in the same cells. Not sure about this option.

B) The receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If that's the case, maybe it doesn't get to the cell surface, so no fluorescent signal. But how would that happen? The construct is under the control of the promoter and IRES. If the stop cassette is removed, the receptor and eGFP should be expressed. Maybe the eGFP is not processed correctly, but why would it specifically be stuck in the Golgi? I'm not certain about this.

C) The enhancer for expression is missing. Both the ligand and receptor have their own regulatory elements. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, so maybe the receptor's expression is relying on something else. But wait, the receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is part of the same vector. If the enhancer is missing, perhaps the IRES isn't working. But without more info, I'm not sure.

D) The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh! Because when using loxP to remove the stop cassette, if the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, the reading frame would be messed up. So the receptor and eGFP would be expressed as a single, nonfunctional protein. So the eGFP would not be expressed as a separate tag.

Wait, in the construct, the receptor ORF is followed by the eGFP, but with a stop cassette. So normally, the receptor would be translated, then the stop would prevent eGFP translation. When Cre is introduced (like in the SOX10-Cre mice), it would remove the stop cassette, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed as a single mRNA. But if the eGFP is not in frame, the reading frame would shift, creating a fusion protein that doesn't include functional eGFP. So when they look for eGFP, they wouldn't see anything because it's not expressed correctly.

If the stop is removed, but the frame isn't correct, the eGFP won't be expressed. So in the Western blot, they wouldn't see the eGFP tag. But wait, the question says that the Western blot was done after transfecting the plasmid into astrocytes. So perhaps when they looked then, they saw eGFP expression. But in the mouse, which is crossed with SOX10-Cre, maybe the construct is being recombined in a way that disrupts the frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 is a different recombinase target than loxP. Oh, right, the lox2272 is a variant that Cre can still cut, but maybe in some contexts. But the original vector has the ligand with loxP-stop-loxP, and the receptor with lox2272-stop-lox2272. So when Cre is introduced, it would remove both stops, but perhaps in different tissues. Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct, so the Cre would be acting in the SOX10-expressing cells.

Wait another pointâ€”Western blot: after transfecting the plasmid into astrocytes, they probably saw the eGFP and mCherry. Because in the plasmid, without Cre, the stops are in place. But when transfected into cells, unless they have Cre, the stops are present, so ligand and mCherry are expressed, and receptor and eGFP are not. Wait no, the ligand is under CBA which is always on, but the stop in loxP would block mCherry. Wait no, the setup is that the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, but the stop is between them. So the ligand is before the stop, and mCherry after. So without Cre, the stop is in place, so ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. Similarly, the receptor is before the stop, eGFP after, so without Cre, the stop is there, so only receptor is expressed, not eGFP. But when you use Cre, the stops are removed, so ligand and mCherry are expressed, and receptor and eGFP are expressed.

Wait, but the question says after plasmid transfection to primary astrocytes, they used the antibodies and ran Western blot. They saw signals proportional to actin, which suggests that the proteins were expressed. But the question is about the mouse model.

Wait, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. So in the mouse, the construct is present. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre, which targets the Cre to SOX10-expressing cells (like neural crest derivatives). So in the offspring, the Cre is active in certain cells.

In the mouse, the construct would have the two stop cassettes. In the absence of Cre, the stops are in place, so ligand is expressed (with mCherry) only if the loxP stop is removed. Wait, no. Let me reconstruct:

Vector setup:

5' CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP) -> mCherry.

Then downstream, there's the IRES element, then the receptor ORF, then stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272) -> eGFP.

So in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes are present. So the ligand ORF is expressed (because it's under CBA promoter), but the mCherry is not, because the stop blocks it. The receptor is under the IRES, which is after the ligand, but whether the IRES is functional to allow translation of the receptor when the ligand is expressed?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. The CBA promoter is strong and would drive the transcription of the entire bicistronic mRNA. The first ORF is ligand, followed by a stop cassette. Then the IRES, then receptor ORF, and another stop before eGFP.

Wait, the IRES is between the ligand ORF and the receptor ORF. So in a bicistronic mRNA, the first ORF (ligand) is translated, then the ribosome would drop off, and the IRES would allow the ribosome to bind again and translate the receptor ORF.

But the presence of the stop cassettes complicates this. Without Cre, the mCherry is behind a stop, so ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. Similarly, the eGFP is behind a stop, so receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

But when Cre is present, the stops are removed. So ligand and mCherry are co-expressed, and receptor and eGFP are co-expressed.

So in the mouse model, the Cre (from SOX10-Cre) would remove both stop cassettes in cells where SOX10 is expressed. So in those cells, both ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP would be expressed.

But when they look under the confocal, they don't see green. So eGFP isn't expressed.

So why?

Looking at the options again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop cassette is removed, but the frame isn't correct, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. Because when the stop is removed, the mRNA would be ligand followed by mCherry, and receptor followed by eGFP. Wait no, the IRES is before the receptor. Hmm.

Wait, no, the construct is ligand ORF, then stop, then IRES, then receptor ORF, then stop, then eGFP. So when the stop is removed by Cre, for mCherry, the ligand would be expressed, followed by mCherry. Similarly, for the receptor, the stop is removed, so the receptor is expressed, followed by eGFP.

Wait, but in the vector, the ligand is under CBA. The IRES is after the ligand. So in the absence of Cre, the stop in the ligand's part is present, so mCherry isn't expressed. The IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed as a separate ORF, but with the stop before eGFP, eGFP isn't expressed.

But when Cre is introduced, the stops are removed, so both mCherry and eGFP should be expressed.

But in the mouse, they're looking for eGFP expression, which didn't happen. So why?

Option D suggests that the eGFP is not in frame. Oh, because when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are in the same frame, or not. Wait, if the stop is in the correct frame, then removing it would allow the two to be in frame. But if the stop is not in frame, then the frameshift would mess up the reading frame, leading to a nonfunctional eGFP.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector was designed so that upon removal of the stop, the receptor and eGFP are in the same frame, allowing eGFP to be expressed. But if the vector was constructed incorrectly and the eGFP is not in frame, then the fusion protein would not function, and the eGFP would not fluoresce.

In the question, the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre. So in the Cre-expressing cells, the stops are removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed. But since the eGFP isn't fluorescent, perhaps the construct didn't work as intended.

If the eGFP is not in frame, the resulting protein would be a fusion of receptor and eGFP but not correctly. So the eGFP tag wouldn't be present, so no fluorescence.

So which option is it?

Option D is "the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame". So if the ORF of the receptor is followed by eGFP, but not in the same frame, the eGFP won't be expressed correctly. So the eGFP wouldn't fluoresce.

So when the Western blot was done, perhaps the eGFP was detected because the stop was removed during the initial transfection, but in the mouse, the stops are only removed in specific cells due to Cre, but if the frame is wrong, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps in the mouse, the construct is inserted in a way that the frame is lost, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the vector is a bicistronic vector. For the eGFP to be expressed correctly, the stop cassette must be in the correct position and the eGFP must be in frame. If the stop is removed but the frame isn't correct, the eGFP won't be expressed properly.

So the most likely reason for no green signal is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So option D.


The question involves a bicistronic vector expressing a ligand and a receptor, with fluorescent tags (mCherry and eGFP) downstream of stop cassettes. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. The vector includes loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes, which are removed by Cre recombinase to allow co-expression of the fluorescent tags. The experiment involves crossing mice homozygous for this construct with SOX10-Cre mice, which express Cre in neural crest-derived cells. Despite this, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under the confocal microscope.

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   A paracrine relationship implies that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the vector is designed for co-expression of the ligand and receptor in the same cell, making this explanation unlikely.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would fail to reach the cell surface and fluoresce. However, this does not explain why the eGFP was not expressed in the first place, as the construct should have been translated and processed.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES element, which should allow expression. There is no evidence suggesting the enhancer is missing or non-functional, making this explanation less likely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   If the stop cassette is removed but the eGFP is not in the correct reading frame relative to the receptor, the eGFP would not be expressed properly. This would result in a nonfunctional eGFP and no fluorescent signal, which aligns with the observed lack of green fluorescence.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, preventing proper expression of eGFP and resulting in the absence of fluorescence.
