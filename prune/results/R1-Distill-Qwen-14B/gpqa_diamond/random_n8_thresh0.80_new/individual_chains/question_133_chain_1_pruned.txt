Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters). It contains 1.00 gram of KH2PO4 and 1.00 gram of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate. The temperature is 25°C. The question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution. The Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Hmm, I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. The species can be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, or PO4^3-. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, so we need to find its concentration.

Wait, but the solution has two different phosphate salts. KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate, which I think dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate, which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus some water of crystallization, but I don't think that affects the calculation.

So, when these two salts are dissolved together, they can react to form a buffer solution because they are a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). Right, because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-, but the Ka2 is much smaller than Ka1, so the main species in solution would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about PO4^3- concentration. Oh, but in the solution of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, the PO4^3- would be very minimal because the solution is probably buffered around the second dissociation step.

Wait, another approach: maybe the solution is a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but if we have both of those, how much PO4^3- is there?

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is at a pH where HPO4^2- is the main species, and some PO4^3- is present. But since the solution has both a weak acid and its conjugate base, maybe the pH is determined by their ratio.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate the concentrations of each salt first and then see what happens in solution.

Let's start by calculating the moles of each salt.

For KH2PO4:
Mass = 1.00 g
Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol
Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007337 mol.

For Na
