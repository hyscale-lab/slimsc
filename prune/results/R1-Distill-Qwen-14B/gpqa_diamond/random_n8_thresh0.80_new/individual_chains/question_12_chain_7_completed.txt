Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me try to think through how to approach this.

The question is: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energy of the mu+ and the neutrino.

Hmm, I remember that in particle decay problems, conservation laws are key. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So after decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to keep the total momentum zero.

But wait, the neutrino is neutral and super light. I think it's treated as massless in many cases, right? So the neutrino's mass is negligible. That might simplify things.

Let me jot down the given data:

Mass of Pi(+) (M) = 139.6 MeV/c²
Mass of mu+ (m) = 105.7 MeV/c²
Mass of neutrino (m_nu) ≈ 0 (assuming it's massless)

The decay process is Pi(+) → mu+ + nu.

Since the pion is at rest, the total energy available is its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV.

The muon and neutrino will share this energy and momentum. Let me think about energy and momentum conservation.

Energy conservation: The total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of mu and neutrino.

E_mu + E_nu = M c² → but since we're in units where c=1, E_mu + E_nu = M = 139.6 MeV.

Momentum conservation: The momenta vectors must be equal and opposite. So |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to the magnitude of its momentum times c, but again, in these units, E_nu = p.

For the muon, which has mass m, its energy is given by E_mu = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). But since c=1, E_mu = sqrt(p² + m²).

Wait, but I'm probably mixing up units here. Let me clarify: in natural units where c=1, so E = sqrt(p² + m²) for a massive particle. For the neutrino, since m=0, E_nu = p.

So, the two equations are:

1) E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV
2) E_mu = sqrt( p² + m_mu² )
3) E_nu = p

And because momentum is conserved, the magnitudes are equal.

So substituting equation 3 into equation 1:

E_mu + p = 139.6 → equation (1a)

But E_mu is sqrt(p² + m²), where m is 105.7 MeV.

So equation (1a) becomes:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

This looks like an equation we can solve for p.

Let me denote m_mu = 105.7, M =139.6.

So set x = p.

Then equation becomes: sqrt(x² + m^2) + x = M.

Let me rearrange:

sqrt(x² + m^2) = M - x

Now, square both sides:

x² + m^2 = (M - x)^2
x² + m² = M² - 2 M x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

m² = M² - 2 M x

Rearranged:

2 M x = M² - m²
x = (M² - m²) / (2 M)

Plugging in the numbers:

M is 139.6, m is 105.7.

Calculate M squared: 139.6² → let's compute that.

139.6 * 139.6 → 139^2 is 19321, but let me compute accurately.

139.6 * 139.6: Let me compute 140^2 = 19600. 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140.

So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Wait, but 139.6 is actually 139.6, not 140-0.4. Wait, 140 = 139.6 +0.4, so 139.6 is 140 minus 0.4. So yeah, it's correct.

So M² is (139.6)^2 = let's compute it directly:

Compute 139.6 * 139.6:
= (140 - 0.4) × (140 - 0.4)
= 140² - 2×140×0.4 + 0.4²
= 19600 - 112 + 0.16
= 19600 - 112 is 19488. Then adding 0.16 gives 19488.16.

Similarly, m_mu² is (105.7)^2.

Let me compute 105^2 = 11025; 0.7^2 = 0.49, and 2*105*0.7 = 147.

So (105 +0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 → 11172.49.

So, M² = 19488.16, m²=11172.49.

So M² - m² is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Then, x = (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6)

Compute denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So x ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that division.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2 ≈ Let's see, 279.2 × 30 is 8376. That's more than 8315.67.

So 279.2 ×29= ?

279.2 *29 = 279.2*(30-1) = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

But wait, 279.2 *29 is 8096.8, which is less than 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

So 29 + (218.87 /279.2) ≈ 29 + 0.782 → about 29.782.

Wait, but wait, 279.2 * 29.78 → let me compute 279.2 *29 = 8096.8, 279.2 *0.78 ≈ 279.2 *0.7=195.44, 279.2 *0.08=22.336 → together 217.776. So 8096.8 + 217.776 = 8314.576. Which is very close to 8315.67.

So x ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, x is p, the magnitude of momentum. So E_nu is x, which is approximately 29.78 MeV.

Then E_mu is sqrt( x² + m_mu² ) → sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.78²: 29.78^2 = (30 - 0.22)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.22 + 0.22^2 = 900 - 13.2 + 0.0484 ≈ 886.848.

105.7^2 is 11172.49 (from earlier).

So sqrt(886.848 +11172.49) = sqrt(12059.338) → sqrt(12059.338) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the sum is 886.848 +11172.49 = 12059.338, right. What's the square root of that?

Well, 109^2 = 11881, 110^2=12100.

109.81^2 → let me compute:

109.81^2 = (110 - 0.19)^2 = 110² - 2*110*0.19 + 0.19² = 12100 - 41.8 + 0.0361 ≈ 12058.2361. But our target is 12059.338, so it's a bit higher.

So maybe around 109.83.

But perhaps for precise calculation, but maybe we can approximate E_mu as about 109.8 MeV.

Wait, but another approach: from equation (1a), E_mu + x =139.6. So, since E_mu is sqrt(x^2 + m^2), and we found x ≈29.78, then E_mu is 139.6 - x ≈139.6 -29.78=109.82 MeV. Which matches the calculation above.

So, E_mu is approximately 109.82 MeV, and E_nu is approximately 29.78 MeV.

But wait, the question asks for the kinetic energy of the particles. Kinetic energy is total energy minus rest mass energy.

So for the muon, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu.

E_mu is 109.82 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV. So KE_mu = 109.82 -105.7 =4.12 MeV.

For the neutrino, since it's massless, its total energy is all kinetic. So KE_nu = E_nu =29.78 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That's very close.

Option A: 2.84, 26.8 → no.

Option B:7.2, 32.8 → no.

Option C:3.52, 20.8 → no.

So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay process **π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν**, we apply conservation of energy and momentum. The pion is initially at rest, so its total energy is its rest mass energy, **139.6 MeV**. The muon and neutrino share this energy, with the neutrino being massless and its energy equal to its momentum.

### Key Equations:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}
   \]
2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the pion is stationary, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal:  
   \[
   |p_{\mu}| = |p_{\nu}| = p
   \]
3. **Energy of the Muon**:  
   The muon's energy is given by:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}
   \]
   where \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\).
4. **Energy of the Neutrino**:  
   Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p
   \]

### Solving for Momentum \(p\):
Substituting \(E_{\nu} = p\) and \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}\) into the energy conservation equation:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = 139.6
\]
Rearranging and squaring both sides:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = 139.6 - p
\]
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (139.6 - p)^2
\]
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2
\]
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p
\]
\[
2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 139.6^2 - m_{\mu}^2
\]
\[
p = \frac{139.6^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}
\]
Substituting \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):  
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49, \quad 139.6^2 = 19488.16
\]
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
\]

### Calculating Energies:
1. **Energy of the Neutrino**:  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
   \]
2. **Energy of the Muon**:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = 139.6 - p = 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

### Kinetic Energies:
1. **Kinetic Energy of the Muon**:  
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}
   \]
2. **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino**:  
   \[
   KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately **4.12 MeV** and **29.8 MeV**, respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: D**
