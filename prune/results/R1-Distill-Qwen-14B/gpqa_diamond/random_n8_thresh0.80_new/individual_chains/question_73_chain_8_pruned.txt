Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. The classic addition of velocities doesn't work because of the speed limit c. Instead, we use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but wait, I need to get the signs right. Since both are moving in the positive x-direction, the relative speed might be the difference between their two speeds divided by that factor.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. If one object is moving at velocity u and another at velocity v in the same direction, from the perspective of the first, the second is moving at (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). But wait, is that correct? Or is it the other way around? Because if I'm moving at u and you're moving at v, then your speed relative to me is (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²). Or maybe I should think in terms of the frame of reference.

Let me clarify. Suppose astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. From A's perspective, what's B's speed? So, A sees B moving at (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²), where u is A's speed and v is B's speed. Because from A's frame, the speed of B would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c)(0.6c)/c²). That would be (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3c²/c²) → (-0.1c)/(0.7) → approximately -0.1428c. Wait, but relative speed is a magnitude, so it's 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c for v_rel.

Now, moving on to the total energy. The total energy of a relativistic object is given by gamma multiplied by m c squared. But wait, the problem mentions the total energy of the system. So each astronaut has their own energy, and I need to sum them up.

So the first astronaut (mass 2m) has energy gamma1 * 2m c². The second (mass 3m) has gamma2 * 3m c². Let's compute each gamma.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for the first astronaut moving at 0.6c: v1 = 0.6c → v1²/c² = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma1 is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Second astronaut at 0.5c: v2 = 0.5c → v2²/c² = 0.25. 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. So gamma2 is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So the energies are:

E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 m c². So the energy would be about 5.96 mc².

So the relative speed is 0.14c and energy is about 5.96 mc². That matches option C.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Gamma1: 0.6c → gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) → 1/sqrt(0.64)=1/0.8=1.25. Correct.

Gamma2: 0.5c → sqrt(1 - 0.25
