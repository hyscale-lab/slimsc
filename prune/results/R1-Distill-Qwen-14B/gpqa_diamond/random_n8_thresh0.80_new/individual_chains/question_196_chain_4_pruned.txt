Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So it's a harmonic oscillator, but relativistic, which probably means we need to consider effects from special relativity, like how mass increases with speed or something like that.

Wait, the problem is asking for the maximum speed, v_max. In a regular, non-relativistic harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, in that case, you'd set (1/2)kA² (potential energy) equal to (1/2)mv_max² (kinetic energy), right? That gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Looking at the options, option C is that expression. But wait, the question is relativistic, so probably not the right answer.

In relativistic mechanics, things get more complicated because mass increases with velocity. The relativistic mass is gamma times the rest mass, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So when the object is moving at speed v, its mass is mγ. But wait, energy considerations also change. The total energy isn't just kinetic plus potential as in the non-relativistic case. Instead, the total energy includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy, and the potential energy.

Hmm, the system is a harmonic oscillator, so the potential is (1/2)kx². The total mechanical energy in the relativistic case would be the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy.

Wait, but wait. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², which is a form of potential that's a function of position. So, when the mass is at position x = A (the amplitude), the potential energy is maximum, and the kinetic energy is zero. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the kinetic energy is maximum.

But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv², it's (γ-1)mc². So the total energy (which is conserved) is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the potential is treated the same way in relativistic mechanics. Oh wait, the problem states that it's obeying Hooke's law, so it's a classical harmonic oscillator, but in a relativistic framework, so we might need to consider relativistic expressions for momentum and energy.

So, the setup is that the oscillator is moving such that its maximum displacement is A. At that point, all the energy would be potential, but in reality, because the mass is relativistic, the energy expressions are different.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this using energy conservation. The total energy of the oscillator at any point is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy.

At the maximum displacement, x = A, the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy is (1/2)kA².

But wait, in the relativistic case, when the oscillator is at rest at x=A, the total energy would be the potential energy plus the rest mass energy. Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is just (1/2)kA². But relativistically, when the mass is at rest (x=A), the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².

But wait, that can't be right because in the non-relativistic limit, when kA² is small compared to mc², then E_total would be approximately (1/2)kA², which is correct. Hmm, maybe.

Wait, but when the mass is moving, its kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc². So the total energy when the mass is at x=0 (maximum speed) would be the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy, which is zero because x=0. So E_total = (γ -1) mc².

But wait, in that case, the total energy at x=A and x=0 should be the same. So, setting them equal:

At x=A: E = (1/2)k A² + mc².

At x=0: E = (γ -1) mc².

So setting them equal:

(1/2)k A² + mc² = (γ -1) mc².

Wait, that doesn't look right. Because (γ -1) mc² is the kinetic energy, and the potential at x=0 is zero, so the total energy would be just the kinetic energy. But the potential at x=A is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic is zero, so the total energy is (1/2)kA² + mc²? That can't be correct because in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is just (1/2)kA², but here E is higher because we're including mc².

Wait, perhaps I'm getting something wrong. Let me think again.

In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is the sum of the maximum potential and zero kinetic. So perhaps in the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the mechanical energy. Wait, that makes sense. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, but when the mass is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, so E_total = (γ -1) mc² + 0. But E_total should be the same as when it's at x=A, so:

(γ -1) mc² = mc² + (1/
