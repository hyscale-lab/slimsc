Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a specific nucleus moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativistic mechanics, but let's try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the question says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. Oh right, lithium-6 maybe? Because Li usually has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. So the mass number A is 6 (3 protons + 3 neutrons).

So the nucleus in question is a lithium-6 nucleus. I need to find the energy at which it's moving such that its speed is 0.96c. Wait, but wait—relativistic energy usually refers to the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Or is the question asking for kinetic energy specifically? The problem says "energy of the RHIC", which I think refers to the total energy. But sometimes in these problems, they might be asking for the kinetic energy. Hmm, I'll have to keep that in mind.

Wait, the problem states: "what is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I think they're asking for the total energy, because the speed is given, and we're calculating the necessary energy to reach that speed.

So the formula for total energy in relativity is E = gamma * m0 c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh right, so I can calculate gamma first.

Given v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Then sqrt(0.0784) is what? Let me calculate that. 0.0784 is 784e-4, whose square root is 28e-2, because 28^2 is 784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, but wait, let me be precise.

Wait, 0.0
