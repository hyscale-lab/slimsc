Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is an electron's state. It's given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So I know that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. That usually means they're the standard basis states for spin-½ particles, like |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

The first task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij is ħ/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. So let me think about what this matrix looks like.

Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because we're dealing with spin up and down), the operator A would have zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 on the off-diagonal. So the matrix would be:
[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says Aij is ħ/2 if i ≠ j. So for a 2x2 system, the diagonal (i=j) entries are 0, and the off-diagonal (i≠j) are ħ/2. So that's correct.

Hmm, but wait, what kind of operator has such a matrix? Oh wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices often have structures like this. Let me think: The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So if I multiply that by ħ/2, I get [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], which matches A. So operator A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix.

The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are the eigenstates for the spin-x operator. Those eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because the Pauli X operator represents the spin in the x-direction, and its eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states along x.

So the eigenstates are |x+⟩ = (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/√2 and |x−⟩ = (|↑⟩ − |↓⟩)/√2. The problem is asking for the probability of the particle being in each of these eigenstates when we measure the operator A. Oh wait, and also find the average value of A.

But wait, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I need to normalize this state, because it's only proportional. Then express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A (which are |x+⟩ and |x−⟩) to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express |alpha> in terms of the standard basis, then find the expansion coefficients in the operator A's eigenbasis, then square the magnitudes for probabilities.

Wait, but perhaps another approach is better. Let me think: The operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x,
