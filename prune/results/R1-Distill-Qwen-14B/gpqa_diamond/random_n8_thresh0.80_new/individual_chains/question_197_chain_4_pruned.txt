Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining what the product is after it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A, B, C, D, each a different organic compound.

First, I'll start by looking at the spectral data given for compound X. The IR and NMR data should help me figure out the structure of X, and then I can think about the reaction.

Starting with the IR data: the peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region usually indicative of O-H stretching. But wait, that's a pretty broad range. Maybe it's an aliphatic or aromatic O-H? Then, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which I know corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So that suggests the compound has a benzene ring with substituents, possibly a carbonyl group, and maybe an OH group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:

The peaks are:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)

Let me break this down. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's a strong indication of an -OH proton. But wait, sometimes O-H can be in the 1-5 ppm range if it's deuterated, but 10.5 is more typical for an aldehyde proton. Oh, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe it's an aldehyde? But the IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which is lower than a typical aldehyde (which is around 1720 maybe?), but wait, aldehydes can be around 1720 too. Alternatively, it could be a ketone or an ester. Hmm.

Wait, but the NMR at 10.5 is a broad singlet. If it's an aldehyde, that would make sense. But wait, if it's an -OH, like a phenol, that would be a broad peak, but phenols are usually upfield, around 5 ppm or so, but I'm not certain. Wait, sometimes in D2O exchange, the phenolic O-H can be broad, but if the sample isn't exchanged, maybe it's a different kind of -OH. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde.

Looking at the aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because the two doublets each have 2H, which is typical of a para-substituted aromatic (like p-xylene or nitrobenzene etc.). So the substituent is in the para position, and the coupling between the two sets of protons would lead to doublets.

So, the aromatic protons are in a para-substituted benzene. Now, what substituent would give a carbonyl in the IR? Maybe a substituent with a carbonyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl. So perhaps the substituent is an acyl group, like a ketone, ester, or acid.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak could be an aldehyde. Aldehydes have protons around 9-10 ppm. So if the substit
