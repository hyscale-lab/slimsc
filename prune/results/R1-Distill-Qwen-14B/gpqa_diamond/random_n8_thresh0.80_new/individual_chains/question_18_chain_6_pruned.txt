Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and figuring out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, I'm not sure if the masses matter here because the question is about elemental abundances, which I think depends more on their compositions than their masses. So maybe the masses are just extra info.

The elemental abundances given are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex for Star_1, and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star_2. Also, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, right, the brackets denote logarithmic abundances relative to hydrogen or another element.

The photospheric composition for the Sun is provided: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. Wait, so for the Sun, the ratio of Fe to H is calculated from that equation.

Let me start by understanding what each notation means. The notation [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Or wait, no, actually, I think [X/Y] is defined as log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y, relative to solar.

But wait, no, the correct definition is [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. That makes it easier to compare with the Sun's values.

So first, let's figure out the solar values for Fe, Mg, and Si. Because the question provides the Sun's photospheric composition, I can use that.

For the Sun:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=10^-5 =1e-5.

But wait, the question is about silicon. I don't have the solar [Si/H] value. Oh, right, because the Sun's [Si/H] isn't given. Hmm, so I need to find a way to relate Si to Fe and Mg.

Looking at Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is higher than solar by a factor of 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So [Si/Fe] = log(Si/Fe) - log(Si/Fe)_sun =
