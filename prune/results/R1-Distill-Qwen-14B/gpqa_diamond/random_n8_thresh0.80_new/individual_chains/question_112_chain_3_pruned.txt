Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's take it step by step.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So the spin-z operator has eigenvalues +ħ/2 for |up> and -ħ/2 for |down>, right?

Wait, but the question isn't directly about measuring spin-z. The main task is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Oh wait, that's a 2x2 matrix since it's for a spin-½ particle.

Wait, let me think about this matrix. For a 2x2 case, the matrix would look like:

[0   ħ/2]
[ħ/2 0 ]

Because the diagonal elements are 0 (since i=j) and off-diagonal are ħ/2. Oh wait no, wait, the matrix is defined as A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. So the diagonal elements (when i=j) are zero. So the matrix is:

[ 0     ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0  ]

Hmm, wait. So what kind of operator is this? It's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. I remember that the Pauli matrices have similar structures. Let me recall: the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], Z is diagonal. Oh, so this matrix A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X has 1s off-diagonal, and 0s on diagonal. So A = (ħ/2) * σ_x.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are 2x2, right? So the operator in question is proportional to σ_x. So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of σ_x. Because if you have an operator proportional to σ_x, their eigenstates are the same as σ_x's.

I should find the eigenstates of A. Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenstates are the same as σ_x's, and the eigenvalues would be scaled by (ħ/2). Because if σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, then A would have eigenvalues (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1). So the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2.

But the question is more about finding the probabilities when measuring in the basis of this operator's eigenstates. So the state |alpha> is expressed in the spin-z basis, but I need to express it in the eigenbasis of A, which is the σ_x eigenbasis.

Wait, let me think again. The operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x, so its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, the eigenstates of σ_x. Because σ_x |+x> = |+x> and similarly for |-x>.

So the state |alpha> is given in the |up> and |down> basis. I need to express |alpha> in the |+x> and |-x> basis to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate.

Alternatively, I can find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>. The probabilities will be the square of the amplitudes for each of these components.

But first, let me write down |alpha>. The problem says it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So I should probably normalize it first.

Wait, the state is given as proportional, so I need to compute the normalization factor. Let me compute the norm.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

Calculating each term:

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1 =
