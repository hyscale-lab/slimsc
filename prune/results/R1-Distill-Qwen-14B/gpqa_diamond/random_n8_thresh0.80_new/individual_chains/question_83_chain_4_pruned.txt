Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

Hmm. Alright, let's break this down. First, I think I should figure out the concentrations after dilution. Then, for the titration, I'll need to find out how much NaOH is added at 25% and at equivalence, and then calculate the pH at those points.

Wait, the first step is diluting the acetic acid. So, I have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When you dilute it with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right? Dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2.

So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. So M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that. 0.05 times 20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid (a weak acid) in a 1:1 mole ratio. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion. But since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, the solution will be basic. So the pH at equivalence will be above 7.

But first, I need to find the volume of NaOH at equivalence. Let's compute that.

The moles of acetic acid initially: M = mol/L, so moles = concentration * volume (in liters). The diluted solution is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So moles of CH3COOH = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is same as moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. Volume of NaOH = moles / conc = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume, which is 10 cm³. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but I'm not sure if '25% titration' refers to 25% of the equivalence volume or 25% of the acid has been neutralized. Oh, in titration terms, usually it's the percentage of the volume added relative to the equivalence volume. So 25% would mean 2.5 cm³.

So now, let's tackle each part: pH at 25% titration and pH at equivalence.

First, pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The amount of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³, which is 0.0025 L. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Since the reaction is 1:1, this means
