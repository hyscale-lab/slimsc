Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I need to figure out how many possible products are formed when this compound reacts with Grubbs catalyst, excluding ethene. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually rhodium or ruthenium-based, that facilitates this process by breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, what's the structure of that? Let me draw it out. Pent-1-ene has a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the first carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH(CH₃)₂? Wait, no, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-? Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3. But 3-methyl would mean a methyl branch on the third carbon. So, the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I'm counting wrong.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So 3-methyl means a methyl group on the third carbon. So the third carbon is the one attached to the double bond. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, no, wait the formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene is actually CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of numbering. Let me write it properly.

The formula for pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But 3-methyl would add a methyl group on carbon 3. So carbon 1: CH₂-, carbon 2: CH-, carbon 3: CH(CH3)-, carbon 4: CH₂-, carbon 5: CH3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent
