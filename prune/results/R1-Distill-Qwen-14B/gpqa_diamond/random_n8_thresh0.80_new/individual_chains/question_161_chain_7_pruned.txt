Okay, let's try to figure out this question step by step. So, the scenario is about a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and the mean free path of gas molecules in the sample compartment. Hmm, I remember that the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. 

So, Mike created an ultra-high vacuum with a pressure less than 10^-9 Torr. He used vacuum pumps, so the pressure is really low. At this pressure, he measured the mean free path as λ1. But when he turned on the electron beam, the mean free path changed to λ2. The question is asking what we can conclude about λ2 relative to λ1.

Wait, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? Oh, maybe the electron beam is interacting with the gas molecules somehow. I remember that when electrons pass through a medium, they can cause various effects. In a TEM, the electrons are focused into a very narrow beam, which might have a significant impact on the gas molecules in the vacuum.

One thing that comes to mind is that the gas molecules might be getting charged by the electron beam. If the gas particles become charged, they might start to experience forces that cause them to move differently. For example, charged particles in an electric field (like from the electron beam) could accelerate, or maybe they stick to the walls of the sample compartment due to the electric charge. 

If the gas molecules are charged, they might not just be bouncing around randomly as they did before. Instead, they could be more likely to stick to the walls or other surfaces. That would effectively reduce the number of gas particles in the compartment because they're getting removed—adsorbed onto the surfaces. 

Wait, but wait. The mean free path is inversely proportional to the pressure. Wait, no, mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(n * π * d^2), where n is the number density and d is the average collision diameter. But if the number of gas molecules decreases because some are being removed, then n decreases, so λ would increase. Because if n is lower, the same volume has fewer particles, so the molecules would travel longer before hitting something.

But wait, in the scenario before the electron beam is on, the pressure is already super low. So some gas molecules remain, but after turning on the beam, perhaps some are ionized or otherwise affected, and thus either removed or their behavior changes.

Alternatively, another angle: the electron beam could cause the gas to be ionized. Ions have different behavior. For example, in a vacuum, if the gas is partially ionized, the mean free path could change because the ionized particles might interact differently with the electrons.

Wait, but the question says that the mean free path changed due to electron scattering. So when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are causing more scattering events. Or perhaps the scattering is causing the electrons to lose energy, but how does that affect the gas's mean free path?

Hmm, maybe the electron beam causes gas molecules to be excited or ionized, leading to a different effective pressure because some of the gas is now in a different state. Alternatively, maybe the gas molecules are being bombarded by electrons, which could cause them to move more, leading to more collisions, thus a shorter mean free path. Or perhaps the opposite happens.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, the energy deposited in the sample could heat the
